<p>Clause 4:</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I move the amendments printed in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 39, after &#x201C;Act&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and that he in fact possesses the arm to which such licence relates&#x201D;; in line 8, page 8, after &#x201C;(1)&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or has failed in terms of subsection (2) to satisfy the Commissioner that he in fact possesses an arm to which a licence relates&#x201D;; and in line 13, after &#x201C;ammunition&#x201D; to add &#x201C;or for any offence relating to the loss or theft or destruction of such arm&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Clause 4 appears in Part I of the Bill which deals with the matter of licences to possess arms. Clause 4 itself deals with the provisions relating to applications for licences to possess firearms, and subsection (2), with which the first of my proposed amendments deals, makes provision for the production to the Commissioner of licences by persons who are already in possession of firearms. Sir, since this is intended to be a clean-up, as it were, of the present position relating to the possession of firearms and the licensing of firearms so that from now on a proper register can be kept, we consider that it is essential that not only existing licences should be produced but also the firearm to which the licence relates, so that the persons who are responsible for compiling the register will be able to know that these firearms which are licensed at the present time are in the possession of the persons concerned.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>I made it clear in the Second-Reading debate that we had considered this matter, but because we felt that it would place additional burdens on the public as far as producing firearms was concerned, we came to the conclusion that provision for this need not be made in the Bill. However, in view of the discussions which have taken place here and also because I agree that it will make for a better register, I am prepared to accept these amendments.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 32, to omit &#x201C;or&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;nor&#x201D;.</block>

<p>At the moment the clause reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) Any white person not being under the age of 16 years or a disqualified person may, with the prior consent of the holder of a licence to possess an arm and for such period as such holder may permit, have such arm in his possession &#x2026;</block>

<p>As it is phrased here, it seems to me that it postulates two classes of persons who may possess firearms. In other words, any white person who is not under the age of 16 years may possess firearms, or a person who is disqualified may possess firearms, whereas in fact what is intended in this clause is that a person who is neither a disqualified person nor under the age of 16 years should be able to possess a firearm. In other words, there are two conditions that he must fulfil in order to be able to possess an arm; firstly, he must not be under the age of 16 and secondly he must not be a disqualified person.</p>

<p>Sir, since I put this amendment on the Order Paper it has occurred to me that the correct English here should be &#x201C;any white person being neither a person under the age of 16 years nor a disqualified person &#x2026;&#x201D; It seems to me that that would be the correct way of expressing it, and perhaps my amendment, which makes the wording better than it is now, could be further improved upon by omitting the word &#x201C;not&#x201D; and by inserting after &#x201C;being&#x201D; the word &#x201C;neither&#x201D; and then retaining the amendment to omit &#x201C;or&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;nor&#x201D;, so that it will read: &#x201C;Any white person being neither under the age of 16 years nor a disqualified person.&#x201D; As it stands at the moment, it is subject to the interpretation which I have mentioned and I hope the hon. the Minister will either accept the amendment or indicate that in the Other Place he will move an amendment to incorporate the word &#x201C;neither&#x201D; and to substitute the word &#x201C;nor&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_police">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think I can accept this amendment. In the Second Reading debate I was inclined to agree that the knowledge of the hon. member for Durban (North) of English would probably be better than mine, but in the present circumstances I am not so sure any more. I have looked at this clause again and, as I see it, it is intended that any one of those two factors would be a disqualification. If you want to introduce the word &#x201C;nor&#x201D;, then, as I see it, you should also introduce the word &#x201C;neither&#x201D;, and then say &#x201C;neither a white person not being under the age of 16 years nor a disqualified person &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then you must bring in the word &#x201C;neither&#x201D; at the beginning of the sentence. But without the word &#x201C;neither&#x201D; at the beginning of the sentence, the word &#x201C;or&#x201D; is perfectly correct. I have taken the trouble to consult Fowler’s Modern English Usage and I would like to refer the hon. member to the Second Edition, page 394. Perhaps the hon. member will take the trouble to consult it. I have come to the conclusion that the use of &#x201C;nor&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;or&#x201D; in this particular case would apparently, according to Fowler’s Modern English Usage, amount to thrusting the word &#x201C;nor&#x201D; in where there is no room for it. That is my contention. But I am prepared to look into the matter again and we can have a discussion privately, and if the hon. member can convince me I will change it in the Other Place.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am indebted to the hon. the Minister for going to so much trouble to find out exactly what this should be. Of course he is quite right that you have a &#x201C;nor&#x201D; where you have a &#x201C;neither&#x201D;, but then one was dealing here with a translation of clause 8, in which perhaps it was not properly put. But the Minister agrees with me that in fact it should be &#x201C;neither, nor&#x201D;, and I agree with him, as I indicated when I spoke, that this is the way it really should read. Therefore, with the leave of the Committee, I should like to withdraw the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>Clause 11:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>I move the following amendment, as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subsection (1) and to substitute the following subsection:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) If the Commissioner is of the opinion that on the ground of information given under oath, there is reason to believe that any person is a person&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) whose possession of any arm constitutes a danger to the peace or to such person himself or any other person; or</li>

<li>(b) who has discharged an arm at or in the direction of himself or any other person or has threatened or expressed the intention to kill or injure himself or any other person by means of an arm; or</li>

<li>(c) who has by means of an arm killed or injured any other person through negligence or wantonly or through negligence endangered the life or limb of any other person; or</li>

<li>(d) who while in lawful possession of an arm, has lost such arm through gross negligence,</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>he may, by notice in writing delivered or tendered to such person by a policeman, call upon such person to appear before the Commissioner at such time and place as may be specified in the notice, in order to advance reasons why such person shall not be declared unfit to possess any arm on any ground aforesaid so specified;</p>

<p>and to add the following subsections at the end of the Clause:</p>

<ol>

<li>(3) Any person appearing in pursuance of a notice issued under subsection (1) shall be entitled to be represented by counsel or an attorney.</li>

<li>(4) Upon proof that the notice was duly delivered or tendered to the person to whom it was addressed, the Commissioner may at any time subsequent to the time specified in the notice, whether or not such person complies with the notice, but subject to the provisions of subsection (5), declare such person to be unfit to possess any arm at any time or during a specified period of not less than three years, if, having regard to any reasons advanced by or on behalf of the said person and to any information at the disposal of the Commissioner given under oath, the Commissioner is satisfied that such person is a person contemplated in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of subsection (1).</li>

<li>(5) The Commissioner shall not, without the approval of the Minister, declare any person to be unfit to possess any arm on the ground referred to in section (1) (d).</li>

<li>(6) The Commissioner shall by notice in writing sent by post or delivered to him inform any person in respect of whom a declaration has been made under subsection (4), of the tenor of and reason for the declaration.</li>

</ol>

<p>I think now that this amendment has been moved, the hon. member for Transkei, who has another amendment on the Order Paper, will probably be satisfied and will not want to proceed with his amendment. I should like him to tell me what his views on the matter are.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>We would prefer the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as it provides for a hearing before a magistrate who is obviously better trained in hearing evidence and deciding matters than the Commissioner or one of his officers who may be delegated to take the hearing of a particular application. I understand that the Minister is not prepared to accept our amendment. He made it quite clear in his Second Reading speech that he wished to keep control solely in the Police Department. However, in view of the fact that he has acceded to our request that the maxim <i>audi alteram partem</i> should be adhered to and that the person affected should be given a chance of stating his case and producing whatever evidence he has before the Commissioner, we are prepared to accept it. I therefore withdraw my amendments, although I would have preferred it to be done by a magistrate. However, there is still one thing about which I am not quite clear. Is there provision for the Commissioner to delegate &#x2026;</p>

<p>New clause (to follow clause 42):</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the following be a new clause to follow clause 42:</block>

<p>43. The Minister may&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) establish at such centres and at such places as he may deem fit,</li>

<li>(b) by notice in writing authorize licensed dealers or any institutions which he deems suitable for the purpose, to establish,</li>

</ol>

<p>repositories where any person may deposit arms and ammunition on such conditions as the Minister may by regulation determine.</p>

<p>I move this formally, but I wish to indicate that since I placed this amendment on the Order Paper it has been pointed out to me and has been made very clear that in fact the hon. the Minister could set up repositories without having any enabling power in terms of the Act. In terms of this Bill it has also been made clear that any private person can establish a repository for arms. It has been made clear that you may leave your firearm with someone else who will store it for you, but he does not need any licence in order to store the fire-arm. In other words, his possession of the fire-arm while he is storing it, does not require the licence referred to in clauses 2, 35 and the other clauses. Now, Sir, I do not think that this is generally known to the public. I think it is most important that people should, when they go away on holiday, deposit their arms in some safe place. They have always felt that the place to go to was the police station. When they go to the police station, the police refuse to accept those arms. This is the point. This is the public’s natural reaction, &#x201C;I do not want to leave my fire-arm at home. If someone breaks in, it will be stolen&#x201D;. So they go to the police station. People generally go to the police station when they are in trouble or when they have a problem. But the police do not want to accept it. It is no good my saying that, in fact, this is unnecessary. They can leave their fire-arms at the bank, with a friend of theirs who has a safe, or anywhere. They can store them at some other place without the person who stores them needing a licence. I think the hon. the Minister will do the public a great service if he now confirms that this is the position and indicates that they may, in <span class="col_5911-5912" refersTo="page_0103"/>fact, store their arms with other people. This will be an authoritative statement upon which the public would act and, I believe, one in the public interest.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I gladly do what the hon. member has asked me to do, namely to confirm what he said, i.e. that it is laid down in section 45 (2) (b) (ii) and section 45 (2) (c) that the provisions of the Act will not apply to a person to whom arms and ammunition are entrusted for the purpose of, <i>inter alia,</i> storage. In other words, provision has been made in the Act for a person to store an arm with another person for the purposes which the hon. member explained to us. I also want to give the undertaking that wherever it appears to be necessary we shall make this public in the administration of this Act relating to arms.

<p>Mr. Chairman, with regard to clause 11, as we accepted the amendment moved by the Minister, I asked him what power of delegation there was. He referred me to clause 44. I see that the Commissioner, with the approval of the Minister, may delegate to any person in the full-time service of the State any power conferred on him by this Bill. Apparently the Minister will be the one who is going to decide what powers can be delegated. I ask the Minister, in delegating any powers in terms of this clause, to bear in mind that the person to whom the authority is delegated, should at least have the rank of captain in the service.</p>

<heading>PUBLICATIONS AND ENTERTAINMENTS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>When the House approved of the Second Reading of this Bill, it adopted the principle of prohibiting future publications&#x2014;in other words, censorship of the unknown and the unseen, as far as the Publications Board is concerned. We, on this side of the House, remain opposed to this clause and would like to see it deleted. The Minister and speakers on his side have indicated that they hold a view contrary to ours and, may I say, also contrary to the opinion of a vast percentage of people outside. Furthermore, the Government has the power to proceed with this legislation. Consequently, as realists in the situation in which we find ourselves now, I want to appeal to the Minister to consider amending this clause to ensure at least that before this drastic action is taken, there are indications of wilfulness on the part of the publisher concerned and that there are indications of a specific course of conduct on his part, indications which would justify the drastic action which the board can take in terms of this legislation. Furthermore, we think it is essential that the Publications Board should arrive at a conclusion that the conduct of the publisher against which objection is taken, is likely to continue in future and that such a conclusion can be justified by what has gone before.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rissik, who is not in the House at the moment, suggested that we oppose this legislation because of what he termed a &#x201C;British liberal outlook&#x201D; as far as censorship was concerned. His arguments, of course, correspond to a certain extent with those uttered by the hon. member for Ermelo and are equally without foundation as are the arguments of the hon. member for Ermelo. Perhaps the hon. member for Rissik can at a <span class="col_5913-5914" refersTo="page_0104"/>future date elaborate on this approach of his. In actual fact, we on this side of the House agree that certain action must be taken by legislation to prevent the publication of blatant pornography. To that end power should be vested in some body or other. This clause has reference not only to such category of undesirable publications but also to a vastly wider field of publication, as one can see from section 5 of the principal Act. If this clause is adopted in its present form it may, for instance, be possible for the Publications Board to come to a conclusion that certain publications may be bringing certain elements of our population into ridicule. As a matter of fact, we have had instances of this on the political front already. But I do not think it is intended that these wide powers should be given &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy-chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY-CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member should come back to the clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Chairman. But I am dealing with the justification for this clause as it reads now. The Minister has indicated that there are difficulties in dealing with this matter by way of prosecution, but this clause already provides that there should have been one successful prosecution. I would like to suggest to the Minister, without departing from the principle contained in the clause, that that is putting things too wide, i.e. that there should only be one conviction to justify a conclusion by the board that future publications are likely to be undesirable. It is for this reason that I should like to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">in line 9, to omit &#x201C;edition&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;two editions&#x201D;; in line 11, to omit &#x201C;has&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;have&#x201D;; and in line 14, to omit &#x201C;is&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;are&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In other words, there should be conviction for two undesirable publications before this clause becomes operative. There should, therefore, have been at least two undesirable publications before the board can exercise these very wide powers. This. I think, is a very reasonable safeguard and does not limit the principle of this clause; it only makes it a little more realistic.</p>

<p>I listened with interest to the way in which the hon. member for Green Point motivated his amendment. I do not want to speak for the Minister, but I simply cannot imagine our accepting such a watered-down principle. It seems to me the Opposition is adopting the attitude that we are dealing here with a Publications Board that consists of a lot of unreasonable people, people who are obsessed by a persecution mania and who only want to see how many of these publications they can ban. Surely we cannot say that this Publications Board will use a single pornographic sentence or a few pornographic sentences in a publication to ban all future editions of that publication.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>They have the power, yes, but, surely we can rely on the sense of reasonableness of the members of this Board. Surely there is no need for us to prescribe to them that, for example, there must be ten lines of a pornographic nature before they may ban the publication. The hon. member for Green Point now wants us to give such a publisher the opportunity of first issuing two pornographic or obscene publications before we take steps against him. Surely a line must be drawn somewhere. I do not regard it as our function to protect the interests of these people who want to publish undesirable literature. After all, the whole spirit of this clause does not constitute censorship in its most blatant form. One may much rather regard this as being proper control over these publications for the protection of the general public.</p>

<p>In a previous speech the hon. member for Bezuidenhout expressed his misgivings about the norms applied by the members of the Publications Control Board in judging certain matters. I concede that the hon. member may differ with them as regards these norms, just as any one of us may differ with the next person as regards moral codes. After all, we cannot all agree on everything. But where will one find a board or a body which can make a decision which will serve and satisfy everybody? Moreover, this clause does not apply to the members of the Press Union, who are responsible for the vast majority of publications in the Republic. They are excluded. Decent publications falling outside the framework of the Press Union are also excluded. This legislation is being introduced merely to be able to take action against people who are continually publishing indecent literature.</p>

<p>I want to repeat that it is not our task as legislators to protect the interests of people who publish indecent literature. The Minister indicated quite clearly in his reply that the penalties laid down in the old Act did not have the desired effect. The purpose of the control we should like to have, is to prevent these publications from coming into the hands of the general public. This purpose was defeated by the old Act. Under these circumstances I really cannot see how we can deviate from the clause as contained in the proposed legislation and how it can in any way be watered down justifiably.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Tygervallei misses the point which we on this side of the House are endeavouring to make. Here is the drastic power contained in this clause, as it has now been approved, to prohibit a man or a company from carrying on normal business not because of something that has happened or which is there to be judged for the future, but because the Board of Censors believes that such a course of conduct is likely to be adopted by <span class="col_5915-5916" refersTo="page_0105"/>the particular person or organization. This is a drastic conclusion. With the best will in the world on the part of anybody in this House who feels that pornographic literature should be stopped. I can see no justification for that prohibition being permissible on one occurrence, be it a conviction or one publication which has been deemed to be undesirable by the Censor Board. After all, who sets the norm as to what is undesirable? The board itself sitting in secret session sets a norm under all the tests of section 5 (2) as to what it deems to be undesirable. I believe that that is a power which goes too far and should be restricted at least so that it takes effect after there have been two convictions or two decisions taken by the board that undesirable publications have appeared from the Press of that particular publisher.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree with the hon. member for Tygervallei. Unfortunately I cannot accept this amendment. As I made clear yesterday, the reason for my refusal is that we must prevent this undesirable literature from being distributed among the public. The main task of the Publications Control Board is to prevent the public from getting hold of this undesirable literature. Anything one may do will be of no avail if the damage has already been done among the people. We would be watering down this clause completely if we made it impossible for us to act if we saw that a certain publication containing undesirable literature was being published and if we had reason to believe that the next edition of such a publication would contain similar undesirable literature. The hon. member for Green Point is acting on the assumption that the Publications Control Board is going to take action because it &#x201C;believes&#x201D; that the publication will contain undesirable literature. I want to put it somewhat more strongly by saying that it will take action because it has good reason to believe that. It is not merely a matter of belief in the sense that we believe in something we cannot see or cannot hear, but we act because there are sound reasons for us to believe that the literature will be of an undesirable nature. Mr. Chairman, yesterday I showed you a certain publication which I had in my possession. If one has to judge by the contents of what they describe here as the first chapter of a story, I think there is no member in this House who would not agree that publication of the remaining part of this story should not be allowed.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I repeat that we have to prevent this undesirable literature from reaching the public. I heard it said this morning that &#x201C;prevention is better than cure&#x201D;, and I think this should be our attitude in this case as well. I pointed out yesterday that I did not want the provisions in terms of which the Publications Control Board functions, to be applied like the law of the Medes and the Persians. This is a case in which a great deal of discretion had to be used, and that is why we are making provision here for discretion to be exercised. If the Publications Control Board were to decide to ban a certain edition, it would not mean that it should proceed to ban the whole series. In the same way as the Publications Control Board prohibits an edition in a series, it may also withdraw its prohibition of the publication of that series by way of a notice in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> The circumstances are fluid here, and the Publications Control Board will have to decide from time to time whether it is desirable that certain literature be made available to the public or not. In those circumstances I cannot allow this clause to be watered down in the way the hon. member for Green Point has suggested.</p>

<p>I would also like to point out to the hon. member for Kensington and to the hon. member for Green Point that we are dealing with publications which are not approved publications. Against the original decision on the first publication, they have the right of appeal which is included in this clause. They have the right of appeal under clause 14, so they have really had two bites out of the cherry already, because first of all, they can appeal against the Board’s decision to ban the publication. But, Sir, I want to put another angle as well. Surely to goodness, if this happens to be a type of publication which the Board in its wisdom considers to be unsuitable for publication in this country, is it not better then that they immediately tell the publishers and the importers that this is in fact a type of publication which is not acceptable for publication, circulation and distribution in South Africa? Surely it is a far more intelligent approach to do it that way than to let these publications come in and then to ban every second or third publication. I think this is a far more intelligent and reasonable approach, because then at least the publisher, the importer and the person who wants to place orders for a publication which is an unsuitable type of publication will know from the very beginning that that is a type of publication which is unacceptable to the Board, and that therefore they will be wasting their time if they try to import it, publish it or circulate it.</p>

How does the hon. the Minister know that a periodical, if it has committed one offence, will commit a second?

<p>Well, this is what we understood from the hon. the Minister when we asked him this question. But the point I want to make is this: The hon. the Minister said repeatedly that there could be difference of opinion on what is good and what is not good. The only way in which a publication can really become acquainted with the norm that is set by the board is when it is banned. Then a periodical realizes that it has applied a norm which meets with the disapproval of the board. But then surely it should be given an opportunity of reforming itself. Is this not fair? The board has now said that it disapproves of that kind of article. But now the Minister is not going to give that periodical a second chance at all. He is not going to give it a chance to reform itself. All our amendment is asking&#x2014;and that is why we made it &#x201C;two&#x201D;&#x2014;is that, if it is clear that it persists in its wrongful action after the first punishment, the board should then tackle it and ban its subsequent issues as well. But I <span class="col_5919-5920" refersTo="page_0107"/>really think a publication should get a chance to reform itself before all issues are banned.</p>

<p>The reaction of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout really astonishes me. As someone who used to be connected with journalism, surely he ought to know what the procedure is when periodicals or publications disseminate this kind of obscene or objectionable literature. They publish an article in one edition, or they begin by publishing an appetizer in which they say they are going to make certain disclosures about, say, homosexualism, or lesbianism, or sadism, or some form of human misdemeanour. This they announce under bold headlines, and then in the next issue they come along with the first article on that theme. Then they usually say that in the subsequent second or third issue they will make further disclosures. This is how the Minister will be enabled to determine whether in the future, after the first article or after the announcement, further undesirable literature will appear in the publication concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said very clearly here that we cannot accept this amendment, and now I want to tell the hon. member for Green Point that he is trying to catch this side of the House napping this afternoon, and that we are not going to allow that. All he is trying to do is to water down this clause. I want to tell him again why we cannot accept this. It is for this simple reason. This type of publication, the publishers of which are very shrewd and which flourishes on the exploitation of filth, can very easily, if this loophole is left, i.e. that two issues may be allowed, but not the subsequent ones, fill one issue with an article full of this filth. They will then skip one, then repeat the performance in the next issue, and so they will continue, and the Minister will simply be unable ever to pin them down. Every time the whole impression will be sold out before the Publication Board can take action, and we will be frustrated in our object. The object of this Bill is to get at the source of the evil done by these publications which shy away from being enrolled with the National Press Union, where proper control can be exercised over them. There have been many complaints here this afternoon that publishing firms will now be ruined and go bankrupt. I feel that if a publishing firm wants to flourish on the exploitation of this objectionable type of literature, it deserves to have strong action taken against it, and if it suffers losses in its attempt to make a profit out of this kind of literature, it is its own fault. So I cannot see at all why the Opposition is kicking up such a fuss over this clause, and I hope the hon. the Minister will not budge an inch.</p>

<p>The hon. member’s amendment is very reasonable, because he at least gives the publication two chances, and not just one, as the hon. the Minister wishes to do. My point is that the hon. the Minister yesterday produced a consumers’ guide in which there was an article which he thought was objectionable. This article dealt with methods of contraception. In this particular case we can possibly assume that part two, which was also coming in a forthcoming issue, would also be objectionable. It is quite likely that part one in itself could have been objectionable without the rest of the articles on this subject being objectionable, but this journal runs the risk of being banned for ever more. I think this is a completely unreasonable power which the hon. the Minister wants to take upon himself. A point which I do not believe has been made in this regard is that so far everybody has been concentrating on &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; in so far as it applies to what is &#x201C;indecent&#x201D;; in other words pornography and such literature.

<p>Mr. Chairman, has anybody mentioned the point that &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; refers to more than public morals and that it may refer to anything which is considered harmful to any section of the inhabitants of the Republic or brings any section of the inhabitants of the Republic into ridicule or contempt. Nobody has referred to that, to the best of my knowledge. I was here for the Second Reading debate, and this is still clause 1. Am I right? Can the hon. the Minister tell me whether the term &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; encompasses the whole definition of that word in terms of the principal Act and not just public morals as far as indecency is concerned?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, I am sorry to argue with you, but you have allowed full discussion on the question of the pornographic side of this clause, and I do not want to discuss that at all. I want to discuss the point that anything that is undesirable in terms of the definition falls within the ambit of this clause. I object to that part of it. It has not even been mentioned in this discussion and it is much wider than just lewd literature; one can have a series of cartoons making fun of the super-verkramptes, which might have the result that the next edition will be banned because it is bringing ridicule on a section of the community. I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister will not ban those sort of things. He might; one never knows.</p>

<p>All right, the board then. I object to this very strongly not only because of the impossibility of anticipating further lewd publications, when a particular issue happens to contain a lewd reference or a lewd picture, but because it goes much wider than that. It can affect political development and all sorts of aspects which can fall under the very wide definition of &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; under this clause.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I really cannot understand why the hon. members are so concerned about this clause. What we are asking in this clause in regard to the first edition of a publication, as stated by the hon. member for Green Point, is already contained in the Act in respect of imported publications. It is already in the Act in respect of imported series. Now the hon. members pretend that this is a terribly unreasonable power we are asking here. I just want to make it clear that the principle of taking action in regard to series was accepted at the Second Reading. Accordingly I agree that we cannot now discuss the principle of taking action. What we can discuss is whether it should be after the first edition or after the second edition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Or the third.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Or the third edition. In other words, the details, and therefore I feel myself limited to discussing these. As I said, we previously accepted a principle here with which no one found fault. The principle relates to imported series. Now the hon. members say that an article appears which forms part of a series, i.e. a kind of publication which appears weekly or monthly, which we do not like, which is in our opinion wrong and indecent and which has been published and has already done its harm. They say that because that article appears in that publication we ban the rest of the series. Surely the hon. members know that this is not what we have in mind. Surely the hon. members know that a series will not be banned on the grounds of one isolated article. What we have, in mind relates to a series of articles. This is what I indicated yesterday when I referred to the specific publication which I had before me. This is what usually happens. There is a publication <span class="col_5925-5926" refersTo="page_0110"/>which forms part of a series. That publication contains an article which is totally undesirable and which has already done its harm. They say that they will continue the series in subsequent publications. Now the hon. member for Green Point wants us to allow that publication to offend a second time after having done so the first time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>If it offends again, it must be prosecuted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But it is no use prosecuting it. The harm has already been done. The hon. member for Etosha quite rightly pointed out that the publication may be referred to the board to obtain a decision beforehand as to whether such an article is permissible or not. The necessary provision is there. I also pointed out to the hon. member for Green Point that this is not an inflexible measure. If the board finds that the second publication is innocent and it has no objection to it, it may withdraw that prohibition it has imposed. It is quite flexible, reasonable and fair. But I think our main task is to keep this undesirable literature from our people. This is the only way in which we can do so.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am amazed at the attitude which has been adopted by the hon. the Minister in suggesting&#x2014;and I hope this is not his thinking&#x2014;that publishers in South Africa must go to the Censor Board beforehand and submit their documents to see whether they may publish. [Interjections.] But that was what he suggested.</p>

<p>After the publisher has been stopped.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>After he has been stopped, it is no good going, because the board has already made up his mind. But if a publisher wants to be cautious, is he to submit himself to continuous censorship on payment of a fee in terms of that section? It is a shocking thought if that is what we are coming to in the publishing world in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I think he is placing the burden, in terms of this clause, on the Censor Board that it must express an opinion that every subsequent edition of such a publication is likely to be undesirable, and not only the succeeding one. The board has to do that on the evidence of one isolated article or conviction. The board can do it; that is what this Bill gives them power to do. Surely, Sir, that is not the basis upon which one must impose these restrictions. The Minister pushes aside and ignores the fact that each one of these persons who does publish an undesirable article, photograph or whatever it may be, who contravenes the Act, is subject to the criminal sanctions. He puts that aside. Surely, that is the normal way of dealing with something which is against the public interest. Now the Minister wants us to accept that this board, as a result of one prosecution or one undesirable article, which is undesirable in that board’s own opinion, can then come to a conclusion and express an opinion that every subsequent edition of such a publication is likely to be undesirable. I think the Minister has been most unreasonable and unjustified in taking up the attitude he has with regard to this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#van_breda">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is high time we came back to earth. I feel that the hon. member for Green Point is arguing in the air with that standpoint that the edition will be banned on account of one specific article. Let us be practical. None of us is a member of the Publications Control Board. The general public are not members of it. I am telling hon. members today that you can ask the scruffiest chap in the street what the scruffiest publications in South Africa are. He will be able to tell you which one he is going to buy next week. As the new expression goes, &#x201C;It’s a ‘safe’ one; that’s a juicy periodical for you&#x201D;. In other words, if a layman in the street with low moral codes is able to indicate what periodical he tends to buy on account of its contents, how can hon. members be justified in doubting the judgment of the Control Board, and say that it will simply ban a publication on account of one little article in an arbitrary way? Surely this is quite unheard of and unrealistic. But now the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) comes to light with a clever way out and says, &#x201C;But surely they can simply change their name and publish another periodical under a different name&#x201D;. One really should not display one’s ignorance in this way if one knows nothing about this matter. After all, the fact of the matter is that control is exercised. If a publication appears at intervals of at least a month, the publisher must register the name of that publication under the Newspaper and Imprint Act. The hon. member seems to think that one can simply change the name every week as it suits one. This is simply no argument.</p>

<p>Within the framework of the definition of what may be regarded as undesirable the hon. member for Houghton wants to include things in addition to the indecent. By doing so she is in fact lending force to the argument that this clause is really necessary. On that basis it will be clear if there is an article which she considers to be derogatory to the Jews. If an article should appear which forms part of a serial, surely that is sufficient reason to ban it. This again represents a complete difference in approach between this side and that side of the House. Our point of view is that it is enough if one filthy publication has appeared. The point of view of the hon. member for Green Point is that if two have appeared, it is not so bad. As long as this is the basis on which we argue, we will simply not be able to come to terms. I just feel that we cannot water down this matter, because it is <span class="col_5927-5928" refersTo="page_0111"/>precisely our duty to prevent that first edition from appearing. If this clause is accepted as it stands today, it will be a definite deterrent to those very publishers and will cause them to see to it that that first article which is the point at issue, does not appear.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is the second time the hon. member for Tygervallei has come into this debate, and both times he talked a lot of nonsense. Does he not know that it has happened in the past that when periodicals have been banned, they reappeared under different names?</p>

<p>It does not matter. Whether he has to register or not, it has happened. I merely asked the hon. the Minister what he is going to do. If he wants to close all the loopholes, this is another one he must close.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the hon. the Minister. I think that my hon. friend from Green Point was quite right in the attitude he took up about the reply of the hon. the Minister. That was no reply. I am sure the hon. the Minister in his heart knows that it was not a reply, especially when he started talking about the principle having already been established and accepted with regard to imported publications. He knows the reason why this principle was accepted and why it was introduced by one of his predecessors in previous legislation.</p>

<p>Order! The principle of this Bill is not under discussion now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I agree, Sir; it is not under discussion now. But what I want to put to the hon. the Minister is that he knows our attitude, why we are opposed to this. We are opposed to it because the courts have jurisdiction over the publishers in South Africa, and over the publishers of the very periodicals which are referred to in this provision, the only publications which are affected by these particular powers the hon. the Minister is now taking.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred again to a publication which he has there. I do not know its name. It carries the first of a series of articles on contraception. He asked what action he was to take. I am sure that he is quite clear as to what action he could have taken. If he considered that this article was so bad, he could have taken the necessary action in the courts, not only to prohibit the distribution of that particular edition, but also to act against the next or any subsequent editions which might appear.</p>

<p>He has that power and he does not need the power given to him by this measure which he is taking now. The hon. member for Green Point made the point to the hon. the Minister about a publisher who is cautious referring his publication to the board before publishing it. I want to quote an example that occurred recently and I want to point out how dangerous this provision can be. A leading magazine, and I can almost go so far as to say the leading family magazine in South Africa, appeared on the news stands with a rather lurid picture on the front. It is not the picture I sent to the hon. the Minister. When the publishers saw this they were horrified. This particular highly reputable firm had been very careful and very strict with the cover pictures as well as with the articles which they had published. But due to an oversight and a breakdown on one occasion of the machinery employed by that firm in seeing that their publication maintained the high standard which they like to maintain, this picture slipped through. This happened not so long ago. In terms of this Bill as it stands to-day the hon. the Minister’s board could have picked up this picture, said that it was undesirable, pornographic or whatever they may decide upon and on the strength of that, in terms of this Bill, they could have come to the conclusion that future editions of this publication might have carried such a picture on the front page. They could then have banned, pending an appeal, any further publication of that magazine. This might have happened to the leading magazine in South Africa due to an oversight and a breakdown in the machinery of that firm.</p>

Can it be construed that, if the views expressed by these periodicals ridicule a certain section of the <span class="col_5929-5930" refersTo="page_0112"/>community, not only a particular edition can be banned, but all future editions of these publications? Surely these two magazines have followed a pattern. Surely they have taken the pattern of ridiculing a section of the people in this country?

<p>Mr. Chairman, if the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) is not meeting trouble halfway with one of his arguments, he is trying to split hairs with another. In this way we had to listen for the second time during this debate to the hon. member’s voice. It is not really worth the trouble to do so, but my real purpose in getting up is to ask the hon. member, in the first place, why, if he says that the hon. the Minister already has the powers under the Act to take certain steps, he complains if these powers are now being granted for a second time. Surely it does not matter in that case, and surely the power could then again be laid down by legislation. The second point is that the hon. member puts forward the argument that if a publication accidentally happened to contain something undesirable, its fate was sealed. This is not the position at all. The entire purport of this clause is, firstly, that there must in fact have been a prosecution and that it must have been found undesirable under section 5 (1) (a), or, in the second place, that according to a statement by the board it is undesirable in the board’s opinion, and the said statement has not been set aside. In other words, a statement of undesirability may be set aside subsequently. In the third place we have a council which consists of fair and reasonable people, and which will not simply intervene if a fair explanation is given in connection with such an undesirable publication. We on this side of the House want to ensure that publications containing harmful information do not appear on the streets. This hon. member is meeting trouble halfway and splitting hairs when he refers to publications such as <i>Veg</i> and the <i>South African Observer.</i> He knows what our real idea is here and what we have in mind. What we have in mind as far as this measure is concerned, is mainly publications that corrupt the morals. I am of the opinion that once the publishers of a publication have had an opportunity and they have forfeited that opportunity, it is a good thing if they are exposed to the threat of their publications being banned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister, when dealing with this clause at the Second Reading, indicated, quite correctly I agree, the problems of acting as a court of appeal for censored films. I think the Minister with this amendment is accepting a very onerous task in that he personally should be responsible for decisions in appeals from the Censor Board. We believe that it is correct that the Minister should accept that responsibility. The Minister demonstrated to us an exercise in the censorship of films when he invited members from both sides of the House to review a film which was banned by the Publications Board, a film under the title &#x201C;The Chastity Belt&#x201D;. This is a film which I myself would not have banned. In fact, I found it to be rather a nonsensical farce on the activities of the Crusaders. However, what did worry me is the fact that this film, by virtue of the fact that it was submitted to the procedures of the Publications Board, would now get far greater publicity than the one star it should get at the very most as a piece of entertainment. It seems to me that the Minister in amending section 11 of the principal Act has not given sufficient thought to the possibility of their being a divergence of opinion about what should be banned and what not. He did not give proper recognition to the fact that opinions in this regard may vary between individuals in the same walk of life. With this amendment he proposes to delegate to one person the responsibility of reviewing a film which has been censored, and of reporting and making recommendations to him. The Minister should recognize the divergence of opinion which was apparent when members of both sides of the House reviewed that film and realize also that his decision on appeal is final. There is no further appeal to the court, and he is in fact in the position of a tribunal. If he delegates that power he is giving that power to some other tribunal, I believe it would be wise for him to provide in this clause that there should be at least two persons and possibly three who would do the reviewing on his behalf. I know the hon. the Minister may feel that that will be a cumbersome procedure. But I believe it is dangerous to leave the power to recommend, at variance possibly with the decision of the Censor Board, in the hands of one person only. Where that recommendation is at variance with the decision of the Censor Board, the Minister will find himself having to see every one of those films himself before he comes to a decision. It is for that reason I have moved the amendment which stands in my name, namely to substitute &#x201C;persons&#x201D; for &#x201C;person&#x201D;, which means that the hon. the Minister should call two or more persons to perform this duty and not rely on one opinion only, because of his own experience of the divergence of opinions on these delicate matters. I therefore move, as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the interest the hon. member is showing in this problem we have. In fact, we do have a problem here.

I must say we are in fact making an attempt here and an attempt was also made in the Act as it reads at present, an attempt which did not provide a proper solution to our problem. I think the hon. member will agree with that. That is so. That is why I said yesterday that it would seem to me that the best procedure would be to abide by the decision of the Publications Board. The hon. member suggested a moment ago that we should obtain many different opinions in cases such as these. My attitude is that we already have this on the Publications Board. The members of the Publications Board were specially selected and are specially equipped to take decisions on matters of this nature. I am <span class="col_5933-5934" refersTo="page_0114"/>quite satisfied that no other person is as well equipped as the Publications Board itself to decide on matters such as these. Thus the people who consult each other go into all the different aspects of the matter so as to ensure that proper consideration is given to the literary, artistic and moral principles, etc. They are pre-eminently the people who perform this function. As for me, in this case I feel I should like somebody to give me his impressions of the film concerned. As we are amending the Act at present, the final decision remains in the hands of the Minister. I think this is an improvement, otherwise I would not have moved this amendment. I think it is an improvement because in the past I was obliged to delegate that power to somebody else who, in the normal course of events, probably had nothing to do with the whole matter. In isolated cases such a person was suddenly asked to decide whether something was permissible or not. He had probably never had the occasion before to consider the standards and norms on the basis of which a film should be allowed or not. In my capacity as Minister I at least have contact with the Board. In addition I am also obliged to report to Parliament. I must admit the procedure is not effective. I do not think it is very effective, but as for me, I am satisfied that if I were to appoint two or more persons, I would find myself in such a muddle that I would benefit much less than I think I shall benefit from the opinion of the one person I will ask to go and see the film. I can very well imagine what would happen if two people like that hon. member, for example, were to be appointed. They would differ with me just as I differed with him in respect of the film we had seen.</p>

<p>No, we did not agree on that film. One of the two people appointed, may say it is a good film and advance certain reasons for his opinion, while the other person may say that for some reason or other the film should not be allowed. What am I to do then? It will make it much easier for me if I were to obtain the objective opinion and impressions of one sensible person. I shall be able to take a decision on the basis of the description he gives me. Under these circumstances, as far as I am concerned, my intention is to appoint only one person. I want to ask the hon. member to leave the matter at that now.</p>

<p>There is something else I want to say to the hon. member. As a matter of fact, this is an additional argument. When the Arms and Ammunitions Bill was being considered a little while ago, I pointed out that, according to the Interpretation Act, the singular includes the plural, and <i>vice versa.</i> It is clearly stated in the Interpretation Act that this is the case &#x201C;in every law, unless the contrary intention appears&#x201D;. There is a degree of uncertainty as regards the explanation of this &#x201C;contrary intention&#x201D;. These are the precise words as they appear in the Interpretation Act. Words in the singular number include the plural, and words in the plural number include the singular. In other words, if the hon. member succeeds in becoming Minister of the Interior one day, he will, in terms of the Interpretations Act, be able to appoint more persons if he wanted to.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister was good enough to give us the opportunity of seeing this draft amendment and I am glad that he has seen the light on the subject and has drafted an amendment which removes our objections to which we gave expression yesterday afternoon. It would appear that the Bill as printed does not really mean exactly what the Minister intended it to mean, and this amendment which he is now moving will make it perfectly clear exactly what he did mean. It would further appear, in regard to the tabling of reports and recommendations by the board, that in the strict letter of the law, the law has been broken by the Department and by successive Ministers, including myself, ever since 1944, because the law is quite clear that all recommendations and reports must be laid on the Table. That certainly was not the intention when the law was passed. I can say so with certainty because I happened to put the Bill through the House. The intention was not that inter-departmental memoranda and things of that sort should be laid on the Table, so this amendment meets our objection to the Bill as printed, and we are very grateful to the Deputy Minister for moving this amendment.</p>

<heading>SOIL CONSERVATION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday evening, just before the adjournment of the debate, I was busy mentioning the most important reasons why the Soil Conservation Act of 1946 had not been successful. The most important reasons which I mentioned, not necessarily in the same sequence, were the following: The tremendous droughts which we had, pestilence and plagues, the financial position of the farmer and, finally, the shortage of trained technicians to give the necessary guidance in connection with soil conservation. The hon. the Minister pointed out that the 1946 legislation was definitely an idealistic measure. Incidentally, this does not surprise me because the 1946 legislation was passed by the United Party Government. But we are going to support this Bill of the hon. the Minister, and I am briefly going to furnish the reasons why we are supporting the Bill at the Second Reading. Firstly, we are supporting it because the extent of the problem has now become so great that drastic steps have become necessary to check soil erosion in South Africa. Twenty years ago it was claimed that we were losing about 300 million tons of topsoil annually. To-day it is claimed that we are losing our topsoil at the rate of 400 million tons annually. We are informed by experts that this loss of 400 million tons of soil annually is equal to R1,000 million, almost the same as the total annual agricultural turnover in South Africa. Sir, we support this legislation because a greater responsibility is being placed on the shoulders of the farmer in respect of soil conservation and the application of sound conservation methods. But we also support it because the responsibility which rests on the shoulders of the Minister and his Department will become considerably greater. We thus support the Bill in general because it also enjoys the support of the South African Agricultural Union. In addition we feel that the Bill can be supported because after it has been passed it will not be possible to look for scapegoats; it will then no longer be possible to accuse soil conservation committees of not being prepared to take action against farmers who do not want to apply proper soil conservation methods. It will also no longer be possible, as has frequently been done previously, to blame soil conservation committees for laxity in this respect or in any other respect.</p>

<p>Before I come to the Bill itself I want to touch upon a few matters which arise out of the hon. the Minister’s speech. I must say that we are grateful to the hon. the Minister for making copies of his speech available to us. In his speech he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because many committee members were not able to plan farms they relied heavily upon the extension officers and technicians of the Department. Owing to a chronic shortage of officers the desired progress could not be made with farm planning either. The farmers whose farms had been planned and on whose farms the necessary works, such as fences, had been erected, did not, however, apply the prescribed measures.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister how this Bill of his changes the situation, because the chronic shortage of extension officers and technicians remains. Sufficient officers are simply not being made available to the farmers. In addition, Sir, I shall tell you why the hon. the Minister will not succeed in improving the position in this way. He will not succeed in improving it because the committees which he is contemplating in this Bill will be absolutely advisory in nature. In fact, the hon. the Minister <span class="col_5937-5938" refersTo="page_0116"/>himself said this in his Second Reading speech. Previously soil conservation district committees could, in fact, plan farms, and, in particular, where they had the confidence of their fellow farmers they could achieve quite a good deal. The greatest objection of the local soil conservation committees was, as the hon. the Minister mentioned, that they could not institute proceedings against lax farmers. That was their only objection. They did not object to the other tasks which they had to perform. But now the hon. the Minister goes and removes all the other tasks and all other powers which they had and says that they will merely be advisory committees. Sir, I just want to repeat that point: He is not going to have the necessary extension officers because this Bill is going to do nothing to the chronic shortage of extension officers, and in addition he is depriving his soil conservation committees of further powers. Who is now going to do this work? I think that the hon. the Minister should give us a very clear reply about this. However, at a later stage in his speech he said that the committees would still always play a key role. In what respect would they then play the key role. Certain powers are being taken from them; they are becoming merely advisory, but the hon. the Deputy Minister claimed that they would still always play a key role. He neglected to give us a proper illustration of what role he thought these people were subsequently going to play. Unfortunately, I now have to refer the hon. the Minister to the Soil Conservation Board’s latest report which we have at our disposal. On pages 6 and 7 they refer to a conference which was held by soil conservation committees in March last year in Bloemfontein. This conference made certain recommendations and, according to the report, they are not, in fact, prepared to take disciplinary action against their fellow farmers, but they have always been prepared to perform any other task for the Minister and for soil conservation. They said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That all Committee members be elected in the future as is at present the case with farmer members.</block>

<p>That is the recommendation which his committee itself made at their conference, but in this Bill the Deputy Minister states: You will never again be elected by the farmers; I shall appoint you in consultation with the S.A. Agricultural Union. In my opinion, if there is one important principle in this respect it is that if one really wants these people to play a key role they must be elected by the farmers; when they have the confidence of their fellow-farmers they can achieve so much more. We also want to give the Minister notification of the fact that in the Committee Stage, in respect of clause 9, we shall propose that, while he will be empowered to constitute such a soil conservation committee, we should nevertheless like to see that the majority of them are <i>bona fide</i> farmers and that they will be selected by him from a panel of farmers from the soil conservation district concerned, a panel which was set up by the farmers themselves. They elect their people to serve on those committees, submit their choice to the Minister and then he in turn can select as many of them as he needs. I think that this would be the best way to do it. But to say that he will merely consult with the S.A. Agricultural Union will, I fear, not have the necessary effect of obtaining the co-operation of the farmers, and these soil conservation committees will still always be the most important link in doing the work. As a result of a shortage of trained technicians, and also because the Soil Conservation Advisory Board which the Minister is contemplating will not play any particular role either, we on this side of the House still see the committee’s task as being of the utmost importance. They are the Minister’s front line; they are his soldiers, but I fear that according to this legislation the Minister is going to send them to the front without any weapons. He is disarming them and pleads that they will be merely advisory, but at the same time he says that they will play a key role. We on this side of the House find this to be an anomaly. It is essential for us to point out that there are 816 functioning soil conservation committees in the country, from 780 or 95 per cent of which the Minister has received reports during the year under discussion. In other words, they were doing his work, and they were doing good work as well; and statistics indicate that these soil conservation committees have evidenced a considerable improvement even as far as attending their meetings is concerned, and in the number of meetings which were held. I can therefore not envisage anyone thinking that these committees are not functioning, because 780 of the 816 regularly submitted reports and there is proof that these committees are displaying considerably more interest.</p>

<p>I now want to mention another argument about why we think that these committees, as he envisages them in the legislation, will not work. If he were to give them new and greater powers, letting them be constituted from the farmers themselves, the situation would improve considerably. In addition to their necessary meetings, the local soil conservation committees have independently planned 1,833 farms, 292 more than in the previous year. But now the Minister says that they will no longer do so in future. We know that they do not like performing this task. Such a committee is usually hesitant, but if they are not there to do it, who is going to perform this essential service in the absence of sufficient extension officers? It should also be borne in mind that only 50 per cent of our farms have, in fact, been planned, and therefore there are still 50 per cent which must be planned, and the Minister knows from his reports that the works are being executed and conservation methods applied on only 12 per cent of the planned farms. Therefore, if there are still 50 per cent of the farms to be planned and one is not going to make use of the soil conservation <span class="col_5939-5940" refersTo="page_0117"/>committees, I fear that with the best possible disposition towards this legislation now before the House, the hon. the Minister is going to come back after a year and tell us that the United Party was right.</p>

<p>The Minister cannot accept that these committees should no longer be elected by the land owners as was previously the case. If he had put something else in its place to fill the gap he could, in fact, have used that argument, but unfortunately he is not filling the gap which is being left; he is simply making it bigger. As a farmer himself he will realize that he would have confidence in a man which he himself had placed there to manage his affairs on such a committee. In addition it appears to me as if the hon. the Minister wants to decrease the soil conservation committees even more. I think that it will land him and the Department in a much greater morass if they decrease the number of the committees.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member had listened attentively to the case which I was trying to build up he would have realized why; it is because there is still such a fantastic task which lies ahead, the 50 per cent of the farms which are unplanned. If the hon. member would merely look at the report about the amount of work which has been done in the past few years he would find that 577,000 farmers’ works were approved at a cost of R81 million, but in the same period a mere 269,000 were completed. Less than 50 per cent of the work which was approved was completed. The value of the approved work was calculated at R81 million and the value of that actually carried out at R44 million. The hon. the Minister mentioned this in his speech.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>The only difference is nevertheless whether they are elected or nominated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>No, this is not the only difference. To elect them is in effect an important factor, but what we claim is that these soil conservation committees cannot merely be advisory in nature under the prevailing circumstances. That is the point. They must have an actual function to fulfil. They will still always have to plan farms, because who else can do so? Therefore, what the Minister is proposing here, that locally, up to the highest level, one can merely have advisory people in connection with soil conservation, is a big mistake. We are not arguing with the Minister about the legislation, but what we are arguing about is that the mechanism which he has created for himself in this legislation will not work properly unless he is prepared to extend the functions, which he can, in fact do by regulation, so that the local soil conservation committees are not merely advisory but will also have an actual function.</p>

<p>I want to put another question to the hon. the Minister. In his speech the Minister claimed that the district committees would no longer be responsible for the drawing up of the soil conservation scheme. I can understand this to a large extent, because in terms of the 1946 Act it was the soil conservation district committee or the Soil Conservation Board which could draw up the soil conservation scheme, but now the Minister has said that the district plan or farm plan would no longer be bound by law; it would exist, he said, until it is replaced by directions. But at the same time he has also claimed that financial assistance could only be granted by way of a farm map and a schedule. I also find this to be an anomaly in his speech, to think that the district committees may now no longer draw up the farm plan and that the plan will no longer be bound by law, and at the same time to say that if one needs financial assistance, this should still be granted throughout according to the farm map and the schedule. The hon. the Minister must explain this to us in his reply. There may be a point somewhere which I do not understand, and I think that the Minister must make it very clear to us in his reply how he envisages that it will work. I say again that we are not arguing against the Bill; we are merely trying to resolve the doubts which we have about the manner in which the legislation will be applied. We are in agreement with the reinstitution of the Soil Conservation Division and we surmise that this step is a result of the appeals which were made recently for an individually independent Department of Soil Conservation. Soil conservation activities can undoubtedly be promoted to a large extent by this Soil Conservation Division. We have realized its value in the past, and in future we believe it will once more be of great value.</p>

<p>Now there are merely a few matters in connection with the legislation itself.</p>

<p>Clauses 3, 4 and 5 give the Minister tremendously great powers. Clause 4 provides that the Minister himself has the power to require a landowner to carry out and to maintain soil conservation works. In clause 5 the Minister even goes as far as telling a farmer that he must go and do work on another person’s land. After that work has been done, the Minister is empowered to decide whether it was advantageous or disadvantageous, and if there were costs involved the Minister would decide on the amount to be paid out. Why must the hon. the Minister have these powers as laid down by clause 5? Why does he not leave it to a court of arbitration to pass that judgment? The hon. the Minister does not only require action by the farmer on his own land, but even on another person’s land. The hon. the Minister is going to take it upon himself to pass judgment in respect of what amount shall be paid out. We think that this matter can best be decided by a court of arbitration. Why can this not be done by a court which consists of a representative of the Minister’s Department and the Soil Conservation Board and the local magistrate? They will be best able to give a decision in connection <span class="col_5941-5942" refersTo="page_0118"/>with such a matter. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that we are also going to make a similar proposal in the Committee Stage and we hope that he will consider it.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to clause 9. I have already told the hon. the Deputy Minister what we are going to propose there in connection with the constituting of his soil conservation committees. In his introductory speech the hon. the Deputy Minister said that he proposed that the Soil Conservation Advisory Council should now replace the old board. The hon. the Minister also said that the old board was also merely advisory in nature. But why is this not mentioned in the legislation? Why does the legislation not provide that an advisory council is going to be nominated? The hon. the Minister is now the Minister of Agriculture, but to-morrow or the day after there may be someone else who is not bound to establish a soil conservation advisory board. Therefore, if another Minister were to occupy the post he could simply do away with that. If it is the view of the South African Agricultural Union and the farmers in general, as it is the view of this side of the House, I think they would prefer it to be stated in the legislation if such a soil conservation board is to be established. What is more, if there must be such a soil conservation advisory council the farmers should, surely, also have the assurance that the majority of those people will, in fact, be <i>bona fide</i> farmers. They must have the assurance that the people will be able to look after their interests. Therefore we shall also propose that such a soil conservation advisory council shall be so constituted that at least one-third of the members will be <i>bona fide</i> farmers.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say that we realize the urgency of the matter under discussion. We also realize that it is not the final word on soil conservation, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has said. We all realize that we are not farming with livestock, grain, fruit or with anything else; we are farming with land. We realize that we shall now once and for all have to take urgent steps to call a halt to this problem that South Africa has come to face. We on this side of the House want to do it, and the hon. the Deputy Minister knows that in recent years, for longer, even, than I have been here, this side of the House has insisted on the urgency of soil conservation. We do not want the soil to wash away; we want to leave something better to our descendants than we ourselves had. It is our duty, and therefore we want to grant the hon. the Minister these powers. These are drastic powers and under ordinary circumstances we would not have wanted to grant them to him, but we are going to do so and we want to tell the hon. the Minister that if he would be prepared to accept our amendments his legislation would only be improved by it. It would not weaken his or his Department’s position in applying what they must apply. He would at least ensure the support of the greater majority of the farmers in South Africa if he were to do this. On that condition we are prepared to support the Second Reading of this legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>I listened attentively to the hon. member for Newton Park’s argument. However, we have reached a stage where we must not merely support, but must do something more, i.e. welcome with great enthusiasm anything for the promotion of soil and water conservation. Soil and water conservation are very closely related. It is no use merely making money available and placing legislation on the Statute Book. The population of this country, particularly the farmers, must realize their responsibility. The State is here placing certain means at their disposal and thereafter, the onus rests with them. I have the fullest confidence that if we were to give them the necessary assistance, our farmers would carry this tremendous task through to the benefit of our whole country.</p>

<p>In the Soil Conservation Board’s report it is stated that it is expected that the life of the Verwoerd Dam would be a mere 100 years under present circumstances. On the other hand, I have heard experts say that it is more likely to be 50 years, owing to the present danger of silting up. Therefore it is extremely essential for the inhabitants of our country to be made aware of the necessity for soil conservation and of the conservation of our life source, water, which goes hand-in-hand with that.</p>

<p>I now come to a few of the arguments of the hon. member for Newton Park. He wanted to know from the Minister what the position was in respect of the technicians, in respect of the staff which had to render assistance. According to my interpretation of this legislation and of the Second Reading speech of the Minister, it boils down to the fact that the procedures in connection with soil conservation must be streamlined; that up to now there had been too much prolixity involved. The approach of this legislation is that the onus will in future be placed on the farmer. The Opposition frequently creates the impression that farming is a ragged profession; that it inspires no confidence; that it is in such a rotten position. They must get rid of that idea, because that is one of the reasons why so few of our young people are coming to the fore to render assistance. This is owing to the psychosis which hon. members opposite are trying to create by implying that everything is ostensibly in such a rotten position. We should rather try and instil idealism into our people. If we have to criticize, let us do so in as constructive a way as possible and try to avoid being derogatory and creating an image of farming which instils no confidence.</p>

<p>In respect of the work of the soil conservation committees I have said that this legislation is aimed at streamlining the procedures. We have here more than 800 committees with <span class="col_5943-5944" refersTo="page_0119"/>more than 5,000 members and we have heard that only half of them were active. But what are we going to do now? We are now going to place the onus on the farmer. During a previous debate the hon. member mentioned the fact that he had asked an officer, I do not know how long ago, to do certain survey work on his farm. He is still waiting for that officer. I support the Minister’s attitude that the farmer himself should confidently get down to work because many of them can do the work themselves. Why must officials come and do it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>How do you think an ordinary farmer, with no technical training, is going to survey a dam which must be built, for example a cement dam?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the hon. member what I did. I bought the necessary implements for my farm manager and from the Department I obtained brochures for him in connection with the building of round dams. Now he is also doing surveys of the contours. In fact, I have even taught some of my farm labourers to do certain work. It is, of course, necessary to call in engineers when it comes to the larger works. But for the majority of these small jobs officials have to travel hundreds of miles to survey a simple contour with a specific slope, something which the farmer himself could do. I want to go as far as to say that 80 per cent of these works could be done by the farmer himself if he wanted to take the necessary trouble and wanted to acquire the necessary instruments. Let me suggest that next time, instead of going to play golf, the hon. member should take his levelling instrument and go for a walk. It affords as much exercise and more satisfaction. There are 90,000 farmers in the country, all of them potential planners. The farmer and his wife could themselves travel around the farm a little and decide where camps should be established and where water should be laid on. If they were to come up against technical problems they could go to these advisory committees and to the technical officers. Things would then go more smoothly. But what is the present position? A plan is now submitted to the farmer, a plan which he perhaps does not even understand. In any case, he must now go and work according to plans which other people have drawn up for him. Therefore I regard this legislation as a great step forward. I heartily welcome the fact that we should involve the farmers in these matters to a greater extent. They should cooperate more closely in planning and related matters. I repeat: Much of this work is elementary and can be done by the farmer himself. In fact, they would welcome being able to do it themselves. I regard the personal participation by the farmer as the basis for future success. But as long as he stands to one side and waits for the State, for officials and for soil conservation committees, he is not directly involved. He merely sits and waits, i.e. an attitude of &#x201C;others must come and do the work for me&#x201D;. As I have said, it is the object of this legislation to place the onus on the farmer himself to a greater extent. The hon. member said that the soil conservation committees were the soldiers. But in my opinion a greater number of soldiers can now tackle this work. Each individual will concern himself with his own work and not with that of another. We must stimulate the farmer and create and urge towards self-achievement.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the powers of the Minister. In my opinion these powers are necessary. We can perhaps argue about the appointment of committees, i.e. whether more should be elected by the farmers’ unions. If we look at clause 2 of the Bill we see what the aims of this Act are, i.e. to make provision for the combating and prevention of soil erosion, and for the conservation, protection and improvement of our soil. To my mind this is of overriding importance. In clause 3 it is provided that a Minister can declare a direction to be applicable. There are a whole range of things which he can cover under such a direction. I must express my gratitude that that range is so wide that it can cover various fields. Virtually every area affecting soil and water conservation&#x2014;every facet of it&#x2014;is mentioned in that range. I welcome this in particular. I particularly want to refer to the application of areas which are being reserved as water catchment areas in terms of a legal provision. This is very important in the area from which I come. There we have a clashing of interests with those participating in forestry. We know that the Water Act also makes provision for dealing with these matters and I am glad that our farmers who want to apply soil conservation, and the committees which can act in an advisory capacity to the Minister in future, can also concern themselves with this. I do not want to elaborate further on this matter. I want to content myself with asking for a more positive and sober approach to this matter on the part of the Opposition so that we may give this important legislation the necessary stimulus which will carry through to our farmers. They will now be able to say with pride that they have a responsibility in that matter and that they are going to tackle it in conjunction with the Minister and the Department. I am sure that this is the only way in which success can be achieved. In my opinion we shall not be able to achieve this overnight, but the more people we involve in this and to whom we give responsibility&#x2014;and this is what is contemplated with this legislation&#x2014;the quicker and greater will be the success that we achieve.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park has indicated that we are supporting this Bill. We are supporting it simply because it is taking the place of an existing measure and because we agree that something has to be done to preserve the fertility of our soil and that it is necessary to educate the public. I was going to say <span class="col_5945-5946" refersTo="page_0120"/>in particular the farming community. But that is not fair. It is not true. We want the public of South Africa to understand the need for the protection of our soil and the fertility of our soil. We put these matters, namely soil conservation and water conservation, right in the forefront of the work which we believe should be carried out by Parliament. I want to say at once that I am not suggesting for a moment that this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. But I do want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that in my opinion this Bill will prove to be a complete failure in so far as the object we have in mind is concerned. It will prove to be a failure not because of any fault of the hon. the Deputy Minister, but because of the instrument. I will deal with that in a minute or two.</p>

<p>I should like to reply to the hon. member for Nelspruit, who has just resumed his seat. What I would suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister is that if the issue concerning the difficulties that will crop up in the administration of this measure, were to be referred to a Select Committee, it will take that committee three years to complete its job. I base that on the three years it took the Select Committee to deal with the present Water Act. We sat for three years on that and it was a matter, namely the protection of water, which was no more important than that of soil. Here again unfortunately we are in the position that we have the conservation of water and the conservation of soil as two totally different things, whereas they are inextricably bound together. This must have been a matter of big thought to the hon. the Deputy Minister as it is to everybody in this House who is interested in soil and water conservation. Soil conservation and water conservation go together. Soil conservation, in so far as the existing Act is concerned, has failed. That admission is implicit in the present Bill that we have before us. The present Act has failed. It is not serving the purpose, whatever the reason may be. The hon. the Deputy Minister gave some of those reasons. As I have said, it took us three years on the Select Committee to deal with the Water Act. It would take us three years to deal with soil conservation if we are to get an Act which will serve its purpose.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for Newton Park and that is that you have to get a live, active interest in the farming community in any measure designed to be effective where soil conservation is concerned. If you do not get that then the basic mainspring upon which the whole of your soil conservation will be based is failing. There is no driving force. There must not only be an appreciation by the farmer that as an academic principle it is good to preserve the fertility of your soil. He has to be convinced that it pays him to conserve the fertility of his soil. He has to get an absolute fundamental principle engrained into his mind that his way of life as a farmer is to protect the fertility of his soil, is to protect the heritage which has come to us from our forefathers and which we must pass on. We are the caretakers of the soil. We are not the owners of it. We have our title deeds. We have bought it and all that sort of thing. But we go and those that come after us and the nation that follows are the people who have got to take over from us the fertility of the soil, undiminished, if in fact we are to survive as a nation.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, with these preliminary remarks I want to say this. One of the things that is missing here has been excellently set out by the Natal Agricultural Union. It appears in a special show supplement. I am referring to the show that was opened the other day in Pietermaritzburg by the hon. the Prime Minister. It is the show supplement of the <i>Natal Witness</i> in Pietermaritzburg. It excellently sets out the attitude of the Natal Agricultural Union. It is no good us saying that organized agriculture is behind this Bill. The Natal Agricultural Union is an agricultural union dealing with diverse soil conditions of the farming community in Natal. But it carries the support and confidence of the whole of the farming community in that province. The Natal Agricultural Union has indicated their opposition because of its ineffectiveness. It is not a question of their opposition in principle to soil conservation. Let us put that out of our minds once and for all. There is no farmer worth his salt to-day who is opposed to soil conservation <i>per se.</i> Of course we are all in favour of soil conservation.</p>

<p>What we are concerned with is to make an effective instrument for it. And here the Natal Agricultural Union is against it. And, Sir, the chief reason is that it does not bring the Bantu areas under the provisions of the Act. You cannot have a farmer saying: &#x201C;Of course, I stand for soil conservation. Of course, I apply soil conservation on my farm. I have my farm very carefully planned. I adopt soil conservation methods all the way through my farm.&#x201D; And if you were to ask him: &#x201C;Is that so? What about this part of your farm?&#x201D; He will then say: &#x201C;Oh yes, but I conserve only on half my farm. On the other half I do not apply soil conservation methods.&#x201D; That is exactly what we are saying as long as we do not bring in the Bantu areas under this Bill. We are saying just that. What is South Africa? South Africa is an area in which there are white and non-white areas. It includes the Bantu areas. What does the soil conservation measures in terms of a law which can be enforced look like in regard to my province? May I show you? This map I have here is my province with the Bantu areas. Can you imagine soil conservation in the white areas and the law not applying in the black areas? Fancy saying that we have an Act enforcing soil conservation in Natal &#x2026;</p>

<from><span class="col_5947-5948" refersTo="page_0121"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what an approach to this basic problem in South Africa! What an approach by the hon. member. Here I have a map of Natal. There are spots that are not under white control. They fall under the control of the Department of Bantu Administration. The law does not apply and has not been made to apply. How can the Government say that we are applying conservation methods, that we have a law now dealing with soil conservation in South Africa when you have a situation like that?</p>

<p>This is the fundamental weakness and the main, basic reason why the Natal Agricultural Union has said: &#x201C;If you are to have a law dealing with soil conservation, apply it to everybody.&#x201D; The Railway administration, the roads departments, are all exempted from it. Some of the worse soil erosion there is in South Africa stems from inadequate planning so far as the Railways and the roads departments are concerned. Some of the worst soil erosion I have seen results from a concentration of water, wrongly planned, from drainage works on the Railways and the various roads departments. These areas are exempted, as well as the Bantu areas. With weaknesses like this in the instrument, how can the Deputy Minister, when the time comes, expect that he will be efficient in the administration of the instrument? It is a failure in that regard because of the inherent weakness in the provisions.</p>

<p>As my hon. friend pointed out, the present committee, with their weaknesses, have done their best. They have not been as effective as they could be. Who is going to be the first to throw a brick because of inefficiency? Can I start, perhaps, with the Government themselves and ask them whether they have been as efficient and effective as they might have been? Do we have such a government, composed of Cabinet Ministers, that none of them can be said to have been inefficient or ineffective? Let us then not be too harsh in blaming the district soil conservation committees. They have been doing their best. I am not saying the Deputy Minister blames them. I think he paid them a compliment. We agree. But when we take them away and disband them, we want to substitute something better and how can it be said that a voluntary committee appointed by the Minister will be better? They will be volunteers. It is no good the Deputy Minister saying to Messrs. A, B, C, D, and E, &#x201C;I am appointing you to one of the new soil conservation committees&#x201D;, if they have not volunteered for the job and are not willing to serve. What is the good of that? They will stay at home. They are not interested. There is no discipline. One can only appoint them when they are interested, when they are volunteers. They are not elected. They do not have that sense of duty towards their fellow farmers.</p>

<p>On that point I want to come to what the hon. member for Nelspruit said just now. The hon. member dealt with what he called, I think, &#x201C;enthusiasm and idealism&#x201D;. He said that the farmers had to bring enthusiasm into their farming operations, which included soil conservation work, and so forth. Enthusiasm and idealism are like marriage. One can take love and kisses to a marriage, but one needs something a darn side more than that if you are going to make a success of it. One’s love and kisses on one’s farming land, too, requires something more than that if one is going to make a success of it.</p>

<p>Let us just for a moment look at the hon. member’s contention. It sounded fine and it will read nicely in Hansard, for a townsman. But does the hon. member know what the farmers are going to say when they read the hon. member’s speech? They will say: &#x201C;Where does this townsman come from? He cannot be a farmer to talk like this. Where does he live?&#x201D; We are not talking here for the big farmer, as he is called to-day, nor for the cheque book farmer. We are talking for the practical farmer who has to make a living. He has to pay debts and have something over to spend on his wife and his children and for himself to live and to have a reasonable existence. The hon. member says&#x2014;I say it reads well in Hansard&#x2014;that probably something like 90 per cent of our farmers, if they will get down to it and buckle to the job, can get all sorts of work in connection with anti-erosion schemes done on a do-it-yourself basis. They can get it done themselves.</p>

There was no question of self-help. There is this idea, this sort of picture that is painted in the minds of many of these good folk, of a farmer sitting on the stoep so long, with his big pot of coffee and calling out to the kitchen boy every now and again to come and replenish the kettle. He sits there with his cup of coffee, watches the crops grow and tells the Induna boy to do this and to do that. What a wonderful picture! What a flight of fancy!

<p>So far as this particular matter is concerned, I want to draw this to the hon. member’s attention. I believe he will be honest enough to admit it. If the farmers want to get a subsidy in terms of the Act for the work they do in connection with anti-erosion measures, they cannot get it unless the work is done and planned by one of the staff of the Department. There is the point. It is no good the farmer who is up to date, doing 80, 90 or 100 per cent of the work himself, and then saying to the Department &#x201C;I want a subsidy for the work I have done&#x201D;. That is the provision in the law. This is the crux of the whole matter. Where is the staff An up to date farmer can do the work. I accept what the hon. member said so far as the practicability is concerned. But we are not dealing here with the big farmer or the cheque book farmer. We are not dealing with the farmer who says, &#x201C;I am going to do that work and then I shall risk getting it passed by an official afterwards and getting my subsidy. I do not mind if I do not get it. It will be simply that much less on my income tax.&#x201D; We are dealing with the practical man, down to earth, who has to make both ends meet somehow. If he is to get a subsidy, he must have his work planned and approved by an official of the Department. That is basic. [Interjections.] I have yet to see any provision in the present Act where one can get a subsidy without getting a certificate from the official of the Department concerned. There is no such provision. I will stand corrected if the Deputy Minister gets up and shows me where that provision is. We will be very grateful, indeed, if there is such a provision in the Act. This is basic. We are short of staff and we shall continue, under existing circumstances, to be short of staff. The shortage of staff is one of the main, fundamental reasons why, what one might call, a planned soil preservation and soil conservation economy is not practised to a much greater extent than it is at the present time. It is basic, and it remains one of the fundamental difficulties here. In this article to which I have referred, the <i>Natal Witness</i> sets out the view of the Natal Agricultural Union. Apart from the question of what it calls the &#x201C;patchwork quilt&#x201D; of ownership of the land, it says: &#x201C;The husbandman must have the knowledge of how to practise such farming&#x201D;. He must have the knowledge. He must know what to do and the time to do it.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at what the farmer has to contend with, and what the extension officer has to contend with when he comes to assist farmers. He has to deal with the different farming types in the different areas, which call for different treatment. He has to deal with the different soils, which require totally different treatment. He has the different rainfall in the different areas. Once again, the soil conservation methods in the different rainfall areas are totally different from each other. Lastly, he has to take into account whether the final payability of the farming of that type in that area will be assured for the man who goes in for soil conservation.</p>

<p>Let us take transport costs. The man who is a long way away from his market, who has heavy transport costs, may have off-setting factors against, for instance, that high transport cost. He has to get his product to the market. He must go to some or other market. Now he must obtain a price which will give him a profit. After all his expenses, including the cost of soil conservation, has been paid, he still has to make a profit. A neighbour who is close to the market may be in a totally different position. The extension officer has to act as the trusted officer for the Department. When I say &#x201C;trusted&#x201D; I do not use the word ill-advisedly: I say it deliberately and after careful thought; the trusted agent of the Department. If there is one official in the whole of the Department who is in contact with the public and who can make good the image of the Department as far as the farmers are concerned, it is the extension officer. The extension officers are the people who are in touch with the farming community day after day and month after month. They are there to help and it is accepted that they will help. They have to take all the factors into account and can say to a man that if he continues with that type of farming in that area he will fail and will not make a profit. They will say to him that he may be a good farmer, that he may be doing his very best, that his production may show that he is successful, but that he will fail to make a living. They will advise <span class="col_5951-5952" refersTo="page_0123"/>him to change over completely, because of distance from rail or distance from market or whatever it may be. These are all the factors that have to be taken into account. Where are these extension officers? They do not exist. I do not know where they are to come from, but at the present time they do not exist. When it comes to the planning of works and so forth, we are far behind. I do not have a copy of the report with me, but I think we are two or three years behind with planning at the present time. Soil conservation is a matter for now, not a matter for two or three years time. Unless the hon. the Deputy Minister takes my advice and introduces a measure which will get the backing of the farming community because it is something practical and which will have their wholehearted support, then while we are going to lose, in my opinion, three years before we can start and this can be a stop-gap in the meantime, it will only be a stop-gap and nothing more.</p>

<p>On the question of the committees, I want to say that the present committees are being substituted by advisory committees. I ask the Deputy Minister to go through the records of any organization and find where an advisory committee has been a success.</p>

<p>I shall resist the temptation. For the record in Hansard may I say that it was on your advice that I resisted the temptation so that the hon. member will not be able to say afterwards that I refused to debate the matter with him.</p>

<p>In my opinion the farming industry of this country is now in the same position as a manufacturer who decides that his equipment is outmoded. We had a classic example in Britain a few years ago. The equipment of the British manufacturers was not old in terms of years; they were old in terms of models; they were old in terms of output; they were old in terms of concept when compared with modern equipment being installed in countries like Japan, America, West Germany and so forth. The British Government made special taxation proposals to allow those manufacturers to buy and install up to date new modern equipment. That is the position with the farming community to-day. We are handling the old models, the old outdated ideas, the outdated equipment, not in terms of tractors or harrows, but the methods and the ideas. What we want now is a brand new set of equipment which is modern and up to date with new ideas giving us new norms to aim at we need new ideas, new targets to which we can aspire. That cannot be done. I suggest, in terms of this Bill before us. This is no blame to the Deputy Minister or the Minister. The Minister’s Department has said the present Act is a failure: it does not work. We have had it for many years and it has not been successful. We will come with something new. The something new will be equally unable to cope with the situation. We are trying to graft on to an old tree which has reached the end of its fruitful life. That is not what is needed. We need something new from the ground roots upwards. That can only be brought about as a result of the widest consultation.</p>

<p>I have suggested a Select Committee or a commission. I do not want a number of people who are not associated with the practical side of farming. We could have one man who knows something about the administrative side of government. It should only be one, because if we had two, they would quarrel as to what is the best method. The rest of the members of the committee or the commission should be people who make their living out of farming. They should investigate every up to date method of soil conservation and not in South Africa only. Some of those methods may be biological methods, as they are called to-day, which may have nothing whatsoever to do with the mechanical side of soil conservation. Incorporate these latest up to date methods in an Act, obtain the backing and the support of the farming community, and then we will have the enthusiasm and the necessary drive to push the matter forward. But it has to be quite clear to the farming community that not only will they protect the soil of their country, but that they will be committed to make a livelihood at the same time as they are protecting the soil. Then it is worth their while. I am sure the Deputy Minister will then obtain their backing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after the quiet debate which we had this morning, we have now once more experienced the hon. <span class="col_5953-5954" refersTo="page_0124"/>member for South Coast’s tirade. The hon. member for South Coast said that he had serious doubts and that this legislation would fail because of the inadequate instrument for its execution. I merely want to point out that this legislation was drawn up in collaboration with the Agricultural Advisory Board and the Soil Conservation Board. If the hon. member had wanted to take the trouble to read the Soil Conservation Board’s report he would have read about all the bottlenecks that these people are faced with. What is more, this legislation was drawn up in collaboration with the South African Agricultural Union, of which the Natal Agricultural Union is an affiliated member. If it is as he has said, then surely the Natal Agricultural Union is not being faithful to its chief affiliate. He also professed that in the Bantu areas nothing at all was being done for soil conservation. He said that for that reason this legislation would also be a failure. Has he then not read what the Soil Conservation Board had to say about the development in the Bantu areas? On page 28 of its report for the year 1st January, 1967 to December, 1967, the Soil Conservation Board stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The planning of the Bantu areas is the basis on which soil conservation works and the orderly development and utilization of the agricultural resources are carried out. Planning is done for and with the community to enable them to make the maximum use of the resources at their disposal.</block>

<p>In addition it stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bantu areas comprise 13.065 million morgen, of which 6.633 million morgen, that is 50.77 per cent, is planned.</block>

<p>The hon. member now pretends that no planning and nothing at all is being done in connection with the washing away of soil in the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>As a result of the tremendous economic explosion which we have had here in South Africa. Special provision has been made at the universities for the training of extension officers to supplement the shortage. The Department has gone further and appointed part time technicians to help supplement the shortage. Our committee members have been trained. Hon. members will see in the report that we already have 1,858 committee members who have received basic training, and a further 1,000 of these committee members have received advanced training. It is unreasonable to want to put all the blame on the Government for a manpower shortage which is not only being experienced in our Public Service, but throughout the entire country. It was also said here yesterday that the drought conditions in South Africa were one of the causes for the fact that soil conservation works have not progressed. Sir, I want to agree with the hon. member for Nelspruit who implied here that we, as farmers, could do very much more ourselves. I know of several farmers who are so soil conservation conscious that they planned their own farms and carried out their own soil conservation works without having asked the State for assistance. But the hon. member for Nelspruit also added that our farmers could do a great deal more to help the State combat this great evil in South Africa. Sir, I want to quote to you what Mr. C. C. Claassens, director of information and education, said recently when he was opening the North Western Agricultural Union’s congress in Calvinia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Conservation farming is based mainly on the principle of &#x201C;rest the veld&#x201D; and this demands the urgent attention and wholehearted support of every agricultural leader in South Africa. &#x201C;Reserve grazing&#x201D; is the best antidote against drought.</block>

<p>Sir, this must be the basis on which our farmers in South Africa approach this question of soil conservation and conservation farming.</p>

<p>It has also been alleged here that the farmers cannot carry out these conservation works because they are not in a financial position to do so. During the many years in which the Government has been engaged in this, subsidies have constantly been increased: loan facilities were established, etc. The facilities are there for the farmer to make use of, but we find that they do not make the best use of them. Still, I merely want to refer you to the Soil Conservation Board’s tables in connection with the loan scheme, and their remarks about this matter. It is a matter which T myself should like to take up with the hon. the Minister. The Soil Conservation Board’s tables indicate that from 1966 to 1968 the following number of works was approved under the loan scheme: in 1966. 1.092 works were approved, and this decreased to 130 in the year 1967-’68. This was in the Highveld region. The same tendency applies in all the other regions. The value of these approved works was R119,659 in 1966-’67, but in the year 1967-’68, this amount decreased to R16,188. On page 7 the <span class="col_5955-5956" refersTo="page_0125"/>Soil Conservation Board has the following to say about this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It came to the attention of the Board that farmers have raised objections against certain information which had to be given in the application form for a soil conservation loan.</block>

<p>Since this can detrimentally affect the construction of conservation works this matter was taken up with the Department of Agricultural Credit. When revising the form certain questions which met with opposition were omitted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board has further been given the assurance that the Agricultural Credit Board will not apply any means text in considering soil conservation loans.</block>

<p>Apparently it seems as if the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure had deterred farmers from taking loans from the Department. I nevertheless want to request that the hon. the Deputy Minister give serious attention to this matter. It is an urgent necessity, as the Secretary for Agricultural Technical Services also mentioned in his report, that these loan facilities should be just as accessible to farmers as in the past and that this division should also be streamlined.</p>

<p>Sir, we hope that this legislation will shortly come into operation. We hope that it will not be three years before it is streamlined, as the hon. member for South Coast has predicted. We hope and trust that the bottlenecks, which were mentioned in the Soil Conservation Board’s report, will be eliminated. I am convinced that this legislation will mean a great deal for South Africa. Together with the veld reclamation scheme and together with the financial assistance which farmers in South Africa can now obtain, I am convinced that the tempo of works for reclaiming land will increase, and I am convinced that this will help to preserve South Africa for our descendants.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Since we are dealing here with one of the most important Bills which could probably be brought before any Parliament in the world, a Bill dealing with the preservation of our tillable soil and vegetation, upon which our entire existence depends, it would be a good thing if hon. members on the Government side were to understand that although we are casting the searchlight on legislation which now has to replace all other legislation in regard to soil conservation, we are only doing so in an attempt to see what is the best thing that can be done in this connection. Sir, it is no easy thing to introduce a Soil Conservation Act in order to reclaim the soil. In this connection we have a considerable backlog to make up here at the southernmost point of Africa, owing to the fact that our farming industry is only a few centuries old. Our farming industry is not 2000 to 4000 years old as is the case in countries in the northern hemisphere. Those of us who have visited those countries have seen how countries which are overpopulated conserve, fertilize, care for and nurture their fertile soil. The population of those countries runs into millions, and their fertile soil is limited. Here in South Africa it is a horse of a different colour. We have a great deal of land. We have vast expanses, and droughts, overgrazing and many other factors have ruined our fertile soil, and in terms of the figures which the hon. the Minister himself mentioned yesterday to indicate what has already been done in this connection, it is clear to us that we are losing the struggle. Any legislation which is intended to make it easier for us to win the struggle must be welcomed by the entire House.</p>

<p>Sir, everyone in this House, everyone on that side of the House, and everyone on this side of the House, even those who are not farming and who did not come from farms owe, to a very large extent their derivation from mother earth, from the farm. There is not a single member who will not say with the English poet: &#x201C;This is my country, the land that begot me; these windy spaces are surely my own and the people that toil in the sweat of their faces are flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone&#x201D;. This is what we all feel for the soil, and this is how we all feel about its erosion, and that is why, when this legislation is being introduced to replace existing legislation and which is intended to protect our fertile soil, we must see whether we cannot do better.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to be unnecessarily critical. I do not want to say that there are too few officials and too few technicians to carry out the Act. I want to present everything in pose that we have enough officials and enough technicians. It is no use saying that the far- the most favourable light, and I want to supmers must do the work alone. There are in fact many farmers who have done the work alone and who have never asked for assistance in regard to the planning of their farms, and have never asked for subsidies. There are hundreds of farmers like this. But that planning is not in terms of national planning. No farmer, who has planned and executed his own works, without giving attention to the planning on his neighbour’s farm knew whether the work he was doing would fit into the framework of the work which had to be done in that particular region. It is no use every farmer carrying on on his own and undertaking conservation work on his own farm; he must be assisted by technical people who have planned on a regional or national basis. There must be technical people who can say to that farmer: &#x201C;This is the area we are dealing with; this is the potential as far as water and grazing are concerned,&#x201D; and after those works have been planned they must be carried out and inspected.</p>

<p>Sir, I have already stated that I do not even <span class="col_5957-5958" refersTo="page_0126"/>want to go in to the question of whether there are enough people to do this work; there are not enough, but let us suppose that there are. Let us suppose that we will one day reach a stage when there will be enough technicians available; let us suppose that we will one day reach the stage where more planning can be done and where work can be carried out. Let us suppose that we will one day reach the stage where instead of one eight, half of the part of South Africa which we occupy will have been reclaimed to such an extent that we will feel satisfied that we are winning the struggle; then I would still like to ask the pertinent question: In what respect is this legislation so much better than the old legislation that it will encourage the farmer and instil into him more confidence to undertake conservation work? Here we come to the burning question of whether this Bill makes provision for everything we should like to make provision for? Sir, I welcome the fact that powers are being granted to a Minister or to a body if those powers are necessary in order to administer the Act properly. How extensive are the powers which are being entrusted to the Minister in this Bill? Let us glance for a moment at the powers which are being given in terms of clause 3 to an individual, to the Minister. The Minister may, either by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> or by written notice to the owner or occupier of land declare a direction to be applicable with reference to land referred to in such notice, relating to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(n) generally, as to any other matter whether or not connected with any matter referred to in paragraphs (a) to (m) inclusive &#x2026;</block>

<p>As far as I can see just about everything is mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (m)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which he considers necessary or expedient for achieving the object of this Act in respect of land.</block>

<p>Sir, greater powers have never been granted to a Minister. I do not know whether there is any legislation in this country in terms of which a Minister is granted so many powers in regard to the soil on which we live. I have no objection to this. As long as powers are granted to a person, a body or an organization which is able to carry into effect, to ensure that we recover the soil and are able to leave it in a condition which posterity can be proud of, it will be a good thing. But now I wonder, even in this legislation and with these vast powers which we are giving the Minister, whether we have done something to instil in the man who must do the work greater confidence so that he can get on faster with the job? The Minister said the climate was favourable for soil conservation. I do not know what the hon. the Minister put that down to. We have just had a prolonged drought, and the people are still groggy. They are only now beginning to recover. They have not yet solved their economic problems, but supposing next summer is a good summer and the land rehabilitates itself slightly, and the farmer feels like purchasing machinery and carrying on with his soil conservation works, his erosion works and his water conservation works, does he have more confidence in doing so under this legislation than he had before? I find in the legislation that the Soil Conservation Board is being substituted&#x2014;and the Bill states that the Minister may, not that he shall&#x2014;by an advisory soil conservation committee, or a soil conservation advisory committee. Now, think for a moment of other advisory committees which Ministers of Agriculture have already established&#x2014;I am thinking of the Agricultural Research Advisory Committee. I do not know whether the hon. Deputy Minister remembers, but I was a member of that committee. We had such great plans on that committee, because it was a committee that had to furnish advice in regard to agricultural research which had to be carried out, and do you know, Sir, it met twice. It was composed mainly of experts and officials. The S.A. Agricultural Union had representation, as well as other bodies, and it met once and prepared for itself a long agenda according to its terms of reference; it met a second time and then never again. Now the hon. the Minister can tell me that the Soil Conservation Board did not meet very often either, and I must agree, but I do not think it was their fault. But I do not think that any advisory board which is constituted can function better than the Soil Conservation Board did, or otherwise the Minister must tell me in what respect it could perhaps function better? What will the impetus be which will cause it to function better? I want to go further. It has been said that there may even be regional advisory committees. It is the Minister who has to determine whether he will appoint them or not. The legislation mentions district committees. I just want to point out that even in this legislation we are emasculating those district committees, owing to the fact that they have no powers. They may not even bring a charge against a person. They are there on an advisory basis, to advise the Minister. I want to ask the Minister the following: Two former speakers on this side have already indicated what problems they have. The hon. member for South Coast said that he thought his legislation should go to a commission which would go into it and determine what could best be done. I know the S.A. Agricultural Union was consulted, and that all their advice was included in this Bill. They stated what proportion they want on that board, but it has not been defined in the legislation. It states that the Minister may appoint a board; it does not state that he shall appoint one. It is of no use the hon. member for Vryburg saying so. They will consult, yes, in regard to the legislation which has to be established, but I know, and the hon. member for Vryburg also knows, that the S.A. Agricultural Union wants a board to be established on which they will have a <span class="col_5959-5960" refersTo="page_0127"/>proper proportion of representation. But when we say that, we come back to the Soil Conservation Board. And even in this way I do not know whether it will give the necessary impetus to the entire attempt to make it function better. I do not know. If we cannot do something to bring home an awareness of the conservation of that part of mother earth which we have at our disposal, not only to the farmers but also to everybody in this country, and bring it home to them in such a way that we make them so afraid that even they become conservation conscious and will want to share in the national attempt to conserve our portion of mother earth, then I do not know whether we can win through. We have already made so many attempts to do so. We had the Veld Trust, and we had other bodies, but is the population of South Africa soil conscious to the extent people in the northern hemisphere are, where one can hardly travel five paces, by road or by rail, before one sees how the earth has been banked up and built up and terraced and conserved and fertilized in order to conserve it. One can scarcely move without seeing how this is being done. But this is not the case in this country. If we cannot make a positive attempt to make the entire population of South Africa more soil conscious, I do not know whether we will win through. I shall return to that later.</p>

<p>I now want to discuss the problems which the hon. member for South Coast raised, i.e. that as long as the Railways, the provincial administration, the divisional council and Bantu land is excluded from a soil conservation Act, so that one cannot get to them, then I do not know whether we will ever be able to achieve success with this thing. You know, even between farmers in the same area one finds this problem that the one man has carried out soil conservation works or water conservation works, he has embankments built and he has been engaged in doing this for years at his own expense&#x2014;I speak from experience, because this has happened to me already&#x2014; and subsequently there is planning and many works are broken up and a start is made from scratch because in terms of the regional planning they were wrong. And just to the north of you you have a neighbour who has only mountains where nothing can be done as he overgrazes, there are two inches of rain, the water flows from his land and your embankments are done for. This is not the kind of planning we are looking for. There we have experienced problems. The hon. Minister knows that at the outset he had problems because he could not get the best elements on the soil conservation committees because the progressive farmers who could look after themselves did not want to serve on them. The second difficulty was that if you complained about the man who was doing nothing and ruining all your works, they said: Yes, but Oom Piet is on the church council and lives in the town, while his son is eking out an existence on the farm, and we cannot bring a charge against the man now because he is overgrazing his veld. That is the kind of problem one experiences in regard to things of this kind. I want to put it like this. We welcome this new legislation and we hope that it is an attempt in the right direction, but we must throw the spotlight on those things which we still regard as weak links, which can be improved. I think the legislation can be greatly improved, if instead of merely giving the powers into the hands of one man, the Minister, an appeal board were established. Otherwise, when an appeal is made, it returns to the same people who undertook the planning in the first instance, and if I want to appeal against something which happened to me and I appeal to the Minister then it goes back to the same people who planned my works in the first instance.</p>

<p>In my opinion this is not a court of appeal. It is not a body one can go to. I want to recommend very strongly to the Minister that the establishment of an arbitration court, a statutory body, be borne in mind. I am less concerned about whether the Minister appoints it or whether the Judges appoint it, or who appoints, but there must be an arbitration body which the individual or the undertaking can approach and say: Something is not being done here which should be done, or in this instance I object to what is being done, and then let the arbitrators decide. And it must be a statutory body, so that it can even be binding on the person who has to administer the law, and on other bodies as well, because I have by this time mentioned all the bodies. I am aware of the problems in introducing legislation which will also have a bearing on the other departments which I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>This is a colossal undertaking but if we cannot get past it, we can never make a success of this legislation and solve the soil conservation problems in this country. It will not be possible. We will simply continue to do patchwork and the footpaths will be trodden out and the water will come down and the dams will silt up and things will continue as they have always done, no matter how hard we try. For years I lived near Tarka, and I know what happened there, how many works had to be carried out at State expense, further and further up along the Vlekpoort, to try and prevent the soil from washing down and silting up the Lake Arthur dam; the dam wall was raised, but this was mere patchwork; there is nothing permanent if one does not have the powers to prescribe to all these bodies. And when the Minister has all his prescriptions and is the only judge to say whether a thing is right or wrong, then I as a farmer feel concerned. Then I as a farmer feel that I would like to put in a plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister and tell him that if he does not see his way clear to referring this Bill, even at this late stage, to a commission, they should go into this aspect which we have now mentioned here thoroughly, because it will be <span class="col_5961-5962" refersTo="page_0128"/>so difficult for the legislation to operate if there are so many factions and departments under it. Then he must give further consideration to whether it is not worth while to accept the second suggestion which we will make subsequently in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I do not want to discuss this matter much longer, because there are many speakers who want to speak after me, but I want to make a special appeal to the Minister and to all the hon. members on that side of the House. Goodness knows, this side of the House is not after political gain; there is no political gain in criticizing what happens to the soil for any Party. The hon. members opposite can rise and abuse us so much that the ocean will not wash us clean, but we must all live from the soil and look after it. I want to make an appeal to both sides of the House to the effect that we should approach this matter with a view to what is the best thing to do for our Mother Earth, and perhaps we can then find something which is better than we have at present.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I listened carefully to what the hon. member for East London (City) had to say. His first complaint was that the progress we were making with soil conservation works was too slow. I want to remind him&#x2014;and he ought to know this&#x2014;that we are making good progress under the circumstances if we take into account the vast expanses of our country and the devastating droughts which sometimes afflict our soil for years on end, and if we take into account the topographical situation of our country, with its mountains and its rapid downflow of water. In view of all this, we have really made good progress. Ours is not a small country; it is an extended area in which soil conservation has to be generally applied. I want to congratulate the officials whose never-ceasing task it is on the progress which they have already made in this connection.</p>

<p>I would just like to dwell on one other point the hon. member raised, which is his complaint against the fact that the Minister will now have more powers and that it will be possible for his actions to become too autocratic. But immediately after making that remark he contradicted himself when he said that he had no objection to this, provided the Minister had the machinery and the people to carry out the works. In that respect he is correct, we need more. I like this soil conservation legislation for another reason, and that is because for the first time in this country mining is now being involved, through legislation, in soil conservation. The sphere of contact between agriculture and mining has for many years been a favourite topic of mine, and for the first time now this Bill provides that mining will also be involved in regard to responsibility towards soil conservation, soil protection, soil rehabilitation, etc. This was not always the case. For many years, outside and inside this House, I have been advocating that this deficiency in our legislation should be eliminated. Since this Bill is now making provision for that, I am truly grateful and I should like to have it placed on record that I take cognizance of this in the same spirit. I know that farm owners on whose land mining activities are being carried on will welcome the specific provisions of the Act. Previously our soil conservation land and prescriptions only applied to the farm owner. The owner himself was responsible for the conservation of the soil and the maintenance of State conservation works. The title holders of the subterranean rights, the mine developers and companies, had the right to occupy the soil, to penetrate it and to remove the mineral ores and wealth from the soil for its own purposes without any specific statutory provision or regulations in respect of soil conservation responsibilities being applicable to them. They were able to proceed with their work according to their own discretion and as they saw fit. These people were able to use and even destroy the soil without being held responsible for the restoration of that soil which they had destroyed for the purpose of its activities. This state of affairs weakened the soil conservation idea in the sphere of contact between the agricultural and the mining industry and caused much friction and dissatisfaction among farm owners. We were faced with this problem in many districts where mining activities are taking place. The equilibrium of responsibility was disturbed. The one party was exempted and the other party was held solely responsible. The cessionary, whether he had obtained that right by means of a contract, of whether he had retained that right by means of a deed bestowing underground proprietary rights upon him, has always gone scot-free, and there was no legislation which applied to him. Now I interpret the provisions of this Bill and of certain clauses which I shall mention in a moment in this way that it will apply to the mining company, the concessionary and mine developer, as well as the farm owner. I am very grateful for this. I take it that the notice and the farm plan can now be served on the developer as well. I read this in the first section of clause 3 (1) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, either by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> or by written notice to the owner or occupier of land referred to in such notice, declare a direction to be applicable with reference to land referred in such notice, relating to&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the cultivation of land, including the ploughing thereof, the protection, stabilizing or temporary withdrawal of the land from cultivation &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>I also want to read what the definition of a land occupier or an occupier of land is, according to clause 1 (vii). This paragraph reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;land occupier&#x201D; or &#x201C;occupier of land&#x201D; means any person who as owner, lessee or other <span class="col_5963-5964" refersTo="page_0129"/>wise has the management, charge, control or use of any land &#x2026; any person who carries on prospecting or mining activities on any land &#x2026;</block>

<p>According to the definition &#x201C;land occupier&#x201D; therefore also means a person who is carrying on prospecting or mining activities on land. This is one of the most important aspects of the Bill which I welcome. It means that the developer will be responsible for the preservation, repair and maintenance of works connected with his activities while he is doing so, and particularly when he ceases his activities and must vacate that farm and has to restore it to a condition required by soil conservation authorities. A farmer is held equally responsible when he allows his veld to become trampled. He must then withdraw his stock from parts of that pasturage so that it can rehabilitate. If ploughed land should wash away, farmers are also held responsible; they are required, with State aid, to carry out the necessary restoration, and to maintain it.</p>

<p>Closer co-operation between mine developers and farm owners should now be possible with the provisions of this Bill. The success of the implementation of the various provisions will depend on the degree of understanding and co-operation from both parties. I assume that the mining entrepreneur and the farm owner will now be brought together by this measure for the first time. They will be able to negotiate and plan together. They will be able to approach, carry out and apply the soil conservation plans for that specific farm, district or region on a joint basis. I assume that they will submit their differences in regard to the application of conservation plans to the soil conservation advisory committee. If this committee should be unable to find a solution, it will be referred to the Minister who will then have the final say.</p>

<p>I am fully aware that the provisions of section 3 (1) (n) will make the application of the Act in regard to a mine developer subject to the approval of the hon. the Minister of Mines as well. In this clause it is provided that all prescriptions which will apply to the developer in respect of soil planning must also be submitted to the Minister of Mines. Personally I find it a pity that the Bill contains this provision. Not that I have any doubts in regard to the goodwill and sympathetic approach of the Minister of Mines, but in this way the officials of the Department of Mines who will advise the Minister of Mines in this connection still retain a measure of discretionary power. In my opinion it affects the fundamentals of soil conservation in regard which agriculture and agriculture alone should have the last word. However, the provisions in question constitute such a major improvement and progress that I do not want to dwell any further on them or raise any objection to them. It testifies to greater understanding on both sides, i.e. on the part of mining organizations as well as agricultural organizations, as far as common responsibility towards the soil is concerned. I want to assure the hon. the Deputy Minister and his officials of my sincere gratitude and appreciation for their share in the insertion in this Bill of the specific provisions to which I referred. I can only hope that in consultation with the Minister of Mines all the necessary steps will be taken to curb the irregularities which existed in the past, and that it will be ensured that mine developers and concessionaries will in future make their contribution to the conservation of our soil as well. I hope and trust that in this connection there will be the greatest measure of co-operation between agriculture and mining, which will be to the benefit of the conservation of our precious soil in the future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I will be grateful if the hon. member for Marico, who has just sat down, will excuse me if I do not follow the point which he has raised. He was making a very valid point in connection with the application of the Soil Conservation Bill in respect of the mining industry and I think it is something which we on this side of the House also welcome.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Bill we are considering to-day, namely to consolidate and amend the law relating to the combating and prevention of soil erosion in our country, is a very important measure indeed. It might well be the most important measure this House has been called upon to deal with this Session. I think the young Deputy Minister in dealing with this Bill has taken on himself a tremendous responsibility.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House think that the responsibilities which are entrusted to him are perhaps too great. I am not in any way belitting the ability of the hon. the Deputy Minister, but we feel that this Bill confers too great a responsibility upon one Minister. For that reason I hope that during the Committee Stage, some of the points raised by the hon. member for Newton Park will be seriously taken into account so that, when we have finished with this Bill, we shall have a better measure than the one we have before us this evening.</p>

<p>Every sector of our community is vitally interested in the steps which the Government is taking to-day to safeguard our soil. I think the point has been made often enough that we in this country can afford to mine our gold, our diamonds, our asbestos and our other mineral riches, but one thing we cannot afford to mine is our soil. Nobody is to blame for this, but I think that, in the years gone by, there has possibly been an element which has been mining our soil. The time has come for that situation to be brought to an end. The wide publicity the subject of soil conservation and soil erosion has enjoyed in our country has. I think, made the whole nation aware of the need to tackle this problem on a national basis. Soil conservation is a national responsibility. In the same way as the defence of our <span class="col_5965-5966" refersTo="page_0130"/>country is a national responsibility, so the defence of our soil must also be looked upon as a national responsibility. I think it is quite right for the State to have decided to amend the legislation we had on the Statute Book, dealing with this particular problem. I think it is quite right that they have decided to bring it up to date and to create a more effective machinery to deal with the problems we are facing. As in the case of our water, where far-reaching legislation has been introduced to preserve our water supplies and to control the usage of water, it is also imperative that we have legislation on our Statute Book that seeks to control not only the preservation of our soil, but also its proper usage. I think that one factor we often neglect when discussing soil conservation, is that we do not always insist upon the proper usage of our soil. Very often we find cases of ploughs being used where a plough should never have been used. I think the plough has probably been responsible for creating more problems in regard to soil erosion than any other instrument.</p>

<p>I say that this is a national problem in which the whole nation must play a part, because I think it is an entirely erroneous concept which many people have, especially some of our friends in the cities, that the farmer is the sole guardian of our soil. The soil erosion problems with which many farmers are to-day confronted, must surely not be blamed on them. This question of soil erosion arises as a result of the cumulative effect of malpractices which have taken place over the centuries. I believe it is hardly fair to expect the present generation of farmers to be responsible for combating the results of practices which took place in years gone by. On my own farm, for instance, some of the very worst cases of soil erosion were caused by the transport waggons that passed along that way in the previous century, taking goods to Kimberley and to Johannesburg. These waggons, drawn by long teams of oxen, and passing over uncontrolled tracks, created what to-day are some of the most serious dongas on my farm. Not only did the tracks of these waggons create dongas eventually, but the thousands of head of oxen, which had to be provided with grazing on the mountain slopes and in the vleis, caused a serious deterioration of the veld. It seems to me that, in our approach to the farmer, it is unfair to expect him to take measures to-day to control soil erosion caused by factors over which he had no control. It is for this very reason that I say that we have to look upon this as a national problem. It is a problem which demands national intervention in order to bring it under control.</p>

<p>In the light of these facts and when one thinks of all the problems brought about by soil erosion, we on this side of the House are justified in saying that this Bill has come as a bit of an anti-climax. There appears to have been a considerable amount of consultation with the South African Agricultural Union, but we are concerned became some of the recommendations which that union made, have not been incorporated in this Bill. We are concerned because all the powers are vested in the Minister. The main objectives of this Bill, as I read it, appear to be to vest in the Minister all the powers to decide upon the directives to be issued to the various farmers as to what methods they should apply on their particular farms. He also has the power to penalize or to prosecute farmers when they fail to carry out the directives which have been issued to them. We on this side of the House would, I think, be far happier if there were a statutory board, an umbrella organization, to take control of this particular situation. In the administration of this Bill, the Minister becomes the kingpin in the whole set-up. He becomes a presidential cog that has to take nearly all the decisions. I feel that it is asking too much of one man to shoulder all that responsibility. There is no doubt that ultimately when the effects of this Bill come to be judged, what we will really be judging will be the ability of the Minister to cope with the powers which he has now taken. Whether this Bill succeeds or not, will, I think, depend to a large extent upon the ability of the Minister to apply effectively the machinery he has here brought into being. I do not think that he has provided sufficiently for the co-operation, advice and help of other organizations he might well have made use of and other machinery he might well have created to assist him in this tremendous task. But in this respect, Sir, I think that we on this side of the House welcome very much the statement the hon. the Deputy Minister made during his Second Reading speech yesterday, namely that he has decided to re-establish a separate department of soil conservation. This was a separate division of soil conservation. This was a division that was functioning before. It was done away with but has since been re-established. I think this is, in fact, a very wise move. It places in the hands of the Minister possibly an effective machine with which to assist him in carrying out the provisions of this Bill. But I have no doubt that he will find that he will have to build this division into a very strong department and that he will have to ensure that this department is not starved of personnel. What is more, he will have to see that this department is given the right type of personnel to carry out the provisions that are laid down in the Bill before us.</p>

<p>I also welcome the hon. the Deputy Minister’s statement that the policy of his Department is to be based on guidance, assistance and advice and that prosecutions under the powers that he is taking in this Bill will only be resorted to in the very last instance. One cannot help being concerned about the fact that in dealing with legislation of this kind too much emphasis is possibly being placed upon prosecutions whereas in fact what one really wants to do is to ensure the co-operation of the farming community as a whole. I should say that in this connection one cannot emphasize <span class="col_5967-5968" refersTo="page_0131"/>too strongly the very vital role of the extension officers, which they are called upon to play in the arrangements which we are making under this legislation. What concerns me, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that in the past there has been a shortage of extension officers. I have made a speech before in this House emphasizing the important role the extension officer has to play. He is the direct link between the Minister and the farmer. He is the adviser to the Minister. I think the day has come that we have to look upon the extension officer as one of the most important officials in the whole Department of Agriculture. I believe that we will have to recognize that his status has to be raised in the whole structure of the Department of Agriculture. He is the man that should be held in the very highest regard at all times by the farmer, because ultimately, in terms of this legislation, he will be responsible for the implementation of the measures contained in this Bill. I do not in any way want to belittle the efforts of the extension officers that we have had in South Africa. I think they have done a tremendous job under tremendously difficult circumstances. Often their field of function was undefined. They were overloaded with much work that could be described as red tape. They were not able to get their teeth into the kind of work that had to be done on the farms in co-operation with the farmer. When we speak of the extension officer, I think it is most important to emphasize&#x2014;and I think one cannot emphasize it too strongly&#x2014;that the hon. the Deputy Minister will have to see that if he wants to make a success of this legislation he has a sufficiency of extension officers. They will have to be the right type of person. Their qualifications will have to be of the highest order for the farmers with whom they have to deal to have confidence in their advice. T should like to emphasize that this post must be developed into the most sought after in the whole of the departmental structure. They could have a senior status and be vested with very considerable authority.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, this brings me to another point. I think it is the most important point that I would like to make in my speech here this evening. I often ask myself, when dealing with soil conservation in this country, whether in the past we did not place too much emphasis on the bad side of farming, whether by the very institution of a system of subsidies that we have we have not made of our soil conservation legislation merely a medium for the payment of subsidies and loans to do certain work. There is no doubt in my mind that it is the indifferent farmer, the farmer who has not cared for his land, who has neglected it, who is placed in the best position to get the greatest benefit from these subsidies and cheap loans. As against that, the farmer, who has consistently looked after his land by seeing to fencing, to waterworks, to erosion works, and whose general farm management is of the highest order, he is the man who stands to gain only very little from the subsidy system. Nowhere in this Bill is good farming emphasized; nowhere is machinery created for assisting the farmer who has done his best to preserve his land. I think he is the one to whom the hon. the Deputy Minister must direct his attention. He is the one that must be encouraged. He is probably the one deserving of more assistance than those who have tended to neglect their soil. There are many ways that this can be done. The one thought which I want to leave with the hon. the Deputy Minister is that when in the future they decide which farmers shall get assistance during periods of drought and difficulties that it must be the good farmer, the one that has qualified by virtue of the excellence of his farming, who should be most readily assisted.</p>

<p>If we really want to get the idea of soil conservation amongst our farming community to take root, then we will have to institute a system whereby the farmer who is making the greatest effort and who has his farming on a sound conservation basis is backed with all the help that we can give him. There is another point I wish to emphasize. If we can get the farmers to realize that those who are neglecting their farms are the ones that are going to suffer the most during droughts and other periods of privation and that they are the ones that the Government is least keen to assist, then you are going to get the bad farmer to change his system. He will then realize, without being forced or prosecuted, that the way to succeed and the way to get assistance is to put his farming on to a sound basis.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister quoted figures in connection with the money spent by the Government on soil conservation He gave me the impression that he felt that the Government has done more than its duty in this <span class="col_5969-5970" refersTo="page_0132"/>particular respect. Now, I emphasized earlier that soil conservation is a national problem. I do not believe for one moment that in the years gone by, the State itself has spent anything like enough money on the control of soil erosion. It is all very well to quote the amount of money which has been given for subsidies and loans, most of which has to be repaid, but I say the time has come where we have got to have a dynamic approach to this whole question of soil conservation in South Africa. I want to quote an example where the State and the Provincial Councils have had a dynamic approach to a particular matter, namely the construction of our national roads.</p>

<p>Look what progress has been made in that particular respect! Look what a fine network of roads we have throughout this country. I think we are the envy of many other countries. The reason why we have achieved this is because we set out with an objective in view and because we decided that we would not stint when it comes to the expenditure of money. The result now speaks for itself. I believe that in exactly the same way we have to tackle the question of soil conservation in South Africa. We have to be determined now that the State must be prepared to spend in order to save at a later date. This is surely a question of a stitch in time saves nine. Every day we wait to get this matter under control, the more it is going to cost us at a later date. I feel that the hon. the Deputy Minister must think again when he says that he feels that the State is making a sufficient contribution in respect of financing soil conservation measures in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to inform the hon. member for Newton Park and the other speakers on the Opposition side that I respect their approach; I respect their approach to wit that this matter is so important that it is not a political matter and that they are going to support the amending legislation because it is to the benefit of the conservation of our soil. Now, the hon. members have raised a few problems. The first is, what becomes of the existing committees, and what are their functions. I want to inform the hon. members that their functions remain the same while only two aspects have been removed. The first is that they will no longer be responsible for prosecution and that for reasons as mentioned by the hon. member for East London (City). The other privilege they are being deprived of is that they will no longer undertake the drawing up of farm and district plans. However, we need these committees as much as we did in the past. The hon. members on the opposite side feel uneasy in regard to the appointment of these people. On the other hand, however, the hon. members say that we have too few extension officers and that we do not have enough officials to whom this tremendous task has been entrusted. Are hon. members aware that in order to appoint soil conservation committees in some areas, four meetings are required and then there is still no quorum.</p>

<p>There are 816 committees which were initially appointed, and when the terms of service of those people had elapsed, and others had to be appointed, it was an extremely difficult matter to get the people so far as to attend an election. I am not talking in general, I am talking about many of the committees who are not motivated and not inspired in regard to soil conservation. The hon. members may be inclined to think of those outstanding committees. During the discussion of the Agricultural Vote, I referred to the outstanding soil conservation committee at Ixopo. I would just like to see what Minister would be so stupid as not to ask that committee to carry on with its work exactly as it was doing. How are these committees constituted? They are constituted by popular vote. You as practical farmer have had this experience, that when a member is elected, the voters adopt the attitude: He is in fact a member of the co-operative board of management. He is in fact a popular deacon or elder; we may as well elect him to the soil conservation committee. And he does nothing to conserve the soil.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when business was interrupted we were dealing with the anxiety which may arise in the minds of the United Party owing to the fact that the election of committees will now fall away, and may lead to dissatisfaction. I mentioned to you the reasons why the committees are no longer being elected, but I want to mention one further reason: The vast majority of committees that served in the past did their work faithfully, but we found that many of the committees that were elected by popular vote were not prepared to act objectively. But when the people serving on such a committee are appointed from a list of names submitted to us by the Department and by the agricultural unions, people who are soil conservation conscious, they will function better.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park mentioned the shortage of officials. We admit that we do not have the necessary extension officers and that we must fall back on the assistance <span class="col_5971-5972" refersTo="page_0133"/>we can get from these committees. But now the committees are going to get a great deal more work done because they no longer have to draw up the particular district plans. It will not even be necessary to waste time by drawing up individual farm plans. Hon. members also wanted to know how payments are going to take place if the work is not done according to a farm plan. But this is not going to be done; the work is done strictly in accordance with the farm plan and schedule.</p>

<p>Prescriptions are served by the Department on the district concerned, on the magisterial district or the specific area. Sir, the Opposition is missing the fundamental point in regard to this Bill which is as follows: We want to make this Act streamlined. We want to have this work done far more rapidly than was the case in the past. What happened in the past? The officers and the committee drew up the farmer’s plan and the work was done. When the farmer wanted the subsidy on a fence he was going to put up or a dam he was going to build, those officials had to be sent to the farm to carry out inspections in order to find out whether the work had been done. Hon. members know how much time this takes, and I admit that we do not have enough officials to do this. But how is it going to work now? Our whole purpose with this measure is that of streamlining it. The work which was initially approved is now carried out and the farmer then submits a sworn statement in which he declares that the work has been done, and then he is paid.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the inspection can take place at any time after that. I was present in this House before when that hon. member asked how we should go to work in such a work as to avoid delays; he asked that all the red tape he mentioned here should be eliminated, and that is precisely the whole purpose here. We are now taking the man’s word and we say to him: &#x201C;You have made a sworn statement to the effect that you have put up that fence, and here is your money.&#x201D; The inspection comes afterwards. There will be inspections, sometimes 25 per cent of a district, sometimes more and sometimes less; we are only going to make random inspections. We will soon realize what farmers want to apply soil conservation, and what farmers do not. But the hon. member must remember that the farmer pays 45 per cent of the costs of the erection of that fence himself. The man who pays 45 per cent of the costs of a fence will not allow that fence to be flattened deliberately. Suppose the inspection has been held, the man has already been paid out, and the fence is subsequently flattened. We do not have the officials to keep on seeing whether the fence is still standing or whether the cement dam is still being maintained. If that does not happen, then the farmer himself loses 45 per cent of the cost paid by him. Sir, let us lose a half-million rand; let us lose a half-million rand; what of it? We want to get the work done. We want the work to proceed. That is what the hon. member for Salt River said.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park would like to have arbitration. Sir, there is not another Minister in the Cabinet who is subject to so much control as is the Minister of Agriculture. There are the various farmer’s associations; there are the various provincial agricultural unions; there is the South African Agricultural Union; there are all the growers’ associations, the wool growers’ association, the mealie growers’ associations, etc.; they can all come to the Minister with critical eyes. He dare not make a mistake, and in addition to that he must eventually report here in Parliament on what he has done with the powers entrusted to him. No. the hon. member must not be so keen on arbitration, because it is not possible to take advantage of any of these powers.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member is asking that the soil conservation advisory council Should be mentioned in this Act. Sir, if that were to be done, all the departments would have to be consulted in regard to the appointment of such an advisory board. Hon. members themselves know how it can be appointed.

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, one is not going to ignore them, but these are all things which are going to cause further delays again. Sir, hon. members on the opposite side who have participated in this debate are all practical farmers, and they know how practical farmers feel about things of this kind.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Nelspruit, and I want to give him full marks for one thing he said, namely: Must we always, when we speak of soil conservation, place the entire onus on the Department of Agricultural Technical Services; with the view to the shortage of extension officers in this country, must the farmer, when he wants to put up a fence or build a dam across a stream, get a technically trained man to help him? As a practical farmer I know precisely where I want to put up a fence on my farm. That is where we make the mistake. I think the hon. member for Walmer would agree with me when I say that one no longer finds the farmer who says: &#x201C;Give me a sextant and I shall measure how high this dam should be built or this is how this canal should be made.&#x201D; You do not get enough farmers who could do this. You find more and more of them who adopt the attitude: &#x201C;I shall make the farm available to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services; they must send out an extension officer to me.&#x201D; That is the wrong approach. I then come to the hon. member for South Coast. I agree with him. He began by asking whether there was still that enthusiasm among our people to want, of their own accord, to leave this heritage of a farm free of washaways to their children. There I agree with him, but he had a specific problem, which is the situation in Natal. We cannot draw Bantu Administration into this legislation. My feeling is that we should have lumped the whole lot together and stated that we are conserving the soil of South Africa in this Bill, but we must be realistic. [Interjections.] Before we want to plan the Bantu areas for them, we must be able to say with a clear conscience: &#x201C;Come and look at what the white area looks like.&#x201D; Only then will we be able to say to them that we want to help them. Let us first sweep in front of our own door.</p>

<p>I should like to say to the hon. member for Vryburg that, since he mentioned that problems may arise in cases where a man has a loan from agricultural credit and Land Tenure, we should, with the conservation of the soil never consider a man’s financial ability; no means test must be applied. I assure the hon. member that if the payment of a subsidy here is justified, then we do not consider whether that man has a loan with Agricultural Credit or not.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member for East London (City), apart from the fact that he stated that the Minister is being granted a good deal of power, made the statement that we should put a scare into them. Our approach is not to put a scare into a farmer with this legislation. Our approach is not to tell him that we now have powers, exercised by an inspectorate to prosecute and put him in jail, because then this legislation would be doomed from the start. We want him to state from inner conviction that he wants to farm in such a way that his offspring can carry on farming as their father did before them. We do not want to threaten, but there will be obstinate people whom you will have to take by the neck and say: &#x201C;Now you will just have to apply conservation.&#x201D; This will ultimately have to happen.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Marico has an exceptional problem in regard to mines. I respect his opinion on that point and he will have to take it up with the Department of Mines. Now, lastly, I want to come to the hon. member for Walmer. He also stated that the Minister was receiving too many powers, but I think he was perhaps instructed to do so. But he agreed that the extension officers had insufficient time to do the basic work for which they had been trained, and I also think so. There are hon. members here who adopt the attitude that the extension officer is a man who puts up fences, but that is not what he was trained for, he was trained for much more important work. He also stated that we are inclined to emphasize the darker side of agriculture here. Sir, that is correct. We forget about those men who have been applying soil conservation efficiently of their own accord, and many of our farmers have never asked for a cent from the State in order to put up a fence. I am not saying this with contempt for those who have in fact asked for assistance, but we should, now and again as the hon. member for Walmer has done, thank those farmers who have put their hands into their own pockets and paid the account themselves; I want to thank the hon. member for Walmer for doing so. In addition he stated that there were many farmers who will only apply soil conservation with one purpose, namely that of obtaining a subsidy. We cannot argue: there are such cases. It is not out of conviction that he wants to apply soil conservation and put up paddock fences or build a dam; it is for that 55 per cent and more subsidy which he can get. It is for that reason that he wants to apply conservation and this is not the purpose. But I am not condemning those people. I am merely saying that what the hon. member for Walmer said must not be allowed to pass without comment. He also stated that in my Second Reading speech I implied that the state was doing enough. But in a country such as ours the State can never do enough to conserve our soil. I will never create the impression that I feel that the State is doing enough. Up to now we have been working under an Act which I admit was introduced by that side of the House in 1946&#x2014;and it was a fine Act for its time, but we have now reached the stage where the Act must be adjusted: in those years the State did its duty and contributed its share, <span class="col_5975-5976" refersTo="page_0135"/>and in the future it will do even more. He then stated that the most inefficient farmer is the farmer who receives the most assistance. Perhaps that is putting it too strongly. I am not in full agreement with that. But there are many of the farmers who are receiving a great deal of assistance because, initially, they did not apply conservation, and it is our duty, by means of these committees, which I want to state once again we deem desirable for the purpose of assisting us in the implementation of this legislation, a piece of legislation which has no ulterior motives, a piece of legislation with but one purpose, as the hon. member for South Coast and other members on this side stated, to conserve our soil&#x2014;those committees are going to help us to get these things done. Ultimately I believe that even if it should take a long time, we will fair better under this legislation than we did under the former Act.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>It is not necessary for me to furnish a detailed explanation of this measure. We are all aware of the danger, mainly of an economic nature, which weeds constitute for our country and although we have had considerable success so far, control may by no means be relaxed. With modern means of transport weeds spread much more quickly and over longer distances than was the case when the principal Act was placed on the Statute Book in 1937. Thus fodder is transported on a country-wide basis in drought conditions such as we have just experienced, and it has therefore become necessary also to gain control in regard to weeds which can spread in this way. Existing legislation only provides that seed shall not be contaminated by or mixed with any particular weed, and therefore it is not logical to allow any &#x201C;material&#x201D;, as defined, which can contain weeds, to continue to spread without exercising any control and consequently thwart the efforts to combat weeds, which has cost the State alone millions of rands.</p>

<p>The control will be exercised judiciously, causing as little disruption as possible. We particularly have in mind areas where weeds such as satan’s bush and dodder are found, and hay, fodder, etc., which come from those farms will of necessity have to be subject to certain control measures. It will therefore be in the interests of the farmers themselves to control the proclaimed weeds as far as possible and so to assist in preventing weeds which are found in certain areas, from spreading to other parts of the country.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since cases are continually found of persons selling seeds of weeds as ornaments or putting up for sale by the roadside the fruits of weeds, such as blackberries and prickly pears, thereby causing it to spread, it has also become necessary to extend the penalties contained in section 9 of the Act.</p>

We are particularly pleased that persons who are packing fodder and who are likely to spread dangerous seeds, such as satan’s bush seed as well as dodder, in that material, are also being restrained. Apparently it is already known that the State has spent almost R100,000 so far in combating this weed, statan’s bush, which unfortunately has been spread mainly in the Graaff Reinet area.

This weed has been spread mainly by persons selling fodder, particularly over the past three years since the beginning of the drought. The power which is now being granted to the hon. the Minister so that he may also include &#x201C;material&#x201D; in the definition, will help to prevent this seed from spreading any further.</p>

<p>As regards clause 2 in terms of which nobody may sell prickly pear plants, other noxious seed or any portion of any weed without the consent of the hon. the Minister, we want to tell him that the amendment introduced here is also an extremely good one. So many people are growing these plants in gardens and even indoors, without realizing that they are very noxious weeds. However, I also want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that he should be very careful in what he says about the prickly pear. There are certain <span class="col_5977-5978" refersTo="page_0136"/>varieties of the prickly pear species which we should not like to see classified under this definition. There is, for example, the blue-leaf prickly pear, the Schoeman prickly pear, etc. [Interjections.] These are excellent prickly pears. The main reason why they are good prickly pears is that they do not have any thorns. They make excellent fodder. The hon. the Minister should be very careful not to prevent, under this particular provision, the Schoeman prickly pear from being sold throughout South Africa.</p>

<p>Clause 3 is merely a definition of material. I have no cause to say anything about it, since it has already been incorporated in clause 1. We therefore agree with the changes the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to effect.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill now be read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The purpose of the Bill is to erect a minor amendment to each of two Acts administered by the Financial Institutions Office, namely the Pension Funds Act and the Banks Act.</p>

<p>In terms of an amendment to the Pension Funds Act effected in 1966, every pension fund is required to hold at least 10 per cent of the value of its total assets in Government stock. A fund which did not comply with the requirement when the amendment came into operation, had to invest annually in Government stock at least 20 per cent of the net increase in its aggregate assets during that year and should comply fully with the 10 per cent requirement not later than the end of 1971. Representations have recently been made on behalf of local authorities and pension funds of local authorities that such funds should be relieved of the obligation to hold a portion of their assets in the form of Government stock.</p>

<p>Like the Government, local authorities also provide essential services to the public for which they need loan capital. An important source of loan capital for local authorities is the local authority pension funds, to which the local authorities, as employers, also contribute substantial amounts. In the past most of these pension funds invested practically all their funds with local authorities. In order to comply with the requirement of a 10 per cent investment in Government stock these pension funds will now have to invest the bulk of their available funds in Government stock for a few years. They will, therefore, be unable to give any appreciable support to local authorities. Local authorities will experience difficulties to obtain the loan capital which they previously obtained from these pension funds from other sources. Having regard to all the circumstances and especially to the functions performed by local authorities, it is considered that there are good grounds for differentiating between pension funds of local authorities and other pension funds in so far as compulsory investment in Government stock is concerned. It is proposed, therefore, that pension funds of local authorities be exempted from the requirement to hold a percentage of their assets in the form of Government stock on condition that such a fund holds at least 90 per cent of the value of its total assets in the public sector. This arrangement in fact merely restores the old <i>status quo</i> and is acceptable to the parties concerned.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment to the Banks Act as set out in clause 2 of the Bill will make it possible for banking institutions to appoint to their boards of directors, executive officers who possess specialized knowledge of the management of the institutions. This is the modern approach. In order to ensure that the composition of the board of directors is balanced, the number of executive officers who may serve simultaneously on a board is limited to one third of the total number of directors. A similar concession was granted to building societies in 1968.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support the Second Reading of this Bill. It is an amending Bill and is an essential administrative measure. However, regarding clause 1, where the Minister refers to the investment of pension funds in local authorities, I hope the Minister will not lose sight of the fact that there might be a danger where the local authority pension funds invested their funds in their own local authority. It will not be a problem with the big local authorities, but in a small local authority if the pension funds were invested solely in the local authority appertaining to the pension funds, there might be a risk if there are funds which are not properly looked after. I know it is a remote risk, but there is that possibility. On the other hand, I do not think we should object to the suggestion made by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I do think, however, that this is a matter which should have the hon. the Deputy Minister’s attention, because there is a risk, particularly in a remote township that there might be a tendency to invest the whole of the pension funds in the local authority and at some future time they may find their pension fund in some difficulty. We know it is a practice with companies that no company is allowed to invest its pension funds in the stock of the company concerned. A certain proportion of the pension funds of a company must always be invested outside the company for obvious reasons. There is this possible risk as far as local authorities are concerned.</p>

<p>The second clause, referring to the directorship of banks, I think is a welcome step. There is no reason why the senior staff should <span class="col_5979-5980" refersTo="page_0137"/>not be elected to the boards of the banks. On the other hand, I think the hon. the Minister is quite right in limiting it to one third, because it would not be advisable to have the whole of the bank policy controlled by the staff. Equally, if there was no member of the bank staff on the bank board, there is the possibility of the board becoming too remote from reality. I think it is a welcome step. As the Minister said, it has been allowed in the past in building societies. We support the suggestion.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in reply to the hon. member for Pinetown, I can only say that clause 1 of the Bill states that the pension funds under discussion must at least invest 90 per cent of their total assets in assets of the type specified in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of the main Act. Paragraph (c) of the main Act reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Bills, bonds or securities issued or guaranteed by the Government of the Union or of a provincial administration.</block>

<p>Paragraph (d) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Bills, bonds or securities issued or guaranteed or deposits by any local authority in the Union authorized by law to levy rates upon immovable property.</block>

<p>Lastly, paragraph (e) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Bills, bonds or securities issued or guaranteed by the Rand Water Board or the Electricity Supply Commission or by any institution which is, in the opinion of the registrar, financially sound and which has been approved by him.</block>

<p>I appreciate the point the hon. member has raised here. I am of the opinion that in terms of these three subsections of this legislation it would be possible for a local authority to invest 90 per cent of its pension funds in its own loan requirements. However, I will look into this matter. If there is any real substance in what the hon. member has said, I will give attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p><i>Object of legislation:</i></p>

<p>The main object in introducing this measure is to provide for radio listeners’ licences to expire on a common date every year, which will permit of an envisaged new system for the control of such licences to be introduced.</p>

<p><i>Present system of licensing:</i></p>

<p>As the Act reads at the moment, every listener’s licence expires every year on the date on which that licence was taken out for the first time. The system whereby control is at present being exercised over the collection of licence moneys, consists, firstly, in a register being kept of every licence holder by the Post Office. Renewal notices are sent every year to the listeners at the addresses which appear in the registers, and the date on which each licence was renewed is recorded in the registers. Secondly, under this system radio licence inspectors pay house to house visits so as to ask persons who possess radios to produce their licences. Those who do not have licences, are then requested to take out licences and their names and addresses are recorded in the registers. Finally, under the existing system radio dealers in selling radios insist on radio licences being produced by the buyers and enter the particulars on the invoices, of which they send copies to the Post Office. In this way it is ensured that new listeners take out licences and that their particulars are recorded in the registers.</p>

<p>Reminders are sent to persons who do not react to renewal notices, and after various further steps and warnings they are subpoenaed for non-payment of the fees.</p>

<p><i>Ineffectiveness of system:</i></p>

<p>The present system, Mr. Speaker, has been in existence since 1927. Years ago, when there were still relatively few listeners’ licences, it still functioned reasonably well, but in view of the increase in the number of licences from 498,000 in 1948 to almost 1,700,000 today, so many problems are being presented that it has become essential to revise this system completely.</p>

<p>The greatest weaknesses of the system are that it fails when listeners change address without notifying the Post Office or when a person acquires a radio in some way or other without taking out a listener’s licence. The renewal notices do not reach people who move without reporting their changes of address, and tracing them is a time-consuming and often impossible task. New listeners who acquire radios without taking out licences are, right from the start, pirate listeners who can only be traced by chance by inspectors doing the rounds for the purpose of asking occupants of houses to produce their licences. The whole register system is extremely cumbrous and expensive. It involves a tremendous amount of administrative work which consists of following up cases where, according to the registers, listeners failed to respond to renewal notices, and which is for the most part unproductive since it is so difficult to trace listeners who left their last-known addresses.</p>

<p><span class="col_5981-5982" refersTo="page_0138"/>To keep pace with this steadily growing mass of administrative work the staff doing radio licensing work have to be increased continually. This work is increasing at an even faster rate than the rate at which new licences are taken out every year. The inspection staff are so deluged with work concerned with the following up of cases of defaulters, of which the Department has records, that they can only devote a fraction of their time to their more productive work of tracing pirate listeners by paying house to house visits for the purpose of asking listeners to produce their licences. The stage has been reached where it is clear that the present register system is making excessive demands as regards operating costs and manpower whereas it does not serve its purpose adequately, and that it will also be of no avail to go on increasing the staff engaged in the unproductive work of following up defaulters.</p>

<p><i>New system:</i></p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after thorough investigation and research for various alternatives, it has been found that the most practical solution is contained in doing away with the system of registers and changing over to an arrangement in terms of which the control of licences will in the main consist of house to house visits by radio licence inspectors to determine whether listeners have licences. A listener’s licence year is being introduced which will extend from 1st October in any year to 30th September of the following year, and in conjunction with that it is being provided that a person who takes out a licence for the first time, will only pay a licence fee in respect of the unexpired quarter or quarters of the licence year. A further new arrangement which is being introduced, is that any person who fails to take out during October his new licence for the following licence year, has to pay by way of penalty 10 per cent of the licence fees in respect of every month during which he has as from that date failed to take out his licence. However, the total amount of the fine will never exceed the licence fees. Clause 8 provides that these licences shall expire on a common date, clause 6 that the fees payable in respect of new licences shall be determined on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, and clause 7 for the payment of the penalties I mentioned.</p>

<p>Renewal notices will no longer be sent out, in view of the fact all listener’s licences will expire on 30th September every year and all listeners will be informed before the time, on the radio and through the Press, that they are to take out during October new licences for the new licence year. Licences will be issued at post offices, just as is the case at present. Under the envisaged arrangement radio licence inspectors will, on a much larger scale than is the case at present, pay house to house visits for the purpose of asking that licences be produced. Listeners who do not possess licences, will be subpoenaed after fair warning.</p>

<p>Radio dealers and repairers will still be required to insist on the production of licences by persons who buy radios or have them repaired, but there will no longer be any need for them to send copies of the invoices to the Post Office. Their books of account will instead be checked regularly by the inspectors. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for the retention of copies of invoices by radio dealers and repairers. Information about the licence holders will have to be furnished on the invoices, information which may be followed up by the inspectors for the purpose of exercising proper control.</p>

<p>The envisaged new system is an administrative arrangement and it will be possible to adapt the details thereof to circumstances if it should become apparent that adaptation is necessary. I want to give the assurance that the Post Office will implement this system in a responsible manner so that nobody will be caused unnecessary inconvenience. For instance, it is not the intention to trouble travellers or holiday makers for their radio licences, but only to carry out inspections of radio licences at the permanent addresses of persons.</p>

<p><i>Different kinds of licences:</i></p>

<p>Sir, provision is also being made in this Bill for a new kind of listener’s licence which may be issued to business concerns such as hotels, mines, transport services, etc., which make use of radio receiving systems through which their customers or employees may by means of loudspeakers, for instance, listen collectively to broadcasts received by one main set. Clause 5 (b) deals with this matter. For practical reasons it is desirable to differentiate in this way between what one may call &#x201C;private&#x201D; licences which are issued to a person or a household, and licences for organizations which use radio receiving systems for business purposes. It will be possible to prescribe different fees in respect of these business licences, depending on the nature and extent of the systems they use. In addition the enabling provisions in the Act in terms of which regulations may be made, are being adapted so that a member of a household may under prescribed circumstances be exempted by regulation from the obligation of having a licence and also so that it may be prescribed who will be regarded as the head of a household and may consequently be held responsible for producing the licence which is valid for that household. Clause 14 deals with this. These adjustments are necessary for clarifying the object of the Act and facilitating the practical implementation thereof.</p>

<p><i>Delegation of powers:</i></p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in clause 13 of the Bill it is being provided that the Postmaster-General may delegate powers to the South African Broadcasting corporation enabling the latter to issue licences and collect moneys on behalf of the Postmaster-General, if under certain <span class="col_5983-5984" refersTo="page_0139"/>circumstances or in respect of certain licences it may appear to be desirable and practicable and may promote efficiency. In actual fact the Post Office acts as agent for the S.A.B.C. as regards the collection of listeners’ fees, and the <b>S.A.B.C.</b> has to pay compensation to the Post Office for doing so. As a result of this provision it will be possible to allow the S.A.B.C. to perform some of its own collection work if in future it should be found that this can be done effectively and be advantageous to the S.A.B.C. This clause also provides that it will be possible, by agreement, for any local authority or other body to collect licence moneys on behalf of the Post Office where this may be found to be advantageous and practicable. In cases where, for instance, such a body lets houses and has to collect the rentals monthly, it may be arranged for radio licence fees to be collected in instalments, i.e. along with the rentals. The object of all these provisions is to create the necessary statutory machinery which makes it possible for the most effective administrative arrangements for the collection of licence fees to be made in future whenever and wherever such arrangements may appear to be desirable and practicable. It goes without saying that the Post Office itself will still issue the vast majority of licences since it has at its disposal the most extensive organization for that purpose, and that it is only to a relatively limited extent that other bodies will possibly take over some of this work. All administrative arrangements in terms of which the services of other bodies may be used for assisting in the collection of moneys, will be subject to the approval of the Minister. I should like to emphasize this point.</p>

<p><i>Miscellaneous provisions:</i></p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the remaining provisions of the Bill include, more specifically, domestic affairs and consequential adjustments, and may in all probability be discussed more profitably at the Committee Stage. Perhaps I may just refer here to the transitional provision contained in clause 8 (2) and (3), in terms of which it is being provided that listeners’ licences taken out before the commencement of this amending Act, will remain valid until the individual dates on which they would have expired had these new provisions not been introduced. This ensures that nobody will, as a result of the contemplated new system, lose in anyway on licence moneys already paid. Hon. members will also notice that clauses 2 and 16 make the Radio Act applicable to South-West Africa and repeal the Radio Ordinance of South-West Africa. This is necessary because the administration of radio matters in the Territory was taken over by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in terms of the South-West Africa Affairs Act, which came into operation on 1st April.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion:</i></p>

<p>Sir, I believe that the new system of licensing which will be made possible through this Bill being passed, will not only be more economical as regards finances and manpower than is the present system, but will also to a large extent be instrumental in combating pirate listening which has over the years caused the South African Broadcasting Corporation great losses in revenue. I trust that this measure will receive the support of both sides of the House. I move.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has given us a full explanation of the Bill now before the House. As I see it, it contains five main provisions, all of them unexceptionable to a greater or lesser degree. I shall have a few comments to make on each one of these five.</p>

<p>The first main provision is that there shall, now be a single date for the expiry of listeners’ licences. I believe that, on the whole, this is a sensible step, for the reasons the hon. the Minister gave us. It is quite clear that there were great shortcomings in the previous system and that a new system had become imperative. The hon. the Minister said that no notices would be sent out before the expiry of a listener’s licence on 30th September each year, except that notices would be given in the Press or over the radio itself. I wonder whether that is really going to serve the purpose intended. For income-tax purposes, and in the case of other licences, we are given previous notification. I trust that the hon. the Minister’s fond hope that such notices will not be necessary will be realized. I do see a certain disadvantage in this particular provision. That is that it might involve a very large amount of paper work at one particular time of the year. If all our licences are to expire on one particular date, namely the 30th September, it will mean a growing amount of work during the few weeks just before the expiry date, or just after. I see that one disadvantage, but on the whole I do believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I admit that the system was cumbersome in the past, and that this new system should be given a chance to prove itself in practice. It has the advantage, amongst others, that if there were to be a change in the licence fee. the Minister can make that change applicable from a certain fixed date. I believe that the licence fees are too high, and I trust that, should there by any announcement in this regard, it will be an announcement to the effect that licence fees will be lower than they are at present. This is only a fond hope I am expressing, Sir, and I am thinking aloud.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to be distracted by interruptions, but I think I should point out that a broadcast service, in terms of the definition in the Radio Act, which we are now amending, does also <span class="col_5985-5986" refersTo="page_0140"/>include the word &#x201C;television&#x201D;. Although television is not a subject we are debating now, I hope you will allow me to say just one sentence on this subject. If this particular clause is passed, and the hon. the Minister has the right to alter licence fees, I hope he will not increase them on account of the fact that we are getting television. I shall say no more on this point.</p>

<p>There is one thing I think the hon. the Minister might just tell us, and that is why all the other fees for which provision is made under the Radio Act, were not also made payable on 30th September. Many other licences are mentioned in the Schedule to the Radio Act, for example coast station licences, land mobile station licences, radio repairers’ licences, etc. There is quite a long list of them. Since the Minister is now making the expiry date for radio listeners’ licences the 30th September, why does he still, in this Bill, retain the 31st December as the expiry date for these other licences? To me it seems a good idea to have the 30th September as the final date for the expiry of all radio licences.</p>

<p>The second main provision in this Bill is that the hon. the Minister will now have the power through the S.A.B.C., or directly, to see that different types of listeners’ licences can be issued. We have had a discussion on an amendment in a previous Bill on this matter when I pointed out how we on this side of the House had always felt that there should be greater power for the hon. the Minister or for the S.Á.B.C. to grant free listeners’ licences, institutional licences and licences to businesses. This is what this particular Bill is doing at the moment, so we find this provision unexceptionable. I can particularly understand a provision of this type being introduced in regard to the manager of an institution such as, for instance, a hotel. I believe at the moment a hotel owner has to pay R1.75 for each loudspeaker in a separate room. Sometimes in a five-star hotel one finds a loudspeaker in the bedroom, one in the bathroom and you might even have one in the sitting rooms. So you can have three loudspeakers. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Indeed, I think it did work unjustly in the case of these big institutions where they have to pay all these additional licence fees. I trust that the hon. the Minister will be fair in laying down the fees for these new licence holders. I am particularly concerned about institutions where pensioners live and institutions for the aged, and I should like to have some assurance from the hon. the Minister that in these old-age homes, where many of the old people have their own little portable radios, the intention is to issue a single licence for the institution as a whole. Thereby the owners of these transistor radios, many of whom are pensioners, will not be compelled to pay these very high licence fees annually. I should like to have an indication from the hon. the Minister that that too might be or could be part of the intention of this Bill.</p>

<p>The third main provision in this Bill deals with the change in the duties of radio repairers and radio dealers in regard to their responsibility towards the Postmaster-General and the filling in of forms. Here, indeed, this Bill is again an improvement on the past Bill. In the old days the radio dealer had to fill in a form in triplicate every time a customer went to a radio dealer to have a radio repaired or to buy a new radio. Every time forms had to be filled in in triplicate and you had to have your licence number with you. The onus was on the radio dealer to make sure that that person who brought in the radio for repair or the person who wanted to buy a radio did have a licence for that particular radio. There has been a slight change for the better in regard to this. In the past these forms had to be filled in in triplicate and the third form had to be sent to the Postmaster-General. All that the hon. the Minister is doing now is simply to remove that third form which had to be sent to the Postmaster-General. However, I wonder whether this is really sufficient change. I say this on account of the difficulties which we know the public had experienced in the past; difficulties like, for example, when they took their radio to have it repaired, and where they had more than one radio. Difficulties also arose when they were on holiday and their car radio broke down. They had to have it repaired, but for some obvious reason they did not have the radio licence or the radio number with them and they could not actually have that radio repaired without having the number or the licence. This difficulty still remains. This particular provision does not remove that difficulty.</p>

<p>I do, however, grant the hon. the Minister that he has made a change in regard to this form in triplicate which had to be sent to the Postmaster-General. Just imagine the vast amount of work which that provision involved during the past years. I wonder how many man hours, how much money and how much office space had been wasted through this rather senseless provision of forcing the radio dealers to send the triplicate form to the Postmaster-General. According to information given by the hon. the Minister, in reply to a question, last year more than half a million of these forms were sent to the Postmaster-General, 553,000 during the year 1968. Still, this resulted in very few prosecutions. One can imagine the cost, the manpower and the office space which had been used through that provision. What is more important, when this provision came before the House, we on this side of the House, warned the hon. the Minister that that would be the result. However, I am most glad to see that the hon. the Minister has to a certain extent accepted our ideas and our views in regard to this provision.</p>

<p>The fourth provision in this Bill is one which allows the hon. the Minister and the S.A.B.C. to delegate the authority to issue <span class="col_5987-5988" refersTo="page_0141"/>radio licences to other bodies which are recognized in law. For example, the hon. the Minister can now allow a city council or a municipality to issue radio licences and collect the fees. I believe that is an improvement, although the hon. the Minister told us that it is a factor which will not affect a very large part of the country. I take it that on the whole it would only be the larger municipalities who will be collecting radio licences through their own organizations. I understand they will get commission on that and I trust the hon. the Minister will be reasonable and generous when he lays the amount down. I believe it will be a good idea. However, throughout the whole of the country it will still be the ease that the ordinary person will go to pay his radio licence at the Post Office. In this case you will basically have the same procedure as in the past. This new system of permitting the local authorities, the municipalities, to collect licences is, I believe, basically a good one. I come from a city, the city of Johannesburg, where we tested in practice this system in the issue of the annual motor car licences. Over a hundred thousand, close on two hundred thousand motor car licences are issued on behalf of the Province of Transvaal by the local authority in Johannesburg. It has worked very well and I have heard it has been done in Durban as well. It might be done in the hon. the Minister’s city of Bloemfontein too. It would be worth while to find out from these municipalities who have attempted this method of issuing licences in the case of motor cars what they have done, what the snags were and to see to what extent this particular system can be applied profitably and well to radio licences.</p>

<p>The fifth provision of this Bill is that certain persons of a household can be exempted from paying licences. The position at the present moment is that a person holding a licence can have as many radios as he wants to, provided that all these persons live under the same roof. The hon. the Minister is now coming with a provision which makes it possible for people who do not necessarily live under the same roof, but who are still members of the same household, to be able to get their radio licences under that one householder’s licence. As I see it, it will refer to cases such as the following: You will find the head of the family living in a certain town takes out a licence and if it so happens that he has a son at a university and a daughter at the boarding school he will be able to licence their transistors (most of the young people nowadays have transistors) under the central licence of the householder. I believe that the provision is that the Minister is taking the power to do this, under this Bill. As I understand it the householder’s licence will exempt those other members of the household of buying licences. I should like to have a rather firmer assurance from the hon. the Minister that he does actually intend doing something in regard to those cases where the head of the household has, for example, a son at the university and a daughter at a boarding school, that they will be permitted by regulation to have those radios, while they are still basically members of the central household, without an additional charge.</p>

<p>Sir, these are the few comments that I have to make on the five main provisions of this Bill. On the whole we agree that it is an unexceptionable Bill; that it flows from the previous amendment to the Broadcasting Act that we dealt with a few weeks ago in this House, and for those reasons this side of the House will support the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

<p>The speech the hon. member for Orange Grove has just made proves that even he can be sensible at times. I want to thank him for the Opposition’s support of this Bill. There is really nothing contentious in this measure. I should like to give him the assurance for which he asked in the last statement he made in connection with concessions to persons belonging to the same household, where members of the household may be at a university or a boarding school. I have already issued instructions to the effect that a concession should be made in such cases. I also want to give him the second assurance for which he asked in respect of concessions to the aged as far as their radio licences are concerned. If the finances of the S.A.B.C. permit, such concessions are granted gladly. It is in fact the intention to improve the system of collecting radio licence fees to such an extent that it will be possible to accommodate these cases. If the finances are available, they will be readily accommodated. There is no lack of sympathy at all. I do not think the hon. member raised other points to which I have to reply specifically at this stage. I think that further questions, if any, can profitably be out to me in the course of the Committee Stage.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As you know. Sir, the Water Act was referred to a Select Committee during 1955 and 1956. The then Bill was very thoroughly considered and unanimously accepted by this House.</p>

<p>Since then it was necessary to effect certain amendments from time to time, and now I have to approach the House once again for approval to effect further amendments&#x2014; amendments which have become essential over the years. It is not possible for us to stand <span class="col_5989-5990" refersTo="page_0142"/>still; we must move on all the time and also adapt our water legislation to changed circumstances. Because I regarded it as essential, and in view of the important principles contained in this Bill, I consequently deemed it advisable to refer this Bill to a Select Committee for consideration. This was in fact done and the Select Committee investigated the amendments very thoroughly and a Bill with a few necessary amendments was adopted unanimously by all the members of the Select Committee. This Bill has now been submitted to the House. I want to extend my sincere thanks to the Select Committee for its prized study of and attention to this legislation. Since water legislation is always complicated and has far-reaching consequences, it requires careful consideration and sound insight. The House may rest content that close attention was devoted to this Bill by the Select Committee, and that it has now become essential to accept the proposed adjustments with a view to enabling the Minister to exercise better control over the water resources of the Republic. I shall now discuss in brief the principles contained in this Bill.</p>

<p>As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Water Act provides that the use of water for industrial purposes is to he under my control and that the use of water which, on an average, is in excess of 50,000 gallons per day, may only be allowed by way of a permit. It was felt that a similar provision was necessary in respect of the use of water for urban purposes, because the position may in fact arise where a local authority may build a dam in a public stream and divert water which would normally flow past and thus prejudice a major project constructed by the State at considerable cost. In this manner the State may find itself in the position where, owing to the steps taken by the local authority or authorities concerned, it has to create at considerable cost additional storage facilities in order to protect the existing irrigation area, which may also include the supply of water to cities or towns and industries, and in order to straighten out the position.</p>

<p>Therefore I consider it desirable that provision be made in the Act in an attempt to prevent this undesirable situation from arising. In cases where local authorities have effected in a river storage which is in excess of 45 morgen feet of water or where more than a million gallons of water per day are being used, such storage or use is to be effected by way of a permit issued by the Minister of Water Affairs.</p>

<p>For years now my Department has experienced problems as a result of the injudicious development taking place in certain dam basins. In view of the fact that there is nothing to prevent large-scale development, such development is subsequently flooded resulting in considerable expense for the State. For instance, roads have to be diverted, or compensation has to be paid in respect of permanent structures, etc. In order to prevent as far as possible such problems from cropping up in the future in cases where dams are contemplated in certain rivers, provision is now being made in terms of which it will be possible to proclaim dam basin control areas.</p>

<p>A railway line or a road or a building can be laid down or constructed in more than one place, but a dam can only be built on a certain dam site. That is why it is essential that all dam sites be protected and be proclaimed as controlled areas so as to ensure that development does not take place in such areas. This will bring about a major saving, prevent <b>a</b> great deal of inconvenience and save many sites for water storage.</p>

<p>It is, of course, appreciated that people may suffer damage because of these arrangements. Consequently provision is being made for compensation. It is also being provided that a claim for compensation shall not become superannuated. In addition it is being provided that normal farming operations be excluded, but that any road, building, water work or any other work or structure of a permanent nature may only be erected or constructed under cover of a permit from the Minister.</p>

<p>In cases where storage dams are built by the State and the river-bed is consequently being used as a channel for the distribution of that water amongst riparian owners or the supply of water to local authorities or industries, the State has at the moment no control over the construction of works or water works in such a stream unless such area is declared to be a State water control area in terms of section 59 (1) (b), the result being that in terms of section 62 permits will then have to be issued to every riparian owner in respect of his existing rights. This requires a great deal of work which may be eliminated if the provisions of section 63 were applied; in other words, when the preparation of a schedule of rateable surface areas is implemented and water is then supplied to the persons concerned in terms of such a schedule of rateable surface areas, as if the river were a channel.</p>

<p>In the Appeal Court case <i>Mostert</i> v. <i>The Minister of Water Affairs,</i> the Appeal Court did in fact make it clear that where a State water work was involved, the provisions of section 63 were to be implemented, and where a river without a State water work was, for the purposes of control over the use of water in that river, declared to be a State water control area in terms of section 59 (1) (b), the provisions of section 62, i.e. the issuing of permits, were to be implemented.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the Department’s work and also to acquire control over the abstraction of water in a State water control area which was proclaimed in terms of section 59 (1) (b) and in cases where a dam was built in the river in question and the river is being used as a distribution channel, it is therefore essential to amend the Act and to make provision for control over all waterworks in such a river in order that waterworks may not be constructed without the Minister’s approval <span class="col_5991-5992" refersTo="page_0143"/>by way of a permit. It will therefore be possible to exercise proper control over the abstraction of water.</p>

<p>Now I come to a very big problem. It deals with the powers and the performance of duties and functions of irrigation boards. Time and again it has been the experience of the Department that certain, and I repeat, certain irrigation boards do not perform their duties, do not maintain or repair their works properly, nor distribute water amongst the irrigators in a proper manner, i.e. so that everybody may receive his just share of the available water.</p>

<p>In addition there are certain irrigation boards which do not meet their loan obligations, do not hold regular meetings, do not revise their schedules of rateable surface areas regularly and do not furnish the Department regularly with information which they have to furnish in terms of the Act. All the Department could do in the past, was to issue instructions to such a board and if it did not comply with the instructions, the Minister of Water Affairs had to take over that board and, by proxy, vest its functions in an officer of the Department. This places a major burden on officials since it is additional work for which they are not remunerated, and in such a case they must in effect do the work of a board which consisted previously of perhaps nine or 12 members.</p>

<p>In order to meet these problems I now propose to effect certain amendments. Firstly, the constitution of irrigation boards ought to be changed. It is now being provided that the Minister of Water Affairs may of his own accord appoint half of the members of an irrigation board, whilst the other half are nominated and elected by the irrigators themselves. These powers will, of course, only be used in cases where existing boards fail to perform their duties properly. May I just tell the House that we have to deal with more than 300 boards of this nature.</p>

<p>Secondly it is being provided that certain areas may be proclaimed. In such proclaimed areas it will be possible for the State President to vest in the Minister control over the waterworks of such an irrigation board and the distribution of water in the irrigation district concerned.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is being provided that the Minister or any officer in the Department authorized thereto by him may by notice in writing to any irrigation board direct such board to take steps in regard to the maintenance, repair or betterment of any water work or in regard to the method of distribution, supply or use of water in or from any such waterworks. If such a board fails to give effect to such directions, the Minister or the officer concerned himself may take the necessary steps and take over the control of the works or the distribution of water for such period as may be deemed necessary. In cases where it is deemed necessary to take over the waterworks of a board, the State may not levy rates on the irrigators in respect of such waterworks on which a loan is still outstanding, unless that loan is written off by a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament. Where additional works are constructed in the interests of irrigators, rates may be levied in respect of such additional works.</p>

<p>At present it is almost impossible to succeed in a charge to the effect that a person was guilty of unauthorized use of public water, because it is always said in defence that the water was taken or the sluices were adjusted&#x2014; in colloquial language this is known as common water theft&#x2014;without the knowledge of the person who is charged. If he proves that this was done without his knowledge, it is impossible to obtain a conviction.</p>

<p>In view of this and of representations made by the Attorney-General it was decided to eliminate this loophole by providing that under certain circumstances an owner may nevertheless be convicted and also that his manager, agent or employee may be convicted.</p>

<p>Legislation is required in order to implement the policy of the Water Affairs Branch of the Administration of South-West Africa gradually being taken over, as contemplated by the Odendaal Commission, by the Department of Water Affairs of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>At the moment there are certain ordinances in terms of which the Water Affairs Branch in South-West Africa operates. In order to cause, as far as possible, no disruption and to effect a gradual take-over, it is being provided that the present ordinances shall be deemed to be regulations made in terms of the Water Act, and also that these regulations may be amended and new regulations may be made so as to make it possible for the functions of the Branch, with due regard to the special circumstances in South-West Africa, to be carried out as smoothly as possible without the said functions being restricted by provisions of the Water Act which cannot be applied to South-West Africa in their entirety, or in cases where there is no provision under the Water Act for special circumstances which may arise there. It is also being provided that any or all of the provisions of the Water Act may be applied to South-West Africa, and it is the intention to apply to the Territory in due course those provisions which may in fact be applied profitably to South-West Africa, and subsequently to make provision for additional matters by way of regulations which may then also be amended from time to time. As has already been said, this will only be effected with the approval of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>In addition to the above-mentioned major amendments, certain minor financial amendments have also been effected. For instance, it is being proposed that the maximum subsidy which may be granted to a private owner, be increased from R1,000 to R3,000,. Hon. members will recall that in this regard representations <span class="col_5993-5994" refersTo="page_0144"/>were made to me in the course of the previous session.</p>

<p>The provisions relating to the submission of White Papers to the House of Assembly and the Senate are also being amended. At present it is necessary to submit a White Paper in respect of every State water works in excess of R200,000. It is now being provided that a White Paper shall only be submitted in cases where the cost exceeds R500,000. In the case of an irrigation board which negotiates a loan, it is at present necessary to submit a White Paper if the cost of the work exceeds R60,000. It is now being proposed that a White Paper should only be submitted if the cost exceeds R150,000. The reason for these amendments is obvious and it is unnecessary for me to elaborate on it. Costs have increased since 1956, and the drafting of White Papers for relatively small amounts merely places an additional burden on my Department.</p>

<p>Pursuant to representations made by the S.A. Agricultural Union an amendment has also been effected as regards the furnishing by farmers of detailed plans and specifications for water works in excess of a certain amount. Whereas previously such plans had to be submitted in respect of works in excess of R1,800, this will now only be necessary if the cost is in excess of R3,000. The provision which obliged me to ask the House for an extension of time in the event of my being unable to issue permits in any State water control area within three years, places me under a big obligation. I feel free to ask the House to delete that provision.</p>

<p>With a reorganization of the Department, and also by virtue of certain amendments contained in this Bill and certain specific arrangements which I have made, I now hope to issue within three to five years permits in respect of which it was previously estimated that with the present shortage of staff it would take more than 100 years before it would have been possible to issue them. We are doing our best. That is why I feel free to ask for this particular provision to be deleted. I also want to give the undertaking that if there should be a miscalculation in this respect, i.e. if within a year or two we should discover that we had in this time miscalculated by a year or two, then I, for my part, shall come to this House in good time to warn you and to say that it was with the best of intentions that we set it at three to five years, and to tell you whether we can keep it up and whether we think that the target can be reached.</p>

<p>With this explanation I have covered the most important provisions and new principles embodied in this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to thank the hon. the Minister for the explanation he has given of this Bill and to make one or two preliminary remarks regarding the measure we have before us this evening. The Minister quite rightly said that this Bill was sent to a Select Committee before Second Reading, and that agreement was reached in the Select Committee regarding the provisions of the Bill we have before us. The pattern that was followed here was that which was adopted in 1956 with the original Act upon which a Select Committee sat for some three years, and that Act is still the basis of our law dealing with water in South Africa. This Bill before us is therefore an amendment, in some respects, of that basic Act which still stands. I do not know whether in the future there will have to be further substantial amendments. I will come to that in a moment. But for the moment we have these amendments, and although perhaps the Bill on the face of it may not look as though it is of particular importance, I can assure you, Sir, that it gave the members of the Select Committee many days of sitting and many long hours considering the changes that were made in the Bill that was first introduced into Parliament by the hon. the Minister. That again shows, I think, that it was possible in a Select Committee to get down to the fullest and most detailed consideration of one of the most important matters that we have before us in Parliament at present. We have dealt this evening already with a soil conservation measure, and now we come to water. We had the fullest support from the staff and members of the Minister’s Department who came before us. They were perfectly frank and gave us the utmost help and information that they could. In passing, may I say that we were all grieved and recorded our grief at the passing of one of the senior members of the Minister’s staff just on the eve of a sitting of the Select Committee. When we were about to hear him, he suddenly passed away. We expressed our grief then, and I would like very briefly just to refer to it here now because he was an official whom I had known for many, many years and who had given a lifetime of service and, indeed, was engaged upon his duty and had accorded us very valuable information at the time of his passing. The other officials subsequently filled the gap and we had the greatest help from them, so that we sat there as a Select Committee determined to find what was best, in terms of the law, to deal with this question of water, the conservation of water and the use of water in South Africa. Sir, I venture to suggest that the time is coming very rapidly, because public opinion is changing to the extent that there is coming a greater and greater appreciation of the need for us not only to conserve our water supplies but also wisely to use the supplies we have. I was recently shocked to hear a suggestion by a professional man as to how we should use what is usually called our &#x201C;fossil water&#x201D;, water which, once used, is gone for ever; it is not an inexhaustible supply. It therefore behoves us as Parliament to see that the use as well as the conservation of our water will be as wisely controlled in terms of our laws as is possible for human endeavour, with the knowledge at our disposal. The time is coming, and I think it is close, when because public opinion is so aroused, there is such a realization of the vital <span class="col_5995-5996" refersTo="page_0145"/>part played by water in our economy, in our very life as a nation, that before long I am sure we will have a Bill coming before us which will make the conservation and the use of water priority No. 1, over everything else in South Africa in our public life. It is not in our law yet, with the result that you get, as we have a Bill here, where certain Departments contract out of the restrictive provisions of this measure. Sir, this is most regrettable. We have brought in in this Bill those bodies which it was thought to be competent for us with a chance of success to bring in, but the net is not yet wide enough. I believe that the time will come when we will have to say to all branches of public activities, including Government Departments, Railways and Harbours, together with every other Department, and Bantu Administration, that they take second place to the need to conserve and adequately to use our water supplies. Water must not be made subservient to the needs and desires of other State Departments. It is not in the Bill before us, but we are getting close to it. I believe it will not be long before that time comes and I hope the Minister is going to be bold when the time comes.</p>

<p>Let me say at once that we support this Bill. It was a unanimous measure in the Select Committee. It has come before the House as an agreed measure from both sides. I want to say to the Minister that he is in this privileged and fortunate position that he has the whole of Parliament behind him. There will not be a dissenting voice in Parliament as far as this Bill is concerned. When he has that backing and that power, he must go forward, knowing that he has the people behind him; he has the public opinion of South Africa behind him in any steps that he takes within reason to control the use and the conservation of our water supplies. This Bill gives the Minister very wide powers indeed. We have had changes in this portfolio. I regret them. I prefer to see a portfolio change hands quickly if it is to leave the hands of a Nationalist Minister and come into the hands of a United Party Minister. Naturally, the quicker the better, and I would have no objection, but as long as this Government is in power I would like to see a portfolio such as this remaining for quite a lengthy period in the hands of one Minister. I hate to see a portfolio like this chopping and changing. This is no child’s job to get down to an understanding of the ramifications of this question of water. It is a job that takes a man who is going to apply his time to it, who will get down to it and work hard to learn even the broadest principles of the ramifications of our water supplies in South Africa.</p>

<p>I say quite frankly that I believe the hon. the Minister is trying to get the job done. Last year we treated him gently during the discussion of his Vote to give him a chance. This year we will deal with the question of water supply when we discuss his Vote later on and we will discuss it from a different angle than the four precise corners of a Bill, such as the one that we have before us. The hon. the Minister receives a tremendous amount of power through this measure. What are we going to do in regard to water supplies in South Africa? We have come a long way since the 1956 Act. The 1956 Act took certain powers away from certain private owners which they resented. With this measure we are going further and taking away further rights and powers and placing them in the hands of the hon. the Minister. We have to do it. In the Select Committee we faced this problem fairly and squarely. We asked ourselves where we should place the authority so that it will be recognized and will be easily available. We do not want something obscure and involved and something so nebulous that the ordinary man concerned with this primary necessity of our lives in South Africa does not know to whom to go. The power is being placed more and more in the hands of the hon. the Minister. We say to the Minister that he may take the powers and we do it willingly. We are doing it for the sake of having a clear-cut authority in the administration of water affairs in South Africa. We feel that this is the only way to deal with the problem. One cannot give power, such as we are giving the hon. the Minister here to committees, boards, councils and all sorts of groups of people. I now want to come to a remark the hon. the Minister made in regard to the &#x201C;besproeiingsrade&#x201D;, irrigation boards.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, but I was brought up in an Afrikaans-speaking family and that is why my English is not so good. The hon. the Minister dealt with this question regarding irrigation boards. This is exactly the question that had to be faced by the select committee. One cannot get boards, however good they may be, to exercise the authority and to perform the functions effectively and efficiently all the time. There is always the interplay between persons, personalities and conflicting interests. In this Bill we have taken a certain line and I am sorry that it may not be acceptable to certain people, but the duty we had to do and we discharged in the select committee, was to make certain that as far as possible the irrigation boards functioned much more effectively than they had in the past. Inefficiency and ineffectiveness can lead to a waste of water. We cannot afford waste of water, whether through the inefficiency or the ineffectiveness of an irrigation board or for whatever other reason. The powers are therefore again placed in the hands of the Minister to enable him to take certain steps under certain circumstances, so as to deal efficiently and effectively with the work which an irrigation board may be failing to do. If it is failing in its duties and is unable to do its task the hon. the Minister may step in. I appeal to the irrigation boards, because they are themselves the custodians of this precious element. It is up to them in the interests of South Africa to see that they <span class="col_5997-5998" refersTo="page_0146"/>work efficiently and effectively on the job they have. If a member of an irrigation board cannot do his job efficiently and effectively and if he will not attend meetings and take his share of the responsibility I want to ask him to resign so that somebody else can take his place and get on with the job. That is the only way this matter can be handled if it is not to go back into the hands of the hon. the Minister for him to deal with it. We have this prime resource on which depends the whole of our civilization and in this Bill this has become very marked. This Bill deals with water for industries, the local authorities, irrigation and private farmers.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister dealt with the question of staff. I understand that the position in regard to this is getting better in the Department of Water Affairs and I am very pleased. I am sure that all of us in Parliament will be pleased if that information is well founded. The staff of the Department of Water Affairs does not only consist of clerical staff. One cannot go out on the highways and byways and find a girl who can type, because she has just left school and has been taught typing, and employ her in the Department of Water Affairs and expect that she can do a job in connection with one of the technical or professional posts, which have to be filled some way or another if the machine is to work efficiently. Vast schemes are undertaken by this department. We will deal with one of these schemes which are being held up, at a later stage. When the time comes we will deal with one of the dams envisaged under the Orange River Scheme, in respect of which a town was built but is standing empty and where the work has been held up for various reasons. The schemes that are undertaken by this department at the moment are enormous and the expenditure runs into countless millions of rand. We want to see these schemes progressing, but they need men behind them. I know that a tremendous burden is placed on the staff as a result of this. The Minister pointed out certain changes in the Act which will permit him to save time and work in his department. We are only too happy to lend him our aid in this regard so that the necessity of producing White Papers and other documents to lay before the House in respect of minor schemes is done away with. Let us save the time and the money and let us hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to attract people who will stay with his department and will be of value because of their technical and professional qualifications. I am sure that in this department any young and ambitious man who really wants to play a part has a very fine opportunity and future in this department, and if he intends to make it his life’s work he will never regret it.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also briefly dealt with the question of South-West Africa and one clause of the Bill before us also deals with that territory. To put it widely the position is that at the present time South-West Africa is enjoying certain powers and has certain laws dealing with the question of water affairs in its own territory. These laws can be changed in terms of this measure by way of a proclamation by the State President and provisions of this measure can be made applicable to South-West Africa. This becomes very much an administrative matter and it will be for the hon. the Minister to say, in the fullness of time, in respect of the application of our laws here in the Republic, that they shall apply to South-West Africa or he will hold his hand and leave them with their own laws. In passing I want to say that when we had evidence from the proper official from South-West Africa I think we were all impressed by the difference in the whole of the setup and the physical characteristics of the territory; the different position in so far as population centres are concerned and the difference in regard to not only the climate but also the soil conditions. We did realize that there was a great difference in principle between the situation in South-West Africa and the situation here in the Republic. While the provision is there for the moment South-West Africa is being undisturbed and left with its own laws. In future the hon. the Minister may for some reason or other find that it is necessary to change that, but we hope that he will be slow to act in any respect which will interfere with their own powers and their own capacity as the authority on the spot to deal with their own problems and their own particular difficulties and the local conditions they have to face there.</p>

<p>There is a very bright spot in this Bill so far as certain communities are concerned, and that is as regards groups of farmers, whether organized or otherwise who may be prepared or wish to put in water supply schemes or who may want assistance in terms of the subsidy provisions in the Bill.</p>

<p>The amount of the subsidy has been increased for them. The conditions under which they can get the subsidies are, I think, less onerous. I am just wondering how far our farmers are going to be made aware of the provisions in this Bill before us, of the new conditions under which subsidies can be made available to them for schemes. Perhaps, merely by reason of the fact that this Bill went to a Select Committee before the Second Reading, and that the deliberations of the Select Committee are not public, it is not like a Bill here in Parliament which creates outside interest because of its controversial nature. This is not a Bill like that. There is no controversial angle to this particular Bill. Therefore we do not have the kind of debate which we would have had in the case of a controversial Bill, which receives publicity through the Press, and that sort of thing. If one wants to know how much value even members attach to this important matter, I ask hon. members to look at the House at the present moment. [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with respect, I am beginning to wonder whether I made a truthful statement just now. I said this was a non-controversial measure. Now I am beginning to wonder whether I was not wrong. It seems as though there are certain controversial aspects, after all, although they may not be related to water, except as an additive to some other beverage, and they may be associated with that.</p>

<p>In regard to this particular matter, I say that because the widest publicity in the form of a controversial debate will not be given to this matter, it can well be the case that these provisions, which I think will appeal enormously to groups of farmers right throughout the whole of the farming areas of our country, namely the increased subsidies and probably the simplicity with which application can be made, as well as the fact that application can be brought to fruition in getting these increased subsidies, may not be generally known. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister at this stage in that regard whether possibly some administrative means cannot be found to bring to the notice, perhaps of organized agriculture&#x2014;I am a great believer in organized agriculture&#x2014;the provisions of this Bill, dealing with those increased subsidies and the conditions under which application could be made. I am not going to ask that it be made easy for people who waste water. We have no water to waste. Production, the bare necessities of stock, of agriculture, and even in some cases of homesteads themselves, when we experience these droughts, are dependant upon having an assured water supply. The principles in regard to an assured water supply I shall deal with while discussing the Vote. I do not propose to deal with it now. In most cases it may well be the case that the farmer, or the group of farmers who will take thought for the morrow and realize how in this country we have to accept droughts as part and parcel of the ordinary, normal way of life and the lot, of the destiny of the farming community, will say timeously: &#x201C;We must not rely upon the rain we have had to-day; we must realize that there will be a drought perhaps next year.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Let us now establish a certain water supply for the household, for our stock, for whatever it may be, in the way of water that is available for the purpose of their homestead and even perhaps irrigation in a lesser or a greater degree. This information I fear is not going to get to the people whom it would assist so much. I therefore appeal to the hon. the Minister to confer with the officials of his Department, perhaps bring in a representative or organized agriculture and find out how best it is possible to disseminate the information to the farmers concerned.</p>

<p>I do not want to keep the House in regard to this Bill. There are only one or two other matters that I would like to deal with very briefly. One is the question of the control of dam sites. That is not immoderate language, it is spelt &#x201C;d-a-m&#x201D;. The clause dealing with the reservation of these sites is one which took a great deal of discussion and long debate. A compromise, however, was reached. It was not truly a compromise&#x2014;it is not the right word&#x2014;as a compromise seems to indicate that both sides rather gave way on something. It was not a compromise in that sense. It was a unanimous agreement. It was, shall I say, the solution found by the Select Committee. Clause 3 of the Bill, in my opinion, contains the solution to this problem. What we wanted to do in Select Committee was to protect sites suitable for the construction of major conservation dams by the Department from time to time. We are faced with this difficulty. As I have already said, the Department is faced with works running into tens of millions of rand. They have their plans already for a few years ahead. It is not only staff in the Department that is necessary to prepare plans and then to see that they are carried out by the technical and professional people, but you have to have contractors who are prepared to come and build those dams. In South Africa we have gone so far as to even get consortiums from elsewhere to come and lend a hand. We have to have the builders to do the work.</p>

<p>After all, the blueprints, the plans and specifications and everything else have been compiled by our people. But we then want someone to actually do the physical work. However much we may desire to continue to build these enormous conservation dams, which are vitally necessary&#x2014;it must be remembered that Rome was not built in a day and we cannot simply rush in holus-bolus and build vast numbers of these dams&#x2014;we have not the resources neither in men, nor in money, nor in the people to actually do the physical work. The Department is, therefore, in the position, that in respect of a particular river a dam site is found where they are satisfied after their investigations that a dam can be constructed which will serve the purpose. And, Sir, dam sites which are going to be available to serve the purpose are not always readily available on some of our rivers, not even on some of our major rivers. I know there is a feeling abroad that anybody can go along and if he finds a bit of bed rock he can build a nice concrete wall on it and construct a dam. That is not the answer to this problem. And nobody would be more criticized than the engineers in charge of such a project, if for any reason the dam itself fails to be efficient and effective for the purpose for which it was designed and constructed. Everybody concerned on the construction side has, therefore, <span class="col_6001-6002" refersTo="page_0148"/>got to be doubly careful. What then was the position of the Department in this matter?</p>

<p>It is vital if we are to continue in the years ahead to build these big conservation dams that the Department must be able to go ahead beforehand, particularly in our bigger rivers, to find a suitable site for the construction of our dams and then to hold it. They do not want to come along afterwards and find that somebody else has used that particular rock dike across a river&#x2014;an area which might be a suitable base for a dam&#x2014;and has built a bridge on it because they thought that it was a good place on which to build their concrete piers.</p>

<p>But this is what happens, Sir. Therefore when the departmental officials find spots where a dam can be built, they want to protect those spots, not just for a year or two, because they may not have the money or the resources to build a dam within a year or two. Nor indeed can they determine where development will take place. They naturally have an order of priority according to which certain dams being constructed will be the first called upon to supply water to a certain area they have in mind. Therefore, Sir, there must be a continuing search for sites for the construction of dams for the years ahead. But how to protect those sites so that other developments do not take place precisely where it is proposed to build a dam in the years ahead? Here we find a clash of interests between the people who own the land at the present time and the people who may want to develop in that area. In my own province, as elsewhere, there is always the possibility that someone may establish a private township alongside a river, right in the place where the department proposes to build a dam in years to come. How was this matter to be dealt with? I believe that the solution was found in this particular clause. A solution had to be found because we had to grapple with the possibility of certain farmers, who own such land, possibly having for many years to continue their farming operations, while being prevented from carrying out certain developments they may have wished to do on a particular site because it had been earmarked as a dam site for the future. Such farmers were not paid out. The site had to remain there, earmarked, and held in terms of the law. Sir, as hon. members will see in the new section 59 (4) (b) which is added by clause 3, there is a prohibition on certain developments in a dam basin control area, such as the construction or alteration of a road, building, waterworks or any other work or structure of a permanent nature. However, this is qualified by the following words: &#x201C;Excluding any activity connected with the ordinary carrying on of farming operations&#x201D;. The ordinary carrying on of ordinary farming operations is therefore excluded, and such farming operations may be carried out in that area. A farmer, carrying out <i>bona fide</i> farming operations in an area where the department has discovered a dam site, is free to carry on. Why was it necessary to try to protect these dam sites? It was necessary because the department, in the fullness of time, may have found itself being charged an enormous sum in compensation for other developments which have taken place in the meantime. Such other developments could include the laying out of a township. One could find, after the houses in such a township had been built, that the Department would discover that the township had been built on a dam site they had earmarked. The Department might for instance say in 1979: We earmarked that dam site in 1959, 20 years ago. Now look what has happened. It is in the middle of a town. We shall now have to expropriate all these houses. The Department may have to do so because there may not be another suitable site on which a dam can be constructed with certainty and safety for miles and miles. Whom would such a dam supply with water? Such a dam would be built to supply water for the people of South Africa. This is not a hole in the comer business. This is for the benefit of the generality of our people, of all kinds and cultures and colours. It was to prevent this enormous cost of compensation, which might have to be paid in the event of developments taking place on such a dam site, that this provision was included. The question of the control of a dam basin, as it is called here, is to my mind, one of the most important provisions in this Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The prohibition upon development in a dam basin control area is contained in the new subsection (4) (b), but this is qualified by the words &#x201C;excluding any activity connected with the ordinary carrying on of farming operations&#x201D;. This proviso permits ordinary farming operations. We did not want to define them too closely, but whatever can be construed as ordinary farming operations which may even necessitate temporary buildings, etc., is excluded from the restrictive provisions of clause 3. There may be some people who will feel that their rights have been reduced again. They may feel that their unrestricted right has been a little curtailed. We are sorry if that is so, but we fall back on the belief, as I have said, that in this matter we are dealing with an element which is fundamental to the existence of our nation. Take away or limit the fresh water supply for South Africa, and you limit the population. You then limit our economic growth, our industrial growth and the growth and existence of our people. Sir, I believe that there will be further amendments. They will be more restrictive. But let us hope that this Bill will itself bring closer to the minds of the general public the need to utilize carefully the water supplies of this country, and to control and to conserve that water.</p>

<from><span class="col_6003-6004" refersTo="page_0149"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was my pleasant privilege to act as Chairman of this Select Committee that had to consider the legislation referred to us by the House. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to thank all the members of the Select Committee for the dedicated and efficient way in which they did their work on the Committee. I also thank the hon. the Minister for the much appreciated sentiments he expressed about this Committee this evening. On this occasion it is also fitting for me to pay tribute to a very senior official of the Department. The hon. member who spoke before me also referred to him. Very early one morning, just before the Select Committee was to commence its business, he suddenly died of a heart attack. This official had rendered truly outstanding assistance to this Committee. His work was highly appreciated. The Committee sorely missed his assistance during its subsequent deliberations.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the merits of the Bill, I should also like to express my gratitude to the members of the Department who assisted the Committee so admirably, because extremely involved discussions were conducted. Discussions which lasted for many hours were conducted on involved and technical points in the Water Act. Officials of the Department assisted us to a very large extent. The Select Committee found it necessary to amend certain of the clauses in the original Bill referred to it, as it appeared that certain of these clauses could create real problems in practice.</p>

<p>Before I come to that, I should like to refer to one or two matters raised by the hon. member for South Coast. What I want to refer to is that we most definitely are unanimous as regards the whole idea that water in South Africa should become priority number one. This is not the time to go into this matter in detail, but one need only think of the fact that even now we are using more than 60 per cent of our total water resources. Only approximately 40 per cent remains, and our population is going to double itself between now and the year 2000. For this doubling in our population we have at our disposal 40 per cent of our available water resources. Consequently it is really necessary for the importance of proper water conservation and the conservation of our water resources in South Africa to be brought to the attention of the public in and out of season. It is also true that far-reaching staff improvements have been effected in the Department over the past year or 18 months. One has in mind particularly the improvement as regards engineers in the technical division. I think I am correct in saying that approximately 126 students are studying this year at our South African universities on bursaries arranged during the past year by the hon. the Minister and the Department so as to enable them to further their studies as engineers and technical staff. In addition there are other matters, such as hydrological research, etc., which I do not want to deal with in detail now. But the importance of this aspect simply cannot be overemphasized.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the attitude adopted to this Bill by the hon. member who spoke before me. I am also grateful for his cooperation. Since this measure is not a contentious one as a result of which there will be no difference of opinion between us, I regret that I have to upset the expectations the hon. member has for the future to some extent. I am sorry but I cannot see the hon. member ever having the pleasure, even in the most distant future, of discussing water affairs in this House under a United Party Minister of Water Affairs. He simply has to accept that. It will definitely not happen in our lifetime that a United Party Minister of Water Affairs will sit in this House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, as the hon. member for Christiana says, the chances are nil. In any event, as long as the hon. member for South Coast is a member of this House, we shall definitely have positive contributions in the field of water affairs in this House. I am grateful for that.</p>

<p>As far as this Bill is concerned, I am satisfied that the result of the work of the Select Committee, which is before this House at the moment, will, for various reasons, be conducive to more effective water conservation. The first reason is that this Bill, which the hon. the Minister is now submitting to this House, embodies more effective planning than that which was embodied in the 1956 Water Act. It embodies more effective planning in the field of the use of water by local authorities which, <i>inter alia,</i> will now have to consult the Minister first in regard to certain matters under certain circumstances. It embodies more effective planning as far as the proclamation of dam basin control areas is concerned and also as regards control over the use of water and the construction of waterworks in certain public streams and in natural channels.</p>

<p>The Bill this House is considering at the moment will also be conducive to better administration. Better administration is being brought about by means of the further regulation of the activities and the constitution of irrigation boards in that provision is being made for the vesting in the Minister of the control of certain water works belonging to or controlled by irrigation boards. All these things will be conducive to better administration. Another aspect of better administration is that criminal liability in the case of the contravention of certain provisions of the legislation is now being put into operation. This is a positive step in the right direction. Here I have in mind particularly the theft of water and the failure to execute certain works. In the third place this is a positive step as it also contains an important provision in respect of the regulation of the use and the conservation of water in the territory of South-West Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_6005-6006" refersTo="page_0150"/>As the hon. member who spoke before me said, this Bill grants the hon. the Minister certain additional far-reaching powers. However, the Select Committee deemed the granting of these powers to the Minister essential in view of the fact that here we were dealing with such an extremely serious matter.</p>

<p>As far as clause 1 is concerned, the new subsection (3) of section 13 is a completely new insertion into the existing legislation. This is a far-reaching provision. This insertion is applicable to new works and the enlargement of existing works under certain circumstances. The hon. the Minister already referred in part to this matter in his Second Reading speech. But another important aspect I Should like to emphasize is this: A municipality draws water from a river for use and then finds at a certain stage that the consumption exceeds the supply. That municipality then goes to the water court and asks for a dam in the river concerned or in a second river in the same area or even for a second dam in the same river. The Department of Water Affairs then finds itself in the position that it has no legal status enabling it to go to the water court to put its objections unless the Department already has an existing Government water scheme situated lower down on the river. Therefore the position is that if the Department goes to the water court with such an application while it has no Government water scheme situated lower down on the river, it has no particular status which can be of assistance to it. If, for example, the council wants to build a dam lower down on such a river, that again interferes with the policy of development as planning in respect of the river is undertaken from the upper reaches downwards. Now the position is, however, that the Minister and the Department of Water Affairs have increased legal status as far as the regulation of these matters is concerned when these matters reach the water court. This principle is already contained in section 11 (3) of the Act. Section 11 (3) is applicable to the industrial use of water. When a town council wants to use more than 50,000 gallons of water per day, a permit first has to be obtained from the Minister of Water Affairs before the Town Council may go to the water court with its request for a larger allocation of water. Therefore this is not a new principle. It is essential, however, for this principle to be embodied in legislation as a means of assisting the Minister and his Department.</p>

<p>An extremely important clause in this Bill is clause 3 which deals with dam basin control areas, to which the hon. member who spoke before me also referred. This is a drastic measure. This is a measure which will most definitely be applied judiciously by the Minister. I can only give the assurance that we are satisfied that this measure as embodied in the Bill at present before this House will produce an absolute minimum of problems. This does not mean, however, that provision has been made in that for all problems. Practice may show in future that changes have to be effected. Problems which arise at this stage and to which we try to find solutions in this Bill are, for example, the question of what the position is in respect of extensions. One may find the case of two farms situated on either side of a hill near an urban area. The urban area is now going to be extended in that direction. Farm A, which is situated nearest the urban area, is developed as a township. Before Farm B, which is situated just over the hill can be developed as a township, however, the area concerned is proclaimed a dam basin control area. If provision had been made otherwise, such a dam basin control area could have been kept in operation for an indefinite period. In that case the owner of Farm B would in fact not have been able to claim compensation in due course for the township he was unable to establish as a result of the proclamation. Serious questions arose with regard to the payment of compensation, questions such as for what kind of damage a person could claim compensation when could his claim arise and, the most serious question of all, when would such a claim become prescribed? Another question which occupied our attention was whether the State could maintain such a proclamation for an indefinite time.</p>

<p>When one considers these questions, it is clear, as the hon. the Minister also indicated, that this drastic measure, as embodied in clause 3, will have to be applied with great circumspection in future, but is, for various reasons, an extremely essential one. One of these reasons for example, is that this clause in its present form will obviate land having to be acquired at absolutely excessive prices at a later stage. Compared to what the prices are at present, for example, the prices would be excessive as a result of an increase in the value of land but mainly as a result of improvements effected on the land concerned in the course of time. Another advantage which arises from this is that the Minister will now be able to expropriate land at a much earlier stage than was possible in terms of existing legislation. What flows from this is that such expropriated land may subsequently be leased to farmers within that proclaimed dam basin control area. Furthermore, the practice we have at present is that it is not possible to commence the acquisition of 1and for the purposes of constructing a dam before a White Paper has been tabled, or, in the case of smaller schemes, before funds have been provided on the Estimates. Details in this connection have already been furnished in this House. The other important aspect to be found in this is that the right of the owner in respect of prescription is now being protected.. In paragraph (d) of the new section 59 (4) it is stated very clearly that any debt coming into existence by virtue of the provisions of paragraph (c) shall not be prescribed.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister already referred to the permit question. I should just like to refer in passing to the whole problem of irrigation boards. The hon. member who spoke before <span class="col_6007-6008" refersTo="page_0151"/>me dealt more in detail with this matter. I only want to point out one aspect, however, which is not very clear from the Bill and that is that in the event of an equality of votes in the election of a chairman in terms of the provisions of the clause at present applicable to irrigation boards, there are applicable regulations in which provision is made for what procedure is to be followed by the Minister to cope with such an equality of votes. A matter which cannot be over-emphasized either as far as this clause is concerned is that in spite of all the problems created by irrigation boards for the Department and for the Minister and in spite of the fact that a great deal of patience was exercised in the past, as will be exercised in the future, the fact should not be overlooked that all these provisions in respect of irrigation boards were introduced mainly with a view to water conservation in South Africa. That was the main object. In this legislation no punitive measures are being made as far as irrigation boards are concerned. Another important aspect is that it has happened in the case of many irrigation boards that the irrigation board, with the present system of electing members, was dominated by the larger irrigators. The small irrigators did not get their rightful representation on these irrigation boards. The legislation at present under consideration makes provision for proportional representation.</p>

<p>In addition there is another aspect which is of importance. This is as far as clause 8 is concerned. Clause 8 provides that the hon. the Minister may take over certain waterworks under certain circumstances. But what is important here and what should not be overlooked is the fact that the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; is used and not the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister does not want to take over these boards or these works permanently. The irrigation farmers and the irrigation boards should keep this in mind. When inefficient boards are taken over, for example, because they are not doing their work and do not want to hold their meetings, and I have already given particulars of this to hon. members, this is done not with the motive of being autocratic but simply and solely in the spirit that if there is any improvement in the situation, the work may be handed back to such a board. In terms of existing legislation the hon. the Minister may also abolish a board if the board is making things difficult for him. Here I am referring to section 95 (2) (iii), as it is applicable at present. The position is in fact that the hon. the Minister may take over the works of a board and may abolish a board. The Minister may also take over its works without abolishing the board, but the important aspect which arises from this is the attitude with which this will happen. If the necessary co-operation exists, those works will be handed back. If the necessary co-operation does exist, no board in South Africa need be the least concerned about the operation of this Act. Another important aspect which arises from this legislation is a matter which may again be argued under the Vote of the hon. the Minister, and that is the increased provision of stock-watering schemes in South Africa. There are very large areas in South Africa which could be used very fruitfully if Government stock-watering schemes could be provided. The subsidy applicable to stock-watering schemes is being increased in terms of this legislation. The subsidies are not being increased with regard to water used for irrigation schemes but for agricultural purposes, including grazing purposes.</p>

<p>Clause 12 is one which on the face of it seems to be drastic as it has the effect that the owner of land who uses Government water or water which is subject to the operation of this Act has very little chance of being acquitted in any prosecution brought against him. But even from this an innocent person has nothing to fear. The provision contained in clause 12 is one which has been in our legislation for many years. The same clause is contained in the Liquor Act, in the Price Control Regulations, which used to be in operation, as well as in the Penal Code. This clause is an extremely essential one because water is being wasted to an alarming extent in South Africa by people who do not want to observe the provisions of the Water Act as they do not want to make the necessary repairs to their canals and do not want to carry out the instructions they receive from their boards, or from the Department or from the Minister. They are criminally liable under certain circumstances. Water is also being wasted to an alarming extent by people who steal water. When one starts talking about cases of water theft, the tales are as legion as those about diamond thefts. I am no authority on the methods applied by them: there are irrigation farmers in this House who may have more knowledge about those methods than I have. Perhaps it is not a good thing to discuss the methods as other people may become more clever. The fact remains, however, that as a result of water theft there is a tremendous wastage of water. Consequently it is necessary for this House to tell those people that they will no longer be able to get away by putting the blame on Piet, Paul and Klaas; now the blame will simply be put on the person responsible in the first plase, i.e. the owner of the land. He must realize that he will have to exercise proper supervision to see to it that his employees carry out the necessary works on his farm. He must also see to it that his employees use only the water to which he is entitled and that he does not use water belonging to another. Although on the face of it this clause may seem very drastic to the layman, the innocent person has absolutely nothing to fear. It is necessary for this clause to be in the Act, and it has been introduced by the Department as it is an essential one in view of the fact that the main object of the legislation is the promotion of water conservation in South Africa.</p>

<p>Clause 13 of this Bill now before this House <span class="col_6009-6010" refersTo="page_0152"/>relates to South-West Africa. This clause is also a particularly important one as in terms of the provisions of this clause the first four sections of the Water Act of 1956 are being made applicable to South-West Africa. The first four sections are extremely important ones. These sections deal, firstly, with the word definitions, secondly, with the powers of the Minister which are set out in detail, thirdly, with the appointment of the Secretary and staff and, fourthly, with the protection of certain rights. The Water Ordinance of South-West Africa is not being repealed by this legislation. There are many reasons for this and the most important one is that the existing Water Ordinance of South-West Africa was drafted on the basis of all the finest provisions in our Water Act; if I am not mistaken, this Ordinance was drafted in 1968. These provisions were taken over and in addition to other fine provisions already applicable to South-West Africa, they were made applicable by means of an ordinance of the Territory itself. The clause as it stands, will also ensure the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> in South-West Africa until such time as the necessary regulations are promulgated. There is no hurry to promulgate these regulations immediately or to repeal everything in South-West Africa as the existing legislation and the provisions of the regulations provide that this may happen in due course. It is extremely important for this part of the re-adjustment to be effected as well. When one has regard to the fact that the water resources in South-West Africa constitute only one-twenty-sixth of the resources of the Republic, it is essential for the water legislation of South-West Africa to be very strict and to be applied even more strictly than in South Africa. When one has regard to the fact that in the whole of South-West Africa there is not a single permanently flowing stream of water, one realizes why this is necessary. As the hon. the Minister indicated, this legislation is in the spirit of the re-adjustments as set out in paragraph 110 of the memorandum tabled earlier this year. Consequently it is essential for us to proceed with these things in the same spirit.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have referred in broad outline to a few of the most important provisions of the Bill, and I should like to confirm once again that this Committee, of which I was the Chairman, was convinced, as I am sure this whole House is, that every provision in this legislation is extremely essential because of the urgency of our water position in South Africa and that everything should be put into operation so as to ensure the highest possible degree of success as far as our water conservation endeavours are concerned.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to comment on what was said by the last two speakers who discussed this Bill as they have covered it fairly fully and have dealt with the important principles and main clauses. I believe they have covered the subject well. I must say that I believe the hon. the Minister took a step in the right direction when he referred this Bill to a Select Committee. The subject of the Bill in itself, as we know, and as we have heard, is very important, namely the water of our country. A Bill of this kind should follow the lines of long-term planning, and this is something we have needed for a long time. The country has experienced serious droughts during recent years and this resulted in a serious shortage of water over the whole country. It is therefore necessary that we consider long-term planning in this regard to-day, especially in a country such as South Africa where we have an irregular rainfall. While we have an irregular rainfall, we also have a very large catchment area, but this large catchment area again creates problems too. Our storm-water has to be conserved, and it carries a large proportion of silt with it. There is also the problem of a growing population and a growing economy requiring more and more water.</p>

<p>The main provisions of this Bill are to provide for more effective control over the use of our public water supplies and for better planning of future water conservation works. In clause 1, I am satisfied that with the evidence we on the Select Committee were able to collect and with the able assistance and guidance of our officials, we were able to produce a good provision, in that local authorities, provided they seek the permission of the Administrator concerned, and that of the hon. the Minister, are able to tap more than 1 million gallons per day from a public stream. Not only this, local authorities will be able to take water from a public stream on which an owner of land may have riparian rights. What satisfies me is that the local authority concerned shall pay to such owner such compensation as may be agreed upon, or failing agreement, determined by a water court. Dam sites, or dam basin control areas have already been mentioned and I believe the clause relating to this, namely clause 3, is one of the most important clauses of the Bill. I believe it is the crux of the whole matter. It is something which has been a problem for many years. We have so frequently seen that certain areas are developed by the South African Railways as well as the provincial administrations, the construction of railway communications and national roads, buildings and structures too numerous to mention. What I want to impress on this hon. House to-night is that so often we find that when a defined area is declared a &#x201C;Dam basin Control Area&#x201D;, this area has to be expropriated at tremendous cost, due to lack of long-term planning.</p>

<heading>Question:</heading>

<li>(1) Whether students of the University College of the North recently made representations on grievances to the rector or acting rector; if so, what was the nature of the grievances;</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_bantu_education" to="#suzman">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. The representations were in connection with (a) the refusal of the Senate in 1968 to allow students to issue a statement in which they associated themselves with the sit-down strike at the University College of Fort Hare and in which they also sympathized with the students who had been suspended on account of the sit-down strike; and (b) the resolution of the Senate that students may not affiliate with NUSAS.</li>

<li>(2) No steps have been taken because (a) the students’ representative council passed a resolution last year not to issue a statement in connection with the sit-down strikers at the University College of Fort Hare and the representations can, therefore, not be regarded as a valid grievance; and (b) for understandable reasons the Government is not prepared to approve of affiliation with a controversal white students’ organization such as NUSAS.</li>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill has reached this stage without amendment, and we on this side of the House remain opposed to it, particularly to the contents of clause 1 of the Bill. Sir, during the discussion of this Bill Government members have ranged far and wide in references to matters which are blatantly undesirable publications and which are of a patently pornographic nature. But, Sir, this Bill as it is now before us does not confine itself to publications of that nature only. The Bill will give the board far wider powers than it presently has and will have far wider effects on the publishing world. Sir, it should not be necessary for me to say that the Opposition is opposed to and will assist in keeping away from the public publications which are obscene or indecent or blasphemous. We are naturally opposed to them, but this Bill, if it becomes law, will affect a far wider field of publications. We believe that prosecution, in terms of the law, as it is at present, is the best deterrent to the publication of undesirable matter and will provide the means of preventing such publications which have given the hon. the Minister cause for concern. The Minister, after expressing the view that these powers should be given to the board, referred to the difficulties in instituting prosecutions which were referred to by Mr. Justice Maritz; they were quoted with approval by the Minister, but, Sir, those had reference to the legislation which existed prior to 1963; they had reference to the old Cape Act of 1892 and the Entertainment Censorship Acts which had been passed in 1931, 1934, 1939 and 1953. Those difficulties are not present in dealing with the principal Act which the hon. the Minister now wishes to amend. These difficulties disappeared when the principal Act of 1963 was placed on the Statute Book. Powers to bring offenders to trial should be used and I believe that the penalties which are provided for in the principal Act are sufficiently high to act as a deterrent without the necessity of taking these further powers to prohibit publications in advance.</p>

<p>Sir, this Bill, if it is passed in its present form, will substitute a board for the courts of this country in deciding whether there has been a contravention of the Act or not, because we will now have the situation where we will have parallel jurisdiction as far as the courts and the Censorship Board are concerned. We will have the situation that the Act prescribes a crime and makes provision for the power to prosecute but the board may have no regard to those provisions. On the other hand, the board itself can decide that a publication is undesirable and, having taken that decision, it can act as though it was a conviction in a court. Sir, that is an undesirable set of circumstances to have. As I have said, it is virtually parallel jurisdiction of the courts and the Censorship Board. I believe that what we have in this Bill as it is now before us is another instance of the creeping extension of bureaucracy in controlling the every-day lives of the people of South Africa. It will place in the hands of the board, whose members are appointed by the Minister, powers which are far reaching and which are unnecessary. I would <span class="col_6029-6030" refersTo="page_0162"/>say that our objections to the Bill as we now have it before us at this Third Reading, may be summarized as follows: Firstly, that authority is given to the Publications Control Board to prohibit as yet unprinted editions of a periodical; secondly, that that power can be exercised by the board in the future without a course of conduct having been established on the part of the publisher, and the Minister cannot argue that a course of conduct is evidenced by one publication of one undesirable article. Sir, the periodical is not to be looked at as a whole, but is to be judged upon one article that appears in that particular periodical. Thirdly, the board may be motivated, in coming to its decision, by a number of considerations which have no reference to indecency or obscenity or blasphemy; it can have reference to publications which in the opinion of the board, bring sections of the public into ridicule. Is a publisher of satire in regard to public persons now, because of this Bill, to have the sword of Damocles perpetually hanging over his head? Is satire, because it results in a certain amount of ridicule of public figures, to disappear now from the literary life of South Africa because the board may feel that the publication of that satirical article may result in certain members of the public being ridiculed? Sir, the board can also base its opinion on what it regards as harmful to good relations between sections of the community, without reference to indecency or pornography or blasphemy. Sir, one wonders whether the board in its wisdom may not decide that the publication of political differences between parties in South Africa is to be the preserve of the members of the N.P.U. who are not subject to this Bill, and whether an independent publication, which appears in periodical form may now have restrictions placed upon it if it were to publish political matters of such a nature. Because, Sir, the members of the N.P.U., the daily Press, are exempt from these provisions.</p>

<p>If one turns to section 6 of the principal Act, one finds there that in so far as the court is concerned, there are certain presumptions which arise if certain matters are dealt with in what the court regards as a harmful way; they are murder, divorce, infidelity and other matters which appear in novels and are accepted in novels from day to day.</p>

<p>It is accepted that at least murder occurs on several occasions in the thrillers which so many of us enjoy reading for relaxation, but there are guide-lines set down for the courts. But what is the position of the board? The Appeal Court has told us that when it views a matter which comes before it under this Act, the test that is applied is the effect upon the ordinary reader, who is neither a prude nor a libertine, in the words of the Appeal Judge. But there are no such guide-lines given to the Publications Control Board. It can sit in solemn conclave on its own and make a decision as to what it considers undesirable without the matter having gone to court to be tested. For the rest, the public and the publishers are at the mercy of the board. We must remember this. The Minister will say to me that when the board gives a ruling of this nature, the publisher affected can go to court on appeal, but what happens in the interim? Either the appeal must suspend the order of the Censor Board, and if it does the publisher goes on with his publication until that appeal is finally disposed of in the courts, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of the appeal, or the publication must be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal. As the Minister knows, appeals are not only time-consuming but they are expensive. It may well be that after many months a publisher is able to satisfy the Appeal Court that the order should not have been given initially by the Control Board, but by that time he is out of business or he has sustained colossal losses through the suspension of his publication. He will be off the market by that time. It is most unfortunate that the Minister does not see his way clear to accept the amendments we have suggested, because censorship in itself is an infringement of the rights of individuals, and as such it should only be applied when no other course is open to eradicate the evil. I emphasize what I said before and I repeat that we on this side of the House believe that the sanctions provided by prosecution and punishment for the criminal offence which is created in the principal Act are a sufficient deterrent and are more desirable than the extension of the powers of the board to regulate the conduct of society, as it will now be able to do in terms of the powers contained in this Bill.</p>

<p>There has been in the past a great force to control publications and to regulate society, and that was public opinion, but with this erosion of the matters left to the public conscience and with this growth of bureaucracy, public opinion is disappearing. The man in the street sits back now and says: The Publications Board has approved, or has not approved; he never applies his own mind to see what is good and what is bad in literature, and one gets a negative and impassive approach from the general reading public to the publications they are now permitted to read. The life of the individual is becoming so circumscribed that he now finds himself abiding by the dictates of boards of various kinds rather than by the dictates of his own conscience. This Bill extends that process. Although it is in keeping with Government policy and Government administrative procedure, it certainly does not carry our support and we will oppose the Third Reading.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point has talked a good deal more now without really saying anything. I just want to make use of this opportunity to point out briefly that the main objection hon. members opposite are raising, and which was again stated by the hon. member for Green Point, is in fact hanging in the air. In principle they actually want no Censor Board, and the <span class="col_6031-6032" refersTo="page_0163"/>excuse is that the possibility of prosecution in the courts is a sufficient deterrent for anyone who publishes the kind of literature or the kind of publication which is destructive, harmful or undermining. But it has specifically been proved in our courts that in most oases it is impossible to prove that the law has been contravened when it comes to harmful, destructive and immoral publications of this kind. We had an example of this only last year. The hon. member for Green Point knows very well that it appeared in a court decision last year that it is always possible to find people to explain away the worst pornography or even blasphemous things and to say, for example, that they are satirical and actually contain nothing harmful. This was specifically demonstrated in public. I therefore want to tell the hon. members for Green point and Pietermaritzburg (District) that it really is a disappointment to me that we find this attitude on the part of the Opposition that they agree in broad principle that there are many things which are undesirable, but nevertheless oppose this legislation, even up to the Third Reading stage. I think we have enough common ground on this side and on that side, i.e. that we are dealing with a Christian people and a Christian community. We need not weigh Calvinism or liberalism against each other here and try to stress differences in that way. We have a common Christian basis, and I think we can at least accept that we acknowledge this in the broad sense and should like to maintain it, that we want to develop our national character instead of breaking it down, and that we want to exclude from our national life the harmful things which are published, not to serve the community or the people, but solely with the object of making profit, and which have the detrimental effect that our moral standards are being broken down. I say that is why I personally am disappointed at the whole attitude of the Opposition. In fact, Sir, you will admit that people such as the Murrays and the Robertsons, and many others in our national history made a particularly valuable contribution in helping to build up these standards, of which we are proud.</p>

<p>Yes, and we are grateful for that, and that is why I say we have a great deal of common ground, and for that very reason I am all the more disappointed at the attitude of the hon. member for Green Point. I want to ask the hon. the Minister not to pay serious attention to the considerations and objections that have been put forward here, but that we should try to preserve the essence of things, the essential things. We must try to preserve and reinforce the accented Christian standards: we want to develop these and we do not want to throw them to the wolves.</p>

<p>The Press in general, i.e. the members of the Press Union, are specifically excluded in this legislation, but nevertheless I just want to say that it is perhaps possible and desirable that it should be said here that the Press too will help to develop these standards we are referring to, and that they will not use their protected position to help to break down those things that are precious to our national character. I therefore want to express the hope that the hon. the Minister will use his influence as far as possible to urge the Press in South Africa to greater responsibility in supporting those bodies that are seriously working towards building up our national life and our national character, and to maintain our moral standards on the highest possible level.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Piketberg has touched upon a point with which I will deal a little more fully later, but in direct reply to him I want to refer him to section 5 (2) of the principal Act. It lays down the conditions under which a publication or object shall be deemed to be undesirable. Paragraph (a) says that if it or any part of it is indecent or obscene or is offensive or harmful to public morals, and paragraph (b) says if it is blasphemous or is offensive to the religious convictions or feelings of any section of the population, a contravention is committed. If this Act only contained those two provisions, I would agree wholeheartedly with the argument of the hon. member for Piketberg, but when we go on further and look at (c), (d), (e) and (f) and the petty&#x2014;I am sure they are petty&#x2014;conditions which are laid down, then we cannot agree with his argument and we cannot accept this amendment which the Minister now brings before the House.</p>

<p>The effect of this Bill which is now reaching its final stage in this House is that the hon. the Minister gives to the board the clairvoyant powers I have referred to during the Second Reading; that this board can now prognosticate as to the possible nature of future publications, and of course that the board can then act on those prognostications. But it is a question of interpretation, as was said by the hon. member for Green Point. The hon. the Minister, in his reply to the Second Reading debate, said that why there had been so few prosecutions was because of the difficulty of proof of the contravention of any of these provisions laid down in section 5. He is imposing the burden of proof in regard to those provisions laid down in section 5 not only in respect of a publication which is in print, but he is placing the burden on the board to prove that those provisions have been flouted and he is also placing the burden on them to say that they will be flouted in the future. I cannot understand this logic. As far as I am concerned, it is not logic. In section 5 the question of ridicule is raised, namely if certain people or a section of the community is ridiculed, and I put the question to the hon. the Minister the day before yesterday in the Committee Stage quite straight: Does this mean that he can use this section of the Act against <span class="col_6033-6034" refersTo="page_0164"/>publications such as <i>Veg</i> and the <i>S.A. Observer,</i> which repeatedly bring certain people of this country into ridicule and even bring a certain religious section into ridicule? Is it the Minister’s intention to get the board to use this provision to act against those publications? The Minister did not reply. I can only now assume that my reading of this is correct and that he can, and that the board possibly will act against these publications in the future.</p>

<p>Yes, it might be an autonomous body, but it will be bound by the law, and this House is now passing a law which will bind the board. Anyway, I look forward with relish to a reply from the Minister.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect I want to raise with the Minister. A commission in the United States of America a few years ago investigated certain right-wing organizations. These right-wing organizations posed as the soul of moral rectitude and as the guardians of the morals of the country. We have such right-wing organizations in this country. That investigation brought to light the fact that these right wing organizations obtained their funds from pornographic publications, sex and sin sheets, the more lurid photo-news magazines and from other publications of this nature. The commission found that the sex factor, particularly, was blatantly exploited by these right wing organizations in raising funds to do the exact opposite. As they put it, they stood for the protection of the morals of the country. But they exploited this sex factor through these magazines to raise sufficient funds. They also exploited this sex factor to reach the people to whom their right wing message was directed, and, subtly involved in this sex and sin that was presented in these publications, was their right wing propaganda. As I have said, there are such right wing organizations in South Africa. I wonder if it might not be in the interests of the country if the hon. the Minister or his board were to investigate the very point that I am raising now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Piketberg said that he was disappointed at the attitude which we have taken up, particularly in regard to the guardianship of the morals of this country. During my Second Reading debate speech I quoted from George Bernard Shaw, where he likened the morals of a nation to a person’s teeth. He drew the analogy that the more decayed the teeth were, the more tender they were if they were touched, and that the more decadent the morals of a nation were, the more tender they were and the more prone to offence they would be in these matters. As I have said I was personally offended by the films I have mentioned, namely Prudence and the Pill, Interlude and others. I was also offended by the cover picture of the magazine which I sent to the hon. the Minister. I have been offended by certain of the comic strips, picture magazines and even by books which I have picked up in book stalls throughout the country and read. But I submit that my morals have not suffered as a result of this offence. I do not think that my morals have suffered. I want to go further and say that I have faith in the morals of South Africa and I do not believe that the morals of this country are affected by these films and publications.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to say a few words. I want to appeal in all seriousness to the hon. the Minister not to continue with the Third Reading of this Bill. If, however, he finds it necessary to let the Bill pass through the Third Reading stage, I want to ask him whether he will not consider not proceeding with it in the Other Place. The reasons for my asking this are twofold. In the first place, we saw in the Second Reading Debate and in the Committee Stage that the hon. the Minister quite candidly expressed his own misgivings about the new powers now being granted to him. I do not have his Hansard speech before me, but we on this side appreciated the fact that he indicated quite candidly that the present situation was not satisfactory, and definitely not to him as Minister either.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in respect of films. As I said, we appreciated the fact that the hon. the Minister was so candid as to say that he was not completely satisfied and that he was looking for new solutions himself. This is the one reason why I am asking that, in the first place, the Bill should not be passed here, or that it should not be proceeded with in the Other Place. The second reason is that I do not believe the hon. the Minister can really be satisfied with clause 1 as it now stands in the Bill, and with the effect that it will have. The hon. the Minister must Concede that the principle involved in it is a bad one. Unfortunately we have also had the situation now that the hon. the Minister was not prepared to make provision in the Bill for this bad principle at least to be applied in a reasonable way. We cannot repeat arguments that have already been advanced, but the hon. the Minister will concede that censorship is a matter of opinion and that there is great difference of opinion among people about what is good and what is not good. The Minister himself quoted the example of how he took a few members to a film show and that there was great difference of opinion among them. It stands to reason, therefore, that a reasonable difference of opinion about what is good and what is not good may just as well develop between the board and a publisher outside.</p>

<p>Yes, certainly, but what chance is there for a publisher who sincerely does not want to offend, really to acquaint himself with the ideas of the board, other than through clashing with the board?

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Most certainly. I say this, because we are dealing here with legislation which gives the board the power to ban a whole series of periodicals on a mere presumption, even before the board has read the second article. We can see what has happened in practice. With the publication of the series &#x201C;The Book of Life&#x201D; the board thought fit to approve of one or two editions of it, but it banned one or two editions. In other words, it did not ban the entire series. That proves that it does not necessarily follow that if the first edition is not approved of, the second edition will not be good either. This is demonstrated from time to time. The power being granted here is that if the board merely presumes that the second edition in the series will not be good either it may ban this edition as well. So, in effect, on a mere presumption the doors can be closed on a matter. As I have said, I think this is a bad principle, and it is a pity that there is no provision for such a bad principle at least to be applied with reasonableness.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Omaruru did mention that a publisher has the right to appeal. That is true, but in the meantime a good deal of time is usually lost, and time is money, and one feels that an equitable arrangement ought to be made in this connection. In conclusion I want to say that it is quite clear to me that the hon. the Minister is acquainting himself with the functions of the board and it is also very clear that the hon. the Minister is taking trouble to examine the functions of the board. The same also applies to the new chairman, Mr. Jannie Kruger. There is every indication that he is doing his best in connection with the functions of the board. But both the hon. the Minister and he are fairly new in their respective positions, and I think it would have been much fairer if the hon. the Minister, who is a relatively new Minister of the Interior, and the new chairman of the board had given themselves a little more time to get acquainted with these problems of the board. It is for this reason that I want to suggest that the hon. the Minister should not proceed with this Bill at this juncture, but should rather come along next year with legislation which has been more carefully considered, and that he should then refer the subject of it to a Select Committee so that we can all see whether we cannot find better methods as regards the aspects about which the hon. the Minister himself has misgivings. What difference can six months make? I want to give the hon. the Minister the assurance that if he does that, he will find that he will also get the full support of the Opposition, so that we can create the best possible censorship machinery.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who has just resumed his seat, made quite an argument of my having openly said in my reply to the Second Reading Debate that I had certain misgivings as regards certain provisions appearing in this Bill. I said by way of interjection that those misgivings I expressed were expressed in connection with films, and not against clause 1, to which the hon. the Opposition has objections. I think that if my interpretation is correct, the Opposition acknowledges that clause 2, which deals with films, is probably an improvement on what we had before. They as well as I, however, have misgivings about it, and I still have misgivings as to whether this procedure is a good one. You will remember that I suggested that it would perhaps be best if the Publications Board obtained the final authority in regard to films as well. At present we have the position that there is a right of appeal, and we should like to improve this right. This is what I had misgivings about, and not about clause 1, which is the point at issue. About clause 1 I had no misgivings at all. I am convinced that what we are doing now, is an improvement. I say this with conviction, because we have until now had the system in terms of which imported series could be banned, and this system has worked well. There are no fundamental objections to it. The only objection the hon. member for Green Point and the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg can raise against it is that we can institute criminal proceedings in respect of local series. This is the only argument they have, but as I said, this system has worked well in respect of imported series. Both the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. member for Green Point tried to create the impression here that we were trying to put public opinion under restraint, and that the board now had the final say, so that public opinion no longer applied. I want to tell hon. members that this is not the case. Both the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. member for Piketberg referred to the newspapers and the members of the Press Union. You will remember that I said on an occasion at Colesberg last year that the Cabinet was considering whether it should also investigate the freedom of the newspapers that are members of the Press Union. I should like to show hon. members on the other side the stacks of letters I received in support of the idea I expressed at the time.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but that is the way the people feel. Hon. members on the opposite side want their own personal opinions in respect of any matter to prevail, but public opinion is there and I am convinced that public opinion is on our side in this matter. If I look at the newspapers which, as I have said, are not controlled by this section, then I must say that they also transgress, not through their reporting as such, but their magazine sections, which actually fall in the same category to-day as a weekly, monthly, or periodical publication. These magazine sections are no longer news media. They contain articles, and those articles also contain transgressions. As a result one begins to wonder whether one should not differentiate between the newspaper itself and its magazine section. In fact, I am giving serious consideration to this matter at the moment. Last year I indicated that something might be done in respect of the matter raised by the hon. member for Piketberg. Proposals have been submitted to the Cabinet, but up to the present no decision has been taken. J say this because I think it is in the public interest that it should be said. At present no decision has been taken yet that steps are going to be taken. However, this does not mean that the matter has been shelved. The Press Union came to see me and expressed the opinion that the procedure they are following now, the procedure with the Press Board, was a good one and would enable them to keep their own house in order. I want to give them the opportunity of keeping their house in order. I should therefore like to announce now, also because I have been requested to do so, that it has been decided for the present to do nothing as regards the exclusion of members of the Press Union as far as this legislation is concerned. At the same time, however, I want to point out that in my opinion the magazine sections of their newspapers fall in the same category as the publications against which we propose to take action here.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think what we are doing here is right and fair. The Publications Board consists of 11 members at present, persons selected for the task they have to perform and persons who are exceptionally well equipped for the task they have to perform. In my opinion no one is better equipped than they to judge what should be done. After all, the board as a whole meets from time to time in order to determine standards according to which action is to be taken. With all respect to the hon. member for Green Point, who, as the hon. member for Piketberg said, has such a good name, I want to say that in my opinion it is ridiculous to suggest that we want to obtain the power here to ban a little political paper.</p>

The question is not what the name of the paper concerned <span class="col_6039-6040" refersTo="page_0167"/>is. The question is whether the contents of a periodical are harmful to our nation. Now the hon. member wants to know from me whether we are going to take action against <i>Veg.</i> Apparently he likes this little periodical because it seems to be echoing his sentiments. After all, the hon. member said he was a &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D;. He is against this photograph he sent me.</p>

<p>I am not interpreting my own opinion now. But apparently the hon. member is concerned about <i>Veg.</i> That is why he now does not want us to do anything about it. But, as I said, what matters is not the name of a publication, but whether its contents are harmful. I wish to give the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. member for Green Point the assurance that the Publications Board acts according to the sound judgment it has at its disposal. Moreover, the board’s actions are not such that they cannot be changed. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout himself referred to the &#x201C;Book of Life&#x201D;. But in that case the position was completely different. In that case the Publications Board apparently had <b>the whole</b> series at its disposal before it made a decision. In the case of publications appearing <b>periodi</b>cally the Publications Board usually does not have the entire series at its disposal. Here we are now giving <b>the board the power, if it is of</b> the opinion that an article in a subsequent edition of a publication may be harmful, to take action against it. Nevertheless the possibility of negotiations remains. In fact, the legislation specifically provides for it. The Publications Board may, if it deems fit to do so, withdraw any prohibition by way of notice in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> So this is not a matter which is going to be handled with an iron fist. On the contrary. The procedure is flexible and adaptable; it is subject to negotiations that may take place between the board and the publisher.</p>

<p>In the circumstances I am satisfied that the arguments advanced by the Opposition do not hold water and that the contents of this Bill can only be of benefit to us.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a most important administrative measure. We support it, as we have also done at the Second Reading. However, at this stage I should like to make one or two observations, because of its importance. The establishment of a Bureau for State Security has the unanimous support of this House. It is not necessary for me to emphasize the very heavy responsibilities that will devolve upon this Minister and the administrative head of this bureau. As the House knows, we shall not be informed of the identity of the persons appointed, of their terms of appointment, of their remuneration or of the expenditure incurred. All we are doing is to vote a globular sum. We appreciate that this of necessity must be so and that very little information will reach members of this <span class="col_6041-6042" refersTo="page_0168"/>House and the public about the activities of this bureau. The extent of its success will be gauged only by the extent to which our Defence Force is able to prepare itself for eventualities on the assessment of information passed to it by this bureau, the extent to which life in South Africa continues in an orderly manner and the extent to which activities of a criminal nature, threatening our public security, are contained and the law breakers brought to the courts. It is only from that that we shall know to what extent this bureau is succeeding, by a process of deduction. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister if he would as from the Opposition convey to General van den Bergh who will be the head of this bureau our good wishes for its successful establishment and successful launching, and to express our confidence that he and those whom he appoints to his staff will enter upon and discharge these onerous duties in a manner which they will be satisfied with and in a manner which is for the benefit of all of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on page 546 of the Order Paper there appears a motion which I should now like to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Committee of the Whole House on the Soil Conservation Bill have leave to consider the advisability of making provision therein for the establishment of a Soil Conservation Advisory Council.</block>

<p>I merely want to give, briefly, the reasons for my motion. During the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister held out the prospect that he would, in fact, appoint such a soil conservation advisory council. While it is his wish that such a body should, in fact, be created, I consider it only right that this legislation should contain reference to such a body. I think that that wish of his for the creation of such a body is also the wish of the South African Agricultural Union. On occasion they have also expressed the wish that successive Ministers of Agriculture would, in fact, also be bound to establish such a soil conservation advisory council. Since one is dealing with such an important aspect of agriculture as soil conservation, I find it only right that a co-ordinating body in respect of all activities concerning soil conservation should be established. In the past this co-ordinating work was done by the Soil Conservation Board. In this legislation toe Soil Conservation Board is being done away with; it is therefore essential that there should be a body which would take over its task and thereby fill that gap.</p>

<p>The next reason why I think that the House should accept this instruction is because toe hon. the Minister must, in any case, obtain advice in this respect. Unfortunately he cannot lay claim to all knowledge in respect of the problem of soil erosion and conservation in South Africa. The extent of the problem is undoubtedly too great and therefore the hon. the Minister will have to be advised. If this is his wish, why is it not entrenched in the legislation?</p>

<p>But I think that the most important reason why there should be a soil conservation advisory council is because it is not only toe Department of Agricultural Technical Services which is involved in this matter, but also the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and the Department of Coloured Affairs, because they control areas to-day where tremendous soil erosion is taking place. When such a co-ordinating body exists it can also include the various departments, and toe correct advice can also be given to the hon. the Minister in the oases of areas which fall under other departments. By means of this Council toe correct advice could also then be given to the various departments concerned. I hope that the reasons which I have given are <span class="col_6043-6044" refersTo="page_0169"/>sufficient for the House to decide on the acceptance of this motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if there have ever been arguments which have convinced the House that the Minister’s idea is correct, it is precisely the arguments used by the hon. member for Newton Park. In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Minister already indicated that the crux of the matter was that he would, in fact, nominate an advisory council. One asks oneself whether that advisory council should be laid down by legislation and whether the Minister’s speech is sufficient to ensure that such a Council would, in fact, be appointed. The hon. member has just mentioned that there are various bodies and departments concerned in this matter. When such a council must be appointed within the framework of an Act, the Minister’s powers are limited within the Act, while our whole point of departure with this legislation is to make it more streamlined and to expedite matters. Now the hon. member wants it laid down by statute that the Minister should be compelled to follow certain courses, while there are various departments involved. The way should be left open for the Minister so that he has free powers to nominate the Advisory Council. If such a provision is laid down by legislation, the Minister must act according to that legislation. This is the only difference. What difference does it make whether one now lays down by legislation that the Minister should appoint an Advisory Council or whether one gives the Minister a free hand to gather whatever advice he regards as necessary? The whole idea is to streamline the machinery and to eliminate delays which took place in the past as a result of cumbersome machinery, and therefore we agree with the Bill which the hon. the Minister has submitted here. He will, in fact, be able to nominate advisory committees and an Advisory Council, but we agree that it is not necessary to lay this down by means of legislation. I think that the right thing to do is to give the Minister a free hand in this connection.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I wish to support what the hon. member for Newton Park has said. He has said that the proposed Soil Conservation Advisory Council will be the successor of the Soil Conservation Board. Sir, over the years the Soil Conservation Board, constituted in accordance with the provisions of the principal Act, has done outstanding work. I think this is common cause, and proof of that is the fact that during the Second Reading debate speakers on both sides of the House quoted very extensively from the annual report of the Soil Conservation Board. In fact, they quoted far more extensively from that report than they quoted from the report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. That is not surprising because the report of the Soil Conservation Board runs into something like 32 pages whereas the Department itself only devoted some 12&#x00BD; pages to soil conservation in their report. I do not want to list all the fields with which the Soil Conservation Board has busied itself over the last year, but this is an indication of the very wide field that they have covered and of the very excellent work that they have done. It is absolutely essential therefore that something should take the place of that Board. Sir, the hon. member for Christiana has said that it is not necessary to lay this down by law. In the Second Reading debate, however, the hon. the Deputy Minister had no criticism of the Soil Conservation Board. He did not seem to suggest that his hands had been bound in the past by the fact that the constitution of the board had been laid down by law. When we look at the constitution of the present board, we see that the other Government Departments, for example, that would probably be represented on the Soil Conservation Advisory Council, are in fact represented on that board, and they would be the natural ones to be represented on the new Advisory Council, namely, the three agricultural departments, the Department of Forestry, the Department of Bantu Administration and the Department of Water Affairs. Sir, the question is whether this can better be done by regulation or whether it should be laid down by statute. I want to advance this argument that the present Minister may well be in favour of having such an advisory board constituted by regulation, but this is no guarantee to us that his successor might not like the advice of that board. He might not agree with their recommendations. For that reason we feel that it is essential that this should be laid down by statute.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot discover why the hon. member for Christiana is opposed to the instruction which was moved by this side of the House. Here we are dealing firstly with a Deputy Minister who has his heart in agriculture, who has both his feet in agriculture, who knows what the problems are in this connection and who also knows that the South African Agricultural Union feels very strongly about this matter. The day before yesterday in the Second Reading debate I asked what this Bill contained that would give the farmers greater confidence in the Act and in the administration of the Act. If there is one thing which would give the farmer greater confidence in the legislation, it is the establishment of a statutory advisory council in connection with soil conservation. The day before yesterday I referred to other advisory councils which were established by regulation. What became of them? I can think of very few advisory councils in the field of agriculture which are still in existence to-day. There were advisory councils in connection with agricultural schools, in connection with agricultural education and in connection with research, and many of these advisory councils were dead and buried long before they were properly in operation. If the Deputy Minister or the Department can mention any sound reason why legal provision should not be made for the establishment of <span class="col_6045-6046" refersTo="page_0170"/>an advisory council we would gladly listen to it. Hon. members on that side made mention here of committees and councils which could advise the Minister. But he is under no obligation to appoint such committees and councils. It appears to me essential that an obligation should be laid upon the Minister to establish an advisory council. The day before yesterday I also referred to all the powers which the Minister has. The law makes provision for quite a number of matters in connection with which he may issue directions. It is even provided in the Act that if any contingency which is not defined in the Act, should arise the Minister himself may issue directions in that connection, and then he must surely have the advice of an advisory council in that connection. I can think of matters which fall beyond the affects of the legislation and the Minister will still always have the power to issue the necessary directions in that connection. It is a pleasure for me to support this instruction and I hope that we shall have the hon. the Deputy Minister’s co-operation in that connection.</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot agree with the United Party on this suggestion of theirs. After all, we have many councils in our country which are not appointed in terms of legislation. The hon. the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, for example, is not a statutory body. It is not our intention not to consult the Departments. If we appoint such an advisory council, we shall have the power to appoint whom we please and to ask any of the Government Departments to assist us. Reference was made, for example, to the Departments of Coloured Affairs and Bantu Administration. We can ask any of those Departments to help us, but we can really see no reason why it should be a statutory council. It would not facilitate our task in any way, and I think that the Opposition should not be dissatisfied if we do not accept this suggestion of theirs. After all, we are going to achieve the same object and we are going to appoint a council, constituted as we think fit.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This clause is the one which deals with the point I raised yesterday. We are not opposing the clause, but I think it is of sufficient importance to ask the Deputy Minister to give us some elucidation in regard to it. We are in the position that, taking a wide view not only of agriculture but of the fertility of our soil, we have to recognize that soil and water conservation go together. Now nature does not worry about the Votes we have in Parliament. It makes it difficult for us to deal with them here, but nature is not concerned. But to try to bring some order into our Votes and for the purpose of discussion in debates, we have the Minister of Water Affairs with his Department and his problems and we have the Minister of Agriculture with his Department and his problems. The two are like oil and water; they do not mix, which is a great pity, because in practice they go together. When you are dealing with soil conservation, it is extremely difficult <span class="col_6047-6048" refersTo="page_0171"/>to know how to deal with it without dealing with water conservation. But in this clause they are brought together, as I said in my Second Reading speech. Here, clearly and concisely, the objects of the Bill are set out in clause 2. They are to make provision for the combating and prevention of soil erosion, the conservation, protection and improvement of the soil, the vegetation and the sources and resources of the water supplies of the Republic. It is in that regard that we would like some elucidation from the Minister. What are the provisions he sees and the powers which are conferred upon him as distinct from the powers vested in the Minister of Water Affairs to deal with the sources and resources of the water supplies of the Republic? Had those last two lines been the object of an Act coming under the control of the Minister of Water Affairs, it would just about have summed up the whole of his interests and we are very concerned, because of past history, that there shall be no overlapping, that there shall be no confusion. We want a clear line drawn as far as possible between the functions of the one Department and those of the other. We are concerned basically with soil and water conservation, and in regard to this clause we want to ask the Deputy Minister how far he sees his Department dealing with the sources and the resources of the water supplies of the Republic.</p>

<p>I can appreciate that the hon. member for South Coast is concerned about the problems in regard to water, but the two Departments, Water Affairs and Agricultural Technical Services, are co-operating very closely as far as these problems are concerned. We will have persons representing Water Affairs on the advisory committee on which we voted a moment ago, but I want to mention the catchment area of the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam as an example of what is meant by this clause. We intend to take drastic steps there, to withdraw stock and to spend a large amount of money to condition the soil in order to prevent the dam from being silted up. But the dams belong to Water Affairs and the two Departments will act in close collaboration in an attempt to solve these problems of which we are all aware. The idea behind this clause is to view the water and the soil as a whole, even though they fall under two different Departments.</p>

<p>I sympathize with you, Sir. I did not draft this. As far as the Deputy Minister is concerned, may I say this. Co-operation between the two Departments in terms of a Committee is fine, but what we are now talking about is the law and I want to take the case of a farmer with difficulties, because we want to have as little confusion as possible in connection with soil and water conservation. A farmer may have difficulty. I am sorry the hon. member for Mooi River is not here. Here is a farmer who has had practical difficulties. He can go from department to department and there is a well-known principle which is apparently accepted to-day known as the &#x201C;passing of the buck&#x201D;. We do not want to have that principle embodied in this Bill. We want to know for certain, and in the case of the ordinary unfortunate farmer from the backveld like myself who has to read a legal document and has difficulty, who does he go to in connection with the sources of a water supply? He sees something to which he takes exception; he believes his water supply is being adversely affected. Does he come to the Minister of Agriculture and say: Here is my problem; this is going wrong; can I appeal to you to put it right? Or will he be told to go to the Minister of Water Affairs? That is the crisp problem. May I ask the Deputy Minister to whom does he go in regard to these matters, in regard to the sources of our water supplies, when he wants the matter to be put right?</p>

But if this specific farmer has any trouble about water supplies, I think it is very easy to make a division there; then he must go to the Department of Water Affairs. We can go into the matter, but I do not see how you can have an Act giving definite definitions as to what falls under the Department of Water Affairs and what falls under the Department of Agricultural Technical Services.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>What I want to say on clause 3 is not affected by the amendment moved by the hon. the Deputy Minister. Provision is made here for the Minister to give written notice to the owner or occupier of land to declare a direction to be applicable with reference to land mentioned in such notice relating to a whole list of matters in respect of which he can declare a direction to be applicable. This clause is of the very greatest importance to the Bill before us, because in respect of all these matters which follow in clause 3, right down to the end, hereafter provision is made for the Minister to enforce compliance with all these matters. The Minister can enforce compliance. These are matters which can be extremely costly. The Minister can enforce compliance to the extent of making the farmer pay. Provision is made under certain circumstances for a farmer to apply for relief, but in the meantime compliance is demanded and payment has to be made. As I say, some of these works can be very costly.</p>

<p>I will deal with the cost later on, but the crisp point here is this. One of our difficulties is to keep control of the works which are being undertaken all over the Republic in connection with soil conservation. If the Minister directs the farmer in respect of any of these matters, what is the method of notifying the neighbours? Because notice can be given in the <i>Gazette,</i> or by written notice to the owner or occupier. If written notice is given to the owner of a piece of land, how do the people in that area know that the Minister has ordered that man to do just that? Either there is going to be an inspectorate large enough to be able to cover an inspection of all those areas in respect of which the Minister gives a notice. He issues an instruction and the inspector will now have to go and see that the instruction is carried out. If there is to be an application for, let us call it, compensation or a refund or part refund of the money spent, it will be necessary, but there is a provision in this clause that when once works are constructed they must be maintained, and quite rightly.</p>

<p>In principle we can have no objection to that, because it is no good carrying out such works as are envisaged in this clause and then, those works having been done, within the next two or three years they are allowed to decay and all the time and effort and money are wasted. They must be maintained. Here it seems to me we come to the crux of one of our difficulties in dealing with the heart of the soil conservation problem in South Africa, namely that what is to be done shall be recognized; the instruction shall be issued that it is to be done, the work must be carried out, and it must be maintained. If we could do that all over the Republic, our soil conservation problems are over. That would solve the whole thing, and I think the Minister will agree with me. May I say that we are trying to help. We think the Minister has got here an impossible task on his shoulders, but we would like to help and where these practical matters are concerned we want to raise them and say to the Minister: This is the problem as we see it; can you tell us how you envisage it?</p>

<p>Because in this matter neighbours are very often the best people to talk in a friendly manner to a neighbour and say I understand that you received instructions to do such-and-such a work, and provision is made hereafter <span class="col_6051-6052" refersTo="page_0173"/>for work on other farms, to be carried out on a neighbour’s farm in such a manner that it creates no fresh danger and that it does not result in damage to that neighbour’s farm, or it may actually be beneficial to that neighbour’s farm. Provision is made here. The hon. the Minister can order a neighbour to do work on his neighbour’s farm, and so forth. But how is the hon. the Minister in fact going to see to it that the majority of the people there are made aware of the order so that when it is carried out, it will be recognized as being part of a plan for the soil conservation in that area? It may be a key farm. I know of many such cases and I want to come back to some of them later on. Unfortunately we have not reached the clause yet and I cannot come to them. We have had cases where a key farm is a question that had to be dealt with, because from that farm damage is resulting in a group of farms. It is this question of notification that I am concerned with. How is the hon. the Minister’s notice served and how is control maintained over works which are carried out in terms of clause 3 of this Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for South Coast should keep in mind that a direction can be served on a group of farms in a district or it can be published in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> Let us take the case of a farm where the water from the neighbour who has drainage channels causes erosion on a particular farm. This work is planned jointly and this is where the importance of the committees come in. The committees are still there to discuss the matter with the farmers; the problem is then solved jointly and the work is not done individually. As in the past, the work is done jointly, wherever it is practicable. Drainage channels draining away the water from the farm of one particular farmer are constructed across the farm of another. The scheme according to which a particular district is to be planned, is announced in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and serves as the notification to the farmer.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>No, but this is how it will be done in practice. The committee will still be active. The hon. member for South Coast said that the matter had to be followed up and I agree with him in this regard. It is no use doing all this work and then allowing it to fall into disrepair. The committee will see to it that this work is maintained. This is also the object of this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, am I correct then to understand from the hon. the Deputy Minister that the direction will only be issued by the Minister in respect of an area which has been planned and which includes a group of farmers? Will the direction only be issued when there is a group of farms which has been planned and after it has been approved of? I do not think that is what this clause means. The hon. the Minister can do this without a plan and he can also do it in respect of an individual land holding, what we call a farm. A farm has not been defined for the purposes of this Bill with the result that in the case of small holdings and people who go in for intensive cultivation with about 25 acres of land, if a man dies and the executors of his estate do not look after his land, as far as soil conservation is concerned, that that piece of land can then be a menace to the neighbours. We may have such cases. The hon. the Deputy Minister can step in and say to the trustee of that piece of land that he has to go on with the work and that he has to protect that piece of land, and so forth. That is the meaning of this clause.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The power is here for the Minister to deal with an individual piece of land but the reply the hon. the Deputy Minister has given me seems to indicate that he anticipates this power of a direction only being applied where there is a group of farms in respect of which a soil conservation scheme has been worked out under which all those farms are brought in. In that scheme the group of farms falls under the direction of the Minister. This direction will be applicable to all the farms and will be published in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> I suggest that this clause does not mean that. The first portion of clause 3 (1) states as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, either by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> or by written notice to the owner or occupier of land referred to in such notice, declare a direction to be applicable with reference to land referred to in such notice &#x2026;</block>

<p>It may therefore be one or the other and is not merely a notice published in the <i>Gazette.</i> I have given the hon. the Deputy Minister an opportunity to look at his notes and get this matter clear, and I wonder whether he can now tell us what the position is.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister something by way of explanation. I now speak with particular reference to the Karoo areas. In the past we had what is called a farm plan which was drawn up and served upon every farmer in that particular area. In this particular clause there is reference to a direction. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if a farm plan is now replaced by a direction and if this direction will apply to a soil conservation district or will it apply to each particular farm or to each particular owner in the area. Will the direction take the form of the farm plan, which I presume it now replaces?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as in the past, a diagram of the farm will still be drawn up and the work will be done accordingly. The matter will still be planned as under the old system and I fail to see the hon. member’s problem. Surely this work cannot be carried out if the co-operation of the owner has not been obtained? A farmer will be told to apply conservation measures according to the directions. The position will be very much the same as in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not have a problem but I just want clarification because the mechanics of this matter is very important. One cannot declare a plan for a district as a whole.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I also want to refer more to the Karoo than to other parts of the country. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that the direction could be given either to an individual farmer or to a group of farmers. I am thinking specifically of the Vlekpoort area, the Noupoort area and other areas where the mountain slopes are of such a nature that if planning is applied there, they would never again be released for grazing. Where is the Minister authorized to purchase or to expropriate or to deprive the owners of that land so that it can never be used for grazing purposes again? It is not a question of temporary withdrawal, but of permanent withdrawal. These areas will never again be used for grazing purposes and they will have to become overgrown, otherwise the erosion will never stop. Does this clause authorize the Minister to take steps of this nature, because that is essential?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question on the same lines with reference to paragraph (e) of clause 3 (1). This paragraph mentions the &#x201C;protection, temporary withdrawal from grazing and stabilizing of any soil surface&#x201D;. The hon. member for East London (City) has talked about the permanent withdrawal of grazing and the hon. the Deputy Minister replied that the power to expropriate exists. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister how far he has it in mind to go with this temporary withdrawal of grazing. Is this merely the normal withdrawal from grazing of a portion of a farm under the soil conservation plan applicable to that farm? In certain areas, for example, farmers are sometimes directed to withdraw a quarter of their farms from grazing for a complete growing season. Does this Bill go further than that? Does it, for example, cover the situation that we have in certain areas of the Eastern Cape at the moment where there has been a very bad drought and where the topography of the land is such that although the lower-lying areas, which are warmer, have been able to recover with the late rains, yet in the higher-lying areas, which are cold, there has not been sufficient time before the winter to allow growth to take place. In a situation such as this where not the whole district is affected, but areas within a district, it will be difficult to apply the veld reclamation scheme. Particular farms will have to be isolated. Another reason is that it may not be necessary to apply the veld reclamation scheme. One does not want to withdraw sour veld grazing for more than one season. The owners are in the position that they have very little grazing and if they dispose of their stock, they will have no income.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I understand clause 3, it means that the hon. the Minister has the power to serve a direction on a specific farm or on a specific area. In other words, every farmer and every land-owner can be compelled to do everything laid down in clause 3.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 3 contains a very important principle, and the point I want to raise with the hon. the Deputy Minister, is that assistance can only be obtained from the State after the provisions contained in paragraphs (a) to (n) have been complied with and if a farm has been planned. The point I want to raise with the Deputy Minister is that there are a large number of small farmers in the country, and there are people who are not in a financial position to do these things. I want to ask that before these directions are served on the individual farms, it should be taken into account whether these individual farms have actually been planned. If not, the farmer has to comply with all these provisions contained in clause 3. but he will not really be entitled to his subsidy. The hon. the Deputy Minister said it would still be done by means of a farm diagram and schedule. I agree with all these directions that may be served, but when it is demanded that all these directions have to be complied with, I think the Department should also agree that this will not be done until the farm has been planned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in regard to the withdrawal of portions of grazing land, I should like to inform the hon. member for Albany that we had the case of Namaqualand yesterday, where one part of the constituency had had rain and the other part had not. One farm had had rain and another had not. As a result the district was not declared a drought-stricken area. We are going into that problem to see whether we can find a solution, because the rain fails in belts. These committees will have to advise us when an exception has to be made. They may recommend that a particular farm should be withdrawn for a longer period. Stock may be withdrawn for as long as six years. Hon. members must remember that we want to save the soil. We shall not be stingy for a few rands and allow the stock on the grazing land again as soon as the first rains have fallen, if we can save the soil. We want to apply these measures in a practical way.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park expressed his concern, and it is true that a person will not be helped if he does not comply with all these directions. But we want to apply these measures in practice as they were applied in the past. For example, when a person puts up a fence, he can still get a subsidy for it, even though he has not carried out all these works. It will not necessarily happen, as the hon. member said, that a person must do everything in the correct way before qualifying for State aid. As in the past a person, even though he may have failed to do certain things, may still receive a subsidy when putting up a fence or building a dam, for instance, and if it is done according to the directions.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are faced with a certain amount of difficulty in regard to clause 4. Clause 4 is inextricably bound up with clause 6, but we cannot deal with clause 6 because we have not reached it yet. Let us first of all establish clearly what the purport of clause 4 is. In terms of clause 4 the Minister issues a direction to the owner of land to construct and maintain certain things on land belonging to that owner or on land belonging to another person. The instruction is issued to a certain person to carry out certain works on his own farm, or on land belonging to a contiguous owner. In terms of subsection (2) this direction shall be served on the owner concerned, and if the work has to be done on land belonging to another person, a copy of the direction shall be served on the other person as well. I want to say at once that I am afraid we are getting bogged down here. I am very sorry, but, according to the explanations we are getting, this does not seem to be quite right. This clause now makes it abundantly clear that we are not referring to a scheme where there are a number of farms which have been planned in terms of a farm planning scheme. Individual farms are being dealt with here. This clause makes provision for the Minister to serve a direction on an owner, and to say to him: &#x201C;Go on to your neighbour’s farm and do certain work on that farm.&#x201D; This is done, irrespective of whether that person is doing any work on his own farm or not. This does not therefore refer to a scheme, a group of farms which has been planned. This clause refers specifically to work on a particular farm. Subsection (3) of this clause deals with the costs. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The costs of the construction and maintenance of any soil conservation works constructed under the provisions of this section shall be borne by the person who has been ordered by the Minister to construct such soil conservation works.</block>

<p>In terms of this clause, if we do not take clause 6 into account, the Minister says: &#x201C;You must go on to your neighbour’s farm, and do certain work, and then in terms of subsection (3) of this clause, you pay for it.&#x201D; The Minister therefore directs a person to go on to his neighbour’s farm and do certain work, and th&#x00E9;n that person has to pay for it himself. It is true that provision is made later on for a come-back, but we have not reached that point yet. At this stage this is the position. Mr. Chairman, what machinery is set up here to deal with this particular problem? Standing alone, as this provision does now, we are faced with certain difficulties. I do not know whether the Deputy Minister wishes to deal with this matter now or whether he wishes us to wait until we deal with later clauses which make provision for compensation.</p>

<p>As I said yesterday, I was brought up in an Afrikaans-speaking household. It is because of that that my English does not come easily to me. It is because of that and because of the fact that farmers like to be on friendly terms with their neighbours; they do not like to take strong action&#x2014;prosecuting and things like that. Here we have a similar position. However, the Minister goes further because as far as I am aware we have never had the right to order a farmer to go on his neighbour’s farm to do work and on top of that to tell him that he has got to pay for it. What I should really like to have from the hon. the Deputy Minister is how an advisory committee will work under these circumstances. How are they going to remain friends with their neighbours, many of whom are their relations? The Deputy Minister knows of communities in which relatives are dotted all over the place. If a member of that community likes to take a strong line and be obdurate, what is he likely to find in the way of social ostracism and other types of trouble? Because he is the man who has to advise the Minister in terms of this Bill. He is the man the Minister can tell to go on to his neighbour’s farm to do work. I am sorry, but I cannot see how this is going to work in practice. [Interjections.] I couldn’t catch what the hon. member for Christiana tried to say but I do not know whether he would like to be in that position.</p>

<p>That is the very reason why we have this clause here, for the water of the neighbour to be &#x2026; I know the hon. member for South Coast has problems of this nature in his constituency. This thing of planning a farm separately is impossible sometimes. This has to be done on a basis which includes other farms. Yet a notice is served on each person individually. The committee then meets and along with the extension officer it decides that a drainage channel should be constructed over the land of one of the neighbours. This clause empowers us to do so and to recover the costs thereof from the owner concerned. He simply has to fall in with this. He will receive his subsidy and we shall accommodate him as far as we possibly can, but he cannot say that the water should not be brought any further than his fence. Under the circumstances I simply cannot understand what the problem of the hon. member is&#x2014;if the hon. member can only tell me what his real problem is. Whether notice is served jointly on a district or only on individual farms, does not make any difference. We only want the power to say to a man that a drainage channel is to be constructed over his farm for the provision of water to his neighbours and that he has to fall in with that.

<p>Mr. Chairman, things are not as simple as the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to pretend. Let me give him an example in order to illustrate the powers which the Minister is requesting in this legislation. Suppose one has a neighbour whose farm is situated higher up than one’s own, whose veld is situated on a steep mountain slope and that farmer is not in a position to undertake the work there. As a matter of fact, the only work which can be undertaken there is to construct 50 or 100 concrete or stone walls. Now the person is ordered by means of a direction to go on to that land and to construct those walls. But this involves much more. In the first place, he has to maintain those walls. He may be ordered by means of a direction to do so. Apart from the right of recovering the costs from this owner of the veld situated on the mountain slope who allows over-grazing on his land and who allows his land to wash away, the problem still remains. This is not a question of constructing a drainage channel over the land of the next person. There is a water course and there is nothing one can do about it, and while he has constructed weirs and works in that water course, soil erosion continues. This legislation now empowers the Minister to give the right to farmer A, over whose land the water is to come, to construct waterworks, erosion works, on the farm of farmer B. The Minister as a practical man will know that if such works have to be constructed on steep slopes the only thing one can do is to construct numerous small stone walls in an attempt to arrest erosion. And after these works have been done, the question of maintenance still remains. Somebody has to do that. Can any Act be so impractical as to lay down that the Minister has the right of recovery if he cannot do so? Should the Minister pay this as a subsidy, the maintenance cost as well, for all time to come? Surely, Mr. Chairman, one cannot have an Act like this.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I consulted the Secretary and asked him whether I was stupid as I could not understand what the trouble was. He told me that he, too, could not understand what the trouble was. I cannot see what the difficulty of the hon. the Opposition is. We must have the powers and the committees. You agree with that. The committee consists of practical farmers who know what the problems are. They recommend the construction of a drainage channel. Now the hon. member for East London (City) says that we are going to recover the costs from the farmer on whose farm the drainage channel is constructed. We have to recover the costs. If the farmer is not in a position to bear the costs, the committee will, after all, inform him that the conservation work has to be done and that the farmer will not only receive a subsidy of 55 per cent but will in fact receive a larger subsidy. The only problem is that the State must be able to take certain steps. What we want to obtain by means of this legislation is the powers which will allow of those steps being taken. I cannot make out what the problem of the Opposition is in connection with this matter.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with due respect to what the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, did I not make myself clear? The problem does not merely involve the serving of directions instructing the man over whose land the drainage channel is to run to do the work. The example I mentioned was that of a natural, dry river course running over a man’s land. Nothing can be done about that. That is the water course. But now take the example of a few thousand morgen of mountainous land which is so steep that a baboon needs a walking stick to make his way to the top. Suppose there is a whole number of water courses which run over that mountainous land. The only way of doing something in that regard is, in the first place, to withdraw the land from grazing and, in the second place, to block all the water courses running down that slope with as many walls as possible. A direction to construct such weirs is served on farmer B. He then has to construct the weirs and maintain them, because farmer A does not have the means to do so. Now we come to the sixty-four million dollar question. In the first place, must B, over whose farm a natural water course runs and for whom there consequently is no need to construct such weirs, construct weirs on the land of A? The reply is in the affirmative as a direction may be served on him. If the direction is not served on him but on contractors and the Department bears the costs of constructing those weirs, the works on the farm of A still have to be maintained. Then the direction is served on B that he has to maintain the works on the land of A for 20 years. It is then registered against his deed of transfer that those works have to be maintained on the land of A.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that problem will only arise in very exceptional cases. Most of these works are of a permanent nature. They do not always require maintenance. If a concrete or stone wall has been constructed properly, such a wall is of a permanent nature. If we had to define all these problems in legislation, however, it would be very difficult.</p>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 19 and 29, respectively, to omit &#x201C;the Minister&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;an arbitration tribunal appointed by the Minister and consisting of the magistrate of the district concerned (who shall be the chairman) and one representative each of the Soil Conservation Advisory Council, the Minister and the Department&#x201D;; and to add the following subsection at the end of the Clause:</block>

<block name="quote">(3) The provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1965 (Act No. 42 of 1965), shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply to an arbitration tribunal appointed in terms of the provisions of this section.</block>

<p>What the provision in the Bill amounts to is that when the Minister has ordered someone to construct any works as a result of which the value of the land increases on the completion of those works and the two owners cannot come to an agreement, the Minister has to determine the amount. My amendment reads that the amount shall not be determined by the hon. the Minister but by an arbitration tribunal consisting of the local magistrate, a representative of the Soil Conservation Advisory Council as well as one person from the Department of the Minister. I cannot see why the hon. the Minister should take this power on himself to determine whether the value of the land has increased or decreased. In my opinion, often in the execution of a work of this nature, as the hon. member for South Coast also said, it is extremely inappropriate for the matter of determining the extent of the increase or decrease in value to be left in the hands of the Minister. I think he is letting himself and his Department in for a great deal of trouble. Why not leave the determination of the amount to a completely impartial arbitration tribunal? Surely such a tribunal will come to the best settlement. In terms of clause 4 the Minister will be able to decide whether or not a man should do the work on another man’s farm. After the work has been completed, the Minister shall decide whether there is any increase or decrease in value. When the two farmers are unable to come to an agreement as to that amount, the Minister is the <span class="col_6063-6064" refersTo="page_0179"/>person who decides on the amount of the payment. I think this is completely wrong. Why should the hon. the Minister be the right person to determine the amount in this respect? We feel that it would be much better if that were to be done by a tribunal of this nature so as to make the fairest proposal to a farmer and so as to allow a farmer to put in a reasonable claim in cases where farmers cannot come to an agreement. That would eliminate a great deal of difficulty and would not saddle the Minister and his Department with so many problems. Consequently I move the amendment, as printed.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think my colleague, the hon. member for Newton Park has raised a very real difficulty here and I want to take it a step further. I want to refer to clause 5 (1) (a) which reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may on application by the owner of land who has constructed any soil conservation works (whether of his own volition or after having been ordered to do so in terms of section 4 (1)), which in the opinion of the Minister have increased the value of land &#x2026;</block>

<p>So far there is no provision which allows a man to go of his own volition on to his neighbour’s farm. Does this provide the statutory authority for him to do so? Is that what it purports do do? Is this purporting to give a man the legal right to go on to his neighbour’s farm, because it says clearly enough that &#x201C;on application by the owner of land who has constructed any soil conservation works (whether of his own volition or after having been ordered to do so) and he increases the value of land belonging to another person etc.&#x201D; such and such will be the position. In this particular clause, as the hon. member for Newton Park has pointed out, the question of compensation arises; the question of assessing the value of the wonk done also anises, and not merely the physical work, but the benefit to the farm of the work done. This is one of the clauses where the hon. the Minister can delegate his authority to somebody else and I can assure the hon. members on that side of the House that we on this side of the House do not want that. If this kind of dispute arises between a man and his neighbour, we want to know that we can go to the Minister. I want to be able to come to the Deputy Minister, when I have a case like this and tell him that it is unfair. I want to be able to put my case before him so as to get evenhanded justice for the man who feels that he has been badly treated and who has not received adequate compensation. I do not want to have to go to one of his officials. What does it behove me if I come to Parliament and under the Minister’s Vote complain about the way an official had treated somebody who is a farmer in my constituency, or as the case may be? The first thing I am told is that the official is not here to defend himself. We know under Parliamentary procedure the Minister is the man who is responsible. But in practice we find that you do not do it. I want this clause to be accepted together with clause 20 and the power retained in the hands of the Minister. Let the Minister be the man&#x2014;whatever time this is going to take and however much he may have to curtail his golf or anything else&#x2014;who deals with this question of compensation when it has to be worked out. This is a matter between neighbours; this is a matter which can create a bitter feud in an area, and we want to be able to go to the Minister and say: &#x201C;It does not appear that this man has had a fair deal here,&#x201D; and we want to be able to put the case before him and perhaps he will be able to get a grant from the Land Bank to help us out&#x2014;a grant recommended by the Minister, of course. On the other hand, whatever the position may be, we want the Minister to be the arbiter here. He is taking the power; it is only the Minister who issues the directives and we want him to determine the amount of the compensation.</p>

<p>In whatever way this may be done, whether it is on the advice of the local district committee or on the advice of the technical officer of the Minister, a direction is served on a person to construct certain works on his own land or on the land of another man. This creates problems, as I repeatedly said a short while ago. The hon. the Deputy Minister said a case like that might be an isolated one, but apart from the fact whether these will be isolated cases or whether there will be many such cases, it still remains a problem. Sir, as the hon. member for South Coast said, the last thing in the world a farmer should do is to look for trouble with his neighbour, because once he has had trouble with his neighbour it continues to exist like a festering sore which will not heal. First a direction is served on one to do the work and then the Minister has to recover the costs of the improvement of the land from the other man. That man, in the first place, did not have the means to do the work, and therefore the Minister will also be unable to recover the costs of the wonk from him. Where in this legislation does it say that the Minister will compensate one for the work one has done, irrespective of whether or not the other man has the means to pay for that work?</p>

<p>I am coming to that. What procedure will be followed in terms of the clause as it stands? The Minister will issue certain directions; he will follow the usual administrative procedure, and if difficulties should arise in the end, the matter will be referred to the Minister. This is exactly the same principle as that which we followed in the Water Act, i.e. that the Minister gives the final decision as regards the payment. The Minister is the person who is accountable to this Parliament for his deeds. If any injustice were to be done to anyone, the Minister would be in a vulnerable position because he is accountable to this Parliament. In other words, the Minister will exercise that power, not only in consultation, but very honestly and sincerely to the best of his ability in order to expedite soil conservation in South Africa. By placing that power in the hands of the Minister we are introducing the same principle here, and I think it is no more than right that the powers should be in his hands as he is ultimately accountable to Parliament for his deeds. Therefore I support the hon. the Deputy Minister fully and I hope he will stand by his original clause.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, we have not dealt with this question of &#x201C;his own volition&#x201D;. I must admit that I cannot believe that this is statutory authority for a man to do something which, in the one case, is going to increase the value of his neighbour’s property and, in the other case, under subsection (2) (a), do something of his own volition which will reduce the value of his neighbour’s property. This is not statutory authority for him to do such a thing. We do not want to pass legislation which is just going to create law cases. Here we are going to give the man the right to do something of his own volition; that is to say, he is not ordered by the Minister to do so. The Minister does not come into it now; the Minister is shouldered completely <span class="col_6067-6068" refersTo="page_0181"/>out of the picture. You have a farmer now who does something of his own volition and then his neighbour claims that it has detrimentally affected him; he claims that his neighbour’s property has been increased in value because of what he has done. Is this legal authority for him of his own volition to do work which affects his neighbour’s property beneficially or detrimentally?</p>

<p>Sir, we said during the Second Reading debate that this Soil Conservation Act would be a topic of discussion for a very long time, and that it would have to be amended many times. In practice there will be snags, but as far as this specific point is concerned, if the man, along with his committee, carries out the directions applicable to the farm concerned, surely he has no difficulty as that committee has advised him how things should be done. But in order to construct conservation works it is sometimes necessary for one to have permission to go on to the land of a person, and one must give people authority to do so. I cannot see how this can cause trouble. Unfortunately we cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park.

<p>Now I understand. The Minister is saying that his door is open to any farmer who is aggrieved, and not that he has a right of appeal to him as a statutory right in terms of the Bill. But this still does not answer the question. It still does not answer the problems raised in this debate. The hon.member for Christiana says the Minister is the person who should have the final say because he is subject to the sanction of Parliament. Sir, I do not think Parliament is going to be interested in any individual case of arbitration where the Minister has to make a decision as to what compensation should be paid to a person who has constructed soil conservation works on his neighbour’s farm. That is not the point at all. What we are trying to get is a fair assessment of the compensation due. We must accept now the provisions of clause 4, because they have been adopted by the Committee. So now we accept that the Minister can by direction tell a farmer to do certain work on his neighbour’s or anybody else’s farm. Then he talks about compensation and he reserves unto himself the right to decide the amount of that compensation. The purpose of the amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park is to say to the Minister: Why do you want to involve yourself with this? You say your door is open and anybody who wants to appeal to you can come to you at any time, but let us have a board, a body which will be constituted of people with local knowledge, with expert knowledge of the value not only of constructions that have been done but also of the land, and let them deal with the question of compensation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot understand this. Now the hon. member for Christiana says this will happen, but where does it say that this will happen? Clause 23 says the Minister can delegate any power to any senior official of any department, not that he can delegate it to a magistrate or a representative of the Soil Conservation Committee, or a representative of a farmers’ association. This is the whole intention behind this. I want to ask the Deputy Minister to reconsider his decision. I feel that this is a perfectly reasonable request put forward by the hon. member for Newton Park. It will facilitate the work, because it will take the load off the Minister and his already seriously depleted department. He knows they are overworked and have not the time to do these things. I want to appeal to him to reconsider his decision in regard to the amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park.</p>

<p>Now I want to come back to another point which I must admit had missed my attention until it was raised by the hon. member for South Coast. That is in line 10, where it says that the Minister may on application by the owner of the land who has constructed any soil conservation works, &#x201C;whether of his own volition&#x201D; &#x2026; There is nothing in clause 4&#x2014; and I submit that this clause must be read in conjunction with clause 4&#x2014;empowering a person to go on to his neighbour’s land to construct soil conservation works, and therefore I would say that this is quite out of place in clause 5, which is consequent upon the provisions of clause 4. I am wondering whether the <span class="col_6069-6070" refersTo="page_0182"/>Minister and his officials have considered this point, and whether perhaps this should not be referred to the legal advisers. My knowledge of law is not all that good, but I think this is a valid point which the Minister should apply himself to, and that he should consult with the law advisers on it.</p>

<p>The reply the Deputy Minister gave a short while ago gave me more cause for concern than I had before, i.e. when he made the statement that when a settlement had to be made between neighbours and they could not come to any agreement the applicants could go to court. The Minister knows what the result of something like that may be and what problems and costs that involves, for example, had a water right been affected; was it running water or not? Endless arguments may arise in a court in this connection and that is why the hon. member for Newton Park asked for arbitration. The Deputy Minister referred to the costs of establishing an arbitration tribunal, but they are minimal in comparison with the costs to the individual to go to court. The Deputy Minister admits that the legislation will have to be amended many times. I wish he would assist us by amending it at this stage already, seeing that we are faced with these problems. Take another case: The lower end of my farm borders on a municipal area. The town council decides that if they were to construct a wall on my property five yards from the boundary that would assist them to arrest erosion or it would increase the flow of their water or something of that nature. They damage my property by driving about in lorries to collect stones and material. The Act gives them that right; the Act empowers them to do so. Now I want compensation because they had damaged my work. Their construction is neither of any significance to me as it is situated near my lower boundary nor would I have constructed it. At the moment we are faced with these problems, and this amendment represents a reasonable request for provision to be made for the establishment of an arbitration tribunal to which any owner may go for a decision. Who is to decide now? The Minister?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>That town council has to obtain authority from the Minister to execute that work. If the hon. member is of the opinion that we do not want to accept this proposal of the hon. member for Newton Park concerning the matter of appeal, the only reason for that is that I shall ask the hon. member next year how many mishandled and dissatisfied cases had come to his attention. I say you will not find them. After all, our object is not to anger the farmers; we want to co-operate with them. Why chase up hares at this stage, i.e. that he should appeal and create all these different kinds of problems? If in practice it should appear at a later stage that it is necessary to establish such a tribunal we can do so.</p>

<p>Is the Deputy Minister able to mention one argument to me why he is in a better position than an arbitration tribunal to determine the value?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I am not in a better position, but there is a practical committee that understands the problems and it advises the Minister as far as that specific area is concerned. Now the arbitration tribunal is to sit in Pretoria, whereas there is a lot of trouble in the Western Province. These things have to be maintained and this involves additional expenditure.</p>

<p>And that again means a great deal of additional expenditure. If there will be so many cases, we may discuss this matter again next year. I said adjustments would have to be made from time to time. And hon. members should not think that I am being contrary by not wanting to accept these things, but do they know that we have been discussing this legislation since September and that we have weighed up all the practical problems. It is possible for one to find fault with the wording of this, but here we are dealing with something different, with a farmer who has to apply soil conservation, and this one cannot write into an Act. [Interjection.] There is no need for you to protect me against the farmers, because I shall always treat them very sympathetically. Therefore I think we should not Chase up hares now.</p>

<p>I have never heard any excuse for not establishing an appeal court which is as weak as that just given by the Deputy Minister. He says next year we can tell him if anybody suffered an injustice and then we can appoint some form of appeal board. [Interjections.] It is like the Minister of Justice saying that he will not appoint an appeal court unless you can prove that some injustice has been done and then he will appoint it. Surely, the Minister wants to lock the door after the horse has bolted. He should make provision now to see that no injustice is done, and not wait until an injustice has been done and then say he will appoint an appeal board. I ask the Minister to give this point some consideration during the lunch hour. He says he does not need protection because he will always be sympathetic to the farmer.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister said before we adjourned that neither he nor the Secretary of his department <span class="col_6071-6072" refersTo="page_0183"/>understood the difficulties that we on this side of the House foresaw with this clause. I cannot understand the attitude of the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Newton Park. After all, what is the object of this clause? The Minister may, in terms of clause 4 (1), issue a directive to owner A that he must construct certain works on the ground of owner B. Now, owner B may not feel that those works are of any benefit to him at all. But if in the opinion of the Minister they are of benefit to owner B, owner A must pay a certain amount of compensation to owner B. If the two owners are unable to agree on the amount to be paid, the Minister again must decide how much will be paid. Surely, this is setting up the Minister, who has made the initial directive and in whose opinion it is beneficial to owner B that that work should be done, more or less as judge in his own case, which is a bad legal principle. For that reason I think that the amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park should be acceptable to the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>Apart from that, the Deputy Minister has said to us that if we have difficulties in future with the implementation of this clause, it will be time enough to introduce amending legislation to put the matter straight. The Deputy Minister did not seem to appreciate that our whole function in this Committee is to try and make the Bill as watertight as possible and to try and obviate difficulties which may arise in future. I also do not think that he has appreciated that the arbitration body, as proposed in the hon. member for Newton Park’s amendment, will not be a body which sits in Pretoria. It will be an entirely local body, composed, in the first instance, of the magistrate of the district concerned, who is a local person but nonetheless impartial, and at the same time a man with legal experience. Then there will be a member of the local soil conservation committee, who knows the local conditions and lastly, a member of the Minister’s own department, who might perhaps be the local soil conservation officer or might be sent down from the headquarters of the region for this purpose.</p>

<p>In view of that, we are trying to help the hon. the Deputy Minister. We are not trying to obstruct him in this matter: but there should be some impartial body which will decide on a matter like this. I have much pleasure in supporting the hon. member’s amendment.</p>

<p><b>Clause 6:</b></p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause is the one which we could not refer to earlier on. It is a clause which authorizes the hon. the Minister, subject to such conditions as he may determine, to pay subsidies or make grants in connection with the construction of soil conservation works or the performance of any act in compliance with a direction. The position therefore is that the payment is not only for soil conservation works, but it may be in respect of other associated activities. Here the following question arises. I take it that from year to year Parliament will be called upon to vote a globular sum; because clearly, we cannot in advance estimate how much money is going to be required to deal with the financial commitments under a clause of that character. Nobody can say, when the Estimates for the following year are being made, that R&#x00BD; million, R1 million, R2 million, R3 million or R4 million will be <span class="col_6073-6074" refersTo="page_0184"/>required. Nobody knows. It is quite impossible to tell. If it is a very bad drought year, people may wake up and find that a lot of money is required. If there are big interests and big works involved, a lot of money will be required. On the other hand, the amount might be small. So, there can be no real estimate. The hon. the Deputy Minister during the Second Reading debate indicated to this House that he had made up his mind to see that people who are entitled to receive their subsidy, refund, payment, the money, the cash, shall receive it with the minimum of delay. The old laborious method of certification and so forth, shall be put to a short cut and the money shall be available quickly. Of course, that is highly desirable from the point of view of the farmer who is doing the work. It encourages him to think, if he implements soil conservation measures, that he is going to receive his money quickly. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister: Does he still stand by the statement he made the other day when he said: &#x201C;If they pay before certification, what does it matter if they lose R&#x00BD; million or R1 million for that matter? As long as the work goes forward and as long as they are in a position to pay quickly, everything is in order.&#x201D; Therefore, this question of estimates does not really arise, apart from the fact that a fixed amount will have to be voted in Parliament That remark of the hon. the Deputy Minister the other day indicated that he was going to see that adequate money would be available for the purpose of paying the moneys which farmers will be entitled to receive, in terms of the various clauses of this Bill providing for repayment of compensation, subsidies, and so forth. Does the hon. the Deputy Minister stand by that statement, that he is going to take the short cuts, even if it means losing up to R1 million?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in principle clause 6 is identical to what appears in the 1946 Act. It was drafted by the United Party in 1946. So the matter is settled.</p>

<p>As regards the R&#x00BD; million referred to by the hon. member referred, I explained to him that we wanted to streamline the measure. Payment of a subsidy may be made to a person after he has submitted a sworn statement. The hon. member accepted that this was in order. I went on to say that it would be immaterial whether we paid an additional R&#x00BD; million or R1 million to conserve our soil if we could succeed, through this Act, in preventing a dam such as the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam from silting up. The idea is not that we are going to waste money now. Estimates have always been drawn up in the past, and we know more or less what the cost of the works will be in the coming year. These estimates are in accordance with. that. However, if we exceed this amount because we have saved our country, I cannot see that there will be any trouble.</p>

<p>I do not know what hon. members are worried about. If they should like a share, there is some in the drawer. They are welcome to come and help themselves.</p>

<p>Section 29 (c) of Act 45 of 1946, reads as follows:</p>

<p>Pay subsidies or make grants to the owner or occupier of any land &#x2026;</p>

<p>But in the provision as it is presented to us to-day we find that it is payable to any person who happens to undertake soil conservation works whether or not he is the owner or occupier of the land. That is why we have accepted a new principle in clause 5 which we have just dealt with in this House. However, let us leave that as it may be and let us come back to clause 6.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 4 the Minister may direct farmers to carry out soil conservation works. In terms of this clause he now asks for the power to pay subsidies or to make grants subject to such conditions as he may determine under clause 20 (1) (d). The point made by the hon. member for South Coast is what conditions the hon. the Minister will be laying down. Will we have the same conditions as pertain to-day by regulation? Will we have the same unwieldy structure which has been, I could almost say, the pitfall of the Soil Conservation Act up to now. It has been the biggest stumbling block as regards the carrying out of the intention of this Act which was placed on the Statute Book many years ago. Or is it the intention of the hon. the Minister to relax those regulations, particularly the regulations with regard to the approval of work before it shall be undertaken? Secondly, will he relax the regulation with regard to the approval of the completed work before payment shall be made? This is what has caused the delays that we have had in the past; this is where many farmers became &#x201C;moedeloos&#x201D;. I cannot think of an English word which is as expressive as the word &#x201C;moedeloos&#x201D;. This is where farmers became &#x201C;moedeloos&#x201D; with soil conservation measures, because they have been unable, firstly, to carry out what they wanted to do and, secondly when it has been carried out, they have been unable to be reimbursed by the amount which the hon. the Minister and his Department are <span class="col_6075-6076" refersTo="page_0185"/>prepared to give them. This is the point that we are asking the hon. the Minister about. Is it his intention to streamline this procedure now in terms of these powers which he will receive or are we going to still be stuck with the ox wagon which we have had in the past?</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) pointed out, the wording of this clause is not the same as it was in the original Act. The hon. member quoted a portion of the original Act. He stopped a little bit too soon in his quotation from the Act. I want to go a little bit further. Section 29 (c) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may pay subsidies or make grants to the owner or occupier of any land in respect of any soil conservation works constructed or soil conservation measures applied by that owner or occupier in accordance with a soil conservation scheme.</block>

<p>This is the whole nub of the matter. There will now no longer be a soil conservation scheme drawn up by a district committee, because this will no longer be one of the functions of the district committee. During the Second Reading debate the hon. the Deputy Minister told us that there will not be schemes drawn up by a district committee. The impression we got from the hon. the Deputy Minister at the Second Reading was that it will now be left to the farmers to draw up their own individual farm plan. The point we want to put to the hon. the Deputy Minister is, in the light of that change, what sort of conditions will he lay down in regard to the payment of certain subsidies or grants? If the farmer himself will be drawing up the plan of his individual farm, by whom will that plan be approved of first of all before the farmer can feel that he might be entitled to a subsidy or a grant on those works which he will be constructing? Having constructed these works, what will be the machinery by which the Department will satisfy itself that they can make the subsidy or the grant in question?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let us get this matter straight. The farm plan which we used to have in the past, is going to fall away now. The hon. member for Albany is quite right in his view of the matter as he understood it at the Second Reading. Directions for a particular district are published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> for example, directions prohibiting the ploughing of sloping land vertically, the burning of veld at a certain time of the year or directions prohibiting or allowing the burning of veld, etc. Hon. members know what I mean. These directions are served on the area concerned. Let us consider how this works in practice. We shall no longer have a specific farm plan tin future as we had in the past. That is correct. The hon. member says that this clause is no longer the same as it was in the Act of 1946. However, the entire principle of the matter remains exactly the same. If we look at clause 20 we shall see the various directions. The replies to the questions which are being put, are to be found in clause 20. The regulations in terms of which this payment will be made, are all set out in clause 20.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like merely to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question in regard to the provisions of subsection (4) of clause 7 which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before the construction of the soil conservation works referred to in subsection (1) is commenced, the Minister shall in writing order the Registrar of Deeds concerned to make an endorsement on the original title deeds of all land in respect of which the soil conservation works are, in the opinion of the Minister, likely to have a beneficial effect, indicating that the costs of the construction of soil conservation works may under subsection (2) be recovered either entirely or partly from the owner or owners concerned, &#x2026;</block>

<p>I take it under normal practice it is usual for the Minister’s Department to consult with the Registrar of Deeds in a matter of this kind. However, I should like to have an assurance that that is so, because this seems to me to be a very loose provision indeed. I do not know what the folk who handle our deeds will think about this. Heaven only knows, we are in trouble enough trying to get deeds through the registrar’s office at the present time. But if now a large number of fresh title deeds are to be sent in for endorsement in terms of this subsection and the Registrar of Deeds will have this extra responsibility thrust on his shoulders, the position will even be more serious. As I have said, I hope there has been consultation and the registrars have given their approval through their council.</p>

This is no laughing matter. The Registrars of Deeds have been particularly careful in the past to see that, what I would call, a workmanlike method is adopted, for dealing with the endorsement of title deeds and quite rightly so. This is a very loose manner of <span class="col_6077-6078" refersTo="page_0186"/>dealing with it.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Minister is granted the power to construct soil conservation works where he may deem them necessary. The recovery of the costs is also left to the discretion of the Minister. In order to protect future buyers an endorsement is made on the title deeds of the land to the effect that a certain amount of money is still due to the State on that specific piece of land. We have already consulted the Deeds Office about this matter. They agree with us that it will be possible for this method to work this way. We consulted them as part of our Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is one of the clauses in which problems are cropping up which are so big that one can drive through them in an ox-wagon. The Deputy Minister is quite correct. The Minister may order works to be constructed or he may give directions to the effect that works should be constructed. He may decide whether the State will have to bear all the costs or a part thereof or whether the owner will have to bear all the costs. This is recorded on the title deeds because the Minister thinks that the farm as such has become more valuable. This is one liability which is already being recorded on the title deeds now. But it also goes further than that. It is also being stated here in the last paragraph of this clause that the Minister may recover the maintenance in respect of the works from the occupier or the owner of the land. Does this also have to be registered against the title deed? Obviously, by implication it has to be registered against the title deed that the occupier or owner of that piece of land or the future occupier of that piece of land will have to go on paying maintenance in respect of the works on that piece of land. As a practical farmer I want to know from the hon. the Minister what would happen if this were a major work and there were to be floods, what would happen in regard to the legal powers which are transferred to the next owner? Is it now being registered against the title deed that the occupier of that property will have to maintain those works for many years to come, irrespective of whether they are major works, medium or small works. Surely, one cannot pass such an Act? Surely, one should be able to tell the person who buys the land what his obligations are and what they will be for many years to come. This provision should not provide that he has to maintain these works even if they are hit by a storm or floods. The legislation does not provide that it is to be left to the discretion of the Minister to determine whether or not that farmer would have to maintain those works. The legislation provides that he has to maintain those works.</p>

<p>Surely, the hon. member knows what action was taken in the past when exceptional circumstances arose, such as floods. The person concerned buys the farm and a condition is attached to that purchase. One the debts have been paid off, that agreement lapses. This is quite clear to me and I cannot see what is wrong with it. Once he has paid off his debts, those conditions lapse. This will vary from case to case.</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the following be a new clause to follow clause 8:</block>

<block name="quote">9. Any person who is aggrieved by any direction or order given or made or action taken in terms of sections 4, 5 and 7 by any person acting on the authority of the Minister, may, within 30 days after such direction or order is given or made, or such action is taken, appeal to the Minister against that direction, order or action in the prescribed manner.</block>

<p>I raise this particular point, because I am quite convinced that this Bill which we are considering will be far more acceptable to the farming community if they know that in the Bill there is a clause which can protect their interests if in any respect they feel aggrieved by directives which may be imposed upon them by the Minister or somebody who has been delegated powers by the hon. the Minister; I think it is only right that in passing this legislation we should think in terms of the interests of the farmers. I say this because we have said earlier on that the Minister is taking far-reaching measures in this Bill. Because we on this side of the House realize and are keen to see that we have legislation which can expedite soil conservation work in the country, we think that he should have extensive powers. But at the same time, I think <span class="col_6079-6080" refersTo="page_0187"/>it is imperative that we should also have in this legislation a clause which can protect the farmer when he feels that the directives imposed upon him are unfair. As the legislation is now, one can appeal to no one against the measures which have been imposed upon him. For that reason I wish to move this new clause standing in my name.</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of subsection (2):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that the majority of the members shall be <i>bona fide</i> farmers appointed from a list of candidates duly elected by land owners of the area concerned.</block>

<p>In the course of the Second Reading debate we also made this particular aspect very clear to the hon. the Minister, i.e. that we did not object to his appointing various committees. However, we also said that it would be wrong if, in addition, the farmers and the landowners who were personally involved in the implementation of this soil conservation legislation, did not have a proper say as to who their representatives on those soil conservation committees would be. Therefore we propose that the farmers and the land-owners should come together for the purpose of electing, say, a panel of ten or 12 suitable members. These names may be submitted to the Minister, and should the hon. the Minister only want six, he may select them from that panel. I think that this is more or less in accordance with the constitution of soil conservation committees so far, i.e. that the farmers have had a say in the matter. The reason why we want them to choose, is that we do not want members in whom the farmers have no confidence to be appointed to committees. We do not want that, because these soil conservation committees will form an important link in the discharge of the obligations in respect of soil conservation. They will have to provide guidance and they will have to give advice; consequently we feel that the best guidance and the best advice will come from those committees whose members have been proposed by the farmers themselves. In other words, they can best be served with guidance and advice if they had a say as to the persons by whom they would be represented on these committees. Since this amendment is so clear, I do not find it necessary to advance any further arguments in its favour.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry, but it seems to me as though the Opposition is really experiencing some difficulty to-day, and I do not know for what reason this is so. We continually heard the arguments that tremendous delays and difficulties have been experienced in regard to the old Act. I agree with the hon. member that farmers Should serve on these committees, but the question that arises then is whether these members should be nominated by way of ballot. The new course, which the Minister explained very clearly to the Opposition, was adopted because over the years we learned from experience that many of these committees simply do not work. A new provision is now being introduced, i.e. that the Minister is to nominate those committees in consultation with the South African Agricultural Union. Does the hon. member now, for one moment, want to make me believe that the South African Agricultural Union will not nominate as members of these committees farmers or people who are extremely interested in this matter? The only difference is whether the members of the panel, as the hon. member called it, should be elected, or whether the members should be nominated in consultation with the South African Agricultural Union, which consists of farmers. The object is to have committees which will co-operate in fulfilling this task in a really convincing and enthusiastic manner. I think that the hon. the Minister cannot do any more to eliminate one of the bottlenecks which exists at present. By establishing a committee in consultation with the South African Agricultural Union, one of the difficult problems is being eliminated here. We are convinced that this committee will work.</p>

<p>&#x2026; does not appreciate the practical difficulties which there are going to be in the implementation of this subsection (2) in actual practice. Sir, when the hon. the Minister consults the S.A. Agricultural Union what will the machinery actually be? He will go to the S.A. Agricultural Union and the S.A. Agricultural Union will go to its affiliates; they will go to the subordinate unions. In the first instance, they will go to the provincial union because at the headquarters of the S.A. Agricultural Union they do not know the local conditions. Let us take the case of the <span class="col_6081-6082" refersTo="page_0188"/>Cape Province. They will go to the Cape Province Agricultural Union, and, similarly, the Cape Province Agricultural Union, with its headquarters here in Paarl, if the matter concerns, shall we say, a soil conservation district somewhere in the Eastern Cape, will go to the local or the regional agricultural union concerned, and this is where the first difficulty arises. There are many cases where one part of a soil conservation district or even a magisterial district falls under one agricultural union and another part falls under another agricultural union. I could cite instances in my own area where a portion of the magisterial district falls under the Eastern Agricultural Union and another portion falls under the Eastern Province Coastal Agricultural Union. I could cite other instances, in the Indwe area, for example, where a portion falls under the North Eastern Agricultural Union and another portion falls under the Eastern Agricultural Union. Sir, the hon. member for Christiana said that they wanted to streamline the administration of the Act. Is this streamlining it when you have to get two agricultural unions together who have to decide between themselves who is going to represent what? In practice, where that difficulty does not arise, where clearly there is only one agricultural union concerned, you will have numerous cases where the local or regional agricultural union itself is going to have difficulties, because there are cases where there are no farmers’ associations but there are soil conservation districts in the area concerned. Sir, this is essentially a case where people with local knowledge should be able to have a say. The amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park is designed to achieve that end, and if the hon. the Deputy Minister is not prepared to accept that amendment, I am telling him now that in practice he is going to run into a great deal of difficulty with the application of this subsection.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, but we certainly cannot accept the explanation furnished by the hon. the Deputy Minister. The hon. member for Christiana has intimated that it is a difficult process to elect people. How were the members of his 816 soil conservation committees elected up to now? Only here and there one finds one that was not elected properly. The vast majority of them, as the hon. member will see in the report, elect their people. If the hon. the Minister could prove that the elected soil conservation committees acted wrongly in the past, one would still have been able to understand his attitude. But that argument was not advanced here yesterday, nor to-day. Hon. members on that side boast of the fact that we have 5,200 soil conservation committees. How did those people get there; how many of them were appointed and how many of them were elected? The majority of them were elected, and up to now they have done their work in an excellent manner. What argument can one advance in favour of changing the old procedure? The only argument which can be advanced, is that the machinery has to be streamlined, and the hon. member for Albany has just dealt with that. It will not be streamlined in this way. Sir, we are objecting in the strongest terms to the fact that people whose co-operation one wants in this respect, are being ignored. They are not going to have an alternative. Who is the South African Agricultural Union that will be consulted? Is it the local farmers’ association, is it the subregion, or is the Cape Agricultural Union, or is it the national organization? We say that people who are directly concerned, i.e. the people living in the area which is being proclaimed as a soil conservation district, should be consulted, and since this is the democratic way of doing things, we can assure the Deputy Minister that in that way, and in no other way, he will achieve the greatest measure of success with (this Bill. Sir, the disposition of the farmers is simply such that they will not be dictated to as to whom they should nominate; they themselves want a say.</p>

I want to tell the Opposition that we have confidence not in a member of the governing party as such, but in a farmer as Deputy Minister, and if the Opposition cannot bring themselves to the stage where they can also trust this Deputy Minister, the position of the farmer in South Africa will be a very weak one, and that is why I want to appeal to the Opposition to trust the Deputy Minister as we do.</p>

This is one of the most important aspects of this legislation as a whole. Surely, to make a success of the administration of this legislation, to make a success of soil conservation, one must have the co-operation of the farmers, and if one does not want to provide the means through which one may obtain their co-operation, how is this legislation going to work?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This clause deals with fire protection areas and here again we have overlapping. I do not propose to detain the House, but this is one of the most important aspects not only of soil conservation but in respect of the protection of crops and land. We had a Bill before the House about a year ago in which there was a particular section dealing with fire protection. Many provisions of that Forestry Act dealt specifically with this matter. Now provision is made here that if there is a conflict in a scheme between what is provided in this Bill and in the Forestry Act, then the Forestry Act prevails. That <span class="col_6085-6086" refersTo="page_0190"/>is good in so far as it goes, but the trouble here is that in subsection (2) it provides that the constitution, functions and procedure at any meeting of a fire protection committee shall be as prescribed, i.e. as prescribed by the Minister of Agriculture and not the Minister of Forestry. Now the other Act comes under the Minister of Forestry and here it is provided that the constitution and all its work shall be prescribed by this Minister. I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister would tell us how he sees his Department dealing with fire protection alongside the provisions of the other Act administered by another Minister who has precisely parallel powers. We do not want to fall between two stools. If the Deputy Minister has ever been in Natal in August or September and seen a fire get out of control on the slopes of the Drakensberg and burn for two or three weeks, with the damage it does, he would realize exactly why it is that we want to be so careful that there should be no confusion and no overlapping of powers between these two Departments. I must admit that I myself would be very much happier if all reference to fire-fighting, etc., were eliminated from this Bill altogether and let us leave it entirely to the other Act and to the other Minister, with this Minister making representations to the other Minister from time to time in regard to fire-fighting, the burning of veld, etc., so that that Minister would have a policy fitting in with soil conservation which is under the control of this Minister. The other Minister, for example, can proclaim a period when he will allow no fires whatsoever in what is called the period of high risk. The Minister can proclaim that period for two or three weeks if he wants to and he can from time to time extend it or proclaim new periods when he will allow no fires whatsoever, and he may impose severe penalties. We cannot be too clear in fixing the responsibility and making sure that the responsibility will rest in the appropriate quarter. I would ask the Deputy Minister to consider, whether here or later in the Other Place, whether it will not be desirable in consultation with the Minister of Forestry, to have all reference to the control of fire withdrawn from this Bill and left to the other Minister to deal with under the Forestry Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I move the following amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 15, after &#x201C;may&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after giving not less than seven days written notice to the owner or occupier of the land in question of his intention to do so&#x201D;; in line 20 to omit &#x201C;notice to&#x201D; and substitute &#x201C;consultation with&#x201D;; in line 26, after &#x201C;may&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after giving not less than seven days written notice to and after consultation with the owner or occupier of the land in question&#x201D;; in line 32, to omit &#x201C;reasonable notice&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;giving not less than seven days’ written notice of his intention to do so&#x201D;; and in line 39, after &#x201C;times&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after prior notice to the owner or occupier of the land in question&#x201D;.</block>

<p>These amendments are obviously designed to protect the position of owners or occupiers of land from people who may think that they are entitled to enter upon that land without even showing the owner or the occupier of the land the courtesy of telling him that they are going there. I would not be unduly worried if it were only this particular Department with whom we are dealing, because the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is one which is used to dealing with farmers as they do not normally disregard the sort of courtesy a land owner can expect to receive in this respect. But this clause gives power to any officer of any Department of State, the S.A. Railways, a Provincial Administration, or a divisional council, etc., to enter upon land without notice. I know personally of instances where there were persons acting under the instructions of the Provincial Administration, for example, contractors to build roads, who have entered on property without any notice and not merely have they entered upon it and walked around with a big gang of labourers, but they have clambered all over the fences and have disturbed the landowner’s stock and his game. They have even gone as far as to dig test-holes in his veld which they did not even fill in afterwards. Similarly, there have been cases&#x2014; I do not know whether they are numerous or not&#x2014;where some of these firms prospecting for oil under licence from the Government have shown similar disregard of the normal rights of landowners. I do not think the Minister will say that he disagrees with me in principle on this point because in at least two places the clause makes provision for notice to be given. <span class="col_6087-6088" refersTo="page_0191"/>In line 20 it says &#x201C;after notice&#x201D;, and in line 32 the phrase used is &#x201C;reasonable notice&#x201D;. Our object is to make quite sure that it will be reasonable notice. After all, what is reasonable notice? It is a very vague term. One man may consider an hour’s notice reasonable, and another may consider a fortnight’s notice reasonable. We on this side feel that seven days’ notice would in fact be reasonable notice to expect from the Department concerned; except in one instance, namely in the case of subsection (3), where we feel that giving a week’s written notice would be unreasonable to demand of the Department concerned, where they are going on to a man’s land to see whether it is necessary to construct work or to inspect the construction of those works or to ascertain whether the soil conservation work is in fact being carried out. In cases like that, my amendment asks for prior notice and not a week’s written notice, because there it would be reasonable if the official concerned either telephones the owner or even goes on to his farm and tells him that he is going into the veld for this or that purpose.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I want to deal with. In various places we have also added the words &#x201C;after consultation with&#x201D;. I want to deal with that for a minute. In line 20 for example we want to omit the words &#x201C;notice to&#x201D; and say &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D;. May I say that the original Act provided that it should be done only after consultation. May I also add at this juncture that, in case the Deputy Minister says to me that a large portion of this was taken direct from the 1946 Act, and that was a United Party Act and that therefore we should not try to improve it, I want to use the words he used in this regard during the second reading when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die 1946-Wet was ’n agtermekaar wet vir sy tyd, maar die tyd het nou gekom om aanpassings te maak.</block>

<p>We feel that these are some of the &#x201C;aanpassings&#x201D; that are necessary. As regards the question of consultation, our amendments are designed to provide, where a directive is given that work should be done, and it is necessary to take materials such as sand, stone or gravel from that land, that notice shall not merely be given to the owner concerned but that this shall also be done after consultation with the owner concerned. After all, Sir, the position may well arise where the official, if he is only required to give notice, may say: I have given the required notice. I am now going to establish my camp and I am going to remove sand, stone, etc. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to accept this amendment, particularly in the interests of good relations between the farmers who are going to be affected by this clause and between the officials of his department. There will be many instances where the person doing the work will need materials and it will help him to have the willing co-operation of the landowner concerned. He might even achieve a better result if he were first to consult with the landowner concerned. The landowner may say to him: You want to take sand from such and such a place, but it will be more convenient for me, and you will also get better sand, for instance, or concrete making, at another place. I think that if we have adequate notice, which my amendments are designed to provide, as well as the consultation with the landowner concerned, this will contribute to happy relations between the officials of the Deputy Minister’s department and the landowners themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the 1946 Act also provided for that, and it worked well. However, the hon. member now wants to give the extension officers additional work, and we are already faced with the problem of not having enough extension officers. Now he wants to give them additional work. After all, the farmer will be consulted in practice, because the farmer has to co-operate if we want to carry out certain works. But there may be people who refuse to co-operate, and for such cases we have to have an Act to be able to carry out these works. The hon. member must also bear in mind that clause 17 (1) provides that a farmer shall be compensated for the material which is taken from him in case other material is not available. This has worked excellently since 1946 simply because one knows how to deal with a farmer.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that I said, when I moved my amendment, that the old Act was nearly the same. However, it did differ in this one very important aspect, and that is that it did provide for consultation. I want to read it to the hon. the Deputy Minister. Section 32 of the original Act, which deals with the right of entry, on or over land, reads <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Any officer of the department &#x2026;. may enter upon any land and may take with him such equipment &#x2026;. for the purpose of constructing or maintaining on that land any soil conservation works in accordance with the provisions of this Act, or any soil conservation scheme, and may dig or take on such land, after consultation with the owner or occupier thereof and without an obligation to pay compensation therefor, such stone, sand &#x2026;.</block>

<p>I should like to draw the hon. the Deputy Minister’s attention to the fact that the words &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D; are used. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will change his attitude and accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope that the Deputy Minister is going to reconsider this clause. It is a very smart one, and he will pardon me if I read it, because I want to lay emphasis on certain words. The clause reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may delegate to any senior officer in any department of State all or any of the powers conferred upon him by this Act, other than the powers referred to in section 20.</block>

<p>The powers referred to in section 20 include the making of regulations relating to the calling of and the procedure and quorum at meetings of the conservation committees, etc. That is all. As for the rest, the whole of it, the &#x201C;bosun tight and the midshipmite and the crew of the captain’s gig&#x201D;, they all slide into the discard. The Minister can take the lot and say: &#x201C;I call that man a senior officer&#x201D;. Such a person can be in any department of State. I have never seen a provision like this in any law. The Minister, from his department, can go right outside to any other department, presumably in consultation with other Ministers, etc., but I am not talking about that, and he can take officials from other State departments, whom he can call &#x201C;senior officers&#x201D;. A senior officer is not defined. I do not know what a senior officer is. If it is determined in terms of years, I suppose I might look upon myself as a senior member of Parliament, but there are many other senior members of Parliament, and I do not know what to make of this. What is a &#x201C;senior officer&#x201D;?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman &#x2026;. [Interjections]. Sir, we are trying to help the Deputy Minister. I want to say here and now, in the light of day, that we regret extremely the fact that the Deputy Minister has had to pilot this Bill through Parliament. We are not doubting the capacity of the Deputy Minister. We believe that he is a very capable Deputy Minister, but he is a new man and he has only recently come into this portfolio. He has a difficult Bill here, dealing with one of the most vital matters in the country at the present time, namely the conservation of our soil.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I bow to your ruling. I merely want to say that we are being a little careful. We see that the Deputy Minister is engaged in conversation with his staff, to try to find the answer to some of our questions. We are patient, and we should like to give him a chance to so consider the matter, while we discuss other aspects of this clause. In this particular matter I want to say that I hope the Minister is going to tell us why his own department does not have capable senior officers able to do the work which may be delegated in terms of this Bill. Sir, we have pointed out that we want to go to the Minister. My colleagues have dealt with the question of committees. We have moved amendments and we have tried to get committees and bodies that can intervene in a quasi-judicial capacity to help the farmers. But what happens when we have to deal with a departmental official from another department? How then do we go to the Minister? Can I go to the Minister in connection with an official from the Department of Community Development, or the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, for instance? How do I deal with a senior official from the Department of Bantu Administration and Development? If I do not like his decision, I must go to the Minister of Agriculture. What position are we in then? Sir, we want to be able to know the authority we are dealing with. We want to know who has the authority. That is what farmers want to know. Who has the authority? How does he exercise that authority? How can we, in terms of a clause like this, deal in a practical manner with that authority, and how can we appeal against it? We were told just now that there was a right of appeal to the Minister. What Minister? Is there an appeal to the Minister of the Department of Agriculture if he appoints officers from other departments to take on this job? Sir, I have never seen a provision like this in any Act in my life.</p>

<p>I want to go further and come to the powers that are going to be conferred. The only power reserved to the Minister in this particular Bill is set out by clause 20. That clause deals with the question of the calling and the procedure and quorums of meetings of conservation committees which are advisory bodies in any case. They are purely advisory committees; they have no power. But the Minister can delegate all the financial provisions. <span class="col_6091-6092" refersTo="page_0193"/>How far will those financial provisions run? In the course of a year they can run to millions of rand. The Minister can divest himself from the responsibility entirely. He can delegate that responsibility to officials not even in his own department. I do hope that the Minister is not going to be misled by any argument that may come from any quarter that this is going to make for ease of administration. This provision is wrecked before it starts. We will have more to say about that when we come to the Third Reading debate. In this matter I do appeal to the Deputy Minister: Play fair. Give the farmers the opportunity of knowing that they are dealing with the Minister of Agriculture under this Bill. They must not be asked to go through a list of the Cabinet Ministers to find out with whose department they have to deal when they deal with a particular official, who has been clothed by the Minister with authority in regard to the financial provisions of this Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, my hon. Leader says we are in a happy position. I thought it was an unhappy position for the Deputy Minister. Here we see the difficulty of having an administration, a government, such as we have at the present time. The Deputy Minister agrees with us. He knows perfectly well that soil conservation must be soil conservation in the whole Republic of South Africa, or it is not soil conservation. One cannot &#x201C;soil conserve&#x201D; half of one’s farm; one cannot conserve the soil of half one’s country. The exceptions, where the Bantu areas are concerned, have the effect of exempting from the provisions of this Bill the very areas where it is most necessary that control should be exercised. We have gone through the other clauses. We have now reached this clause and coming near the end. We have made provision for what might happen when one’s neighbour does not carry out soil conservation works with the result that your farm is damaged. What happens when that neighbour’s farm is a big scheduled area under the Department of Bantu Administration and they do nothing about it? I am now talking about my own case and that of my neighbours down the coast. Soil conservation, because the Department of Bantu Administration has not conserved the area alongside me, is going to cost me R1,000, and I am getting no subsidy from the Government. I am paying for it out of my own pocket on the basis of &#x201C;help yourself&#x201D; about which the hon. member for Nelspruit was talking yesterday. Mr. Chairman, where do we go? How can we turn around, face our farmers and say that we are dealing with soil conservation in South Africa? We are grappling with the problem. We are taking a new look at it. This is now a down to earth, practical way of grappling with the problem, but we only have to grapple with it in certain areas. As to one-third, a quarter of the country, or whatever it is, we are not going to touch it at all. We are going to leave the Department of Bantu Administration and Development to carry on with it.</p>

The hon. the Minister is the man who can deal with it. He is the only man who can deal with it. I want to repeat emphatically that the hon. the Minister agrees with us. He knows perfectly well that this is vital. If the hon. the Minister had a free choice he will say that it must go in. And what is the trouble?

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>During discussion on the motion for the Second Reading of this Bill, I referred the hon. the Deputy Minister to the risk of local authorities investing in their own funds. In other words, there was the risk of local authorities investing their pension funds in their own municipalities. Since I made that speech a report appeared in the Press which referred to fourteen councils in the Transvaal that are &#x201C;in the red&#x201D;. This article, <i>inter alia,</i> reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Fourteen Transvaal town and village councils and health committees were &#x201C;in the red&#x201D; in the 1965-’66 financial year, according to the latest report of the Local Government Auditor.</block>

<p>It then lists all the various village councils and town councils which were in the red. Without going into detail, one was in the red to the extent of R27,849 and another to the extent of R18,010. I submit that if the council had invested the whole of its pension funds with that council as a council loan, there will be a risk to the pension fund. As the hon. the Deputy Minister knows, no commercial or industrial firm is allowed to invest its pension funds with the company. It has to be invested outside. Here the same principle which is frowned on by the hon. the Deputy Minister when it comes to dealing with company funds is allowed under clause 1. The hon the Deputy Minister implied during the Second Reading Stage of this Bill that he was going into the matter and that he was referring it to headquarters to see whether there was any substance in the remarks that I had made. I do not suggest that there may be a local authority which has all its funds invested in the local authority concerned. But there is the possibility. This Press report to which I have referred, indicates the risk. I therefore suggest that the hon. the Deputy Minister should give this matter further attention because it is essential that pension funds should be absolutely secured. When we have a town council which manages its affairs so badly that its accounts are allowed to run into the red to the tune of R27,000 then such a town council could equally put its pension funds in jeopardy. I therefore suggest that the hon. the Deputy Minister gives further attention to this as it is in the interests of future pension holders and the trust funds concerned.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as regards the point made by the hon. member for Pinetown, I may just mention one or two aspects which may serve as a partial reply to him. The first is that the Pension Funds Act has been in existence since 1956. All the pension funds are under the control and management of the Registrar of Financial Institutions. We have to accept that the Registrar of Financial Institutions will definitely exercise sound control over all the pension funds which fall under the control of his office. He will definitely guard against pension funds being invested in avenues which may place the funds in jeopardy. I think this is some guarantee, namely that the Registrar will constantly keep a watchful eye over all pension funds. These pension funds also include the pension funds of local authorities which fall under the Registrar and which are thoroughly investigated and controlled by him from time to time. I did not see the complete list of the town councils which the hon. member had mentioned and whose finances were in a rather unfavourable position. I therefore do not know whether all of them are smaller municipalities or whether some of the larger municipalities are included in the list as well. As regard the smaller municipalities, I want to point out that they do not have their own pension funds. I think not one of the small municipalities in our country has its own pension fund. The small municipalities join forces and they usually have a joint pension fund. That is the position in the Cape Province. I take it that this is the position in other parts of the country as well. They have what are called &#x201C;joint pension funds&#x201D;. Of course, these joint pension funds of the small local authorities do not invest their money in one of those participating local authorities alone. They naturally invest in a wider field. As regards the larger city councils, for example, Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria, their pension funds are invested in, <i>inter alia,</i> the works and undertakings of those city councils. They grant loans to those city councils, but they invest their pension funds in a much wider field than merely in that specific city council. However, I want to give the hon. member the assurance that I shall take up this particular point he mentioned, with the Registrar of Financial Institutions. I shall bring the matter to his attention and we shall furnish the hon. member with a personal reply in due course. I take cognizance of what the hon. member said, but as he probably feels himself, there is no need at all for this clause to be amended.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister in his discussions with the registrar <span class="col_6097-6098" refersTo="page_0196"/>will take cognizance of one point. In his reply to the hon. member for Pinetown, he said these funds were under the control of the Registrar of Pension Funds. That is correct, but where the law lays down that a pension fund can make certain investments, surely the Registrar of Pension Funds does not have the right to say to a pension fund that it cannot invest in a particular security. That right has already been granted by law. Hence, the hon. member for Pinetown quite correctly raised this point. If a municipality is by law entitled to invest all its funds in its own pension fund, all the registrar can do is to say to that municipality that it may be taking a risk but he cannot deny it that right because that right has already been laid down by law. Therefore I think the hon. the Deputy Minister should have a look at that situation as well.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>This clause contains an important definition of a concept which is not in the existing Act. That is that 30th September will be the new year for the renewal of radio licences. Henceforth radio licences will expire on 30th September and will have to be renewed from 1st October. During the Second Reading we on this side expressed our general agreement with this principle. Unfortunately the Minister’s explanation in reply to the Second Reading did not receive sufficient coverage in the Press. Consequently questions have arisen in the minds of the general public about the operation of this new measure. I therefore trust that the Press will bring the discussions during this Committee Stage more fully to the notice of the public.</p>

<p>The question arises in my mind whether announcements made in this connection in the Press and over the radio will in fact be adequate to inform the public fully. Personally I see major problems. Later, during the discussion of the other clauses, I shall briefly revert to these problems. But I can see even now that people will not know where they will have to pay their radio licence fees. Henceforth there will also be local authorities which will collect these fees. They can go either to the Post Office or to the S.A.B.C., or even to other bodies. That is why I think that the Minister will find that it will still be necessary to send out notices informing listeners that their licences expire on 30th September. This is done in the case of income tax and in the case of car licences in Johannesburg, for example, and I think he will find that it will be necessary to do so in the case of radio licences as well, because I think he will find that announcements in this regard over the raido and in the Press will not be sufficient notice.</p>

<p>Another question is why a new year is being introduced in respect of listeners’ licences only, and not in respect of all the other licences mentioned in the Schedule as well. I am only asking for an explanation, and I am not expressing any criticism.</p>

<p>The third point is, and I am not raising this in a spirit of frivolity, that we have closed circuit television in this country at the moment. For that licences have to be taken out as well. Does a radio licence referred to in clause 1 cover a licence for closed-circuit television as well? Or does a person who wants to install a closed-circuit television system have to obtain one of the licences mentioned in the Schedule? Perhaps the Minister could say something in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>As regards closed circuit television, the position is that in terms of the Post Office Act that is dealt with by way of permit. Therefore it does not fall under the licences we are discussing here. The other question asked by the hon. member, one he also asked during the Second Reading debate, is what the position is as far as other licences, except listeners’ licences, are concerned. There are very few of these other licences, and they expire on 31st December. If the expiry date of these licences also had to be advanced to 30th September, it would only mean that the work in connection with the collecting of licence fees would be increased. There is proper control over these licences. As far as I can see, there is a good reason why the expiry date of these licences should also be advanced to 30th September as well.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member wanted to know whether announcements over the radio and in the Press would be sufficient to inform the public fully. Personally I think that announcements through these two channels will be the more effective way of informing the public. My experience as regards the sending out of notices informing listeners that their licences expire on such and such a date and consequently will have to be renewed is that the notice is received, put aside and finally completely forgotten. On the other hand I think it is possible to bring this to the attention of people more forcibly by means of the radio. Of course, there may be cases where a renewal notice may help listeners, but the hon. member will realize that it will be necessary to keep a register if we want to send out such notices. If we do so, we will weaken the administration for the collecting of licence fees, as the sending out of such notices involves a great deal of work. The hon. member will appreciate this. This may give rise to our having to use the services of our inspection staff yet again for sending out the renewal notices while their services can be used more productively in determining what listeners have <span class="col_6099-6100" refersTo="page_0197"/>paid their fees and what listeners are pirate listeners. As I have said, it may be a good thing to continue the system of renewal notices, but we are experiencing a shortage of staff. In fact, this is the only reason why we have been looking for a different method of collecting of licence fees, one which would be more effective at the same time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like the hon. the Minister to explain this clause to us in somewhat more detail, particularly subsection (2) of the proposed new section 5. This is an entirely new subsection. In the present subsection (1) the word &#x201C;image&#x201D; appears, which one takes to mean also television. Consequently, I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether subsection (2) places a restriction on where people may pick up television signals. For instance, is a restriction being placed on television sets receiving images from, say, satellites or from neighbouring countries? Does it place any restriction on the reception of television signals or radio signals, from neighbouring states or from satellites? I shall be pleased if the Minister could explain to us this subsection with this particular aspect in mind.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member has really baffled me to some extent because I do not think the clause concerned has any bearing on the matter he raised here. This clause lays down three things. In the first place it removes the listeners’ licence from the Schedule. In the second place it introduces the two basic kinds of listeners’ licences, what I call the &#x201C;private licence&#x201D; and the &#x201C;business licence&#x201D;, and in the third place it allows of exemption from the obligation of being in possession of a listener’s licence being granted by way of regulation to a member of a household. That is all that is contained in this clause, and I do not think it has any bearing on anything the hon. member asked me here. He is apparently labouring under a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the hon. member for Port Natal arises from the fact that the proposed new subsection (2) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall use radio apparatus for the reception of anything broadcast in a broadcasting service &#x2026;.</block>

<p>If you go to the principal Act, Sir, you find that &#x201C;broadcasting service&#x201D; is defined as &#x201C;a radio communication service of transmissions intended for direct reception by the general public, including transmission by television or other means.&#x201D; Sir, this is where his difficulty arises, and he pertinently asks the hon. the Minister whether this gives the hon. the Minister the power to prohibit any person from receiving a television broadcast which might reach us ultimately by satellite or from outside.</p>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the Minister said that a new type of listener’s licence was to be issued to hotels and mines and transport services, etc. I would like to ask him what the position has been to date in the case of hotels and these other establishments. As I understand the position, the owner of the establishment has been required to pay the ordinary listener’s licence fee of R5.50 and so much per room. Am I correct in saying that that has been the position? How will this differ from the previous position? Secondly, I would like to refer the hon. the Minister to the passage in his speech where he said that different amounts of money would be applicable to these business licences. How will this work in practice? Take, for example, a large hotel. A large hotel, presumably, under the new system will have to pay the usual listener’s licence fee. Will a lump sum then be levied or will a charge be levied in accordance with the number of rooms, and will a similar system operate in the case of <span class="col_6101-6102" refersTo="page_0198"/>a smaller hotel? Is there any specified standard, or is it left to the discretion of the department concerned to levy on the establishment any fee that it deems fit?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>This clause merely provides authority for the making of regulations, of course, and this will naturally depend on the regulations. At present the position is that the hotels take out ordinary listener’s licences, just as private households do. What this entails, of course, is that one has to take out different licences, because one also pays for loudspeakers. The regulations will probably provide that the greater the number of rooms in which one has radio loudspeakers, the higher the fee will be for the new business licence, because the fee is, after all, determined on the basis of the number of radios.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to emphasize the point which I thought was behind this clause of the Bill. I thought this was one of the means of giving relief to hotels. As the Minister is aware, many hotels require substantial relief, and I was hoping that the Minister and his department would exercise their discretion in levying varying fees, as I understood the position, in favour of hotels to give them the relief that they seek.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>There is only a small point in connection with clause 5. I refer to line 35 where the proviso to subsection (1) of section 7 of the principal Act is being deleted. The proviso reads that a licence may be issued to a person who has to be approved by the Postmaster-General. In other words, one could not obtain a licence unless one has obtained the approval of the Postmaster-General. But the following proviso was specifically included in the principal Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that in the case of a listener’s licence no such approval shall be required and the licence shall be issued on payment of the prescribed fee.</block>

<p>This proviso is now being deleted here. Provision is now being made here in clause 5 that the Postmaster-General has to issue a licence to anyone. I just want to be assured that with the removal of that one proviso the position is still, even with this change in the clause, that any person will be entitled to a listener’s licence. Specific provision is made in the principal Act that he will be entitled to such a licence. Now that proviso is being deleted, and a different sentence is being substituted for that proviso. I just want to have the assurance from the hon. the Minister that this will be the position.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>This clause provides that licences will expire on 31st December, and in this connection we have already had a reply from the hon. the Minister. The other provision here is that persons who are issued with free licences must obtain a renewal of the right every year to be issued with a free licence. I can imagine that difficulties will arise if no central register of persons who are entitled to free licences is going to be kept. Take the case of the aged in, say Kimberley or Bloemfontein or Johannesburg who would like to renew the right to a free licence. They may go to the Post Office and there they are told that they should go to the local authority or to the S.A.B.C. I foresee this problem arising. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he thinks I may be seeing ghosts, and whether some method cannot be devised to cope with that problem. We agree with this idea of free licences, and we hope that this will be extended on a large scale, but I do foresee the difficulty I mentioned a moment ago.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>I may just explain that although a register of all listener’s licences issued is not kept by the Post Office, a register is in fact kept by the S.A.B.C. of free listener’s licences and concessionary radio listener’s licences. This will eliminate the difficulty mentioned by the hon. member altogether.</p>

<p>Clause 9:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Here the problem arises which I mentioned in the Second Reading debate, i.e. that while it is no longer necessary to complete the forms in triplicate when a radio is bought or brought in for repairs, the problem still remains, even after the passing of this particular amendment, that any person who wants to have a radio repaired must satisfy the dealers that he is in possession of a licence, and he has to show the number of the licence or the licence itself to the radio dealer, or otherwise the dealer will get into trouble if he repairs the radio. A difficulty I foresee in this regard is the following: The head of a household has a radio in his home and he keeps his licence there, but his son is at a boarding school, and now the radio of that son breaks downs while the son may perhaps be a hundred or two hundred or five hundred miles away from home. That boy wants to have his radio repaired. He goes to a radio dealer and that dealer tells him: &#x201C;Here is the Act as it was passed by Parliament; what is your licence number?&#x201D;. Can any method be found to meet that situation which can in fact arise?</p>

<p>In connection with this clause I should just like to know why the words &#x201C;person in the service of the State&#x201D; are being substituted here for the words &#x201C;officer in public service&#x201D;? I accept that this is partly as a result of the new dispensation which allows of officials of the Post Office being appointed as officers who may carry out of this inspection. I have no objections to that, but in a previous Bill we passed recently, we saw how wide such powers could be. One can appoint any person in the service of the State and then he may be appointed as an inspector to investigate whether someone is in possession of a radio licence. This is something that can happen under the clause as it stands, and I am a little unhappy about that.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

The words &#x201C;person in the service of the State&#x201D; are being substituted here for the words &#x201C;officer in the public service&#x201D;. This amendment is necessary in order to obviate problems which may arise if in law officers of the Post Office were no longer to be regarded as officers in the Public Service. The other amendments in this clause are merely consequential adjustments. No new powers are being taken.</p>

<p>Clause 13:</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>The purpose of this clause, in so far as the S.A.B.C. is given the power to issue licences, etc., seems quite clear but the remaining portion of the clause is not clear to me, and that is where the local authorities come into the picture with the power not only to issue licences, but also to collect licence fees. I think there must be some background to this portion of the clause, and I wonder if the hon. the Minister could perhaps elucidate for us how this is going to work in practice in the case of the local authorities?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>The arrangement that a local authority or any other similar body established by or under any law should by agreement be able to issue listener’s licences on behalf of the Post Office to persons within its area and should be able to collect the fees therefor in instalments or otherwise, is intended to make use, when practicable and acceptable, for the convenience of the licence holders as well as the Post Office and in the interests of efficiency, of the existing machinery of local authorities and similar bodies for the collecting of money. For example, under this authority it will be possible to arrange with a local authority that it is prepared to do so, for the inhabitants of a Bantu township in its area who are licence holders, to pay along with their monthly rentals their radio licence fees in instalments to the officers of the local authority. The authority being granted in the new section 17 (b) does not allow of the matter of issuing licences and collecting fees being entrusted to private persons or firms. The body with which such an agreement is concluded, must be one established by or under a law. Moreover, arrangements of this nature are subject to the approval of the Minister and, as far as remuneration payable for the work done by the local authority or similar body is concerned, of the S.A.B.C. Such remuneration will in turn have to be deducted from the licence fees paid over by the Post Office to the S.A.B.C. I do not know whether this solves the hon. member’s problems.</p>

<p>Clause 13 also mentions that the right of issuing licences and of collecting fees may also go to any other body established by or under any law. I should like to know what the hon. the Minister envisages with this. I can understand that if one asks a local authority, such as the municipality of Cape Town, or Johannesburg, or Bloemfontein, to collect radio licence fees, they will be able to collect such fees on a monthly or quarterly basis, and place the monies on the account. But there are many other bodies established by law which may or may not fall under this. I have in mind the authority in an area such as Soweto, for example, or an authority in the Transkei. In other words, the Minister may also authorize other departments to collect licence fees, and then they, too, receive the special concession in connection therewith.</p>

<p>Here I have only one question in connection with the determination of affinity. The clause provides that the Minister will have the right to say what the affinity of persons is to be to the head of a household. The head of the household will receive a licence and the other members of the household will then receive their radio licences free of charge. They need not be related either; it may only be an affinity or a connection, one might say, between a specific person and the head of the household himself. Is it the intention, when one has a servant, for example, who possesses a transistor radio, that that servant, may also receive the licence free of charge, of course, while that servant is in the service of the head of the household?</p>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned on Wednesday night, I was discussing the expropriation of land under the old Act and the unnecessary expense incurred with the expropriation of developed land on prospective sites for dams. This provision in clause 3 states that when it is in the public interest no development may take place in a defined area once this area has been declared a dam basin controlled area. If the owner of any land is likely to suffer any damage as the result of such an area being declared a dam basin controlled area, he shall be entitled to compensation by the State, and I emphasize the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. This is a very good clause indeed, and I believe, too, that it will cover all concerned, especially the public. Clause 12 is another important clause in the Bill. It brings about the application of the legislation to South West Africa. Now, South West Africa is very much the same as South Africa when it comes to rainfall. In fact, where we have a low average rainfall in South Africa, in South West Africa, the position is even worse, so much so that even to-day, before the introduction of this Bill, we find that no one, not even the owner of agricultural land, may erect even the smallest dam without the permission of the South West Africa Water Board. So we see that the people in South West Africa have, over the years appreciated these difficulties, and because of the very low average rainfall in South West Africa they have been getting their Water Act in line with South Africa’s, with a view, of course, to South Africa enforcing this Bill in South West as well.</p>

<p>When it comes to irrigation boards, the Minister mentioned in his Second Reading speech that the provisions give him the power to change the composition of irrigation boards where these boards fail to carry out their duties, and I think that this is a very good idea, and here the Minister will have our wholehearted support as well, particularly in areas which are suffering from severe drought. We know that lack of control or bad control of our waters can lead to a crisis in times of drought, leading us to pandemonium and even chaos. I think it is an excellent idea that where the Minister finds that a water board is not carrying out its duties, he should be able to dismiss at least half the members of the board and re-appoint other people who are capable of performing this important work more thoroughly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Arising out of what has been said by previous speakers I should merely like to emphasize a few points in connection with this Bill, by way of elucidating important changes and objects resulting from this legislation. When a certain foreign visitor recently travelled fairly extensively through this country, he was asked what he considered to be South Africa’s most urgent problem, and his reply, consisting of one word, was &#x201C;Water&#x201D;. That person was impressed by the vastness of our country and its conspicuous lack of extensive water supplies, particularly in the light of the present tempo of development in the Republic. I think that we can emphasize the fact that we all realize that if we want to take into account this present development in the Republic, particularly in the field of industry, and the rate of growth of our population, it is one of the most important matters which we must make allowances for and to which urgent attention must be given. The hon. the Minister and his Department were specifically giving attention to this matter in order to consider how the water potential of South Africa could best be conserved and utilized in the future, and that is why this legislation is before us to-day. I want to state that this piece of legislation should actually lay a legislative foundation for the Government, and for the Department in particular, as the executive organ, in respect of far-sighted future planning of our water resources, so as to be able to utilize them <span class="col_6107-6108" refersTo="page_0201"/>to the best of our ability, as economically and thriftily as possible, and to let them last as long as possible. In the future tremendously heavy demands will definitely still be made on our water resources, and therefore it is so important for us to answer the questions about how much water there is available; what the demand will be in 10, 20 or 30 years’ time; and how and where that water can be stored and preserved. These are urgent questions and some of the most important clauses in this Bill specifically have them in view. We are convinced that if this is not done, if provision is not made, if there is not adequate planning, if certain areas are not preserved as potential dam basin areas, we run a great risk of not having those potential dam basins available in the future because they have been taken over for other purposes, and if they must then be obtained it would cost us a tremendous amount of money. Therefore I want to commend this legislation to this House as being specifically necessary for planning, with a view to our water supplies and their future utilization. In saying this we merely want to illustrate that these are not insubstantial ideas. A few years ago the national road to Namaqualand and South West Africa was opened in the Olifants River region, and for years there has been agitation for the Clanwilliam dam wall to be raised by at least twenty feet. But despite those ideas, which were already in existence, and in spite of the possibilities at hand, that national road was built, and at the moment the State is making funds available, and there is work in progress, to raise the level of that road at a few points in that dam’s catchment area so that it can reach that dam’s high water mark. This merely goes to illustrate that since our country is developing tremendously in respect of its road construction programme, its railways and its urban planning, and there is a great diversity of works on all levels, we must watch this type of thing, and we must try to prevent the construction of an expensive national road on a terrain which is going to be needed within a few years for water conservation. In the Boland, in the Breede River catchment area, there is another terrain which has been investigated as a dam terrain. It is necessary for a road and a rail deviation to be constructed there, at considerable cost. I am merely mentioning this so that hon. members may realize that here we are dealing with a very real issue in the light of the development of the Republic which we all welcome. We are grateful for this development, and we look forward to it being even greater in the future. We hope that there will be planning over a wide field and that the Department will not be handicapped in carrying out its planning of the utilization of our water resources, which constitute such an essential, such a key factor. On the contrary, they must have the necessary encouragement and the necessary legal powers to do so. The Select Committee was of the opinion that where reservation is applied it could possibly encroach upon farming activities over a long period. It was therefore decided to exclude these standard agricultural activities because they could possibly result in serious problems in certain areas. As a result compensation will eventually not have to be so high either.</p>

<p>There is another point which I should like to emphasize. I do not want to be unnecessarily long-winded, but I merely want to say something about the increasing of subsidies in respect of the utilization of water supplies by the farmers, individually or jointly. I merely want to point out that it is a very welcome increase for which provision is being made in this Bill. The subsidy of R1,000 is being increased to R3,000. Where farmers are tackling a particular project jointly, they will receive R3,000 per person. I think that this is a very great concession to our farming community. It is frequently necessary for people to stand together. In the light of today’s const structure a great deal of money must often be spent in order to undertake such a scheme. It was felt amongst our farmers that the subsidy of one-third should be increased to at least 50 per cent. Although this is not possible, we are grateful for this increase which should prove a very strong incentive, to the individual farmer in particular.</p>

<p>In addition, I want to emphasize that the existing Act makes provision for a subsidy for the utilization of water for land irrigation purposes. It has now been changed in this Act to utilization for agricultural purposes. In other words, we are here dealing with an extension of the framework of this clause. Previously specific provision was made for land irrigation only. Here we have changed the provision by now making it applicable to the provision of water for agricultural purposes. I want to welcome and to commend this change heartily because there are large parts of our country which are within a reasonable distance of available water resources, where farmers have been drilling for water for years with their own funds, but also with the help of the State. One can almost say that they have achieved disconcerting results. One farmer told me that a year ago he had spent R8,000 on providing water and that he did not have water for his livestock, nor proper drinking water, for that matter, on his farm. The purpose here is also to apply these subsidies on another level as well. Where a farmer has to lay down a pipeline, even for the purposes of watering his livestock, or for domestic use, he should be granted assistance. Over the years one sometimes finds that drilling operations in a particular area meet with no success. This costs the State a tremendous amount of money. It costs the farmers themselves a tremendous amount. Such areas are now also being included in this subsidy scheme of the Department. When I think of the Western Cape, I can point out that we have good water resources in the mountains and the catchment areas, but frequently one finds that 10 or 15 miles distant there are areas which <span class="col_6109-6110" refersTo="page_0202"/>receive a mere two or three inches of rain per year. It is absolutely essential to have this extension of the framework of the Water Act, especially in the Western Cape area where the underground water is brackish and unfit for animals. I want to welcome this most heartily. I want to tell the Minister and the Department that the farming community will be sincerely appreciative of this and that we are hereby making a long-term provision which will eventually also save the State a great deal of expense. Savings will be made in respect of costs for drilling subsidies, etc. Drilling operations have in the past, frequently been carried out at tremendous losses and with very little success. I am convinced that with this legislation we are taking a step forward, that we are streamlining our Water Act and that, under the guidance of the hon. the Minister and his Department, we shall make very good progress in respect of water conservation and utilization in the Republic.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill has come as an agreed measure from the Select Committee. The various clauses have been fully dealt with by speakers on both sides, namely the hon. the Minister, the hon. member for Potchefstroom and the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, and also on our side by the hon. member for South Coast and the hon. member for East London (North). Therefore, not wanting to hold up the House, I wish to confine my remarks merely to one clause of the Bill, namely clause 11. This clause was touched upon by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, during the second portion of his speech. This clause relates to the increase in subsidies from R1,000 to R3,000 per owner, when various owners jointly undertake an irrigation scheme, or a pipeline, as the hon. member has mentioned. Naturally we are very happy about this. The hon. the Minister said that this was partly due to the fact that the value of money had depreciated and that this change would bring the position more into line with present-day circumstances. But, Sir, this is a most important clause because there are quite a number of our rivers which do not really have suitable sites for large dams to be built by the department itself. On such rivers, these dams built by owners with riparian rights, can perform a very useful function indeed. Even on those rivers where there are sites for the big Government dams of the future, this may not be something which the department itself may be able to tackle in the immediate future or even in the near future. After all, the department has its difficulties, and I do not think that the hon. the Minister will quarrel with me when I say that his department has perhaps suffered to some extent from indigestion over the last few years, because quite a few of the works which have been planned could not be carried out quite as rapidly as the department may have wished to do. This may in some instances, possibly be due to a shortage of staff, and also perhaps to financial circumstances where, due to financial policy to combat inflation, certain works were put into cold storage for a while. The Van der Kloof Dam is one such example. Similar circumstances may well arise in the future.</p>

<p>Sir, I have said that these works which can be undertaken by private individuals are of very great importance, but I wonder whether the day is not approaching when the basis of subsidies may have to be changed. This method ties the subsidy to the owner and not to the farm. When we had a fairly stable number of farmers in the country this was a perfectly reasonable basis, but we all know the process which is taking place throughout our country. Farmers are buying up their neighbour’s ground, and so the number of owners is diminishing. I should like to quote from official sources to illustrate this point. According to the economic development programme for 1966-71 released by the Department of Planning, the number of Whites employed in agriculture in 1965 was 109.6 thousand, whereas in 1971 it is anticipated that there will only be 96.2 thousand. In the Afrikaans equivalent of this publication, namely the Ekonomiese Ontwikkelingsprogram vir 1968-73, it is stated:</p>

<block name="quote">Waar 23.6 persent van die ekonomiesbedrywige blankes in 1936 in di&#x00E9; produksietak bedrywig was, het slegs 10.3 persent van die blanke arbeidsmag in 1960 in die landbou gewerk. &#x2026; Daar word beraam dat in 1967 ongeveer 113,000 blankes, of 8.7 persent van die blanke arbeidsmag, ekonomiesbedrywig in die landbou was. Op grond van die inligting in die 1951-en 1960-bevolkingsensusse is in die vorige E.O.P.’s beraam dat die vraag na blankes in hierdie produksietak teen ’n koers van 2.15 persent per jaar daal. Volgens die inligting oor die aantal blanke belastingbetalers met landbou as hul hoofbron van inkome, blyk dit dat die aantal blankes werksaam in die landbou sedert die laaste bevolkingsensus teen ’n tempo van 0.4 persent per jaar daal. Vir die huidige E.O.P. word dit aanvaar dat die aantal blankes werksaam in die landbou oor die programmeringstydperk met hierdie tempo, naamlik 0.4 persent per jaar, sal verminder.</block>

<p>So you see, Mr. Speaker, the Government’s own economic planners expect this process to continue. If it does continue, it will, as at present, take place, not only in the extensive areas, but also along our river valleys, where these private schemes undertaken by various owners are liable to be erected, Naturally, the more farms that are bought out by one owner, the more difficult it is for the remaining owners to undertake such a scheme, because automatically the size of the total subsidy available is cut down, because it is limited to R3,000 per owner. I mention this because I think it may become an actual problem in the future. I hope that the hon. the Minister is aware of it and that he would, perhaps, give attention to it at some stage. At this stage I ask him to do <span class="col_6111-6112" refersTo="page_0203"/>no more than think about perhaps changing the basis of subsidy from one of a subsidy per owner to one of a subsidy per unit or per farm.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we were in full agreement on this Bill according to the speeches made yesterday. As for the Select Committee, I have a feeling that, seen against the history of our water legislation of the past, we will in future always be able to be in agreement on such matters as have been before the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast was concerned about the position of the farmers in regards to the subsidies which will be available in future. I am in agreement with the hon. member and I know that it is of great importance to our farming community that everybody should know what the Government will be able and be prepared to do in regard to this matter. We are prepared to spend money on the better distribution of water. I am sure that organized agriculture will take note of it. I am sure after to-day it will not be necessary to draw the attention of the farming community to this matter, because periodicals and newspapers will be &#x201C;on the ball&#x201D; with the news. I think, if there should be any necessity for giving more publicity, it will in due course be done. I wish to thank the hon. member for the way in which he has dealt with all the matters before the house. He has dealt with all the different clauses of this Bill. I wish to express my gratitude to the hon. member for the way in which he has dealt with them and for the way in which he has always been prepared to consider matters of this kind with the necessary objectiveness. I know the hon. member for South Coast has been a member of this House for many years. I also know that he has since the initial stages of the water legislation in 1956 taken a very important and interesting part in all the debates that have taken place in this House.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I also want to express my gratitude to hon. members on this side of the House who took part in this debate. I want to draw attention to one very interesting point in particular which was made by the hon. member for Potchefstroom, namely that when we are dealing with matters concerning water in South Africa, it is an important matter for the whole country. When we find it necessary in the interests of the country and of all concerned to intervene and bring about better control, the public should not regard such action as a punitive measure. When we impose some restriction or other people are apt to come to the conclusion that we do so simply to restrict them unnecessarily. If all of us adopt the right attitude that water is such an important thing in our lives, we shall realize that when control is exercised over water, it is not being exercised for the purpose of restricting somebody, but to ensure that water is available in the distant future to as many people as possible. I hope this will be the spirit in which this legislation is accepted.</p>

<p>I want to thank hon. members who have done their share to facilitate the course of the discussions of this Bill for their contributions; I also want to thank the hon. member for Piketberg, who said that it has become necessary that we in South Africa should make it easier for our people to protect and supplement water on their own farms, and that the contribution which is being made here, is one which will, indeed, have far-reaching effects for us.</p>

<p>Sir, I hope that we shall always adopt the right attitude in future when it comes to matters concerning water. As the hon. member for South Coast has said here, it might be necessary for us to come back to this matter on a subsequent occasion to ask for further control measures. If we were to do so, it would only be in the interests of the country.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>When the White Paper, W.P. X&#x2014;’62, on the Orange River Development Project was laid upon the Table during 1962, it was realized that legislation in regard to this project would subsequently be necessary. Mention was also made of this in the White Paper. Owing to the progress which has been made with the construction of the H. F. Verwoerd dam and the Orange-Fish tunnel, the time has now come to submit this legislation to the House and to place it on the Statute Book. The Bill now before the House is in fact the legislation which was envisaged at the time, and I shall now deal with the most important principles of this Bill.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the works concerned, when water from the Orange River will be delivered into the upper reaches of the Fish River, and also into the Sundays River, several problems will arise which are not covered by present legislation and which will have to be solved. Intermittent rivers will be changed into permanent streams. As a result of this problems could arise, and legislation could eliminate these problems. Some of the problems are for example:</p>

<ol>

<li>1. The use of water from one catchment area in another catchment area;</li>

<li><span class="col_6113-6114" refersTo="page_0204"/>2. The question of the right of the State to effect a change in the flow systems of rivers; and</li>

<li>3. The use of surplus water in terms of the Water Act, etc.</li>

</ol>

<p>Actually, there are four major principles which are contained in this Bill. The first is that the Government is granted the right to use public streams, private streams or natural channels with which to convey water from the Orange River for use for agricultural, urban and industrial purposes. Where the State wants to store or convey water the State normally, where necessary, obtains a servitude of storage, aqueduct or abutment, or all three together. Now the right will be acquired through legislation, to convey water from the Orange River in the rivers concerned and to distribute it among those who are entitled to it, as well as among those to whom the State wants to supply water.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to convert certain rights which riparian owners in the so-called &#x201C;protected areas&#x201D; have into other rights which they will obtain by virtue of this legislation. Protected areas are areas which date from before 1912. It will be necessary for me to elaborate a little on this aspect. In terms of the repealed sections 15 and 16 of the Irrigation and Conservation of Waters Act of 1912, owners could receive protection in respect of existing works upon application to the water court, and similarly those whom they had to notify could at the same time receive protection from the court in respect of works which they intended constructing. After consideration the court then issued an instruction in terms of which the owners concerned received protection for their works, but only in respect of surplus water. In reality therefore it amounted to a distribution of surplus water. As long ago as the thirties it was realized that this was an impossible task for any court or person to undertake. In respect of normal flow it is possible to undertake a distribution, but not in respect of surplus water, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>At the same time however section 19 of Act No. 46 of 1934 provided that notwithstanding any protected works or any protection granted by the court, any owner of riparian works may construct works for the storage of surplus water to a maximum of 25,000,000 gallons, as well as diversion works capable of diverting 10 cusecs of water.</p>

<p>Similar provisions are contained in the Water Act of 1956, but it will be clear that rights in respect of surplus water which can only be utilized periodically do not have the same value as rights in respect of the use of an assured flow of water. For this reason it is essential to provide that those who are for example entitled in terms of section 16 of the Water Act to divert 10 cusecs of surplus water when the surplus water is there, will not have the same rights in respect of water from the Orange River which will be an assured supply of water.</p>

<p>These rights in respect of the so-called &#x201C;protected areas&#x201D; will therefore lapse, and in their place the said owners will be granted rights in respect of an assured supply of water from the Orange River, as determined in the Bill. I shall explain later how these rights will be determined in terms of the Bill.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the problem of possible damage which can be caused as a result of the use of the Fish and Sundays Rivers in order to supply the valleys in question with water from the Orange River. It will of course be clear that expensive water is in these cases being supplied to the valleys, and that the flow systems of the rivers will have to be changed, and that the possibility exists that there will be a degree of disruption as far as crossings, the possible care of river banks, etc. are concerned. In terms of common law the Government, where it may act in terms of statutory powers, is normally not responsible for damages, unless it can be proved that it was negligent. However, I just want to add here that there may in fact be cases where great damage is done, and in this event every case will be considered on its merits with a view to <i>ex gratia</i> compensation to the person or body concerned. This is an assurance which, I think, will satisfy everybody. Timeous steps are being taken to have aerial photographs and surveys made of the present position so that it will be easy to determine the damage if such damage should at a later stage be caused.</p>

<p>It cannot be expected of the State to pay compensation where it has taken steps to improve the present canal systems and to use them for the distribution of water from the Orange River to persons who were previously entitled only to water from one or other of the rivers concerned. Expensive water is being supplied, and if the present canal systems are used or have to be used for the distribution of the water among riparian owners, and such canal systems have to be improved, the State cannot, apart from all these costs, also pay compensation to the owners concerned for the use of the canals. I should like to mention this because I think that some people are really going too far in their claims against the State. There are similar provisions in the Mooi River District Adjustment Act, Act No. 37 of 1954.</p>

<p>I come now to the fourth, and in so far as it is of significance to the riparian owners concerned and their rights, the most important principle included in this legislation, <i>viz.</i> the determination of the rights of owners and consumers in the valleys as soon as water from the Orange River is made available to them or in the rivers concerned. In the first instance it was decided, in respect of those who formerly pumped out or diverted surplus water, seepage or flood water, for example those who were entitled to divert 10 cusecs <span class="col_6115-6116" refersTo="page_0205"/>in the protected areas, and who did not appear on a list of rateable areas of some or other of the larger or smaller boards, to determine their rights with due regard to the areas which were under irrigation in the year before the Act was applied to the area concerned.</p>

<p>With the determination of the said areas the availability and the assured supply of the water they previously had will be taken into consideration. So, for example, where a person could irrigate a hundred morgen with surplus water once in every ten years, such a person cannot expect to receive an assured supply of water from the Orange River for a hundred morgen each year. His former rights will be evaluated with due regard to the fact that he will now be receiving an assured supply of water. I think that that is no more than fair.</p>

<p>As regards those who were scheduled under Grasrug, Lake Arthur and subsequently the Commando Drift dams, and the same applies to the Sundays River&#x2014;and in respect of those scheduled for water from the Mentz dam, the schedules of rateable areas will be regarded as the rights of the said persons in respect of water from the rivers. In other words, these are the existing rights on which tax was paid in the past, and which will therefore now be assured. The owners concerned have been scheduled all these years and have paid tax on their scheduled areas. Owing to soil conservation works in the catchment control area, silting up, and other factors, they have over the years not received an adequate quota. It can be said that they, with few or no exceptions, never received an adequate quota for the irrigation of their scheduled areas. Nevertheless they irrigated, to a greater or lesser degree, the area concerned with stored water, with seepage or with flood water, and these were their rights and they pay tax in respect of the scheduled areas. These scheduled areas are being recognized in the Bill as existing rights, and they will be scheduled for this provided, however, that if there is an error in any list of rateable areas, for example where a man was scheduled for more land than the total surface area of his property, such areas will of course have to be rectified.</p>

<p>The Minister of Water Affairs will, as in the case of all other areas, determine the quota in consultation with the Department of Agricultural Technical Services in respect of the said areas which will receive water. These quotas will not necessarily be the same from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the river, but in certain demarcated areas the quotas will be uniform and will apply to all riparian owners. I cannot at this juncture say what these quotas will be. These quotas, will, as I have said, be determined in consultation with other departments, with due regard for the climatic conditions, the crops which are being produced, and other factors. However, the intention will be to do this as fairly and reasonably as possible, with due regard for all the factors which prevailed in the past.</p>

<p>There are a few other less important principles which are included in this Bill, such as the question of the repeal of the existing hybrid Acts which apply to the areas concerned; that the irrigation boards of the areas will in future act in terms of the Water Act and the special provisions of this Act; the question of appeal; the question of the protection of certain special agreements or transactions negotiated in terms of the laws which are being repealled. However, it is not necessary to go into these lesser important principles. These are principles of a more consequential nature. In my opinion the principles which have now been dealt with are the main principles. These were also regarded by the Select Committee as being the most important principles.</p>

<p>This Bill was regarded as being so important that, also as a result of representations, it was decided to refer it to a Select Committee for consideration. The Select Committee gave this Bill very thorough consideration. Those concerned were afforded an opportunity of giving evidence before the Committee, which was in fact done, as well as holding discussions with officials of the Department. As a result of this the Select Committee, after a number of meetings, unanimously agreed on this Bill, with certain amendments which were made, amendments which in no way affected the principles of the Bill but which did in fact state these principles more clearly. I want to express my gratitude to the Select Committee for their study and thorough consideration of the Bill.</p>

<p>This Bill in its present form is, after discussions with all the parties concerned, acceptable to those who will be affected by the Orange River Project and the Bill, and as far as can be ascertained, everyone is satisfied with it. It is hoped that the project and this Bill will be of great benefit to the valleys concerned and will lead to the future prosperity of the riparian owners.</p>

<p>There is just one thing I want to add, and that has a bearing on the rights of municipalities. Evidence was also given before the Select Committee in regard to the existing rights of certain municipalities and on the question of what their rights will be under the new dispensation. I want to give the assurance that not only are the existing rights of the municipalities concerned in respect of the use of water being protected, but if they produce evidence to the effect that they need more water in future, more water for use and beneficial utilization will be supplied to them. After all, the Department of Water Affairs is there to provide this water where it is required in the interests of South Africa. I am also pleased that we were able to state it so specifically. There was concern among many of the municipalities as to whether it would be possible to make sufficient water for their requirements available in time. That is why it is essential that it was stated beyond any doubt on this occasion that this will in fact be the case. It is an essential function of the Department <span class="col_6117-6118" refersTo="page_0206"/>and also its duty to supply water to such bodies. Water for domestic purposes is primary use and is always given preference.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill again, as the hon. the Minister has said, has been referred to a Select Committee which has been appointed before the Second Reading. It is again part of a pattern which I hope Parliament will be able to follow in regard to legislation of this kind, i.e. dealing with our water supplies in South Africa. This is probably the most important element in the whole of the country and I think this procedure augers well for the future. The Minister has been prepared to send a Bill, like this, as he did with the one we dealt with earlier on this afternoon, the Water Amendment Bill, to a Select Committee before the Second Reading. There we can get round the table in a manner which is not possible in the Second Reading debate, because of the ordinary normal rules of debate. The rules permit a full debate, I am not suggesting otherwise, but there are naturally certain limitations to debate in the House which is not the case when we deal with a matter in a Select Committee. In the Select Committee you can get the officials before you and you can go right into the inner meaning of the Bill. That has now been the case with several Bills of this kind. The matter we are dealing with under this Bill has nothing to do with the Minister’s Vote, and I want to make it quite clear, seeing that one or two members have asked me what we were going to do on the Minister’s Vote. We are not dealing with the Minister’s Vote; when the Minister’s Vote comes on, the administration of the Department will be under consideration. Under the Minister’s Vote, the hon. members will have the opportunity&#x2014;and no doubt will take the opportunity&#x2014;of expressing their opinions in regard to various matters associated with the administration of the Department. This is a Bill which was referred to a Select Committee and thoroughly discussed and debated by the Select Committee. Here again I should like to pay tribute to the patience of the chairman who was very kind to us and who stretched the rules on occasions so that we might get to the heart of some of the points which were being debated and which resulted in a great success.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, my hon. Leader put me in a difficulty here, because we are used to your approval of the position where we stray from the straight and narrow path; perhaps the Chairman was merely following your very good example when he allowed us a little latitude as you do from time to time. But may I say that is not contained in this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Chairman was very patient and it did pay dividends, but we also had the staff. Here again I want to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister’s Department. They did not only help us in the Select Committee, but they dealt with people who appeared before the Select Committee to give evidence. They saved us a tremendous amount of time by meeting the good folk and hearing their complaints. Where it was merely a matter of explaining the provisions of this Bill, which were not always understood, and it could not be otherwise when farmers from the backveld&#x2014;of whom I am one&#x2014;come along, because we do not understand legal terminology and the legal wording of the Bill, the Department saved us a great amount of time by explaining matters. It helped us a lot; we also took evidence from the witnesses concerned and they appeared to be satisfied. While it is not part of the Bill, some of the assurances that were given by officials and by the legal adviser were recorded and printed in the evidence according to the resolution of Parliament. Therefore, it stands there for what it is worth. It is precisely the same as a speech by the hon. the Minister. What the Minister has said this afternoon, is not in the Bill and there is no law to carry out what the Minister has said. He was telling us what is in the Bill as he understands it, and so similarly the assurances which were given by the officials in regard to a very intricate matter with many facets, were recorded, printed and form part of the record.</p>

<p>Now, what was the big trouble in this particular matter? Firstly, we had to find, if we could, the ambit of the whole of the project. We had to find out where the borders, and the first Bill which was referred to the Select Committee, was unsure because it had a provision allowing the State President, from time to time hereafter, to proclaim for the purpose of the project, and therefore the purpose of the Act to be passed by Parliament, certain areas where there were controlled areas. By proclamation they could be brought within the ambit of the Act. The Select Committee did not like that because we advertised for objections and for people who wanted to express their views. I am not quarelling with the decisions which you, Mr. Speaker, make, but I may say that this Bill was very nearly a hybrid Bill because of the number of private interests involved in it. It might well have made the stoutest hearts of the Department’s officials quail when they looked at what they had to grapple with when they were bringing a Bill before Parliament which they hoped to put into law within a year or two, never mind, within the course of one particular Session. I want to indicate the rights of people, not the people who were affected by the Orange River project as it was originally defined, which allowed for extensions from time to time by proclamations by the State President, but as it was finally narrowed down. If hon. members look at the title, they will find that it has changed from that of the original Bill. In dealing with these problems, here were the people who had rights: I refer only to the water from the tunnel, coming from the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam through the tunnel and I am ignoring all the other areas <span class="col_6119-6120" refersTo="page_0207"/>which were initially included in the project; I am dealing merely with that water delivered into the Theebus Spruit and then down through the Brak River. The rights were as follows: There were private persons who had constructed irrigation works prior to the construction of the Grassridge and Lake Arthur Dams. Their rights are recognized in the 1956 Act, i.e. the main Act. Their rights were recognized and therefore were in existence.</p>

<p>There were private persons who had water rights under the old Irrigation Act of 1912. Those rights were recognized by the Minister and are at present in existence.</p>

<p>Certain owners obtained permits from the board to use water on unscheduled land as provided for by Section 10 (6) (a) (i). Certain owners obtained permits from the board to use water for domestic and industrial purposes.</p>

<p>In addition to water which certain irrigation boards along the Tarka River received from Commandodrift and Lake Arthur, they received an extra supply due to the loss of flood waters which amounts to about 50 per cent of their entitlement to conserved water.</p>

<p>The Scanlen Irrigation Board had the benefit of a differential rating for conserved water, which right is derived from a 1926 notarial agreement. Certain owners situated above the dam were in a protected area and enjoyed certain legal rights and privileges. There were a number of private owners along the upper Great Fish River who had private works abstracting water for unscheduled land which lies outside the board’s district. Examples were given of such cases.</p>

<p>The board has given certain persons pumping rights. These persons are situated below the lowest diversion works and accordingly their pumping cannot affect the distribution of the board. There are also owners situated along the tributaries of the Great Fish River and the Tarka River whose works are outside the board’s districts, but who appropriate the water abstracted by their works on to scheduled land. All these people had to be considered. This is what the officials, and subsequently the Select Committee, had to face upto. The Department adopted the method of wiping out all these rights by means of a clause in the Bill which will extinguish all these rights and starting on a clear slate. They put in a provision which will reinstate all those rights in terms of permits or scheduled land as provided for in section 62 or 63 of the Water Act. We shall now wipe out and then reinstate so that no one will suffer. This then was the point, because if anybody felt aggrieved or did not understand the position, we felt they should appear before the Select Committee so that we would be given the opportunity of hearing what they had to say. That is where the officials helped us considerably. They were able to take a large number of these good folk and explain to them in simple language precisely what was contemplated, and to meet their fears and their difficulties.</p>

<p>Then there was another class of persons. We also had a map before us. Now, if nature is allowed to take its course, apart from the time when you may get a heavy downfall of rain, the dams are dry or virtually dry, and there is little normal flow water running down the Theebus Spruit, the Great Brak or Fish River. There are about 12 farmers whose farms are bisected by these rivers, particularly in the Theebus Spruit area, who have built weirs across the rivers. Something like 12 weirs have been built across the rivers for the purpose of access from the one side to the other, because the farmers’ farms are on both sides of the river. That was about to be changed. A permanent flow of water which will supply everybody below the tunnel was now to run down the river so that weirs which were constructed to deal with the possible flash flood now and again and could stand up to that, were possibly unable to stand up to a permanent flow of water to the magnitude which is necessary to supply all the people who have enjoyed water rights. I may say that as far as the people who were enjoying the rights which have just been enunciated, are concerned, I think that this is manna from heaven; it is an absolute God-send to them. We do not know what a permanent supply of water is. I do not think it can have the ordinary meaning, but whatever it may be, it simply means something very much more than the hit-and-miss method which they have had in the past years when the rain did not come and the irrigation dams dried up. It was of no use for a man to have scheduled land of 50, 100, 200 or 400 morgen when he did not have water. Because the land was scheduled there, it did not help him; what he needed was water. As the hon. the Minister said just now, these people are being protected to the extent that they will now get a fair allocation of water in common with all those others who have rights to water, because their existing rights are being extinguished and new rights are being substituted which will give them a constant, assured supply of water on to their land. It will naturally be determined what amount of water per morgen they shall get; that is quite understood. There is not a limitless flow for anybody who in future may demand some outrageous amount of water for his land. But a plan will be worked out; a standard will be fixed, and on that basis an allocation will then be made so that it is fair to one and all. They all get their water but now, as far as we are able to judge, they get a permanent supply, a reliable supply, and, Sir, what that means to irrigation farmers you will know very well indeed. This is a transition from continual drought-stricken conditions to a position where a farmer can plant his crops, secure in the knowledge that at the appropriate time he is going to get water for irrigation purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we had another difficulty here. With all these rights we realized that if we were not very careful on the Select Committee <span class="col_6121-6122" refersTo="page_0208"/>we could bring forward a Bill which was going to leave sufficient doubt and uncertainty in the Bill that it would lead to law cases. I want to say at once that this was a matter which occasioned us very deep concern. We gave this matter very deep thought indeed. We do not want law cases and we as a Select Committee did not want to bring back to the Minister a Bill which was so uncertain that it could give rise to big law cases, quite apart from the difficulty of the Department or of an irrigator, a user of water, who wants to know precisely where he stands. We did not want to have such uncertainty anywhere that it would give rise to big law suits, particularly as we had provided something here which was not in the original Bill, and that is the right of recourse to the Water Court in certain cases. I repeat that we do not want to bring legislation to Parliament which, when it is on the Statute Book, is so uncertain that it can give rise to big law suits. We would far sooner have the rights of everybody concerned stated clearly; and here again we have had to give the Minister, as we did in the last Bill, very wide-ranging rights, and we did it for the same reason as we did so in the last Bill. Somebody has to take the responsibility, Sir. In the water supplies for South Africa, we have to have somebody taking the responsibility and the Minister will have to take that responsibility on his shoulders; he will have to see that his Department functions effectively and efficiently, because it is a barrier, a buffer, between him and the public. Sir, we have given him powers and we are prepared to give him powers which will enable him to deal fairly with the users of water in whatever areas in which they may be.</p>

<p>Sir, that brings me back for a moment to the position of the first Bill as it came to us, because it covered a much wider area than the Bill which we now have before us. Here we have a limited area, but we were in this difficulty with the first Bill that if we were to deal with the water of the Orange River, where did it end? We tried to follow it to see where the Orange River project could go if and when the Van der Kloof Dam is built, if and when the Torquay dam is built, if and when other water works are carried out and when controlled areas are brought within the ambit of the scheme by proclamation by the President. But, Sir, how far could we go back? It was well enough to follow the Orange River water when it had passed the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam, but how far back did it go? It was Orange River water. Did it go back into the Oxbow scheme in Basutoland? That is Orange River water. How far were we to go back? We could not go into a foreign country. But, Mr. Speaker, as you probably know, steps are afoot to take water from the Tugela and to pump it into the Vaal or into the Orange River. One of our principles on this side of the House is that we shall develop our own water resources and that we shall have a water grid. I am very pleased to see now that very eminent authorities are starting to talk about the use of a water grid. Those are principles that we laid down four years ago. Sir, a water grid could take water from Natal and put it into the Orange. Is that Orange River water, Sir? Was the scheme to go that far? No, Sir, this was becoming entirely too fanciful altogether. This Bill which is before us now deals with an area which is specified and hereafter further Bills will have to be introduced into Parliament to deal with other developments which may take place. This Bill deals with water that goes through the tunnel from the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam into the Theebus Spruit, and water down the Orange for other purposes and into other areas, so far as I can see, because of the multitude of problems that have to be faced, will require further Bills hereafter when the money is available and the professional and technical staff is available. That will have to be dealt with piecemeal because, Sir, it is a great concept; it is a majestic concept and it is a concept which strikes at the very basis of the development of our country and we do not know where that goes. The Minister will from time to time have to use his powers if, for example, oil was discovered in a particular spot which lacked an adequate water supply, or if a huge industrial area were suddenly to spring up at a great growth point. Sir, this is happening in South Africa to-day; it is happening at Richard’s Bay and water has to be found because the local rivers are quite unable to cope with the situation. The Orange River is our big, main water supply and if development takes place anywhere in an area which is served by the Orange River, then water will have to be found and it may have to be found in vast quantities, so we are only at the beginning. We stand here to-day in this House legislating in regard to this particular project, which is not the Orange River project; it is a beginning, a portion of the Orange River project, and hereafter others will come after us and they will deal with the question of the handling, the conservation and the distribution of the Orange River water. But, Sir, at this moment we, the members of the Select Committee, say that we have done our best; we have come with a Bill which we believe will meet the necessities of the case, which is fair to the water users of the Orange, which is fair to the Department and the Minister and which is fair to industrial development, municipal development as well as the development of irrigators and other farmers who are users of water. All of them, Sir, have been properly catered for here, and I believe that they will find that provision has been made for a fair apportionment of the water which they may require, and if they can make a fair case to the Minister for more water, that extra water will be forthcoming from that very great supply that we have in the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam. We support the second reading.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>We want to thank the Minister and also the hon. member for South Coast for their kind words on the work done by the Select Committee. I think we in this House must, with deep appreciation, <span class="col_6123-6124" refersTo="page_0209"/>take cognizance of the service we received from one or our officials, Mr. Potgieter, who at a youthful age met his end in such a tragic way immediately before one of the meetings of the Select Committee. Sir, we want to join the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for South Coast in expressing our sincere gratitude to the Department for the co-operation we had from them in this connection, which made it possible for us to produce this Bill, a Bill which is acceptable to all in the widest sense of the word. After the Second Reading speech by the hon. the Minister, and after the comprehensive survey by the hon. member for South Coast we want to be very brief, but we would just like, since the hon. member for South Coast also mentioned them, to emphasize three points in particular.</p>

<p>The first is that in the Bill as it was submitted to our scrutiny in the first instance, reference was made to an area which would be covered by the Orange River development project. Since this Orange River development scheme is a huge scheme, you can understand that as the Bill stood, it included an area which the Select Committee felt was far greater than the area with which we actually had to deal. This Orange River development project and the water from this project implicate water from the Caledon River and implicate the Lower Orange River, and it can also implicate the irrigation lands on the Orange Free State side and in the Cape Province, which are far removed from this area. Hence this amendment which we introduced. We are dealing here with an area which will receive water from the Orange River through the Orange Fish River tunnel, at present under construction, and that water will be delivered into the Theebus Spruit. There is no doubt whatsoever for which area this Bill makes provision, and if other Government water control areas should be declared, this decision will be taken by the State President, and then it will be necessary to introduce new legislation which will affect those areas.</p>

<p>In the second instance, and the hon. member for South Coast also referred to this, the question here was that with this vast development project, a new background was in fact being created in respect of the entire development of the Fish and Sundays River Valleys. In practice it now almost seems as if the people occupying those areas are in fact Orange River riparian owners as well. With this legislation we had to be careful to do nothing which could affect the rights of any person. In this connection we just want to say that we have succeeded in that, and we also have evidence to this effect, i.e. that all concerned are convinced that what is written into this legislation protects the rights of every individual and everybody to which this development scheme relates. We want to make this very clear, and we also want to state that it is with appreciation that we take cognizance of the fact that as far as we know all concerned are satisfied that these rights, to which the hon. member for South Coast also referred, are being protected in the Bill.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to one difficult matter we came across in the execution of our duty. We want to refer to clauses 6 (3) and 7 (2) in the legislation as it stood. Those clauses provided that the State need pay no compensation in respect of steps taken by the Minister by virtue of the provisions of subsections (1) and (2). Here we felt that we had a position which would have made it a little difficult for people if they had found that real problems were being created for them in respect of the execution of their duties after this scheme had come into operation. We felt very strongly about this. We felt that these two clauses were a little drastic, and that what we were really doing here was perhaps to deprive people, under certain circumstances, of certain powers, particularly if one looked at the English text. While the Afrikaans text read &#x201C;Die Minister hoef nie&#x201D;, the English text read &#x201C;The State shall not be liable&#x201D;, and we were very worried about this. But we also want to make it clear that we were not only worried about the fact that we would have been making the position of the owners of scheduled land a burdensome one, but on the other hand also that if we went and tampered with this, a position would have arisen where people would come forward, in season and out of season, with trivial claims. We want to make this clear so that this hon. House will take cognizance of our concern in respect of this matter, but after mature consideration we eventually decided, as it now appears from this Bill, to delete these two clauses. This was consequently done because, after mature consideration, it became clear to us that we might as well do this because in respect of this matter no problems had cropped up in the past. But we also decided&#x2014;and you will see it in the printed report; we want to say this here so that there can be no uncertainty in regard to this matter&#x2014;that if we should ever find that the omission of these two clauses will result in people coming forward with trivial claims, and making the work of the Department difficult in this way (when viewed against the background of our manpower shortage and all this entails) then I do not think the Minister will hesitate in future to make an amendment in order to rectify this matter. I feel quite satisfied, and so does the Select Committee and the Department, that we have acted wisely in omitting these two clauses, but we want to state equally emphatically that if the Minister should ever deem it necessary, as a result of the misuse of this step which the Select Committee and the Department took, he should not hesitate to take further steps.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Because of the magnitude and importance of this legislation before the House, I must say I feel particularly privileged to have been able to serve on the Select Committee appointed to draw up this Bill. This scheme, the Orange-Fish-Sundays River Scheme, has always been a project which has been close to my heart personally, not only because I happen to know <span class="col_6125-6126" refersTo="page_0210"/>that area very well, but also because I happen to know many people who will be effected and benefit by this project. I am very pleased, too, that the Minister saw fit to refer such an important Bill to a Select Committee where, as you have heard, we were able to gather much needed and valuable evidence from local authorities and people directly concerned, and where we were able to discuss the matter in detail and bring legislation to this hon. House.</p>

<p>The application of the Bill effects the water to be diverted from the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam across the Orange River, through a subterranean waterway running from Venterstad to Theebus, and then down the Theebus Spruit into the large irrigation schemes. This Bill, of course, brings about the realization and the culmination of years and years of discussion and research and planning, and of course budgeting as well. I for one have always taken great interest in this project. Mr. Speaker, I believe we are making history here this afternoon, we are busy making history with one of the largest irrigation projects South Africa has ever known. It was mentioned earlier, by the hon. member for South Coast that water will now be brought to an area which has been suffering under prolonged drought. He mentioned, too, that because of this, large irrigation schemes and dams, such as Grassridge, Lake Arthur, Commandodrift, Vanrynevelds Pass Dam and Lake Mentz, have been empty, or partly empty, for many years due to droughts. While I do agree that it is partly due to droughts I think hon. members who know the area, will agree with me, too, that there is another reason why these dams have not been full for so long. It is because of the terrible erosion in this area, and large parts are still being eroded. But we have over the years been constructing large conservation works in that particular area. Those major soil conservation dams are conserving much of the water which used to flow down freely into irrigation dams below. Now I believe that this is a good thing. But where we have developed this area and conserved much of our soil by means of these works, we have not been able to &#x201C;have our cake and eat it&#x201D; at the same time. Hence, large irrigation schemes below these soil conservation dams have had to suffer.</p>

<p>I have always maintained that there is no substitute for water, and while I say this, I maintain too, that there is no estimating the value of water. While we are budgeting for a scheme like this, which may appear to be an expensive project, I do believe there is no estimating the value of this water. We simply have to have it, come what may, and almost regardless of what it may cost the State.</p>

<p>In order to divert this water, hon. members know that the Government is busy erecting the large Hendrik Verwoerd Dam below Venterstad. This dam was estimated to cost R30 million, but to-day we expect it to cost in the region of R70 million. When complete, it will form one of the largest inland lakes in the Southern Hemisphere. An area of more than 200 square miles will be covered by water. The water will be diverted from there to the Fish and Sundays Rivers’ valleys via the subterranean waterway of no less than 51&#x00BD; miles long. It is estimated that this tunnel will cost R67 million, but I believe, knowing the area and the problems which are arising there, the tunnel is going to cost very much more than this, simply because where they are busy excavating the tunnel now, the formation is softer than was first expected. If it were hard, solid iron-stone granite, it would have been easier and cheaper to excavate. But because of the soft formation, a lot of rock and soil keeps falling in and this is holding up the work in the early stages of the tunnel. When the water flows from the tunnel into the Theebus Spruit, we will be able to increase the stream to about 37&#x00BD; million gallons of water per hour, down the Theebus Spruit. The hon. member who resumed his seat just now, mentioned that the Theebus Spruit as such, was never intended by nature to cater for a permanent stream of water. This is where we have had problems arising from the evidence before the Select Committee. There are at least eleven landowners between the exit of the tunnel and Grassridge who feel they will have problems with the caving in or collapsing of the river banks. I am pleased to say that as far as this problem is concerned, I am not pessimistic at all. With the evidence we have gathered, and knowing the area. I believe we can overcome this problem, not by building a canal, which will cost many millions of rands, but by biological means, by planting reeds, (fluitjiesriet) in the existing weirs in the bed of the river. We will be able to overcome this danger and thus save our State many millions of rand in this cheap and simple way. In any case, knowing the area, a canal will never be suitable, because the soil is so porous and there is so much erosion taking place along the banks of the Theebus Spruit that it would be impossible, I believe, ever to consider building a canal to convey the water from the tunnel to Grassridge; it will have to take its natural course down the bed of this particular spruit, but this important work must be undertaken immediately.</p>

<p>As hon. members have heard, these eleven landowners have riparian rights, unlike those below the Grassridge Dam, who have servitudes Now we have overcome those problems as well, due to the able assistance and guidance of our officials. Of course, the project will even go further eventually, in that another tunnel will be excavated from the Theebus Spruit through the Wapads Mountains, into the Sundays River, taking the water into the Vanrynevelds Pass Dam, and further down the Sundays River into Lake Mentz. But even if it should take us years to complete the second phase of this scheme, water can still be taken into Lake Mentz, simply by means of a short canal from the lower regions of the Great Fish River into the Little Fish River, and another canal conveying it into Lake Mentz, as well. So, hon. members can see that we can kill two birds with one stone.</p>

<p><span class="col_6127-6128" refersTo="page_0211"/>This is long-term planning, and the project has come at long last. Unfortunately, it was not undertaken years ago. Nevertheless, we are busy with the scheme now, and I do believe that, if we do not reap the fruits of it directly ourselves, future generations will be grateful to us, in that we undertook such an enormous project. We have been successful with an oil strike in the Port Elizabeth area, and some of this water will be needed for development in that area as well, where there will be a growth point. I must add, too, that I believe, with further development on this project, we could even divert water, if necessary, to the Border and the East London area for growth and development there.</p>

<p>I am very happy to be able to support this legislation, this Orange River-Sundays River irrigation scheme. I do believe it is going to be a wonderful project. It will be a boom to our country and particularly to agriculture and, of course, we will be able to produce power through hydro-electric schemes in the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam itself.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for East London (North) was quite right in stating that this was an historic occasion. But it is an historic occasion in more than one respect, because&#x2014;I am subject to correction, but this is what I think&#x2014; this is the first time that mention is made in legislation of the Orange River development project as such. This is a project which promises to affect and to change the entire socioeconomic set-up of a very large part of our country.</p>

<p>In the second instance this is an historic occasion for the inhabitants of the Fish River and Sundays River Valleys in particular, because this legislation now gives shape to the dreams and visions of many years. The hearts of those people are glad to-day as a result of what is being envisaged by this Bill.</p>

<p>The greatest part of this legislation applies to the Great Fish River Valley, which falls partly in my constituency and partly in the constituency of my hon. colleague, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development. Irrigation in that valley was introduced many years before 1912. In that time many of the people constructed and administered their own water conservation works. But the struggle which has been waged in that valley has always been against the lack of an adequate supply of water and proper means of conservation. It is calculated that, during the past ten to fifteen years, the irrigation farmer has at best been able to irrigate only eight to ten inches per year per morgen and this happened only once during the past fifteen years. Hon. members will therefore agree that the storage of water for that area is of the utmost importance. Additionally we are dealing with an area which is regarded by experts to be some of the best irrigation land in the Republic of South Africa, the agricultural potential of which has never been fully utilized. This legislation is therefore ushering in a new era for those people. It supplies the stimulus for an area which is already viable, to develop to its full potential and strength. Of course, the State will also have to play its part here in determining the optimum water requirements per morgen of that land, but we have every confidence that the Minister will see to these aspects.</p>

<p>In addition we also want to thank the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, who has already undertaken to make attempts to place an official of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services at the disposal of the irrigation farmers, so that preparations can be made by way of experiment in order to determine which crops can successfully be cultivated in that valley when there is an adequate water supply.</p>

<p>On behalf of the irrigators of the Great Fish River Valley I also want to extend my sincere thanks to the Minister for having sent officials to this area before the introduction of this Bill in order to make themselves conversant with the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<p>If it is borne in mind that irrigation farming in this area has been applied since the previous century, it is understandable, as the hon. member for South Coast also remarked, that an enormous number of servitude rights have been established, some of which would have been purchased at very great expense. Others would have been acquired by court procedures. If it is also borne in mind that at present only the following categories of water are flowing in the Fish River, namely stored water from the Grasrug, the Lake Arthur and the Commando Drift dams, floodwaters and seepage from springs along the river course, then it is clear that the situation in this respect is as complex and complicated as one could possibly imagine. For these reasons it is understandable that with the new legislation, which is of a far-reaching nature, the irrigators of that area initially regarded it with minds filled with doubt, suspicion and a certain degree of concern. In a situation where people have for many years had to cope with an inadequate water supply, and the main source of water was from floodwaters as and when that became available, it is difficult to imagine yourself in a situation where it is being envisaged that you will now be provided with a permanent source which will meet all your needs. It is a strange phenomenon that throughout the entire length of the Fish River, from its origin in the Wapad mountain to where it flows into the sea, it has never been found possible to build one single irrigation <span class="col_6129-6130" refersTo="page_0212"/>works or storage dam of any size along its course. Even the Grasrug dam was constructed across the Brak River, which is a tributary of the Fish River and which is situated above the confluence of the Brak and the Fish Rivers.</p>

<p>Yet, thanks to the appointment of this Select Committee and the wholehearted and sympathetic co-operation which was received from the Department of Water Affairs, the irrigators began to become aware that they were entering a dispensation where they would have a constant, guaranteed supply of water available, in a volume which was two to three times as great as that to which they were accustomed during the past fifteen to twenty years, even under the most favourable circumstances. In this connection I should just like to mention the name of one official of the Department, namely Mr. Dowling, because I think that he was of inestimable value to us.</p>

<p>To support these statements I need only mention that the supply position of the three dams at present serving the area is as follows, and that after a period of reasonably good rains. Grasrug at the moment contains only 14 per cent of its normal capacity, that is 3,139 morgen feet of water. Commando Drift and Lake Arthur together contain at present 46 per cent of their maximum capacity, that is. 17,063 morgen feet of water. Altogether this is a total of approximately 20,000 morgen feet of stored water, which has to supply the needs of very nearly 18,000 morgen of irrigation land. From these figures it is therefore quite clear that floodwaters, as well as seepage, plays an extremely important role in the irrigation setup of the valley. It is obvious therefore that it will be a superhuman task to entrench all the present rights, servitudes, etc. in the legislation which is now before the House. Quite early on in its consultations the Select Committee came to the conclusion that this would be an impossible task. In addition it is also imperative that, apart from other valid considerations, the Minister must have full control over the water which is being taken by the Government from one watershed to another, as is in fact the case here. It is also obvious that in drafting the legislation no cognizance can be taken of the different kinds of water flowing into a river. All kinds of water, i.e. floodwaters, stored and seepage water, are now being regarded as one, and are dealt with as such in the Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 3 of the Bill under consideration ensures that when the water of the Orange River flows into the Fish River no person will be in a less favourable position owing to the deprivation and cancellation of existing rights. In fact, this clause promises and guarantees that the irrigators will not only retain existing rights, but that they will be much better off owing to the fact that water from the Orange River will be made available. The people of the valley accept it in this way. We also believe that that will be the situation.</p>

<p>All that has to happen now is that the water from the Orange River must be released into the Fish River. We of that area are looking forward with longing to the day in 1971 when that event will take place. After the passing of this legislation by this House and by the Other Place, we leave its implementation in the safe hands of the hon. the Minister and his Department in the firm belief that justice will be done to all. Without a doubt, a golden era has dawned for the Fish River Valley.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, again as in the case of the previous Bill we have debated, namely the Water Amendment Bill, this has come as an agreed measure from a Select Committee. Again I do not wish to detain the House unnecessarily. I will confine myself to one clause of this Bill.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for South Coast has pointed out, the area which can be affected by this Bill is severely circumscribed by clause 2, which cuts out of the Bill any other area outside the Orange River area, except that which will be served by the Orange-Fish Tunnel and discharged into the Theebus Spruit and which the State President subsequently declares in the <i>Gazette</i> to be an area for the purposes of this Act. However, I think we must realize that this is nonetheless a very large area. If we take the area specified, for example, in phase 1 of the White Paper, namely the Fish and Sundays River Valley, we have an area of some 16,000 morgen. Again under phase 2 we have an extra area of 41,000 morgen, giving us some 57,000 morgen. These were the two phases which the Government has accepted, namely phases 1 and 2. However, if we go on to phases 3 and 4, we find there an extra 26,000 and an extra 30,000 morgen respectively, bringing it to a total of 113,000 morgen. This is besides the supply of 14 million gallons per day for the towns along the Fish River Valley and to Port Elizabeth of 40 million gallons per day.</p>

<p>It was said at the time when the White Paper was issued and it has been said subsequently, that the whole Orange River project scheme was flexible. Of course, there have been changes already. The Hendrik Verwoerd Dam is being built to a higher level than was originally intended under the first phase. We have had the Welbedacht Dam added to the complex of dams along the Caledon and the Orange. Also, the diameter of the tunnel has been increased under the 20 per cent excess clause in the contract from 16¾ feet to 17¼ feet. Again, De Aar and Noupoort will now receive water under phase 1.</p>

<p>I have mentioned this flexibility because there are of course areas other than those specifically mentioned in the White Paper, which it is only natural should be served by the Orange River-Fish Tunnel and the water that is discharged into the Theebus Spruit. I have in mind, for example areas such as the Bushmans River. I do not know the area involved there; but there is also what I may call the Lower Fish which was excluded <span class="col_6131-6132" refersTo="page_0213"/>from the White Paper, i.e. that section of the Fish River from Junction Drift, the junction of the Little Fish with the Great Fish, i.e. the area between there and the sea. There we have an area of some 15,000 morgen which could be irrigated. I think it would be strange if the area in which one of the people who helped for many years to keep alive the whole idea of the Orange-Fish Scheme, the late Dr. Tom Bowker, where he lived and which he represented here in this House, were not to be included in the area that would receive water under this scheme. As the hon. the Minister is no doubt well aware, there have been promises, both written and verbal, that this area, to which I have just referred, will at some time come under the scheme. I do not want to pursue it unduly at this stage. But this is one of the other reasons that I am glad that we were able in the Select Committee to satisfy all interested parties that there would be no substraction from their rights and that they would at least receive equal, if not better, rights in the future under this Bill that we are putting through. Therefore, I have much pleasure in joining my colleagues in supporting this Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the fact that once again there was unanimity in regard to this Bill. As a matter of fact, the hon. members tried hard to be as unanimous as possible, just as happened on the Select Committee. For that I am very grateful. I am also grateful for the ideas expressed here. I just wanted to remark that two points were raised, the one by the hon. member for South Coast and the other by the hon. member for Smithfield. The matters mentioned are the limited nature of the scheme and the limitation of the rights. The satisfaction which the Committee could therefore bring about, they brought about in respect of the rights and the area under discussion in this legislation, and not only were they able to satisfy themselves, they were also able to give satisfaction to all concerned in this matter.</p>

<p>Of course, it is also possible, with such legislation, to conjecture about the future, as the hon. member for Albany did. I just want to say to the hon. member that I believe that the Orange River project is a living project which will link two oceans. I do not think that this generation, will, in our time, complete the Orange River Project, because we may be able to complete the construction works on the two main rivers, but I do not think that it is at present within our power to complete the apportionment and conceive what will eventually be done with the waters of the scheme. As we learn from experience and the needs present themselves, the waters of the Orange River will, with further reflection and further study, also be adjusted to the greater requirements of South Africa. From time to time the hon. member, and other hon. members as well, will come forward with very fertile ideas. However, I think that these fertile ideas will from time to time also receive the necessary attention. I want to agree with the hon. member, because we cannot at present foresee what we are eventually going to achieve with the Orange River Project. However, if we apportion the water carefully enough and utilize the water at our disposal carefully enough, we will in future be able to supply South Africa with far more sustenance from this source than we have been able to provide up to the present. I thank the hon. members for their contribution.</p>

<heading>ESTABLISHMENT OF THIRD ISCOR</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The General Manager of Iscor recently indicated that the third Iscor works must go into production by 1972, and that the next major expansion must take place in 1984, followed by another larger works by 1995. The Government is now in a position to announce its decision in regard to the further expansion plans of Iscor.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary for me to emphasize what an important role Iscor plays in the economy of the country. From its humble beginnings, and amidst opposition in the early thirties, this undertaking developed into one of the country’s industrial show pieces. Iscor is the result of a far-sighted policy on the part of the then Government, and its establishment was of inestimable significance for the industrial development of our country and for the expansion of our economic structure.</p>

<p>Inexpensive high quality steel is an indispensible requirement for the development of a country’s factories, and this need has been pre-eminently satisfied by Iscor. In the interests of a better geographic distribution of our manufacturing industries the Government decided that Iscor should undertake no further substantial expansion at existing works in Pretoria and Vanderbijlpark. At these works, therefore, Iscor will have to confine itself to rounding off and modernization. However, it is expected that steel consumption in this country will double itself over the next 10 to 12 years, and as it is the policy of the Government that Iscor should retain its leading role as steel manufacturer the immediate construction elsewhere of a third works has become necessary.</p>

<p>In deciding on the best location there were various factors which had to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Firstly, as has already been said, inexpensive steel is of the utmost importance to the development of our country. Therefore the economic factors had to be taken into account very thoroughly.</p>

<p>At the same time it is clear that an iron and steel works of the extent envisaged will naturally form a powerful growth point which could bring major development to any area <span class="col_6133-6134" refersTo="page_0214"/>where it is established. It was therefore not possible to decide the matter on a purely economic basis only, it was also necessary to do justice to the wider social and developmental requirements within the framework of the Government’s policy. In particular, thorough consideration had to be given to the claims of the border areas in the country as well as of other lesser developed regions, particularly those where some of the essential minerals such as iron ore, manganese, coal, lime and dolomite are to be found.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the problem of transport and the availability of water, power and other basic services required for such an undertaking.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the requirements of the future had to be taken into account as well, not only as far as the expected pattern of steel consumption was concerned, but also as far as the possibility that we could enter the steel export market on a realistic scale was concerned. It is obvious therefore that the decision in regard to the location was preceded by a probing study. This study carried out by Iscor and the interested Government organizations stretched over a considerable period of time, and the fullest co-operation was received from local authorities who badly wanted the works to be established in their particular area. The object of course was to find the region or centre where the establishment would bring the greatest socio-economic benefits for the country as a whole.</p>

<p>Without mentioning the names of particular centres, I want to mention that as the study progressed it became clear that the Northern and North Western Cape, the Orange River Area, Northern and Central Natal, areas bordering on the Transkei and the Ciskei, and centres along the East and South coast of the Cape could lay the best claims. The advantages and disadvantages of each one of these regions were thoroughly investigated and weighed up against each other, and the advantages or disadvantages of each, in regard to costs as well as labour and transport problems, were analysed in detail. It was concluded that the consideration of the possible export of steel could not at present or in the near future be deemed to be of decisive importance since the works which was being planned was going to make most of its sales on the domestic market. At this stage the establishment at a coastal centre&#x2014;particularly along the East or South Coast of the Cape&#x2014;would also entail heavy expenses with the establishment of additional transport facilities together with the delivery of raw materials and the despatch of steel products. By about 1984 further works will probably have to be constructed, and the claims of the other areas mentioned above, will then be reconsidered.</p>

<p><i>The Northern Cape</i></p>

<p>To a somewhat lesser degree the consideration of additional transportation costs and labour problems also count against the Northern and North Western Cape. However, the Government has a great understanding and sympathy for the claims of this region, which is in addition richly endowed with some of the most essential raw materials. The Government is determined that this region will receive its fair share of the development which the new steel works will give rise to. This will take place by way of additional large scale production and the upgrading of raw materials in which a direct investment of R83 million will be involved, and which will offer employment&#x2014;only as far as Iscor expansion in the vicinity of Sishen and Postmasburg are concerned&#x2014;to an additional 1,100 Whites and 3,900 non-Whites. To this must of course be added the considerable secondary and tertiary employment which will in due course arise.</p>

<p><i>Newcastle</i></p>

<p>However, the iron and steel works itself will be established at Newcastle. Newcastle is not only favourably situated from a costs point of view but also offers various other advantages. It is a border area, and establishment here promotes the important objective of border area development. There is a sizeable established community which is of the utmost importance for the concentration of the large number of white employees which will be required. The necessary infrastructure is already well developed, which will make possible a major saving in capital investment. In addition there is already a nucleus in the shape of the cast iron plant which could possibly be incorporated with the Iscor works, that is, if Iscor’s offer for the take-over of Amcor is accepted. The cast iron plant at Newcastle is, to an important degree, dependent for its existence upon the export contract concluded with Japan, which terminates in five years’ time. As a result of, <i>inter alia,</i> technological developments in the manufacture of steel it cannot be accepted with certainty that this contract will be renewed. If the contract expires it could result in a serious setback for the entire established community of Newcastle, and the considerable capital investment in the works, with its existing infrastructure, could to a large degree remain unutilized. Both these problems can now be avoided. However, I want to make it quite clear that the Iscor project is by no means dependent upon the take-over of Amcor’s facilities. The project will go ahead whether or not the Amcor interests agree to the take-over by Iscor.</p>

<p>Iscor intends to make an immediate start on the construction of the new works so that the plant can go into production by 1972.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p><span class="col_6135-6136" refersTo="page_0215"/>We are dealing here with a problem, <i>viz.</i> mineral rights and servitudes which prevent the establishment of a township, to which I have been giving attention for a long time now. As you will probably recall, I broached this matter in public in October of last year on the occasion of the opening of the Congress of the Municipal Associations of the Transvaal at Warmbaths and made it clear that the Government could not allow the provision of housing to be thwarted in this respect. Since then the matter has been brought more specifically to my attention. What is, in fact, the problem here? I shall try to explain.</p>

<p>The owner of private land can sell the mineral rights he has on that land to another person and register the transaction by means of a cession of mineral rights. In addition, an owner of private land can abstract the mineral rights from the title deed in terms of which he owns the land for himself by means of a mineral rights certificate, and subsequently sell the land. In the &#x2026; Mr. Speaker, do those hon. members sitting conversing there have a special parliament?</p>

<p>In the case of alienated State-owned land, the mineral rights are reserved to the State, although the owner of the land enjoys certain privileges. Now, when the mineral rights are divorced from the ownership of the land, i.e. when the mineral rights and the land belong to two different owners, a clash of interests arises because the owners of the land cannot utilize that land as they see fit. They must consider the owners of the mineral rights.</p>

<p>This clash of interests has already caused interested parties many headaches. Various legal proceedings have already been instituted in regard to this matter. Perhaps I could just mention briefly the well-known Transvaal Property of Bryanston case of 1938. In that case it was the opinion of the fudge that the holders of the mineral rights were entitled to an interdict which would prevent the owners of the land from establishing the township of Bryanston because such establishment would deprive the owner of the mineral rights of all effective exercise of their mineral rights, notwithstanding the fact that the owner of the land indicated that the probability was extremely small of minerals being found there in profitable quantities. In that particular case the owner of the mineral rights and the owner of the land agreed to a settlement which enabled the latter to proceed with the development of Bryanston. Conflicting interests arise because the holder of the mineral rights wants to retain that right without restriction, while the surface area owner wants to utilize the land for the establishment of townships. This tendency has recently been assuming greater proportions. The various ordinances on township planning and township settlement provide that if the mineral rights are separated from the proprietary rights of the land and application is made for the establishment of a township on such land, the applicant must convince the townships board that the holder, usufructuary or lessee, etc., of the mineral rights, has given his consent to the establishment of a township. Consequently it is not possible to proceed with the establishment of any township before this consent has been obtained from the mineral rights holder. It would now appear as if the attitude of some mineral rights holders has become stricter when application is made for consent to the establishment of a township.</p>

<p>I should like to mention a few other examples to indicate to hon. members how a prospective township developer reaches a position of stalemate as a result of mineral rights. A number of owners of separate pieces of farm land near Pretoria very much wanted to sell their properties to interested township developers. The ground was zoned by the municipality for single dwellings. However, the owners of the land could not obtain the necessary consent from the mineral rights holder for the establishment of a township, and consequently no progress could be made with the establishment of a township. They were unable to develop the land in accordance with the zoning, or sell it to prospective township developers because the holders of the mineral rights withheld their consent to the establishment of a township. However, the owners of the land will have to pay taxes in accordance with the new zoning. In another case the amount claimed by the mineral rights holder for his consent to the establishment of a township was approximately five times more than the amount paid for the land.</p>

<p>In this way surface area owners are complaining that they are in some cases unable to make any progress in their negotiations with mineral rights holders, and that in other cases mineral rights holders are demanding unreasonable amounts before they are prepared to agree to the establishment of townships. Such large amounts must inevitably make township development very expensive. Apparently the mineral rights holders, for the most part, do not know precisely what minerals are present on the property. The excessively high demands for the mineral rights are often not in respect of the intrinsic value of such rights, but only for a negotiable right. I have learned that there are quite a number of applications for the establishment of townships which could not be finalized as a result of the demands made by mineral rights holders.</p>

<p>But apart from the land owner or prospective township developer who can make no progress, the local authority is also being prejudiced, for when a mineral rights holder withholds his consent, it is not possible to proceed with the development of agricultural smallholdings or other large pieces of land which, in the new zoning plan of the municipality are intended for residential purposes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>With the passing of this Soil Conservation Act we want to allege that it is not so much what the Act contains that is important; it should rather be measured against the tremendous scope of the task of efficient veld and water conservation in this country. To mention an example of the fantastic scope of the task with which the Minister’s Department is faced: the 400 million tons of soil which are lost annually could cover 100,000 morgen of land in South Africa each year to a depth of one foot. So it is for example, claimed that certain parts of the Karoo have in the past few decades lost 30 per cent of their vegetation. In other words, ever greater importance can be attached to the thought that the desert is creeping ever nearer. At the Soil Conservation Congress at Bloemfontein last year even the hon. the Minister of Agriculture had to admit that the annual soil and water losses were undoubtedly greater than 21 years ago. In other words, the extent of this task has become so great that in order to take efficient arrestive measures the following requirements would have to be imposed upon the hon. the Minister and his Department.</p>

<p>Firstly, he was repeatedly informed, and it was also stated by his extension officers, as well as by that Soil Conservation Conference last year, that unless an adequate number of officials who were not tied down by office duties and who would spend a minimum of time doing paper work, could be found, the passing of this Soil Conservation Act would mean absolutely nothing. Those people are still requirement number one. In spite of his committees and the Soil Conservation Advisory Council, which the Minister hopes to nominate after the passing of this Act, if he does not have the officials to do the job outside, this Act will not achieve any success at all. A second requirement which must be laid down is that there should be no time wasted in tackling this task. An enthusiastic farmer’s zeal may not be artificially interferred with in that he cannot obtain the necessary information or co-operation from the Department. Steps are, in fact, being contemplated in this legislation to expedite the payment of subsidies, and we on this side of the House welcome this, but in some places soil erosion has reached such an advanced state that the individual farmer would not be able to execute that task on his own. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister that, in cases where the farmer as an individual cannot carry that task alone, the Minister should ensure greater participation by the State, since the Minister now has that power in terms of certain clauses. In other words, the task of constructing soil conservation works, which has thus far been done by the State itself, whether by departmental machinery or by means of contracts, in those parts where soil erosion has become so serious that the individual farmer cannot do so, will have to be extended in this respect and the State will have to do more.</p>

<p>Another important requirement for success in soil conservation in South Africa is undoubtedly that more attention be given to our extensive grazing areas, which a;re also usually very much more subject to exceptional climatic conditions such as violent thunder storms. Those areas will undoubtedly have to enjoy greater attention than has been the case up to now. We do not say this because the intensive areas are less important, but if one reads the reports it appears as if the problem in the intensive areas is reasonably under control. The intensive areas are also the smallest of the arable areas in South Africa. We know that the intensive areas are those with high agricultural potential and that they do not cover more than 4 per cent of the total agricultural surface area. Therefore it becomes far easier to check soil erosion in those areas. We therefore say that, owing to the importance of the extensive grazing areas, it is there that more attention should be focussed in the future, after the passing of this Act.</p>

<p>In addition, it must also be borne in mind that our land is constantly being set aside for purposes other than agriculture. In other words, what remains must be protected as much as possible, and this will be the extensive areas. But another important requirement for the success of this Act is the improvement of the economic position of the farmer himself. A well-to-do farmer usually does not have any problems, but those who have been financially handicapped by lengthy droughts will have to be treated most sympathetically under these circumstances. Incidentally, Mr. Speaker, it is my considered opinion that the decline of soil conservation is closely related to the continual financial decline of so many of our farmers, and this matter will also have to receive greater attention if the hon. the Minister wants to make a success of this legislation. If the matter receives attention he will find the progress to be so much more dramatic. At the conference which was held in Bloemfontein <span class="col_6139-6140" refersTo="page_0217"/>last year one of his officials had to point out that during prosperous times when prices were good, many farmers could do more to construct the necessary camps, lay on the necessary water and build the necessary soil conservation works. If the economic position of the farmer does not receive attention then soil conservation will not succeed either because the two are closely related.</p>

<p>Apart from the requirements which we have imposed, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that we on this side regret the fact that the Soil Conservation Committees are going to lose some of their functions and that they are to be merely advisory in nature. I want the hon. the Minister to have a good look at clause 10 where, in paragraph (a), it is provided that they shall be advisory in nature, and where, in paragraph (b), it is provided that additional duties may be imposed upon them by the Minister. I want to say to him that he should not use the provisions of paragraph (b) in order to decrease the functions of the Soil Conservation Committees, but rather to let them play a greater role in connection with soil conservation. Sir, the fact that they will be absolutely advisory in nature does not meet with the approval of those of us on this side at all. The Minister will find that he will have to extend their functions rather than decrease them. Therefore, after the passing of this legislation, the training of the Soil Conservation Committees will have to be priority number one. They will have to fill the gap which is caused by the shortage of trained technicians. It is regrettable that these people will be appointed by the hon. the Minister, and not elected by the respective agricultural associations. He will, in fact, appoint them after consultation with the S.A. Agricultural Union, but we on this side of the House regret that they will not, in the first place, be elected by those farmers which they will have to serve in the soil conservation areas concerned. The step which the hon. the Minister is contemplating with this legislation will delay rather than promote soil conservation, and I think that, within the framework of clause 9, the hon. the Minister will have to find a way of preferably having those people elected by the farmers concerned.</p>

<p>Sir, this legislation is once more a milestone after 23 years of a United Party Act which we have had on the Statute Book. For 23 years we have repeatedly urged the Government to take steps to promote soil conservation in South Africa. Repeatedly excuses, loopholes and scapegoats have been sought. Now the hon. the Minister has drawn up legislation which meets with his requirements. He is now prepared to accept the responsibility for that. If the hon. the Minister is prepared to accept the responsibility for that, we can only wish him success under these circumstances. We on this side of the House believe that every South African ought to be deeply concerned about this problem of soil erosion; not merely the agriculturist, but also the urbanite ought to be aware of the problem with which South Africa is faced. I think that if the hon. the Minister is prepared to inspire that enthusiasm, to impart that impetus to his Department, to appoint the officials he needs, and to train the Soil Conservation Committees as they should be trained, we shall perhaps be able to look back after a few years and say that this legislation was a success. It depends upon the Minister whether a success will be made of it, because it is in his hands and in no-one else’s.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, throughout the debates on this Bill, we on this side of the House have approached the Bill in the spirit of what somebody has called the eleventh commandment. This reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Thou shalt inherit the earth as a faithful steward conserving its resources and productivity from generation to generation. Thou shalt safeguard thy fields from soil erosion, thy living waters from drying up, thy forests from desolation and protect thy hills from over-grazing by the herds, that thy descendants may have abundance forever. If any shall fail in the stewardship of the land, thy fruitful fields shall become sterile stony ground or wasting gullies and thy descendants shall decrease and live in poverty or perish from the face of the earth.</block>

<p>Over the last 23 years many people have failed, sometimes through ignorance, sometimes through no other fault than their own, and sometimes perhaps through economic pressure. We have supported this Bill, because we are conscious, among other things, of the damage that this failure is doing to our soil and to our people. I want to quote again the figures which have often been quoted and these are the figures given by Dr. J. C. Ross. He pointed out that in 1946, the year when the original Soil Conservation Act was passed, we were losing top soil in our country at the rate of 300 million tons per year. He pointed out that in 1966 we were losing top soil at the rate of 400 million tons per year.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>From Dr. Ross. He said at that stage, 1946, the cost of restoration was some R200 million, whereas it had risen to R600 million in 1966. It is clear that we are not making the progress we should in our fight against soil erosion. Because we regard success in this fight as absolutely vital, we have supported this Bill, and we have been prepared to give the Minister the wide powers he has asked for. The result of this legislation will be that the Minister has taken everything into his own hands and he must realize the effects of this. The ball is now firmly in the Minister’s court. The hon. Minister has shorn the soil conservation committees of all their <span class="col_6141-6142" refersTo="page_0218"/>powers except to act in an advisory capacity. This has been done, he says because, <i>inter alia,</i> some committees were unwilling to prosecute their fellow farmers who refused to farm according to soil conservation principles. One of the other reasons is that some of the members were elected because of their popularity only. Now, the hon. the Minister is going to appoint these people and if the wrong people are appointed, they are going to be connected in the minds of the farmers with the Minister. Therefore, it is the Minister who is going to get the blame from the farmers themselves. If the hon. the Minister’s extension officers draw up unwise, unrealistic and impracticable farm plans, the Minister and his department are going to fall into disfavour. If the inspectorate fails to prosecute the recalcitrant minority, and they are a very small minority, it is going to be the Minister and his department who will be accused of weakness. During the Committee Stage, we on this side of the House tried to make the hon. the Minister’s task easier. For example we moved an amendment to ensure that at least the majority of the soil conservation committee members should be elected democratically and should be answerable to their fellow-farmers. Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister turned down our amendment. If he wants the sole responsibility, he must be prepared to shoulder that responsibility. From now on he is going to be on trial and will have to be on his mettle if he wants to succeed in the fight against soil erosion. If he does not succeed, he must not turn round in future and blame the committees or anyone else for his failure. As the hon. member for Newton Park has said, there will be two requirements which are absolutely essential if the implementation of this legislation is to be turned into a success. Firstly, the hon. the Minister will have to have at his disposal adequate numbers of properly trained field staff, backed up by an inspectorate. Secondly, the economic position of the farmer must be sound.</p>

<p>The key man in this whole set-up is going to be the local extension officer. If those local extension officers are not properly trained and, moreover, not blessed with a great deal of wisdom and an even greater deal of patience necessary to equip them to handle the farmers with whom they have to co-operate to ensure conservation progress, this new set-up is going to fail and this Bill will be a dead letter. As the hon. member for Nelspruit said during the Second Reading debate, &#x201C;Dit help nie net om wette op die Wetboek te plaas en geld beskikbaar te stel nie&#x201D;. The hon. the Deputy Minister himself realizes the importance of the extension officers. When he was a new member in this House, he said on 5th October, 1966 (Hansard, column 3673):</p>

<block name="quote">In the constituency of Heidelberg and in part of the constituency of Standerton 2,912 farms were proclaimed soil conservation districts. They cover 960,000 morgen, and yet there is only one extension officer. The fact of the matter is surely that a soil conservation committee simply cannot function well without the guidance of a technically trained officer. I know the hon. the Minister has no magic wand to put everything right in the twinkling of an eye, but we regard it as our duty to bring this matter to his attention.</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister is taking away from the committees the power to plan together with the farmer. This now is being left to the farmer himself, who will have to be advised by his extension officer. It is throwing more responsibility than ever before on the shoulders of the extension officers. There would perhaps be small cause for alarm if there were any evidence that the hon. the Minister was coping with the problem of ensuring that we have more extension officers. But all the evidence available shows that this is not the case. He is not coping with this problem. In 1960, when the original 1946 Act was amended, the then Minister, the present hon. member for Oudtshoorn, said (Hansard, column 4230) that we had some 225 extension officers and 285 technical field officers to assist the extension officers. On 4th June, last year, in answer to a question from the hon. member for East London (North), the hon. the Minister said that we had 235 extension officers and 168 technical officers, with 67 vacancies for extension officers and 29 for technical officers. In other words, over those eight years all we have gained, is 10 extension officers and we appear to have lost something like 117 technical field officers. That hardly is a case of progressing at the desired rate. If the Minister does not succeed in solving this problem and providing enough extension officers, the farmers will be entitled to say to him, in the words of the hon. member for Vryburg in the Second Reading debate of this Bill, &#x201C;Hulle het die volste reg om ons aan te val as ons nie voorsiening maak om die tekort aan amptenare uit te wis nie&#x201D;. It will not help the Minister, nor the farmers, nor the cause of soil conservation, if the Minister does not solve the problem, but merely shrugs his shoulders and blames commerce and industry for pinching his officials and attracting them away by offering them higher salaries.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the second prerequisite for the success of this Bill is that the economic position of the farmer must be sound. He must be able to afford to look after his veld and his arable land. In the sheep farming areas, particularly the extensive areas of our country, to which the hon. member for Newton Park referred, at no time was greater progress made in soil conservation than during the days of the wool boom. Because during those days it was not only in respect of the construction of concrete or earth anti-erosion works but also in respect of the provision of fencing, in the provision of watering points and in the reduction in stock numbers that progress was made. In <span class="col_6143-6144" refersTo="page_0219"/>those days farmers could still afford to reduce their stock because they knew they had an assured income. But, Mr. Speaker, what is the position in some of those self-same areas today? The Director of Extension and Education, Mr. C. C. Claassens, in opening the congress of the North-West Agricultural Union at Calvinia, said that good progress was being made in farm planning. He quoted the Calvinia district as an example and said that there 50 per cent of farms had already been planned while 30 per cent of those plans were completed. Despite that fact, however, 30 per cent of the farms in the district remained overstocked, 45 per cent of the farms in the Fraserburg district and 63 per cent in the Carnarvon district. Why do these farmers overstock their farms like this? It is not just because of sheer greed on their part, but because they have had these years of drought coupled with the continuing decline in wool prices and the continual rise in production costs year after year after year. This is the reason. So they are forced to overstock their farms in order to keep their turnover up so that they will be in a position to pay the interest on their bonds, to pay their debts to the co-operatives and to other traders and to keep their bank managers in a reasonable frame of mind. Some years ago the producers’ price of dairy products was reduced. The immediate reaction of many dairy farmers was to keep more dairy cows in order that they could keep up their turnover. Last year when pineapple prices in my area were reduced following upon devaluation the sales of a fertilizer firm fell by R24,000 over 12 months&#x2014;proof of the fact that the people just could not afford to maintain the productivity of their arable soil if that involved them in expense. The Minister could get this House to pass legislation and he could go out to the farmers and lecture them, exhort them, and even put pressure on them until he is blue in the face. He will not make a success of this legislation unless he, in the first place, produces the field personnel to assist him and the farmers in the implementation of this legislation and, in the second place, ensures that the Government pursues a policy in respect of agriculture which is going to ensure a reasonable living for the farmer.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House make no excuses for returning time and again to this subject because, in our opinion, this is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever to come before this House. Because this is so we have decided to support any legislation which could improve the situation as it has been up to the present. We came forward from our side with amendments aimed at improving this legislation, but thusfar the hon. the Minister has not been prepared to accept any amendments. We still hope that he will find it possible in the Other Place to move amendments for the further improvement of this legislation.</p>

<p>While saying that this is the most important piece of legislation which has ever come before this House, it is not necessary for me to cover the whole field in detail and to quote statistics to indicate our present position after 23 years in which we have been reclaiming our soil and vegetation, i.e. a very much weaker position than at the beginning. Only about one eighth of the work has thusfar been done. This reveals an incredible backlog. Therefore any reasonable person must support anything which can improve this situation. We have repeatedly asked the hon. the Minister what he envisages in this legislation when he says that it is going to correct the position. If we can make the legislation more powerful, if we can take a short cut in order to encourage people to continue with soil conservation and if we can make it possible for the farmer to see a greater measure of good in this, we want to help in any way we can to reclaim the fertility of our soil, because, after all, we all depend on that.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister does not live in these parts which have, in recent years, been struck so severely by drought. Perhaps he knows the Northern Transvaal well, but he does not know what has happened from one end of this extensive Cape Province to the other. The Minister does not know how much erosion there has been from the Karoo regions on the one side to the mountainous regions on the eastern side. The situation has reached a point where, if we do not get a few consecutive seasons, the farmers will find themselves in a difficult position.</p>

<p>What do you suggest?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That question apparently comes from someone who was not in this House and therefore does not know what amendments we on this side have moved. Let me briefly refer to a few of the problems we envisage, since we are now being asked about what we suggest. In the first place we asked the Minister to draw the farming population closer to him as far as consultation and the implementation of this legislation was concerned. The hon. the Deputy Minister did not see his way clear to do so. In the legislation it is stated that the Minister &#x201C;may&#x201D; consult, &#x201C;may&#x201D; create an advisory body and &#x201C;may&#x201D; establish district committees. However, nowhere is it provided that he must do so. But let us suppose that he will do so. I now want to mention a few of the problems with which he will be faced. Let us assume that he will consult with the S.A.A.U. in connection with the general framework, and also in connection with the establishment of district committees. The Minister is aware, as we are, of the long deviation he is traversing when he says that he will consult the S.A.A.U. in connection with the establishment of a district advisory committee, a committee which will be stripped of all powers, a committee for a certain area which can even extend over two districts. Does <span class="col_6145-6146" refersTo="page_0220"/>the Minister realize what problems he will have when he has to hold consultations about the people who have to fill the posts there? Will a district committee inspire the same confidence in the farmers if the Minister appoints its members, and he does not say that he will do so after consultation with the farmers’ association or district association concerned, or something of that nature? This cannot, of course, be done. A committee, all the members of which have been appointed by the Minister, without consultation with the farmers’ associations concerned, will surely not inspire the farmers with the same confidence? Must we not win the farmer’s confidence so that he can continue with the work and do his best in terms of this legislation? Must we not do everything in our power to give him greater confidence in this legislation? I claim that he is going to have less confidence in this legislation.</p>

<p>In the previous debate about this measure we pointed to the problems which the Minister would experience with the powers and directions which are being granted to him in this legislation. We are, of course, grateful that someone must issue the directions. But if this is not done after consultation with the bodies concerned, we can surely see what problems will crop up, i.e. a direction is issued to a person or a body not able to carry out the work, or directions are issued to people who are not able to pay for the work. I am sure that the Minister does not envisage this problem. One must not blind oneself to an Act, which one thinks is good, to such an extent that one cannot perceive the faults. The hon. the Minister said that it was not humanly possible simply to draw up an Act whereby this major problem could be dealt with in full, and that this Act would still be amended a great deal. But do we recall how many times it has already been amended? We assume that in the future there will be additional amendments.</p>

<p>At this stage I cannot envisage any legislation which would be comprehensive enough to solve the entire problem at one stroke. Since we are now dealing with a new Bill which is to take the place of all previous legislation in this connection, it would surely have been fitting for the hon. the Minister to concede to some of the suggestions which we made in connection with the problems which we have repeatedly raised, in order to improve the functioning of this legislation from the beginning, because nothing can be more damning to such new legislation than that it Should not function for the space of the first two or three years. What must we say about a Department, about a Minister and about a House which institutes legislation which is not decisive enough, which is not better than the previous legislation and which has less support from the people which must implement it? After all, surely no one but the land owners are going to implement this legislation. They must make it function. If they do not have more confidence in this legislation, or at least as much as in the previous legislation, what makes us think that it will be such a success? We want to support this legislation. We want to support any improved legislation, and we must support this legislation in its present form because it is replacing all previous legislation in this connection. However, I venture to predict that next year and also in the following year the hon. the Deputy Minister, if he is still Deputy Minister or Minister, will simply have to introduce additional amendments again, many of which will be similar to those which we have repeatedly recommended to him during the past two days. We are now dealing with the final stage of this Bill. However, it is not yet too late to recommend to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he introduce, in the Other Place, some of the amendments which we have moved. He may do so in his own words and when it is referred back to this House we shall have a look at what he has done in connection with these shortcomings in the Bill. We are convinced, and the hon. the Deputy Minister is as convinced, that there are, in fact, shortcomings in this Bill which must be supplemented.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<p>Mr. Speaker, I can give the hon. member for East London (City) the assurance that we were very sympathetically disposed towards the amendment moved by the hon. member for Walmer. We do not want to create the impression that we are not open to conviction or that we pay no heed to the Opposition’s suggestions. In principle we have already approved to recommend in the Other Place his ideas of a form of arbitration to which a farmer can have recourse.</p>

<p>Then I just want to tell the hon. member for Newton Park that I disagree with him on very few of the matters which he mentioned to-day. I agree with him. He was speaking the truth when he said that there were not enough officials. The hon. member for Albany quoted a speech I made in 1966. I still say to-day that our problem is that there are not enough officials. But can we obtain enough extension officers in this country simply by waving a magic wand? We have said before what our problem is. Fortunately, a salary increase has been announced now. We, on our part, are trying to offer these people housing benefits. I cannot now mention all the things we are trying to do for these people, but I must agree that this work would progress more rapidly if we had enough extension officers. But has that hon. member ever told his child to become an extension officer?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I myself am a guilty party, We only look at big money today. But it does not help to talk about this matter. I feel that we are all aware of the fact that this is our problem.</p>

<p><span class="col_6147-6148" refersTo="page_0221"/>Then the hon. member said that we should not waste time unnecessarily. Our whole object, as I said in my Second-Reading speech and in the Committee Stage, is to streamline the system. We have had this Act for 23 years. Now the hon. members for Albany and Newton Park say that this country is losing so many millions of tons of soil a year, but this is a figure that I do not simply want to accept; I do not think this figure is quite correct. I am not saying that it is wrong, but all the same it does appear to me to be too enormous. It is something to be perturbed about, but we want to put a stop to these things. Now, after 23 years, we have this Act, but the hon. member for Albany says we have made no progress. My feeling is this: Introduce any Act; you cannot go wrong as long as you try to do things in another way. As the hon. member said, the present Act did not work. Give us a chance with this one now. The hon. member told us to bear in mind that he would return and tell the Minister of Agriculture: You have had all these powers and you have failed. But our approach is not to level reproaches if things do not pan out as they should. Do not expect miracles now; give this Act a chance. The hon. member for East London (City) said that we would come along with amendments year after year, but let us do so. If the system works in practice and you see that there are hitches, surely you can change it; surely this does not matter. I have told you that this is not the last word to be spoken on soil conservation; we shall still have to make many adjustments in the course of time. The hon. member for Newton Park said that he felt that the farmer should be financially able to do the work. I agree. The hon. member for Albany said that when wool prices were high the farmers had enough money. That is true. At present not all the farmers have sufficient means to apply conservation as they would like to do. Land prices and production costs have increased, and wool prices are lower than in 1964. All these things are true, and our farmers are basically soil conservation conscious; they would like to carry it out. In my Second-Reading speech I indicated what the State was spending and what we were prepared to do. Someone blamed me for saying: &#x201C;Let it cost R1 million more&#x2014;so what?&#x201D; I repeat that we must try to save the soil. Read this week’s <i>Huisgenoot</i> and see what will happen to that wonderful Orange River Dam if we do not take positive action. If we do nothing that dam may silt up within 50 years. So I still agree with the hon. members.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) asked why the members could not be elected democratically. We elected those people democratically for 23 years. He said that we should take a short cut. We convened meetings and sometimes not one single farmer turned up. [Interjections.] We made arrangements with the S.A. Agricultural Union as to how we could speed matters up in order to obtain the names from them very quickly, but now I want hon. members to understand why we do not hold elections; and this does not apply to all cases. It applies to areas where there is a lack of interest. Some dear old fellow has reached 70 years of age and no one wants to hurt his feelings by telling him he can no longer serve on the committee. I myself was present at a meeting where they said: &#x201C;Let us elect the old lot,&#x201D; but the old lot had done nothing. Now the Minister can appoint a practical man who is prepared to apply soil conservation.</p>

<p>I think we have discussed this Bill very thoroughly. To most of the questions asked we furnished replies at the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage. I do want to tell the United Party that most of the matters they mentioned here are real problems. I also want to say that I am glad that they have not made a political issue of this matter.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>As we stated at the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage, we are not going to oppose this Bill at the Third Reading. Basically we believe this to be a good Bill, but there is one thing that the House should realize and that is that there is a difference between a good Bill competently administered and a good Bill administered inefficiently. That is where the test will come for the hon. the Minister, because he is the person who will have to carry out the provisions of this Bill. Within about four and a half months’ time he is going to be faced by the problem of 1,700.000 listeners’ licences which will have to be renewed within the short period of a fortnight or three weeks. Some of these listeners’ licences will have to be renewed at post offices, some with local authorities, some with the S.A.B.C. and others with different Departments. In other words, there is a big task facing the Minister within the next couple of months, and it will need all his competence to be able to carry out that task.</p>

<p>With this Bill he is faced with two problems regarding the collection of licence fees; one is an important one which only arose on account <span class="col_6149-6150" refersTo="page_0222"/>of a remark made as an aside during the Committee Stage, and that is that apparently there is going to be no central register of licences under this Bill. The fact that there is going to be no central register is going to make the difficulties of the hon. the Minister immeasurably greater. First of all, it will make it impossible for him to send out notices beforehand to all licensees, and secondly, there will be no possibility of a central Check. These are problems which arise from this Bill but we still say that basically the idea is a good one, and we accept the principle that there should be a single licence year.</p>

<p>The Minister will be faced with this other problem that the only way in which he will be able to check in future whether people have listeners’ licences will be by means of inspectors, and I can see that he will have to increase very considerably the number of inspectors that he has in his Department. In the past these inspectors have carried out their duties without causing undue difficulties and trouble, and the Bill itself correctly provides that they shall only enter persons’ homes to check whether they have their radio licences at suitable times of the day. I can, however, forsee with an increase in inspections difficulties arising on occasion.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also has the power now&#x2014;he and the S.A.B.C. together, sometimes only the S.A.B.C. and in other cases he alone &#x2014;to introduce institutional licences and to say which licences shall be free. That, I believe, is a good provision, but again we want to see how the Minister is going to carry that out. He may decide to give very few licences of a free or institutional nature or he may decide to be generous to the old people and to all those thousands of people who are expecting an important announcement from him within the next couple of months. I trust that he will be generous to those people who deserve these free licences.</p>

<p>There is another improvement in this Bill, as passed at the Second Reading, in regard to the duties of radio dealers. Half a million forms a year which have been piling up over the past years will now either have to be thrown away of filed away in those dark recesses of Government buildings in Pretoria where dead files are kept. That is a good thing; that is what is going to happen under this Bill. These forms which have had to be submitted in triplicate in the past will no longer have to be submitted, but there are other problems which have not been solved. Again I believe that the hon. the Minister can now with the powers he is receiving under this Bill, solve these problems. He can very easily solve the problem, for example, of the son of a household who boards 1,000 miles away and wants to have his radio repaired. As it is now he cannot do so, because the licence covering that radio is with his father at his home. It will be very simple to have some or other form of licence with a coupon or a perforated part which can be handed to that particular person. I think this is a matter the hon. the Minister can consider and on which he can give the country more information on his plans.</p>

<p>Another point I want to raise is the power the hon. the Minister should have to include the radio set of a servant of a household in the employer’s licence. Why cannot it be made possible that such a servant may be given a simple form by the owner of the household to say that the radio in his or her possession is covered while he or she is in the employ of this person, by that person’s household radio licence and stating the number and the address? These things can be done, but whether these things will be done will be the test of how this Bill is going to work.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that in dealing with radio listeners’ licences this Bill is quite a radical one. It can be a good Bill in practice and it can work well, but if the hon. the Minister does not do his duty, it can be a disaster. We support this Bill, but we do want to state clearly that we do not, under any circumstances, support in advance any unnecessary, half-baked, ill-conceived, costly, onerous, irritating or needless methods which may be involved with regulations or the means adopted by the hon. the Minister under this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we now come to the final stages of one of the very important measures which we have had before us this Session, namely amendments to the Water Act. The provisions which we have in this Bill before us have not only apparently been accepted by the Select Committee so that it virtually became an agreed measure, but that also appears to have been the position in so far as this House is concerned. The House in Committee also seems to have found no quarrel with the provisions of this Bill. That being so, I just want to mention one or two of the points regarding the Act will eventually appear when this Bill is finalized, because I do not anticipate that the hon. the Minister will have much difficulty when he pilots this measure through the Other Place.</p>

<p>One of the matters which arises here, and I want to deal with it at once, is the provision binding our municipalities in respect of clause 1. Initially there was some difficulty about this clause, because it limits the freedom of action of a municipality. In common with other legislation which we have before us, the success of the administration of the provisions of this Bill is going to depend upon an ample technical and professional staff. With another Bill which follows shortly on the Order Paper and which I cannot discuss now, it is clear that there is going to be an additional administrative burden laid upon the staff of the hon. the Minister’s Department. Although I do not anticipate that the hon. the Minister will want to say much by way of a speech presently, and indeed I think there will not be any great need for it, nevertheless I hope that the one point he will deal with now is going to be his expectation in regard to the additional professional and technical staff for the administration of the work which will be involved in this Bill and the other one yet to come. For the purpose of irrigation settlements and so forth there are two ways of dealing with the land. As provided by the existing Act, a certain section of land can be scheduled and permits granted.</p>

<p>In this Bill we have taken away a condition in the original Act, which placed a limit on the time available to the hon. the Minister to deal with certain areas which were proclaimed. From the point of view of issuing certificates, the Minister had to come to Parliament if such a period as had been provided for had elapsed and he had not finished the job. That was put in deliberately at the time by the Select Committee which dealt with the 1956 Act, so as to see that there was no undue lag in having these matters attended to by the Department. We did not want it to be felt that there was an undue lag and that the people concerned could not get their permits timeously. That provision has now been repealed by the Bill before us. This is a matter of the greatest importance. It has been repealed because of assurances we were given by the officials who appeared before us that within the limits of the manpower available they hope that they will be able to issue the permits and schedule the land timeously and that nobody would be unduly adversely affected because of any hold-up or delay in the Department. But one of the institutions which has to get permits even before the matter can go to the Water Court, is a municipality. In the light of recent developments I want to bring this very pertinently to the hon. the Minister’s attention. It is quite clear that because of a new growth point, perhaps not in the case of a municipality itself, but in the area, and it may be a vast area in relation to that particular municipality, there will undoubtedly be developments taking place which are going to call for basic water supplies. I want to say at once that I am concerned with the statement made by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs when he announced the location of the new Iscor at Newcastle. That will not only affect Newcastle alone, and what is going to be basic in this regard is that all towns in the area brought under the influence of that Iscor, are going to demand water. They are all going to need water. A precise point which up to then had only been a debating point, has suddenly become something which is practicable. The municipalities concerned are in the position that I think they have to give six months’ notice before they can go ahead with their own plans to increase their water supplies if they are taking less than 1 million gallons per day and certain other provisions have to be complied with for a supply of more than 1 million gallons per day before they can go to the Water Court. This is going to throw an immense burden on the shoulders of the hon. the Minister’s staff. This is a point I want to make clear immediately.</p>

<p>Secondly there is this question of a dam basin which again has had the spotlight turned on it because of this very development. Some four years ago in this House it was laid down what we considered then were the first three primary principles in regard to our water policy in South Africa. The then Minister of Water Affairs accepted those principles. He said that he thought that they were good comm-on sense without going so far as to say that he accepted them categorically, but he did by implication agree that they were very sound principles and I never heard any other principles raised in opposition to these principles. I just briefly want to refer to these principles. Firstly, they were that we should develop and secure a supply to our existing communities. The existing communities, whether they are <span class="col_6153-6154" refersTo="page_0224"/>rural or urban, are entitled to a secured water supply before other people hereafter who are not yet in existence. We know nothing about future communities and where they will be established, but the people who are there are entitled to secure water supplies.</p>

<p>Secondly, we want to see our South African supplies developed before we engage on vast expensive foreign ventures for water supplies. Thirdly, we should like to see a grid system on the high berg and high mountains. This grid system is now being accepted by very highly placed hydrologists and others. The high bergs generally are those areas where snowfalls normally occur. There water supplies can be contained and diverted to the various parts of the country when necessity demands that the supply should be made available: perhaps a very imperatively required supply which can be supplied at short notice. Those were the three principles. When we see the developments which are taking place, we come to the question of the dam basin. In this Bill we have before us, we on this side of the House affirm our support for every one of these provisions of this Bill, not only the principles, but also the provisions of the Bill. We support the provisions wholeheartedly, but we see some dangers as regards administration.</p>

<p>Where it comes to the question of the dam basins, we are wondering whether it would not perhaps be a good idea for the Minister, seeing that he has a Select Committee which deals year after year with the question of dams and the construction of dams and so forth, and seeing that it is part of our Parliamentary procedure, to consider whether they should not be given the opportunity to have a look at the priorities being provided for with the construction of dams and the setting aside and the proclamation of dam basins. The basins which are set aside for dams, as has been explained by the hon. the Minister during his Second Reading speech, provide for the construction of dams hereafter when the money and the resources are available. This is done, because these enormous conservation works, with the size of dams which we are building and have still to build to store our water, cannot be built after five or six months of investigation. The work cannot be done in a year or two. The building of these dams are taking years and the bigger the project the more care has to be exercised in the initial stages. But that land is now going to be held up for a long time to come, because as this Bill before us rightly provides when once a dam basin has been proclaimed, development works of all kinds, except normal farming procedures, are virtually barred from the whole of that area. From 10 to 15 years will go by and land will be increasing in value enormously. We only have to look at what is happening at the moment, to realize how land can increase in value. The pressure which will be exerted on the department where they have a proclaimed dam basin, if the land is there and if it is being used for nothing but agricultural purposes, to have it released so that it can be used for some other purpose is going to be enormous. I hope the Minister will not give way. I hope the Minister is going to stick to it and make it abundantly clear that a dam basin, once it is proclaimed, is going to stay there even if there are still 10 or 15 or 20 years to come. Whenever the time is ripe and when it is a matter of priority that a dam has to be built, when the time arrives, we should find that the dam basin is freely available, without involving the public purse in paying, too great a sum for compensation. Therefore, we support this Third Reading.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, raised two points. The one relates to concern he feels in his mind in regard to the problems which may crop up for the Administration in regard to the increased restrictions on the scope of municipalities within the entire water context. I do not think the hon. member need feel concerned. The hon. member drew the comparison between this kind of permit issuing by municipalities and the issuing of permits in agriculture, but that is something of a completely different order. It is a fact that as far as agriculture is concerned, it was necessary for us to come forward and ask that patience be exercised because we were making a special attempt to get the permits issued within a specified period of time. But the scope of the work involved in making such a permit available along a river course is simply enormous. Comparatively speaking, the number of permits is also enormous. I want to tell the hon. member that as far as the department is concerned we are able to keep up with services to municipalities. I think that the other kind of problem which could crop up, such as the administrative problems we may encounter if we do not do what is proposed in the Bill, will probably be greater. I also think that we are quite capable, administratively, of issuing permits without keeping any municipality waiting unnecessarily and causing the feeling to arise that we are unable to meet the requirements.</p>

<p>In regard to the control which we exercise over dam basins, a very important provision in the Bill, the hon. member also expressed concern and also made a sensible remark. He said that where we acquire control over such basins we should not allow further development to take place there, in spite of our control. I can assure the hon. member that we would not have drawn up the Bill if it had not been our intention to be strict. He need not be concerned about that. It is in fact the case that we are now living in a time where it is becoming essential that we select certain dams or dam sites with a view to subsequent development, particularly because development is taking place at a rapid pace. The hon. member mentioned the example of what is happening at Newcastle now.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The hon. member also mentioned what he calls the &#x201C;grid system&#x201D;. All this means is that balancing dams are built at high points (that is, far above sea level), from which water is integrated with the requirements of a region. This is being done. I want to mention the example of Teewaterkloof, where water from the other side of the mountain is used in order to be integrated with the needs of farmers on both sides of the mountain. I also want to mention the example of Spioenkop, where we are also trying to integrate water from the Tugela on both sides. This will happen to an increasing extent in the case of Natal, where water will be stored at control points and then used by way of Government distribution systems in order to meet all the needs of the region. There are already many such examples. But I want to inform the hon. member that, with a view to the greater amount of planning in future, it will of course become more and more of a requirement. As regards our policy for the future, since we will be giving far more attention to planning and will try to draw up a blueprint for the entire country so that we can make our projections for years in advance, it will in fact be essential to declare various key points within such projections in advance, and exercise control there. This is the entire purport of this. I think the hon. member also agrees, and after all, this is his requirement, that what is most important is that we obtain control in advance over these points which are going to become control points in the future development. In the past this was not so much the case: that is why it became necessary to change the Act in this way. But I am pleased that the hon. member agrees. We do not really differ on this point. I agree with him entirely. I want to give him the assurance that we are well aware of both points he mentioned. We will try not to be caught offside, from the administrative point of view, in the implementation of this legislation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This, Sir, is the second of the Bills referred to a Select Committee this Session before the Second Reading. I think it can be truthfully said that they came back to the House as agreed measures.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am going to be brief in dealing with this matter, but I do want to deal with the point that has arisen since the deliberations of the Select Committee. I am sure that in the hon. the Minister I am going to have a sympathetic listener. During the course of the Second Reading speeches members on this side of the House made it clear that a great deal of our work was made easy for the Select Committee. The time we spent on our work there was shortened. The whole of the administrative side of the Select Committee’s work in dealing with witnesses was made easy and the path made smooth because of work done by members of the hon. the Minister’s staff. One of the Under Secretaries for Water Affairs, had seen witnesses. He had discussed matters with folk who were coming to give evidence before us, the people who had misunderstood perhaps the intention of the Bill as they read it, and so forth. He eased our lot very, very considerably and he made it very much easier for the people concerned. When I say &#x201C;concerned&#x201D;, I mean people who had a real concern. They had a real interest in the provisions of the Bill. He did this to the extent that many of them decided not even to come and give evidence before the Select Committee. But now the position arises that a great deal of that was verbal. It was done as between an official of the Department and people who intended to come and give evidence. It was given as evidence before the Select Committee, and much of it has been recorded. Hon. members will remember that I referred to the fact that a lot of the evidence given by our officials was recorded, so that it is on record as part of the evidence before the Select Committee.</p>

<p>I also gave a list of some 12 or 14 types of legal rights to water which were enjoyed by farmers below the outfall from the tunnel from the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam down to the Theebus Spruit, the Brak River and the Fish River. There were something like 12 or 14 types of legal rights, servitudes, scheduled land (under the Irrigation Act), permits issued, and all sorts of rights. The point has now since the Second Reading debate been raised with me as to where in the Bill, apart now from the provisions of the Bill, it is clear that the Minister is going to turn a sympathetic ear to people who have enjoyed those rights, if, in the exercise of his powers now in terms of this Bill, the farmers concerned feel that they are not perhaps altogether satisfied with the kind of treatment they are getting. I want to say at once, because this was the answer I gave to the gentleman who came to see me, that I have no doubt whatever that in the Bill the legal rights of all the people who are obtaining water at the present time, when it is available, are protected. I am absolutely convinced of that. That was the assurance I gave them. I told them that their rights, whatever they were whatever their form was, are protected and that, in due course, the rights will be rescheduled or they will get permits <span class="col_6157-6158" refersTo="page_0226"/>to correspond with the rights they have enjoyed in the past. There is a right of appeal to the Minister here. I said that, when we came to the Third Reading, I was going to put it to the Minister directly that he should turn a sympathetic ear to any of the people enjoying water rights at the present time, even if they are short of water from time to time, as they are&#x2014;they are very, very short indeed; we all know that&#x2014;if they appeal to the Minister, in terms of the right of approach to the Minister, to deal with the difficulties which may arise when once the water from the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam is turned through the tunnel and starts to flow. Only when that water starts to flow will the farmers down there be in a position to physically appreciate the precise circumstances which will then apply. They can conceive of it. They can try and get a concept in their minds as to what the position will be. But only when the water flows through that tunnel and it is actually there will they see for themselves precisely what is happening. So, Sir, I would just at this stage say that we are supporting this Bill entirely from this side of the House. We do ask the Minister, if appeals are made to him by the farmers there, please to turn a sympathetic ear to their requests when the time comes.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for South Coast that the people in the vicinity who are going to receive the benefit of the water from the Verwoerd Dam, need not be concerned about the way in which the Minister will handle it, or about the attitude that will be adopted by him and his Department. It is very difficult to interfere with people’s rights where we are issuing permits in State water control areas. It is just as drastic in a new area to exchange old existing rights for what we are going to give, although what we are going to give is much better than what they had. But we cannot do this kind of thing without the greatest measure of sympathy and co-operation on both sides. If this means anything to him, I want to tell the hon. member that the Department really goes out of its way to explain beforehand to people what is happening, how we have reached a certain conclusion, and what a man’s personal rights are, and then we still leave the door open to him to come to the department in specific cases and to thrash out the matter personally. If they still get no satisfaction, I am still available to negotiate with those persons in the last resort. The whole attitude is to act as sympathetically as possible and to be as ready as possible to receive the people and to explain to them what their water rights are, why those are their water rights and what the extent of those rights is, so that they know precisely where they stand, and to give them satisfaction in this way. I think the hon. member will also find that recently, in granting permits, we have had very good co-operation from the public and that there have in fact been no repercussions. I hope there will be no repercussions here.</p>

<heading>EXPROPRIATION OF MINERAL RIGHTS (TOWNSHIPS) BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned last Friday I had explained the problem we were saddled with, principally in the Transvaal but also in other parts of the country, where the ownership of land was divided between the surface area owners and the owner of the mineral rights. This problem has recently become all the more vexatious. The problem arises out of the fact that an owner of land, who has the surface area rights but not the mineral rights&#x2014;the mineral rights belonging to another person&#x2014;cannot develop his land in any way without the consent of the owner of the mineral rights. Now we find that the owner of surface area rights want to sell their land to township developers or local authorities or to the Department of Community Development, all for the purpose of developing townships for housing, but cannot do so without the consent of the holder of the mineral rights. We have found that many of the holders of the mineral rights&#x2014;and this problem is increasing&#x2014;want to sell their rights at fantastic prices when they realize that a township is going to be developed or is on the verge of being developed, even if it has been very clearly established that there is in reality little chance of exploiting minerals there. In other words, they do not want to sell it because there is a possibility that minerals will be developed there, but are in fact blackmailing the developers of townships, or even the local authorities or the Department of Community Development. That is why we have introduced this Bill to find a remedy against this, and I shall now elucidate this further.,</p>

<p>I think you would agree with me, Sir, that the conditions which I have sketched for you undoubtedly place obstacles in the way of township expansion, with the inevitable result that the provision of building sites and housing is delayed or is even deferred. A case has to be made out therefore as to whether the value of the minerals are such that the development of these is more important than the establishment of townships. Should it be found that the development is not more important, the obvious thing to do is to eliminate the mineral rights so that the establishment of the township can be proceeded, with since it would not in such a case be in the public interest to allow the mineral rights holder to cling to his rights.</p>

<p>Therefore the Bill before you provides that the Administrator of a Province can expropriate <span class="col_6159-6160" refersTo="page_0227"/>mineral rights in land required for the establishment or development of a township, on his own initiative or upon the request of a person who has an interest in the establishment or development of a town. But before the Administrator can proceed to such a step he is required firstly (a) to satisfy himself that the consent to the establishment of a township or the relinquishing of the rights cannot be obtained by way of negotiation for an equitable consideration; (b) to make sure that the land concerned will in fact be utilized for the establishment of a township; and (c) to notify the owner of the mineral rights that the possibility of expropriation exists and that he should furnish reasons specifying why the expropriation should not take place. The mineral rights holder is therefore being afforded every opportunity to negotiate in a reasonable way, and if the negotiation does not succeed, to submit further representations to the Administrator in which he can furnish further details of the minerals he wishes to exploit, the potential thereof and the value according to his determination.</p>

<p>The most important provision, however, is that contained in clause 2 (3), i.e. that the Administrator shall, after considering the representations submitted to him by the mineral rights holder, decide whether or not it is more important in the public interest to lay out a township on the land rather than to exploit the minerals. Only when he decides in favour of establishing a township can he proceed to expropriate if an agreement cannot be reached by negotiation.</p>

<p>I want to draw hon. member’s attention to the fact here that the Administrator can only take such a decision with the consent of the Minister of Mines and the Minister of Community Development. The requirement that the Administrator and the two Ministers should agree on this important aspect is the guarantee that a decision will be made in a responsible way.</p>

<p>The procedure that has to be followed with the expropriation of the mineral rights and the determination of the amount of the consideration which has to be paid is the same as that prescribed in the Expropriation Act, 1965, except when it is not possible, after expropriation, to agree on the consideration. In that case the Administrator determines the consideration. Here, too, I want to point out specifically that the Administrator determines the consideration in consultation with the two Ministers previously mentioned. The Department of Mines is properly equipped to place an equitable valuation on the mineral rights, and the consideration will of course be determined in accordance with that. Thus, there is no danger that the owner will not be compensated according to the true value for the rights which have been expropriated from him.</p>

<p>If the mineral rights are expropriated at the request of the owner of the land or a person who has an interest in the establishment of the township, obviously the rights must eventually be transferred to that person, but the Administrator can take precautionary measures to ensure that the new owner does not, in his turn, impede or restrict the development of the township. Upon transfer therefore the Administrator can lay down suitable conditions in consultation with the Minister of Mines and the Minister of Community Development.</p>

<p>The expropriation of mineral rights, if it should ever come to that, will only take place in order to promote the establishment and development of townships, which is in the public interest, and it will not be possible to make use of these measures for the purposes of speculating with the mineral rights.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, apart from mineral rights, it has also been the experience that essential development for residential purposes can be blocked by servitudes or conditions which grant certain privileges to adjoining owners. There is for example the right to bore for water anywhere on the property. Or, an adjoining owner has a right of way along a specific route across the property. It now happens that the holder of the servitude, or the owner in whose favour the condition was laid down, is not prepared to consider cancellation in order to allow the establishment of a township. In the case of a right of way it has been found that, although the servitude holder does not in any way make use of the right, and adequate, even better, alternative road access across the land is made available to him, he nevertheless demands an excessive amount for the cancellation of the servitude, an amount which will make the layout of the township quite uneconomic.</p>

<p>These servitudes or conditions impede the establishment of townships as much as the mineral rights. As you know, the Administrator has the authority in terms of the Removal of Restrictions Act, 1967 (Act No. 84 of 1967), to alter, suspend or to remove, in the interests of the development of the township, any restriction or obligation binding upon the owner of the land by virtue of a condition of servitude relating to the subdivision of the land, or the purpose for which the land may be used, etc. The Bill before you therefore makes provision for an amendment to the Removal of Restrictions Act, 1967, in order to expand the power of the Administrator so that he can also amend, suspend or remove, in accordance with the provisions of that Act, a registered condition of servitude which can prevent or prejudice the establishment or development of a town.</p>

<p>Hon. members are all aware of the fact that there is an increasing shortage of building sites in our cities and towns. They are also acquainted with the great demand for housing. The Government can therefore not allow holders of mineral rights or other servitude rights who withhold their consent to the establishment of town or who make unpayable demands, to cause new township expansion to miscarry or be delayed for an unspecified time. It is obvious that steps must be taken, <span class="col_6161-6162" refersTo="page_0228"/>and that is why the measures, as contained in this Bill are being submitted to the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>We appreciate the conflict to which the Minister has referred which arises where surface and mineral rights in respect of the same (property are in different hands. One also appreciates the fact that this existence of conflicting ownership rights can have a delaying effect on the development of townships and the provision of housing which it is so vitally necessary to accelerate in this country. There are, however, some problems which arise in connection with this legislation, problems which I trust the hon. the Minister will deal with in reply to this debate, and these are aspects which arise from the fact that this Bill really provides for expropriation where the two owners of surface mineral rights cannot come to an agreement. The hon. the Minister has referred to the situation in the Transvaal. I think he referred to a Bryanston case which was heard before the courts in 1938. One would have liked to have a more recent example to justify this legislation which is before us. The problem is perhaps peculiar to the Transvaal and to the Free State and is not so much of application in the Cape. Because of the Sir John Cradock Proclamation of 1813 in the Cape Province, the rights to gold, silver and precious stones at any rate are reserved to the State. I believe this difficulty does not exist in the major portions of the Cape nor in Natal. Sir, when one realizes that this proclamation was passed in 1813, one is tempted to refer to this as perhaps a very appropriate example of British conservatism as practised by the colonialists in the old days. I want to ask the Minister whether there are similar provisions in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State and whether there the surface and mineral rights are without any restrictions so far as the rights of the State are concerned. As I have said, the Minister has quoted an instance in 1938 and I do feel that we need a little more recent example as to where these problems have arisen.</p>

<p>So far as the Bill itself is concerned, there are certain matters in regard to which we would like to have an explanation from the Minister. Clause 3 deals with the method of assessing compensation. The Minister has said in his introductory speech that where the compensation cannot be settled by agreement between the parties affected, it is determined by the Administrator in consultation with the Minister of Mines and the Minister of Community Development. But I want to know why it is that the Minister has not allowed the right of arbitration to continue? The one clause that he has excluded from this Bill is the right of the disputing parties to go to arbitration, and it seems to me that where either the owner of the surface rights or the owner of the mineral rights is not satisfied with the determination of compensation by the Administrator, they should be allowed to proceed to arbitration to settle the final figure.</p>

<p>Then under clause 6 of this Bill the problem arises as to the control of the mineral rights when once they have been expropriated. The Minister has said that they will be expropriated. The Administrator is given a certain discretionary power as to what should happen to those mineral rights, but one wonders whether the position should not be stated a little more definitely in this particular clause of the Bill. If those mineral rights are retained by the State over the whole of the area which is to be developed as a township, the possibility of conflict still remains. If the rights are kept by the State over the whole of the property the possibility of conflict remains because we then still have one owner of surface rights developing a township and another, the State in this case, owning the mineral rights. The same thing happens in the Cape Province where this reservation is still applicable under the Sir John Cradock Proclamation of 1813. Sir, are these rights to be transferred from the State or from the Administrator? I concede that provision is made for it in the Bill. But if these rights are passed by the Administrator to the township owner and they remain rights which affect the whole of the township area, then the individual plot owner who buys a property is again in peril that these mineral rights may be developed by the township owner at some later stage to the detriment of his ownership. It seems to me that if this Bill is to be logical, then what must happen is that the mineral rights must pass piecemeal to the individual plot owners because in effect then they are completely dissipated and are of no value to any particular person because they are over a very small area. I hope the hon. the Minister gets the point that I am driving at, and that is whether the position should not be that the township owner must then take over at the figure that has been settled by way of compensation and whether the mineral rights should be included in the title deeds of the individual person who acquires a plot or a property within that township. One realizes, on the other hand, that these mineral rights may become valuable. Unknown mineral wealth may subsequently be discovered beneath the ground, and one appreciates what would then happen, as I believe happened in the City of Oklohoma where oil was discovered in the middle of the city and where oil rigs are pumping oil next to the main buildings in the city. They have still been able to develop the mineral wealth in spite of the development of the township. These are problems with which the Minister is faced in dealing with a matter of this sort where we are taking steps to compel persons with conflicting rights to settle their problems. Sir, I raise these points, not because we intend to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill, but there are certain aspects of this Bill which will have to be ironed out in the Committee Stage, and we would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would deal with these particular problems at this stage.</p>

<p>Turning to clause 7, one wonders whether the hon. the Minister’s Department have <span class="col_6163-6164" refersTo="page_0229"/>realized just what they are doing. We know, for instance, that in the Western Cape there is an outcry about the establishment of townships on agricultural land adjacent to some of the Western Cape towns. There has been a great outcry against the destruction of valuable wine farming areas, which are converted into townships. If clause 7 is applied and the conditions of title ignored when it concerns the development of a township, it will mean that no private owner can in perpetuity say that his farm shall be retained as a farm because the Administrator may at any stage, when he deems it necessary that a township be established, in conjunction with the Minister, say he is sorry. You may have that condition in your title deed preserving this for viticulture in the Western Cape but we are entitled, under clause 7, to override those conditions. I raise these matters not because, as I have said, we intend opposing the Second Reading. I raise them in the hope that the hon. the Minister will take cognizance of them. These are important aspects affecting property rights and we shall have to have a discussion in fairly considerable detail when we come to the Committee Stage of this Bill.</p>

<p>I was pleased to learn that the Opposition is not disputing the principles of this legislation. The hon. member for Green Point proved through his argument that he has studied and understood this legislation. During the course of his speech he pointed out a number of problems, but I do not intend dealing with those problems in detail. I do not want to bind the Minister. <i>Inter alia</i> the hon. member raised the question of arbitration and asked why provision had not been made for it in the Bill. But now one must ask oneself the question: Who is best able to form an opinion on the price&#x2014;a person appointed in accordance with the arbitration procedure, or the Administrator on the advice of the Ministers of Community Development and of Mines? Consequently there is in my opinion, no need for arbitration. The hon. member also expressed concern in regard to the eventual establishment of mineral rights and in regard to what the eventual owner is going to do with them. In this connection he referred to clause 6 (3). But, in my opinion, the legislation is very clear on this point. Clause 6 (3) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Administrator may transfer such mineral rights subject to such conditions as he, with the concurrence of the Minister of Community Development and the Minister of Mines, may deem necessary in order to ensure that the possession of the mineral rights by the transferee will not prevent or prejudice the establishment or development of the township.</block>

<p>All this deals with is establishment and development. What about owner’s rights?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>But what is involved here is in fact the establishment and development of townships which is at present being paralysed under the provisions of the present legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised other matters as well. To those, I think, the Minister will reply, or they are points which can be discussed further in the Committee Stage. For my part I just wanted to point out how extremely necessary it has become that legislation of this nature should be placed on our Statute Book. In this connection I want to refer specifically to the Transvaal, because I am better acquainted with it. A penetrating inquiry in the Deeds Office impressed upon me the fact that as far as at least 70 per cent, if not more, of the surface area of the Transvaal is concerned, the mineral rights are divorced from the surface area rights. The implication of this is that those owning the mineral rights have a complete monopoly on the development of townships and cities, particularly when we consider the Witwatersrand-Pretoria-Vereeniging-Vanderbijlpark complex. If we consider the mining activities which have now been in progress for three-quarters of a century then we realize that the mineral rights of the greatest parts of that area must be in the hands of people other than the people in whose hands the surface area rights are. That means that the land lies there and, while the mines are petering out, cannot be used for that purpose to which they are best suited. In this way an artificial shortage is being created of something for which there should really be a great abundance in our country in view of its vast expanses, i.e. building sites. I can imagine that the position in Natal should also be quite serious, as well as in certain areas of the Free State, where vast mineral wealth exists.</p>

<p>But under the legislation which is at present on the Statute Book, certain malpractices have taken place. In this way it has happened that speculators, or option hunters, did nothing else but determine, by means of a rather superficial study, where the possibility of township development existed and who the mineral rights owners were, and they then obtained those rights at reasonably low prices, or options in respect of those rights for a number of years upon the payment of a reasonably low rental. In this way the development of those areas is being prevented. This is something which is not in the public interest, and consequently this legislation is highly necessary. That is why I want to thank the Minister and his Department for having taken this matter in hand. It is no secret that in younger countries, such as Australia and Canada, mineral rights are, for the most part, vested in the various governments. This prevents those rights from being used in a way which is not in the public interest.</p>

<p>The final decision is, I concede, a difficult one, i.e. what is in the interests of a community or a country: The development of mineral wealth or the establishment of a <span class="col_6165-6166" refersTo="page_0230"/>township? This decision, I think, can with an easy conscience be left in the hands of the Minister responsible. The point of fundamental interest is that the value of the mineral rights can be calculated through prospecting and by means of a reasonably simple formula. I am convinced that even members on the opposite side of the House would be able to understand it. By means of prospecting the value of mineral rights can be calculated in hard cash. In this connection I want to refer hon. members to an article written by Mr. Papendorff under the title (translation) &#x201C;Valuation of Mineral Rights&#x201D; in <i>Volkshandel</i> of October, 1968, and subsequent issues. The value of mineral rights can be determined by means of prospecting. If prospecting reveals that minerals are present the value can be determined in accordance with a formula which is reasonably simple and which I do not want to deal with at this stage. Bodies which are capable of doing so can then judge what is in the public interest. In the circumstances objections to this legislation ought to fall away, except if one argues from the point of view of the mineral rights owners who have never determined the value of the mineral rights, but simply have a right which they then want to squander at absolutely improper prices, something which eventually must prejudice the house owner.</p>

<p>Recently we saw in the Press that the prices of building sites in some areas had increased by up to 250 per cent. From time to time that side of the House objects vehemently to the long period of time which supposedly elapses when application is made for township settlement, and that in an area which is not even a mining area, i.e. Pretoria. One of the reasons for that is the very fact that the mineral rights and the surface area rights are divorced. For months, and sometimes for years difficult negotiations have to be struggled through because the prices being charged for mineral rights are quite exorbitant, while no prospecting work was ever in fact done. The end result must be that owing to the loss of time, the concomitant loss of interest and, as the Minister indicated, the loss in taxation, the price of building sites must increase. Eventually, if an exorbitant price is charged for mineral rights, and has to be paid, the price of the building site which can be sold to the ordinary house owner must increase considerably. I therefore want to thank the hon. the Minister for this legislation. I want to trust that the problems which are now being experienced will now be eliminated or reduced in number by this legislation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Wonderboom for the strong support he gave me during the Second Reading of this Bill. It is very clear that he is well informed as far as this problem is concerned. He evidently knows a great deal about the matter. Therefore I shall be very pleased if he will be present in this House during the Committee Stage, which will evidently be the scene of the big dispute, so that he may assist me a little. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Green Point asked me to give him a more recent example than the example of Bryanston. Well, during my Second Reading speech, I gave him an example of a problem which we now have in Pretoria where we cannot subdivide the land. The land has already been zoned by the Pretoria municipality for single houses. We cannot subdivide it, because the mineral right owners do not want to part with their mineral rights. Then the Administrator of the Transvaal has several such cases where he cannot give permission to proceed with township development for the simple reason that the mineral right owners do not want to give way. I may add that the Administrator of the Transvaal was one of the people who very urgently asked us to proceed with this legislation, because at the present moment it is very difficult for him to proceed with township development.</p>

<p>The question of arbitration has also been raised. The hon. member who raised it may have a point. However, I think the point has been fully dealt with by the hon. member for Wonderboom. Firstly, arbitration is a very expensive process. Our difficulty with these townships is that these stands are becoming so expensive that it becomes very difficult indeed for the middle-income group or even the higher-income group to buy stands at a price which allows them to build a fairly decent house. Therefore, we do not want to increase the cost of these stands at all. I think the point made by the hon. member for Wonderboom is very legitimate. After all, whom can we appoint as arbitrators? Who is in a better position to judge the values of these stands than the Department of Mines, the Department of Community Development and the Administrator? They and especially the Department of Mines are really the only people who can tell the value of mineral rights. If we should have a court of arbitration, that would practically be the only evidence which could be out before the court of arbitration. Therefore, I do not think that we can have further arbitration. Nevertheless, I will keep my mind open and listen to the arguments on this point during the Committee Stage. However, as I have said, I think the hon. member for Wonderboom dealt sufficiently with this matter.</p>

<p>As regards what happens with these mineral rights once they have been transferred from their present owners, I can only say that, obviously, if he sells them they are transferred to the man who buys them from him. The question is: If these mineral rights are expropriated, to whom are they then transferred? The reply is that they then go to the Administrator who must then cede them to the township developer. The township developer will actually pay the price which is laid down by <span class="col_6167-6168" refersTo="page_0231"/>the Administrator in consultation with the Ministers of Mines and Community Development. But I think the point made by the hon. member is completely met by this condition in the Bill as it stands, namely that the Minister of Mines and the Minister of Community Development can lay down any conditions and attach them to the transfer of the mineral rights from the present owner to the future owner who will be the township developer. This will make it absolutely impossible for the township developer to speculate with the mineral rights. I think that even the most unlikely cases like the case of Oklahoma where they found oil or something like that in the township, can be covered by those two Ministers and can be met in that way. As I say, these conditions can be very wide. I think they will be able to cover the most unlikely case such as was mentioned by the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>The matter of the servitudes was also raised. The hon. member is worried about the present position where a man lays down a servitude that certain farm land must always be farm land. One of the sections of the Act which deals with this matter provides that the Act empowers the Administrator of the province to alter, suspend or remove certain restrictions and obligations in respect of the land, and it also repeals the Removal of Restrictions in Townships Act of 1946, and validates certain proclamations, etc. Section 2 of that Act gives the Administrator full power to remove any restrictions on any land if he wants it for certain purposes, namely for ecclesiastical purposes&#x2014;the hon. member will not know much about that&#x2014;for use for public purposes by the State or a local authority and also for the use or erection of any building by the State or local authority. In the Act is also given a large number of other conditions including the provision of a town planning scheme and a restrictive condition or servitude registered against the title deed of that land. That is already laid down. Therefore, we do not take any further powers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As the policy of separate development gains momentum it becomes necessary to adjust and to amend the Group Areas Act from time to time in order to make provision for changing circumstances. It has once again become necessary now, for various reasons, to reconsider certain provisions and to make certain accepted principles in respect of proclaimed group areas applicable in the controlled areas as well. In the present measure there is not one single consecutive principle because each of the amending clauses deals with a separate matter. Consequently you will, Sir, allow me to elucidate the clauses separately.</p>

<p>Clause 1 comprises a consequential amendment. Because the Minister, in accordance with the proposed amendment of section 19, with which I shall deal later, obtains powers which he must exercise, it must be provided in section 1 which Minister must exercise those powers, since some sections of the Act are administered by the Minister of Community Development and others, on the other hand, by the Minister of Planning.</p>

<p>Clause 2 deals with section 27 of the principal Act. Section 27 (3) of the principal Act makes provision for the compulsory realization of immovable property within a group area which is inherited by a disqualified person, if he does not succeed in obtaining a permit. The intention is now to make the same provision in the controlled area so that an executor can sell the property and wind up the estate if a disqualified beneficiary does not succeed in obtaining a permit for the acquisition of such a property. A case which gave rise to the need for such a provision recently occurred for the first time.</p>

<p>Clause 3 deals with section 19, which I have just mentioned. Section 19 of the principal Act has up to this stage been applied exclusively in order to establish so called trading areas within urban complexes for displaced traders, and there is no intention to forego this policy. However, as the section reads at present, the investigation and recommendation of the Group Areas Board, as well as the proclamation of the State President must deal with each separate building, land or premises, and it is not possible, as with the establishment of group areas, to deal with a specific area as such. Apart from the fact that giving consideration to separate premises is time-consuming, it is extremely difficult for the Group Areas Board to determine during its inquiry already, and to make a recommendation in regard to a date from which a particular building, land or premises may only be utilized for the envisaged purpose. Consequently the minimum <span class="col_6169-6170" refersTo="page_0232"/>period of 12 months is usually recommended, and the result of this is that after the period has expired everyone who has not yet brought the use of their properties into line with the proclamation must be placed on permit. It is therefore deemed necessary that the Minister of Community Development, to whom the resettlement of disqualified persons and the development of proclaimed areas is entrusted, must be in a position to determine from what date a particular premises may be utilized for the specified purpose only. In this way planned Change-overs can be ensured and the issuing of permits considerably reduced. This principle as well was accepted a long time ago in regard to group areas, and applied with effective results. Identification of so-called trading areas does in fact take place in consultation with the provincial and local authorities concerned, but it may happen that the purpose for which the area is being envisaged, is in conflict with existing zoning or title conditions of single premises in such an area and subsection (5) is intended to make provision for such cases. The proposed subsections (2) and (3) are intended to place those areas which have already been established under the existing section 19 on an equal footing with those which will be proclaimed in terms of the amended section.</p>

<p>Clause 4 is intended to eliminate a deficiency in the provision for the issuing of permits, and to provide specifically that permits for use can be issued.</p>

<p>Clause 5 deals with an administrative matter. With a view to the efficient functioning and administration of its regional offices in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town, the Department of Community Development has found it necessary to upgrade the posts of its regional representatives in the said offices and to appoint the encumbents to the newly created posts of &#x201C;regional representative&#x201D;. The problem is now being experienced that the rank of regional representative is not mentioned in section 22 (1) (a) of the principal Act, with the result that no powers can be delegated to these officers who are in charge of the offices, while the powers can in fact be delegated to the deputy secretaries in the same offices, who are of a lower rank. In terms of the existing Act, the powers up to the rank of deputy secretary can be delegated, and the amendment does not therefore comprise an expansion of delegated power to lower ranks. New powers are being created by the proposed sections 13 (3), 19 (2) and 19 (4) and that is why it is necessary to authorize the Minister to be able to delegate these powers as well.</p>

<p>Clause 6 deals with the so-called &#x201C;backyard locations&#x201D;. Complaints are continually being received about them in the white group areas. Except in the case of disqualified Bantu, the police cannot take action against the visitors of <i>bona fide</i> domestic servants and employees, and it is not possible to combat this evil effectively. Consequently it is deemed necessary to make provision to the effect that the exemptions which may be granted in terms of section 26 of the principal Act by proclamation to <i>bona fide</i> domestic servants and employees can be made subject to conditions regarding the visitors of domestic servants and other employees who live in. According to the opinion of Government legal advisors it is doubtful whether such conditions can be imposed in terms of the existing provision, and the amendments to the principal Act contained in this clause are therefore intended to create the necessary authority. Although it is at the moment the visitors of domestic servants in flats who are for the most part causing the problems, I am not prepared to distinguish in the Act itself between the servants working in flats and those accommodated in or at private dwellings. The Act only makes provision for exemption by way of proclamation, and if there is any reason to distinguish between the visitors of servants at private dwellings and those at flats, it can be done in the proclamation. However, it is emphasized again that the section only applied in group areas for occupation, and that in group areas the Minister of Community Development is responsible for the application of the Act. I can therefore give no undertaking in this regard. Representations in regard to the possible application of the provisions of the Act concerned must be made to the Minister of Community Development.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one asks oneself why it is necessary to have a Bill amending the Group Areas Act again this year. The hon. the Deputy Minister has been quite frank with us when he said that the necessity for these amendments arose periodically. It certainly does. It seems to us that we have to live with these amendments each year. They arise from the very basic concept of the Group Areas Act which was opposed by this side of the House when the legislation was initially introduced. The introduction of the Group Areas legislation was initially opposed by this side of the House because the separation was to be by compulsion and not by magnetism as it was previously.</p>

<p>Do you think that is possible?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, it is possible under a different Government.</p>

<p>With the growth of metropolitan urban areas, it has been a pattern that white occupied areas have surrounded areas which were previously separate and isolated Coloured occupied areas. The application of the Group Areas Act inevitably results in the non-Whites occupying these originally isolated areas, which have now been surrounded by white areas, having to move from those areas. They are given new areas which are apart and isolated and which have been established to house them, because their being moved was made necessary by the Group Areas Act. The location <span class="col_6171-6172" refersTo="page_0233"/>of these areas is inevitably further removed from the business, industrial and residential areas in which the non-white persons are employed. In other words, it becomes necessary for them to travel great distances to and from their work and to spend more time getting to work and getting home from work. It has become necessary to permit certain classes of persons, disqualified on the grounds of colour, to have rights of occupation in such proclaimed white group areas. This Bill deals with one such exempted class in clause 6, namely the domestic servants who are employed in white residential areas. Non-white domestic servants are permitted in terms of section 26 of the principal Act to occupy premises in white areas, that is, to live at their places of employment. The Government having found it necessary to give exemption from the basic provisions of the Group Areas Act, the number of disqualified persons living in these white areas have obviously increased. These domestic servants have increased in number and their number has increased not only because of the extension and development of these white residential areas, but as a result of the distances these non-white workers have to travel to and from their work in these white areas. Daily maids and charwomen are becoming a thing of the past in most white residential areas. They are being replaced by domestic servants who are now employed and live where they work. In all these areas, however, there remain large numbers of nonwhites who are employed on a daily basis. They work in shops, garages, restaurants and hotels in the white residential areas. It is this situation which creates what the hon. the Deputy Minister has referred to as a cause for complaint in so far as the conduct of visitors to the non-white servants are concerned. The inevitable result has been that these daily employees, in every white urban area are tempted, and understandably so, to arrange for accommodation in the white area in which they are employed. Where do they go? They go to the domestic servant who has accommodation for himself or herself. They go there and come to some arrangement whereby they can share that accommodation. One then finds these persons who might be called unauthorized within the white areas. These lodgers, especially if they be Bantu, will probably be acting illegally. They will probably be acting without permission in a number of cases of the employers of the non-white domestic servants, but one would be hard put to secure a conviction if the individual concerned says that he or she was merely visiting and was not occupying the premises at the time. The difficulty that exists is basically and undoubtedly of the Government’s own creation by its policy. It arises because of the application of the Group Areas Act, and the manner in which it is applied by the Government. Because of this legislation people throughout the country in urban areas find themselves faced with two alternatives. I agree there is a problem. It is a problem which has grown, has been created and has resulted from the group areas legislation. They are faced with two alternatives in this regard. The one is the residents in white areas must do without domestic servants and the exemptions under the Group Areas Act must be withdrawn so that no domestic servants may occupy any accommodation in white areas. I would like the hon. the Deputy Minister to suggest that to the housewives of South Africa and to see the reception this suggestion will receive.</p>

<p>That is the one alternative. The other alternative is that measures must be contrived, as in this Bill, to try and control the undesirable situation that has arisen, and to which the hon. the Minister has referred. That is the other alternative.</p>

<p>The Government has now introduced this legislation which seeks power to control and restrict by regulation the daily and personal life of domestic servants who are employed in the white group areas. I want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_planning">

<p>You have the wrong end of the stick.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister wants to control the visitors to domestic servants. I want to remind the hon. the Deputy Minister that these domestic servants are human beings who enjoy the company of their friends just as much as we do. That is why I say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he has here a problem which is a very difficult one and which needs very careful handling. The hon. the Deputy Minister has been strangely silent as to what form of regulation he proposes to introduce. How is he going to regulate the visitors to domestic servants in white areas? What type of regulation does he consider might be suitable? We look at this Bill in the light of the circumstances as they exist and we must accept that this problem does exist because of circumstances to which I have referred. We on this side of the House must ask ourselves what we are going to do. Are we going to support this Bill? It seems to me that the answer is to be found in facing the facts. It is a question of Hobson’s choice. As one of my colleagues put it to me, it is like a person who has become infected with a disease. He did not seek the infection, but having become infected, he has to find a cure for the disease. We have become infected with this problem in our urban areas and it seems that a solution must be found to this problem. One feels that this problem has arisen through no fault basically of the employer or the employee. It is a real one and we would not be realists if we should deny it. This problem is particularly real in regard to blocks of flats. I say in connection with blocks <span class="col_6173-6174" refersTo="page_0234"/>of flats, because in most instances in blocks of flats the servants are housed in a separate part of the building, apart from the actual white residential section. As was referred to in the Other Place, these are places where employers exercise some sort of remote control over the servant, because the servant’s accommodation is not directly within the area occupied by the employer. We are prepared, so far as the Second Reading is concerned, to support this measure, but we want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister for certain explanations and certain clarifications of matters which arise under this Bill. We will move certain amendments during the Committee Stage to this Bill where we feel that the provisions as they are now are not totally acceptable.</p>

<p>I therefore want to raise questions with the hon. the Deputy Minister now, and on which I hope he will give some clarity. How does he visualize using these powers under clause 6? What regulations does he consider are necessary? Because if he is asking for power to introduce regulations, he must have had a preliminary &#x201C;canter&#x201D; as to the type of regulation that he visualizes introducing. What are the conditions he has in mind that should be imposed upon visitors to domestic servants?</p>

<p>The next point which I wish to raise with the hon. the Deputy Minister, although he has anticipated this question to some extent, is whether it is necessary to apply these regulations to domestic servants who are employed and stay in accommodation which do not form part of a complex, in other words, at private houses? The Deputy Minister did say in introducing the Second Reading that this was permissive and if the Department of Community Development did not think it necessary to control the servants in these private dwellings they would not do so, but I do not think they should have the power to do so; I do not think the Department of Community Development should have the power to control them and we will in the Committee Stage move an amendment to ensure that the powers granted will be only in regard to accommodation provided which is not under the direct control of the private owner of a private dwelling. I believe that is a reasonable approach to the problem which, as I say, exists, and that proposal will be put before the Minister as well.</p>

<p>The third point I wish to remind the hon. the Minister is of this. No matter what regulations are made regarding visitors under the powers he seeks in this Bill, the existence of non-White persons within the white group area must be more realistically faced by the Government. You cannot possibly expect an orderly existence of domestic servants, permitted to live in white areas such as Sea Point or any other area of that nature, far removed from their permanent homes out on the Cape Flats, without seeing to it that they are provided with facilities for their recreation and for their meeting within those areas where they are employed. I believe the Government has a two-fold responsibility, not only to attempt to deal with regulations but also to see that these facilities are made available where they recognize the necessity of the non-white domestic servant being employed and living in white group areas. I hope the Deputy Minister will elaborate on these matters in his reply. As I say, as was accepted in the Other Place, this is mainly a Committee Stage Bill and these are matters which we will deal with in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I want to raise one point under clause 1 of the Bill. It is a small item but a significant one. The Bill now provides for the control of proclaimed group areas, the section 19 areas under the Group Areas Act. The Bill transfers the control of those areas to the Minister of Community Development. I want to ask the Minister whether this is indicative of a gradual move whereby the determination of group areas will probably also rest under that same Minister eventually instead of under the Minister of Planning, thus eliminating so many of the problems we have had in regard to proclamations and deproclamations when conflict has arisen between the two departments. I wonder whether the Minister will indicate whether this is a first step in that direction, and that these powers are now being transferred to the Minister of Community Development.</p>

<p>As I said, on this side of the House we feel that we must face the fact that there is a problem which needs attention and which is a cause for complaint. It is a matter which can be discussed in detail with the Minister in the Committee Stage, but I hope at this stage he will be able to elaborate on it and indicate to us how he visualizes the type of regulation he has in mind can meet in a just manner the interests of the persons who will be affected by those regulations.</p>

<p>I have always had the highest regard for the debating ability of the hon. member for Green Point, but I must say that I saw him performing an egg-dance in this House this afternoon such as I have not seen him perform for a long time, and that for obvious reasons. The hon. member tried to indicate to us this afternoon that they actually had a problem as to whether they should be in favour of or against this Bill because they were given a Hobson’s choice; because we have the Group Areas Act and because these things are of a consequential nature, they do not know whether they should be in favour of or against this Bill. Apparently the hon. member’s memory is very short. The problem he has this afternoon, the problem that they do not know which course to take, arises from the fact that he moved an amendment in this House recently in respect of legislation introduced by the hon. the Minister of Community Development, an amendment from which it is apparent that the United Party now accepts group areas and separate residential areas.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>But he is such a nuisance, Sir. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point reads as follows: That &#x201C;whilst this House desires the provision of adequate housing in separate residential areas for the different race groups, &#x2026;&#x201D;. Now the hon. member is calling to witness the fact that they opposed the Group Areas Act and that separate residential areas are being applied to-day through compulsion and not through magnetism. But his real problem is that they indicate, on the one hand, that they are in favour of separate residential areas and he is now finding himself with this problem which has given him a Hobson’s choice. To say that non-Whites have to find themselves one domestic servant or other with whom they can spend the night because they stay a long way from their residential areas, is simply no argument. Does the hon. member want people, because they stay a long way from the areas in which they work, to be allowed in uncontrolled numbers to spend the night with other servants, because provision is made for servants under this Act? I should rather say that we as right-minded members for the Cape Peninsula should have been very grateful for this Bill, which particularly has in mind the control of visitors to our domestic servants. When the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Community Development was discussed during the previous session of 1968, I dealt at length with this situation which we are trying to deal with to-day. I do not want to deal with this matter again to-day, but I just want to read out to hon. members what the hon. the Minister said at that time. I am referring to last year’s Hansard, column 5108, where he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is why it seems to me that the time has come for us to do something about this problem. That is why I am giving serious consideration to it, and I am having an investigation made into it. I am also giving serious consideration to the fact that there are many houses and flats, particularly in Cape Town, where the servant’s room is inside the house or the flat, without having a separate entrance, or separate facilities &#x2026;</block>

<p>I say we should be grateful for this legislation to-day because this is not legislation that has originated on the spur of the moment. I have indicated that this legislation has been investigated exhaustively and considered seriously for some time. Then I want to go further and say that it has become imperative for us, particularly in the Cape Peninsula, because we find that non-Whites move about and loiter freely in the white residential areas, particularly at late hours of the night. This is something unavoidable, because we still have this provision to-day that visitors to <i>bona fide</i> domestic servants are being allowed to spend the night with these domestic servants for as long as 90 calendar days. At that time I said&#x2014;and I want to stand by it to-day&#x2014;that I was sure that almost as many non-Whites were spending the night in some white residential areas as there were Whites living in those areas and that we were faced with a situation where locations were developing in the backyards in white residential areas. [Interjection.] The aspect the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is mentioning now, is one which I should like to discuss outside the framework of this legislation, because it is not being (provided for in this legislation. In many cases these non-Whites were spending the night with the servants without the house-owners knowing anything about it and in such cases the police were able to take the steps they did, but I am afraid that in an equally large number of cases house-owners gave these non-Whites permission to be on the premises, because the house-owners were afraid that they might lose their servants if they restricted them. For that reason they allowed the non-Whites to spend the night with their servants. The situation has degenerated to such an extent that the Police found it necessary to issue warnings from time to time. I just want to quote one case where a report was published in <i>Die Burger</i> on 22nd November, 1968, under the heading &#x201C;Gevaar Skuil Snags in Bediendekamers&#x201D; (danger lurks in servants’ rooms at night), and I just want to quote the following paragraph (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Danger lurks in servants’ rooms in white residential areas in the Peninsula at night. This urgent warning was issued yesterday by a high police spokesman after a major raid had been conducted in the Tygerberg. Early yesterday morning the police struck and within a matter of two hours arrested 38 non-Whites who were sleeping on white premises; 24 of them were Coloureds and the rest were Bantu. Lt.-Col. Visser, District Commandant, issued a warning yesterday against the admission of non-Whites into white residential areas at night. Col. Visser referred to four cases where Bantu were sleeping at houses during the week-end while the women were alone at home. The police are concerned about the situation and say that it involves great danger. The Bantu and the non-Whites may be innocent and may only be sleeping with the servants, but they may also be political agitators or offenders on the run or even terrorists. How do I know? The police took steps against these conditions before.</block>

<p>And then I come to the interesting part (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6177-6178" refersTo="page_0236"/>Afterwards the police received letters of abuse as well as letters of congratulation. Yesterday Col. Visser appealed to house-owners to exercise control over what is taking place on their premises at night before it is too late for somebody.</block>

<p>As is indicated in this report, the police not only receive thanks for what they do, but, according to Col. Visser, they also receive letters of abuse, in other words, from people who wilfully allow unidentified visitors to spend the night with their servants. I ask: Is it our task, is it the task of the legislator to protect those people who wilfully allow such an offence to be committed? Are we in the position to-day where we can allow these malpractices to continue? But these malpractices are not limited to a few residential areas, particularly in the case of the Tygerberg, as is indicated in the report. In flat complexes the position is much worse. There are various methods of providing accommodation for non-White servants at these flats and one of them is that a separate block is erected at these flats in which these servants may be accommodated. In other words, they are concentrated in one block. I do not want to express an opinion about this practice. I am sorry the hon. member for Sea Point is not here to-day since this is a major problem particularly in Sea Point. I do not want to express an opinion about the concentration of servants in one building. I should rather like to quote what was said by one of the voters of the hon. member for Sea Point who gave the following description of the position in a letter which appeared in <i>Die Burger.</i> She described the position as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I stay in Sea Point and I can assure you that it is a shame the way the skollies are performing in these servants’ rooms. One has to put up with this for the sake of those lazy old women who want to do nothing else but have tea parties and play cards and want to be served. Those of us who have to work hard during the day are kept awake by the skollies visiting the servants in the back yards, particularly during week-ends.</block>

<p>Sir, the point at issue is not whether the deductions drawn by this lady are correct as regards the lazy women who are supposed to do nothing else but play cards, and so forth, but what is important, is that the facts of this woman are quite correct, namely that we have here a concentration of skolly elements who use these servants’ quarters as a cache to hide their stolen goods and to serve as a centre for their smuggling activities.</p>

<p>There is also another method of providing accommodation to servants at blocks of flats, namely to make separate provision for domestic servants on every storey in the block of flats. In other words, one finds that Coloureds and Whites are staying next to one another on the same story. From the nature of the case these people are entitled and are allowed to receive visitors freely. People living in flats adjoining these servants’ quarters have no alternative but to accept this situation or to move elsewhere. But then we have the third method of providing accommodation and which is really the worst of them all. I want to say immediately that we find this particularly in the very densely populated flat areas, possibly also in Sea Point in particular. There one finds the situation that there is a small room at the entrance of the flat, a room which is separately equipped as the living quarters of the domestic servant, while the entrance to that room also serves as the entrance to the flat. In other words, there are no facilities for a separate entrance to that room at all. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Green Point sounds very surprised. He need only to move around in his own constituency to discover that situation for himself. It is a fact that those domestic servants living in those small rooms are also entitled under the present Act to receive visitors unrestricted and freely for as long as 90 days per year. Sir, I ask myself and I ask hon. members opposite: Are we entitled to allow such a situation where people are living together, a situation which goes against the grain of every right-minded person? We have to put an end to it and for that reason I am convinced that the legislation we have before us to-day, will eliminate these malpractices to a large extent. We believe this, because we have asked for this legislation. I want to concede that I appreciate that we shall not be able to solve this problem in its entirety under this legislation, because as long as we as Whites want to allow ourselves the luxury of having a non-White servant available at all times, this problem will continue to remain with us to a certain extent, but since this is not at issue at this stage, I do not want to go into that aspect any further. This is not a situation of which we are afraid. The hon. member for Green Point is looking to the convenience of his voters because he fears for his political skin in this regard. However, I do not want to discuss the matter within the scope of this restriction on visitors, because this is not at issue at this stage. But there is no need for the hon. member to challenge me; I shall find an opportunity of discussing this matter at a later stage. But this still does not justify the argument that we should not take any steps at present to eliminate these malpractices. I believe that, for the time being, the steps proposed by the hon. the Minister to-day, will eliminate these malpractices to a large extent.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to be brief in my reply. In the first instance I want to thank the hon. member for Tygervallei for the summary of the position he furnished here. He has more to do with everyday aspects of this matter than I, and I am grateful to him for this summary. I am also grateful to the hon. member for Green Point for the way in which he presented <span class="col_6179-6180" refersTo="page_0237"/>his criticism here. I just want to say this in regard to what the hon. member for Green Point had to say. He stated that his Party stood for voluntary separate residential areas in contrast to what we supposedly want, viz. compulsory separate residential areas by way of legislation. However, I want to remind him of the fact that it was in fact this voluntary separate residential areas of the past which landed us in the stew we find ourselves in to-day. If we did not have this legislation then we would not have had the measure of separation which we have to-day.</p>

<p>The hon. member also stated that we must take into account the fact that domestic servants to-day have to travel long distances to and from their places of employment. I readily concede that point; it is true, but this Bill does not deal with domestic servants as such. It deals with the visitors of domestic servants, and it is aimed at them in the first instance. The distances which these servants have to travel has nothing to do with the matter of the visitors. A visitor, whether he has come a long distance or whether he has come a short distance, remains a visitor, and it is those people we would like to take steps against here. In addition the hon. member asked how I foresaw this legislation being applied. A visitor cannot visit a domestic servant while that domestic servant is working. After all, one does not need a visitor when you are doing your work. If a person is working in a factory for example, you cannot allow him to receive visitors in that factory. If the domestic servant is doing her work in the morning then you cannot allow her to receive visitors. Another aspect is that one cannot allow visitors to sleep over regularly with the servants. There have been cases where a female domestic servant allowed her husband and her entire family to stay with her for more than a year in her room, and nobody could take steps against them although it is provided in the regulations that the periods may not be exceeded by 90 days. Nobody could prove when the period of 90 days had commenced. It is an impossible task for the police to take steps against such servants. The question of the duration of the visits&#x2014;whether it should be 72 hours as is provided in the Bantu legislation, or whether it should be three, four or seven days&#x2014;is a matter which can be arranged by way of regulation. Nor can I see why the hon. member would like to exclude the domestic servant of the private owner from the provisions of this proclamation, for after all it is a fact that the servants of the private owner also receive visitors, and it is often the private house-owner who stands powerless in regard to this evil, for the domestic servant simply says: &#x201C;If you do not allow my husband to come and sleep with me every night, then I shall no longer work for you,&#x201D; and in order to keep his domestic servant, he has no option but to accept that condition. He is in a helpless position and he cannot exercise proper control, for that reason we cannot distinguish between the ordinary dwelling and a flat. The hon. member also stated that we should be realistic and that we should accept the presence of Coloureds in the white group areas and that we should create recreational facilities for them. I cannot see why recreation facilities should be established in Sea Point for domestic servants and their visitors. The hon. member himself drives from here to Newlands and drives even further afield to go fishing. Why cannot these people not have their own recreational facilities in their own residential areas? But besides that, any good house-owner ought to give his servant at least a half day or so off per week so that he can go and enjoy the recreational facilities in his own group area which have been made available for him there.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the fact that the provisions of section 19 are now being expanded, and he wanted to know whether we are now going to hand over our functions to the Department of Community Development. There is no question of that. Under this legislation the Department of Planning has a planning function and the Department of Community Development has a development function. Up to the stage when an area is proclaimed it falls under the planning function of the Department of Planning, and as soon as an area has been proclaimed, the Department of Community Development takes over, and then the Department of Planning no longer has any function. As soon as an area has been proclaimed, either under section 19, or under the Group Areas Act, the Department of Community Development takes over. There is therefore no question of the entire administration of this Act being transferred to Community Development.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that during the discussion of the Vote &#x201C;Prime Minister&#x201D;, the hon. the Prime Minister gave certain explanations of the item &#x201C;Secret Services&#x201D;, which then appeared on that Vote for the first time. On that occasion it was also explained that after thorough consideration it had been decided to establish a Bureau for State Security. The House has approved the amendments effected to the Public Service Act for this purpose. From the nature of the confidential duties and functions of the bureau it is deemed essential that for the sake of greater secrecy special <span class="col_6181-6182" refersTo="page_0238"/>arrangements also have to be made as regards the expenditure on these activities. With a view to this it is now proposed in the Bill that a special account be established for this purpose. This Bill to a very large extent follows the text of the Foreign Affairs Special Account Act passed by Parliament in 1967. It differs from that Act mainly in so far as the Special Account now being proposed will make provision for different services and expenditure in connection therewith. Hon. members will agree with me that it will not be in the public interest to go into the details of the services envisaged here. As it is essential to ensure the secrecy of these services, the expenditure in connection therewith cannot be voted from public funds in the usual way. As in the case of the Foreign Affairs Special Account, proper control will also be exercised over the proposed Special Account and expenditure, as is clear from the provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>When the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act was before this House in 1964, it was generally felt that the plant breeders of the Republic should be protected, and plant breeders’ rights were introduced only for plants which had originated in the Republic. Consequently it was not possible for overseas plant breeders to obtain rights on their plants here. This prevented a large number of unadapted plants finding their way into the Republic and at the same time it served as encouragement to plant breeders in this country. The success which our plant breeders have had is proved, <i>inter alia,</i> by three promising lupin varieties of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services which have been undergoing tests in Germany since 1967 with a view to obtaining plant breeders’ rights there.</p>

<p>In the meantime a new law relating to plant breeders’ rights was passed in Germany which provides that plant breeders’ rights may only be granted if the countries applying for them grant reciprocal privileges to German plant breeders. After careful consideration and consultation with the South African Agricultural Union, the Plant Breeders’ Association and the Seed Dealers’ Association, I came to the conclusion that South African plant breeders have made thorough use of the protection which they have enjoyed up to now, and that it could only be to the advantage of the Republic to make provision for granting plant breeders’ rights on a reciprocal basis.</p>

<p>The granting of reciprocal plant breeders’ rights will take place sparingly and will only apply in respect of a plant of a particular kind or variety which has its origin in a country which is also prepared to grant rights on the same basis to the Republic.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 1 of the Bill is of a formal nature, because it was felt that the period of sole right in respect of plants which are propagated from seed is too short. The reason for this is that the trial period sometimes lasts up to three years, which means that the holder of the plant breeders’ rights is only allowed two years during which he can exercise his sole right. With the proposed amendment this problem will now be overcome.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I trust that I shall receive the support of members of both sides of the House for the adoption of this measure.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that under section 10 of the present Act a South African plant breeder wanting to secure his rights in respect of a new mutation or plant variety developed by selection, may apply to the registrar and may be granted permission by the Minister to have provisional plant breeders rights, which carry with them the sole right to propagate, to sell and to multiply that particular plant. When these provisional plant breeders rights expire he can again apply to the registrar, and be granted by the Minister, final plant breeders rights, which in the case of fruit trees and vines may extend up to a period of 20 years and 10 or 15 years for some other plants.</p>

<p>The rub, as far as the plant breeder is concerned, lies in the fact that it takes some two to three years to test these plants and that the date of application, referred to in the first clause of this Bill, is the date of application for provisional plant breeders rights and not the date of the application for final plant breeders rights. Therefore it can happen, as the Deputy Minister has said, that a person has very little time indeed to exercise the sole right to sell, to propagate or multiply a plant before he in turn has to give a licence to somebody who applies for it and pays royalties to him.</p>

<p>We feel that this is a reasonable amendment. Our South African plant breeders are entitled to this extra period of three years proposed by clause 1. Our plant breeders have some very notable achievements to their credit, both private breeders and breeders at certain Government research stations. One has <span class="col_6183-6184" refersTo="page_0239"/>only to think of the Kakamas peach, for example, which to-day is used for canning purposes; not merely in our own country, but in certain overseas countries as well, including the United States. One might give another example of the stringless mango, which was produced, I think, at the sub-tropical research station of the department.</p>

<p>With regard to the second clause of the Bill, the original Act came from a Select Committee in 1964. Members of the United Party on that Select Committee were in favour of granting reciprocal rights under certain conditions to breeders from other countries. I should like to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister this afternoon for once again giving us an example of how the Government can follow the good lead so very often provided by the United Party. We are not worried that this could be abused. We feel, in the first place, that there is such an interchange of information between breeders and scientists throughout the world that it is to our advantage if we can make use of some of the better varieties that have been produced in other countries.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister cited here the question of lupins, which, of course, revolutionized farming in certain parts of the Western Province; but there are other examples, too. One might cite certain varieties of tomatoes that have been produced in the United States. I say we are not worried about the provisions of this particular section, because it very specifically refers merely to a new plant of a particular variety. It is not just a general right given to the foreign breeders.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we on this side of the House are prepared to support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members will remember that prior to the enactment of section 1 (1) of the General Law Amendment Act, 1957, there was no uniformity in the various provinces of the Republic with regard to the formalities in respect of contracts for the purchase and sale of land. In the Transvaal and the Free State the matter was regulated by pre-Union laws, which required such contracts to be in writing, whereas in the Cape Province an oral agreement was valid. In Natal, where the matter was also regulated by a pre-Union Act, an oral agreement was valid but transfer could not be effected prior to the submission of a written document. Section 1 (1) of the General Law Amendment Act, 1957, was then placed on the Statute Book so as to bring about uniformity and to eliminate and avoid uncertainty and disputes, in any event, as far as it was practicable to do so.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading of the Bill the then Minister of Justice stated very clearly in connection with section 1 (1) that he had discussed the matter in detail with jurists and others and that everybody was of the opinion that it was in the interests of all parties for transactions in connection with the sale of land to be in writing. Moreover, this still is the considered opinion of most people to-day. When we consult the law reports, we find that this section often crops up in the administration of justice and that the interpretation of that section is difficult in certain respects. I do not deem it necessary to analyse everything that has been written about this section, but I may mention that the problems relate more specifically to the question of whether or not a contract is in writing in specific cases, to what kind of transactions it is applicable, etc.</p>

<p>As regard the contract being reduced to writing, it was, according to judgments based on the provision which used to be in force in the Transvaal, on which this provision is modelled, not necessary for the contract to be contained in one document. An offer and acceptance could be made in separate documents. The telegraphic acceptance of an offer or the telegraphic communication that an offer had been accepted in writing, was sufficient for creating a valid contract of sale in terms of the requirements of the legal provisions in force at that time. The interpretation of section 1 (1) of the General Law Amendment Act of 1957 also is such that it is not necessary for the contract to be contained in one document. It is not clear either to what the provisions in connection with &#x201C;cession&#x201D; in section 1 (1) actually relate. The problems of interpretation in this connection are clearly evident from the judgment in the case of <i>Uxbury Investment Ltd.</i> v. <i>Sunbury Investments Ltd.</i> 1963 (1) 747 (K). Of course, it is hardly possible to ward off all disputes and all possible malpractices by means of legislation of this nature, but as far as it is possible to do so, the risk to contracting parties of law suits ought to be limited to a minimum. Consequently the Bill introduced earlier this year sought to achieve this end by substituting a provision for section 1 of the General Law Amendment Act, 1957, which required, <i>inter alia,</i> the contract to be contained in one written document; the document authorizing a person to sign on behalf of a party to be attached to the contract; and one which did not re-enact the provisions in connection with cession and the sale of any interest in land. As hon. members know, the Bill was referred before Second Reading to a Select Committee for inquiry and report, the Committee having leave to bring up an amended Bill. The Bill at present before this House is the one introduced by the Committee.</p>

<p><span class="col_6185-6186" refersTo="page_0240"/>Mr. Speaker, before saying a few words about the provisions of the Bill, I should like, with your leave, to express my thanks and appreciation to the Chairman of the Committee, the hon. member for Virginia (Mr. H. J. van Wyk), who, as I have been informed, dealt very efficiently with a particularly technical measure although he is a layman in the field of law, as well as to the other members of the Committee for the time and energy they devoted to the investigation of this matter. It was their task to consider in the light of their practical knowledge and experience, particularly the possible effect the proposed new provisions might have in practice on the numerous everyday land transactions. I am particularly pleased that the recommendations of the Committee were unanimous.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to analyse in detail the evidence submitted to the Select Committee. The documents are accessible to members who want to know more about the subject. In broad outline I nevertheless want to mention that it appeared that the requirement of &#x201C;one written document&#x201D;, originally envisaged, might possibly not have resulted in fewer law suits in connection with the requirement of writing than was the case at present. In addition it appeared that such a requirement might create the opportunity for a contracting party to evade his obligations if he did not want to honour his given word but sought a way out before conditions which had been agreed upon could be embodied in one written document. Furthermore, there were indications that the public could be inconvenienced in an inestimable number of everyday private and business transactions if it were to be required by law that a contract for the sale of land had to be contained in one document. The Select Committee consequently decided that the existing requirement in connection with writing should be left intact. It has at least that advantage that it is a requirement which can be implemented in practice.</p>

<p>Coupled to the requirement that the contract (had to be contained in &#x201C;one written document&#x201D;, it was envisaged that a person signing the contract on behalf of a contracting party was to attach to the contract at the signing thereof a document authorizing him to sign on behalf of that party. Because this, too, was seen as a possible technical ground on which obligations could be evaded and because of the possibility of delay in finalizing a contract of sale of land, it was decided not to amend the existing provisions in this connection. As a matter of fact, if the requirement of &#x201C;one written document&#x201D; falls away, it becomes evident that this requirement should fall away as well in any event.</p>

<p>It was decided that the existing provisions in connection with cessions should not be reenacted as the Deeds Registries Act regulated this matter adequately, but that the provisions in connection with the sale of any interest in land should be retained because of the fact that the sale of, <i>inter alia,</i> mineral rights might be as valuable, if not more valuable, than the land itself. In short, Sir, what clause 1 (1), as recommended by the Select Committee, amounts to is that the existing section is being amended by the omission of the provisions relating to cession. That aspect seems to be regulated adequately by the Deeds Registries Act. It appears that existing judgments will provide sufficient guidance as regards the interpretation of the other provisions. It is hoped that the amendment will clarify the section, and in addition it has the advantage that the legal provisions relating to the formalities in respect of a contract of sale of land will also be regulated in a separate Act, just as in the case of the Formalities in respect of Leases of Land Bill, which the hon. the Minister of Justice piloted through Parliament earlier this Session.</p>

<p>Clause 1 (2) is a new provision which has been inserted by the Select Committee for the sake of clarity and, in view of the provisions of section 71 of the Companies Act, 1926, to eliminate any doubt as far as it affects those provisions. As hon. members know, that section deals with written contracts entered into by a representative of a company not yet formed, incorporated or registered. So much as regards clause 1.</p>

<p>Clause 2 really is no more than clear confirmation of the existing legal position.</p>

<p>Clause 5 provides that the Act will come into operation on 1st January, 1970. In the case of the existing section it was also provided that it would come into operation on a certain date, i.e. 1st January, 1958. That was done so as to afford the public the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the provisions of that section. It appears (to be desirable to afford the public the same opportunity now.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out that in 1957 the law with regard to the sale of land was amended to bring about uniformity in all the provinces. At that time no formalities at all were necessary in the Cape. It is a pity we did not follow the Cape custom as was in fact suggested by some of the members of the Law Revision Committee who proposed certain amendments to the law. Unfortunately we went more to the Transvaal for guidance. I hope this will be a lesson to the Government members not to be guided too much by the Transvaal and that they should rely more on the Cape. The original Bill referred to the Select Committee provided that a contract of sale should be in one document and signed by the parties at the same time and if one of the parties thereto was a representative of another party, he had to submit a written photostatic copy or a duplicate of the authority. The Select Committee had no difficulty in dealing with these matters, namely the one document and the authority of the representative, because it was quite clear from all the memoranda received by the Committee <span class="col_6187-6188" refersTo="page_0241"/>from interested bodies that these two amendments were not acceptable to the public who had to deal with sales in a practical manner. The only trouble that we did have was with regard to the definition of land, as to what was to be covered by the Bill. As the hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out, one of the reasons for this amending Bill was the difficulty the courts had in interpreting as to what was meant by a cession. The Select Committee decided, quite rightly, to delete the word &#x201C;cession&#x201D; and to apply the Bill only to sales of land and interest in land. The words &#x201C;interest in land&#x201D; were inserted on account of difficulties some members had in deciding exactly what was covered by the term &#x201C;land&#x201D;. We hope that the provision as we now have it in regard to land or interest in land will cover all the transactions that the Select Committee considered. We on this side of the House support the Bill, because, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has already indicated, the recommendation by the Select Committee was unanimous.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when this debate adjourned I was making a final appeal for a third Iscor, knowing at the time that the announcement would come soon, but of course not expecting it quite so soon. We are very glad to have the announcement at long last. At least now the speculation that was getting out of hand will come to a stop. That speculation was particularly evident in my own area near Berlin. I also welcome very much the warning of the Chairman of the Permanent Committee in connection with this speculation. I only wished that he had issued that warning a little bit earlier and a bit more strongly than he has actually done. Whilst we congratulate Newcastle on having been chosen for this site of the third Iscor, I cannot help but express here very strongly our own disappointment at the Border not getting this big industry. We had hoped against hope that it might be placed there. At this stage I must stake a claim for the fourth one. I know the hon. the Minister said in his statement that the fourth one will only be due in 1984. That is a long time to wait.</p>

<p>That is correct, I repeat, that is a long time to wait and we in the Border certainly cannot wait that long for a solution to our problem. I venture to say that our problem is without any doubt the worst from a socio-economic point of view that is to be found in South Africa. There is no other area which has the same problem as the Border. My appeal for this industry is not for the sake of the industry as such, but, in the words of the hon. the Minister himself, the catalytic effect thereof. I do not think that people appreciate the extent of the problem that we have. We only have to look to the figures which the Permanent Committee give in their report to see exactly how bad the position is. The Permanent Committee says they have to find employment for 9,000 Bantu annually. Of that figure 50 per cent, namely 4,500 should be placed in employment in the Border, because we have 50 per cent of the homeland Bantu in the Ciskei and in the Transkei. The report further mentions that the grand total placed in employment throughout South Africa in border areas is only 5,000.</p>

<p>In other words, if the total border area development were to take place in the Border, we would only be coping with the problem for that area. If this were to happen, we would then only be half-way in terms of the I.D.C. figures for 1971, when they say 23,500 people have to be given employment. It is interesting to note, from the report of the permanent committee, that 5,000 people will be given employment as a result of the 164 applications for assistance approved during 1968. This means that only about 30 people per application will be given employment. It is also interesting to see, from the announcement made by the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs in connection with the supply of water to Berlin, that he expects about 240 industries to be attracted to Berlin over the next five years. If you work that out, Sir, you will see that, in actual fact, the five-year development which is due to take place at Berlin is only what is required for one year. I realize that these figures are not accurate, but at least they give us an indication of what the position is there. Hon. members may say: &#x201C;But there are other industries which are expanding in other areas, apart from Berlin&#x201D;. That is true enough, but I have not even taken into consideration the number of Bantu who are being repatriated by this Government to our areas. We are very jubilant because of the statement by the hon. the Minister <span class="col_6189-6190" refersTo="page_0242"/>of Water Affairs, expressing his optimism over the development of Berlin. He thinks that 50 industries per annum will be established there. But, Sir, you must just see the jubilation in that area because of the 14 industries which have been approved and which will now establish themselves in the East London area. From that you will see how imperative the need is for drastic action in that area. I believe that the greatest need is for the Border to be placed on a basis of equality with other border areas, so that the Border can compete on an equal basis with those other areas. Sir, I only have to quote what the hon. the Minister himself said, to show you how difficult the position is there. When explaining why the third Iscor could not be built there, he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Op hierdie stadium sal vestiging by ’n kussentrum, veral langs die Oos-of Suidkus van Kaapland, ook swaar koste meebring, met die stepping van addisionele vervoergeriewe, asmede met die toevoer van grondstrowwe en die terugvervoer van die staalprodukte.</block>

<p>That is the basis of the trouble, namely our geographic position. We have concessions at the moment. There is the 25 per cent rebate on harbour dues and other port charges for East London and ports of destination in the Republic and South-West Africa. But, Sir, this only has a limited coverage. There are only certain industrialists who can make use of this. As the hon. the Minister’s figure in his own Vote shows, R25,000 is being allowed for this rebate. That is the only concession which the border area has over any other area in South Africa. The hon. the Minister will of course mention the 15 per cent rebate on road and rail tariffs for products manufactured in the Ciskei and the Transkei, but he has no longer confined that concession to the Border alone. He has now widened its scope. It can now be applied to any selected town or area. The result is that the Border has to-day, and already for some considerable time, been heading the priority list for border area development. We have found that border areas much lower on the list have actually developed much faster. Let us, for example, take the case of Brits. Brits came on to the priority list after the Border had already been on the list for some considerable time. And yet, what is the position there? Industrialists are expected to commence the establishment of their undertakings during the latter half of this year. Our interim answer, until the fourth Iscor of 1984 arrives, is that the Border must be given greater concessions. I should like to emphasize that I am not asking this in order to give the Border an advantage over any other border area. This must be done merely to place it on a par with any other border area, so that we can compete on an equal basis, having regard only to the quality of the products we produce and manufacture in the Border. One becomes concerned, as time passes, as the backlog increases, and as the required development does not take place. This is especially so when one reads what is stated in the report of the Industrial Development Corporation. Let us look at the passage quoted by the hon. member for Pinetown. I shall not repeat it all; I should only like to repeat the last few words of this passage, as follows: &#x201C;&#x2026; in accordance with the general trend in the industrial sector in which fewer new undertakings were established&#x201D;. This is not for the reason which the hon. member for Florida gave. Here they also say that this was the case throughout, without there being any pressure on industrialists. This has nothing to do with the restrictions imposed as a result of inflation. Therefore, Sir, I call on the Government to forget about the easier areas, which the hon. member for Florida also mentioned, and to tackle this major priority problem which exists to-day. Let us at least overcome the present paradox where we have by comparison, a border without any border industries.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is actually strange and also remarkable how eagerly the United Party laid claim to the third Iscor, especially if one recalls how they opposed the original Iscor legislation in 1927 and 1928. However, I want to make use of this opportunity to congratulate the hon. the Minister and also the Cabinet most heartily on the siting of the third Iscor. All factors considered, I think that probably no better Choice could have been made than to have placed the third Iscor factory at Newcastle.</p>

<p>Sir, I actually want to talk about another matter concerning Iscor. As you know, year after year this side of the House is attacked under this Vote for giving too much protection to State-supported corporations, such as the I.D.C., Sasol and Iscor. It is said that the Government goes out of its way to protect these corporations and that this results in unfair competition with the private sector. Up to this stage in this debate we have not yet had that kind of attack, although some of our financial newspapers and some of the United Party newspapers have mentioned it. The hon. member for Pinetown, for example, referred to it. I merely want to say that this propaganda was especially aimed at Iscor, as a result of the announcement of the establishment of Meteor Investments Limited, in which Iscor was to have extensive interests, and in which the public will also, in the Course of time, be given the opportunity of taking a share. I do not want to say much more about Metcor, but immediately after the announcement of the establishment of Meteor, and particularly after it was announced that Meteor would obtain an interest in &#x201C;Afgate&#x201D;, &#x201C;Wispeco&#x201D; and the steel consumers, we had the following reaction from the financial editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> under the heading &#x201C;Iscor’s Wispeco stake is worrying&#x201D;. <i>Inter alia,</i> the report reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Iscor has acquired a 30 per cent stake in Wispeco and thus a pattern is established for the State-controlled concern to move increasingly <span class="col_6191-6192" refersTo="page_0243"/>into the field of secondary industry, hitherto largely the preserve of private enterprise.</block>

<p>This is now the royal preserve which no one may enter. In the <i>Financial Mail</i> of the 7th March, under the heading &#x201C;Watch Iscor, Mr. Haak&#x201D;, it was asked whether it was in the country’s interests that Iscor, as a steel manufacturer, should also be able to obtain an interest in steel processing companies. Although it is at present the tendency of companies to amalgamate, it is claimed that Iscor’s actions in the establishment of Meteor have supposedly shocked the business world. I row first want to try to reply to these questions. I think that the interests which Iscor obtained through Meteor, Afgate and Wispeco are being completely over-emphasized and too great a fuss is being made of the matter. The interests which Iscor and other companies such as Amcor, Union Steel and Vecor had, already existed before the establishment of the Meteor Investment Corporation. The setting up of manufacturing and consumer companies, in order to guarantee a market for a product, is a tendency which is to-day accepted throughout the world and which is taking place. This is not only done in South Africa, and neither is it only applicable to Iscor. The establishment of Meteor is therefore not a new phenomenon. If we look at how the Highveld Steel and Vanadium Company links up with companies such as &#x201C;Scaw Metals&#x201D;, Stewart and Lloyds and others, we find that they accept that same principle to a much greater extent. Rand Selections. Anglo-American Investment Trust, O.F.S. Investment Trust, West Rand Investment Trust, Anglo-American Industrial Corporation, Vereeniging Estates and African and European Investment Company are all controlled from the offices of the Anglo-American Corporation. These seven large companies again hold direct interests in 324 companies who again have interests in 2,367 companies. If we bear this in mind, I think it is far-fetched to say that Iscor is now competing unjustly with private initiative. It is also a fact that if Highveld with its affiliates were to sell steel to the companies in which it has an interest, 37 per cent of South Africa’s steel production would be supplied by Iscor directly through Highveld to its own companies. However, the most important question is whether Iscor should be allowed to expand, and if that is asking too much, if Iscor should not grow in such a way as to admit private undertakings? This is the question which is now being asked. I want to ask the gentlemen, who are so concerned about the private sector, whether they are aware of the conditions under which Iscor was established? Can they remember what the Government’s object was in the establishment of Iscor; its object was to establish a semi-State industry through which Government control could go hand in hand with public participation? The object was also that the Government should obtain R1 million in shares and that R6 million in shares should be available to the private sector. But the members on that side of the House were the people who opposed this plan at that time and who frightened the public away, with the result that the shares were not taken up and that the Government was compelled to take up the B shares as well. Therefore the public cannot complain to-day that they were not also offered a rightful share in Iscor. It is therefore very clear that the public sector had the full opportunity of also sharing in Iscor’s management and profits.</p>

<p>To come back to the question of whether Iscor should be allowed to expand further or whether it should grow in such a way as to admit private undertakings as well. I also merely want to focus attention on a few small matters. Let us proceed from the supposition that it would be in the country’s interests to place Iscor in the hands of the private companies or to allow them admittance. What will have to happen then? The first thing that will have to happen is that the shares will have to be sold. Who is going to buy those shares? Those shares would be taken up by the person who makes the highest offer. Who would that be? It would be the Anglo-American Corporation. In other words, Iscor must be placed in the hands of Harry Oppenheimer. I do not know if this is what private initiative actually wants. I say that it is very clear that the highest bidder will get hold of that steel company. Why did the public not invest capital in Iscor in 1933 when the opportunity afforded itself? No, those were depression years and they did not want to risk their money in that undertaking. However, now that our steel industry is stabilized everyone is very anxious to share in it. One is grateful that the Government had the faith and trust at that time to establish Iscor, which has done pioneer work for the development of our industry in this country. It is also very important for such a key industry to remain in the hands of the Government. I wonder where the industrial development of this country would have been to-day if it had not been for the establishment of Iscor. With the economic development of our country and with the fact that Iscor furnishes about 75 per cent of our steel, there need be no fear that there will not be room for any other steel manufacturers to participate in the open market as well. It is also a fact that Iscor enjoys no protection from the Government. It must compete with any other steel manufacturing company it must compete with the open markets of the world. There is no special projection for this company. I think that Iscor has succeeded particularly well in is object, because if we think of the fact that the price of steel has increased tremendously during recent years; if we think that since 1952 the price of steel in the United Kingdom has increased by 45 per cent, in the U.S.A, by 43 per cent, in Australia by 63 per cent and in South Africa by 5.7 per cent, it is proof that Iscor has succeeded in building up an efficient industry.

<from><span class="col_6193-6194" refersTo="page_0244"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am certain that I speak for the whole of Natal when I say that we were very pleased indeed to hear the hon. the Minister’s announcement regarding the situation for the third Iscor. The link reaction is such that the whole of the province must benefit, not only the whole of Natal, but naturally also other areas towards the north. I have been very interested in seeing speculation in regard to the development in the Tugela River Basin following the lines of the planning by the Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission some years ago. Of course, it will go much further than that. It will go right down the valley of the Umfolozi River where the new line is being built from Richard’s Bay up to Vryheid and then up to the north. That will produce probably just as big a potential for development as even the Tugela Basin itself. But the development which has followed the statement by the hon. the Minister has produced reaction which, I think, does call for some questions to be put to the hon. the Minister at this stage. This is the first opportunity we have had since he made this announcement. I should like to express my concern over the reports that have appeared in the Press regarding the speculation in property which has been taking place in and around Newcastle over, according to the reports, the past two or three weeks, although I believe that there were quite important deals taking place prior to that. If the reports are correct, something like R2 million worth of property has changed hands during the past fortnight. An authority there who is in a position to give a worthwhile opinion has stated that the value of land in the vicinity has increased by 1.000 per cent during the past few weeks and that there has been a general increase in property values not only in the town, but in all these surrounding areas. I think, if this is so, it gives the appearance of there having been a leak in the information regarding the siting of that Iscor. I think that is a fair deduction to be drawn from it.</p>

<p>I appreciate the position in which a Department like the hon. the Minister’s Department finds itself where it is involved with an organization like Iscor with all its ramifications. Such an organization is a very big concern administratively with many branches and many facets and this development must be known to quite a large group of people. I accept that. I realize that it is impossible to keep that knowledge within a very small number of people. In the past it has been possible to keep these matters, I think, under the seal of secrecy. What I would like to ask the hon. the Minister is this. When was the decision actually made that the third Iscor would be at Newcastle? The hon. the Minister made a statement here speaking for the Government, and while presumably Iscor itself made the decision, I assume it made its decision in consultation with the Government. This is not a decision that could be made by Iscor itself; it had to be made in consultation with the Government. This fact is borne out by the statement issued by the hon. the Minister. My second question is, therefore, the following. Who in fact did make the decision? When was the decision made and who made the decision? If I am right in believing that this is a matter where the decision ought not to be made public, but kept just as secret as a budget prior to its delivery here by the hon. the Minister of Finance, and if it is a State matter of that importance because of the financial ramifications which would flow immediately from any prior disclosure of the intention of the appropriate authorities in regard to the final settlement of the development of the industry concerned, I want to ask what steps are. taken to see that in fact the secrecy is maintained? lust how, when steps are being taken to finalize a decision of this kind, is it ensured that that secrecy is maintained? As I say the facts are at our disposal, borne out by the reports in the Press over the week-end and by statements made by certain people in Natal, for example by a certain lawyer of whom it was said in the newspapers that he locked his door because he had some land and estate agents in his office with whom he was negotiating the completion of some documents which, at the time of the statement, required only finalization. The documents were ready and waiting just to get the go-ahead and this person could not be bothered. He was there closeted with the people who were completing these documents. This gives the impression to the outside world and the public that there was a leak of information and that somebody had acquired that information and that it was used for the private benefit of someone or other. It is not sufficient that in a matter of this kind the Department and all those involved in the matter should have retained the absolute greatest possible secrecy over the matter. That is not sufficient. If in spite of that, word has leaked out that it is possible for persons to make a personal benefit from their foreknowledge of the fact of where that industry was to be sited, then it seems to me that this calls for an investigation carded out at top level. This investigation should be carried out in the open by the finest possible authority that the Government can appoint for the purpose with the most scrupulous regard for everything being done in the open in the light of day, so that the whole matter can be investigated. Secrecy in itself and the desire to maintain secrecy and the honest sincere efforts of everybody who was officially involved in knowledge of the project, is not sufficient. The question of where the new Iscor was to go was a matter of immense financial benefit to anybody who could get that information even in a few hours in advance of the official notification by the hon. the Minister here in this House. He came, according to parliamentary practice, and I have no complaints on this score, and he made a public announcement here in this House. Fair enough, hut if it can be shown, and <i>prima facie</i> it looks as if it is so, that land <span class="col_6195-6196" refersTo="page_0245"/>speculation has taken place there, then it seems to me that it is in the interests of the industry and of public administration in South Africa that the fullest inquiry should be made to find out whether in fact there was a leak and whether private profits have been made as a result of prior knowledge of the fact. It has been said that many people looked upon it as inevitable that Newcastle would be the site for the new Iscor. My friend, the hon. member for King William’s Town, hoped that it would be in Berlin and other people believed that the North-Western Cape was entitled to it. While it is perfectly true that, as the hon. the Minister has said at the time when he made the announcement, that at Newcastle there were transport, labour, coal and other facilities available, particularly water in large quantities, that was not the only place. Even the fact that there was a town which could provide certain amenities and the fact that there was a settled community with all the facilities and amenities that go with a municipality such as we have at Newcastle, did not provide the answer. Those or similar conditions were available elsewhere. Nobody can guess what amount of money changed hands over the past few weeks in Newcastle apparently because of the fact that it was going to be chosen. It was impossible, and a speculator does not invest his money unless he is fairly certain that his money is going to come back to him with a profit attached to it. I ask the Minister please to tell us when this decision was made and who made it. Was secrecy supposed to be an ingredient of this operation, and if so, does he not believe that the cause of public standards of behaviour in South Africa will be well served by having an inquiry into the whole of the circumstances to see whether there was a leakage and whether profit has been made by individuals because of prior knowledge of what was contemplated.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to talk about Iscor, but I should like to say a few words about a matter which, to South-West Africa is as important, as Iscor, and that is the fishing industry. The fishing industry is of particular economic importance to South-West Africa because it is one of our pillars. For Walvis Bay itself the fishing industry is of course of vital importance and it is most essential that this industry be protected under all circumstances. I should like to mention a few figures. During 1966, 720,000 tons of sardines were caught: in 1967, 768,000 tons were caught; in 1968 catches amounted to 960,000 tons, plus another 96,000 tons of anchovies, besides the catches of the factory ships which amounted to 614,634 tons during 1968. In addition, there are still the catches of white fish, which include white fish catches along the coast of South Africa. In 1968, 2 million tons of white fish were caught. It is interesting to note that while 410,413 tons of sardines were caught in South African waters during 1968, catches in South-West Africa during 1968 amounted to 1,685,528 tons. What is interesting, is the fact that catches of sardines in the South African waters constituted only a quarter of catches in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>As far as the future is concerned, I have full confidence in this industry for the following reasons. The large quota for 1968 which I have just mentioned, was easily met, and as far as 1969 is concerned, catches have been very satisfactory. Another factor is that these fishing companies and the owners of factory ships have invested large amounts in Walvis Bay and in the ships, and they themselves cannot afford these resources to become exhausted. The fact that the factory ships themselves have decided not to catch any fish in the Walvis Bay waters, but to fish 60 miles to the north of Walvis Bay goes to show that they are also concerned as far as measures are concerned. A further factor is that the factories, and now also the factory ships themselves, have been allocated fixed quotas and, if necessary, the Government will intervene and take further measures against over-exploitation. Moreover, if the factories find that there are indications of over-exploitation, the factory owners themselves will take measures against it. What is more, I welcome the fact that the Department is taking immediate steps in view of the fact that the Government has taken over now. Dr. De Jager, head of the Division of Sea Fisheries, has already visited Walvis Bay with a view to co-ordinating a joint research programme in order to obtain greater efficiency as regards control. My experience of the industry has been that there has always been excellent co-operation between the industry and the Department and it is the aim of the Department that there should be a sound conservation policy, and because of this it is also being welcomed by the industry. Hence, everybody who has invested in the industry can be sure that all necessary measures will be taken for the protection of the industry.</p>

<p>As far as the marketing of the products is concerned, this does not create any problem at all. On the contrary. The industry is compelled to cut down its sales to certain countries this year. What is important to the industry, is that the price is even higher this year than it was last year. Consequently, when taking all factors into account, we have every reason to have full confidence in the future of this industry.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Omaruru expressed the view that all reasonable measures have been taken to protect the fishing industry and he referred in particular to the close co-operation that exists between the Department and the area he represents, which now falls under our Fisheries department. He referred also to the fact that the fish quotas laid down for South-West Africa last year and so far this year have been easily met, but I am not sure whether he meant that under the circumstances there should be an increase of these quotas.</p>

<p>May I say that attention has been drawn from time to time by people in this House and outside to the necessity for conserving our fish resources. The most recent plea outside this House came from no less a person than Mr. D. G. Malan, the chairman of the Fisheries Development Corporation, and this is what he says in his annual report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No less an authority than the Department of Fisheries of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations has indicated that the present rate of expansion of world fish production cannot be maintained indefinitely, and possibly not for more than another 10 to 15 years.</block>

<p>He continues later in his report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question arises as to the manner in which we are to protect threatened stocks from foreign fleets committed to planned increases in production and unlikely to react favourably to appeals for a limitation of catches or restraint of effort in the interest of stock management.</block>

<p>I have myself previously raised in this House the question of the width of our territorial sea. I think it was last year or the year before that I asked the Minister whether the time had not arrived for us to extend our territorial sea from six miles to 12 miles. He said that the matter had been investigated, but that it had not been found feasible. I wish to make a further appeal to the Minister to-day that earnest consideration be given to extending our territorial waters to the limit that obtains in so many other countries overseas, namely 12 miles. I should like to quote very briefly from the 1967 U.S.A. Department of the Interior’s minute on the action of the Argentine Government. The Argentine has unilaterally extended its maritime jurisdiction over adjacent waters to 200 nautical miles, and dealing with the seabed and subsoil of the submarine zones they have extended their jurisdiction up to the 200-meter isobar or beyond that depth where exploitation of the natural resources is feasible. This is a practical suggestion that I make to the Minister namely extend our territorial sea. Apart from that, there is plenty of authority for saying that we can create around our coast and outside our territorial waters maritime conservation zones, as has been done elsewhere. We should bear in mind particularly the extent of our continental shelf off our coast. I would like to remind the Minister that in the area between Mossel Bay and Hangklip we have a continental shelf of 70 miles in extent; off our west coast it is approximately 36 miles, and off our east coast 15 miles. My purpose in suggesting this is not that we should lay claim to territorial authority over the continental shelf, but that we should certainly claim control over the right of entry by foreigners, making it conditional on the observance of conservation measures laid down by South Africa. In other words, foreigners should not be allowed into maritime conservation zones off our coast, save and except by permit and on their undertaking to observe conservation measures which we lay down.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I have myself suggested in this House that the time is long past when South Africa should have taken the initiative in convening an international conference to obtain, if possible, a convention or an agreement covering the South Atlantic and portion of the Indian Ocean off our coasts. All other sea areas with sea resources of major consequence are subject to convention, and the time is long past that we should have a similar situation here.</p>

<p>I should now like to pass on briefly to the fishing inquiry which is at the moment being held. In response to a question I asked recently, the Minister said that the fishing inquiry would last for another two years at least, and assuming that the report which that inquiry is to produce after it had concluded its sittings takes another year, it is likely that there would be another three years passing before we have adequate information available to us, or firm foundations on which we can make the necessary regulations which the Commission may deem fit. I would suggest to the Minister that although he replied to me that interim reports would be made available if necessary, he should make it a top priority not only that interim reports issued by that Commission should be made available very soon but that regulations suggested by that Commission should be promulgated as and when the Commission thinks fit.</p>

<p>One other matter which I should like to bring to the Minister’s attention is our attendance at oceanography conferences. There was a conference held earlier this year at Brighton, and while our country sent an observer to that conference, we did not in fact take any leading part in the deliberations at that conference. It seems to me that our fishing industry is not being given the necessary financial stimulus, or the necessary research facilities which it should have. I would refer in this connection to the fact that in America last year they budgeted for no less than R567 million for research into the marine resources off the American coast, that they had 55,000 people actively engaged in fishing research, and that they have no fewer than 350 ships undertaking oceanographic research.</p>

<p>So far I have dealt with matters concerning the fishing industry in general. I should now like to pass on, because this is a matter which falls under the Minister’s department, to the specific question of the commercial harbours off our coasts, and more particularly those in the Southern Peninsula. As the Minister is aware, we have in False Bay two commercial harbours which have limited private facilities also. At Gordon’s Bay there must be some 40 boats, and as he knows the harbour there is also used by the S.A. Naval College, I <span class="col_6199-6200" refersTo="page_0247"/>think it is fair to say that there are no further facilities available to the public or to commercial enterprises. Then we have at Kalk Bay a small harbour which has approximately 60 boats. Most of those boats are 34 feet to 47 feet in length, and with a beam of 10 to 15 feet. At Simonstown there is a very limited anchorage available for commercial boats and also for small craft used by amateurs and semi-amateurs.</p>

<p>There is, I believe, a great demand for further harbour facilities in the False Bay area, not only of a commercial nature, but also of a private and recreational nature. The existing two harbours are just not adequate to meet the demand. As the hon. the Minister is aware, there has been an agitation in the Press for some time for increased harbour facilities. The local authorities concerned support the building of a new harbour or else the extension of existing facilities. They are supported by the Navy, which naturally benefits from further maritime facilities for the training of our young people. My contention is that rather than provide a new harbour in False Bay, the harbour at Kalk Bay should be extended, and in this connection I should like to bring certain interesting matters to the Minister’s attention. As long ago as the turn of the century&#x2014; in fact in 1902&#x2014;there was a survey and general investigation by an engineer, a Mr. Methven. Mr. Methven’s task was undertaken at the behest of the Cape Government to inquire into the suitability of a site in the False Bay area for a harbour, the nature of such a site, the extent of such a site and the cost of the provision of a harbour. He in fact examined the whole coast from Simonstown to Muizenberg, and his conclusion was that Kalk Bay, although small, was the most suitable site. He made a very detailed investigation: he saw the fishermen concerned&#x2014;the fishermen at Simonstown, the fishermen at Glencairn, and the fishermen at Kalk Bay&#x2014;and he discussed with them particularly the prevalence of gales and the violence of the sea. Feeling that their knowledge was a little too local, he also consulted Dr. Gilchrist, who was the marine biologist of the Cape Colony Government, and he assured Mr. Methven that the comparatively small amount of fishing carried on was out of all proportion to the quantity of fish which in fact was available. Dealing with the requirements for a harbour in the area, Mr. Methven laid down certain essentials; he said that there had to be sufficient space to prevent any overcrowding of boats; that there had to be sufficient depth at all times and in all weathers in such a projected harbour; that there had to be slipways and facilities for nets, for the landing of fish and for the gear of fishermen. More particularly there had to be direct rail communication, and, furthermore, and most important, an entrance should be constructed for the harbour, which was accessible in all weathers and at all times.

<p>Unfortunately I was not here all the time while the hon. member for King William’s Town was speaking&#x2014;there was somebody who wanted to see me very urgently&#x2014;but I did hear part of his speech. As I understood the hon. member, he pleaded for greater financial benefits for industrialists to encourage them to go to the border area, that is, the border area of the Transkei and the Ciskei. I take it that I understood the hon. member correctly. In other words, the hon. member pleaded for greater benefits in the border areas.</p>

They reject this policy and then they come along and plead for the application of this policy and for it to be applied more effectively and on a larger scale. Sir, surely one cannot have it both ways: one cannot say that one does not want the policy, that it is a pernicious policy for South Africa, and, on the other hand, ask for greater benefits under the policy.

Sir, can one on the one hand scare the industrialists of South Africa by telling them that it would be totally unwise of them to go to the Border area; that they would be going there to lose their money, <span class="col_6201-6202" refersTo="page_0248"/>because they would be placing themselves in the hands of a hostile black labour force, and on the other hand reproach the Government that this policy is not yielding more results?

<p>In 1961 no new industries came to East London; in 1962 no new industries came to East London; in 1963 no new industries came to East London, and then we gradually began to see the fruits of the policy announced in 1961. In 1964 four new industries were established there; in 1965 two new industries, in 1966 six new industries and in 1967 five new industries. The amount of money spent there on extensions of existing industrial buildings in 1964 exceeded R1 million; in 1964 it was almost R2 million, in 1966 more than R1,200,000 and in 1967 R616,000. The amount of land sold by the municipality for extensions to existing industries, has increased progressively over the years. In 1967 additional land for expansion purposes was sold to 14 existing industries, and to-day no industrialist can find a single industrial site to buy in East London; there is simply none to be had, as all of them have been occupied under this policy which that side of the House has condemned so consistently, and we now have to ask them urgently to make additional industrial land available.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have just heard the set piece from the hon. the Deputy Minister on the development of border industries. They keep on using the term &#x201C;the development of the border industries&#x201D; as though this was something unique in South Africa and something different from any other development. What is it a part of? It is simply a part of the decentralization of industry.</p>

<p>They have done everything possible to make decentralization difficult. How does the Government help decentralization? By giving the infrastructure, by providing transport and, if they can, certain concessions in finance. That has happened not only in South Africa, it has happened in every country. What the hon. the Deputy Minister has been talking about is a section of decentralization of industry. We have just had an example of this now in the case of Iscor going to Newcastle; that is an example of decentralization of industry. To come along with this story that this is unique, that East London is different from anything else in the country, is utter nonsense. What we should like the Government to do is to give better facilities. When we had the Tomlinson Report and it was agreed that we should develop the reserves, as we then called the areas which are now called the homelands, our proposal was that white capital should be allowed to go there to develop the reserves, but the Government turned it down. They issued a White Paper saying that they would never agree to it and what are they doing now? They are offering inducements to capital and industry to go to the reserves. They are to-day nibbling at what was United Party policy at that time.</p>

<p>They do not go far enough. Sir, this Government is to blame for the years that the locusts have eaten since the Tomlinson Report until to-day. They are responsible for this. Sir, I want to go a step further on another matter which was not dealt with by the hon. the Deputy Minister. We in South Africa often say that we are a country that encourages private industry; that we are not a socialist country; but we are pretty near it. We have more Government enterprises than some wholly developed countries like the United States of America; we have a number of them. We have the I.D.C. We are all very proud of the I.D.C., hon. members on the other side tell us. The I.D.C. goes into business in a big way. We are told that the I.D.C., as originally established, was going to sell its assets in due course to the public, dispose of them and then help new companies. What are they doing now? They are going into finance. They have established National Industrial Selections. They are going in with the big people. Sometimes in raising money, to their horror, I have found them in the company of such companies as Anglo American and the Corner House. They were guaranteeing a flotation together with them. In other words, they are rubbing shoulders with the big people that used to be condemned by the other side! What I want to come to, is this: Since we are in big industry, for example Iscor and the other great producers, I want to ask the hon. Minister of Finance, what dividend is he getting out of this? What is the taxpayer getting? We know that if a company shows a profit, naturally it is taxed under the companies tax, which the hon. the Minister stipulates in his Budget. He has raised it slightly again. He keeps on doing that. But I want to know, why do these companies not declare a dividend to the Government?</p>

<p>I want to know, Sir, what relief the hon. the Minister is giving the taxpayer of South Africa. Does Iscor declare a dividend that it gives to the shareholders? Who are the shareholders of South Africa? Who are the shareholders of Iscor? The taxpayer! We are their representatives. We have their proxies, and we want to know when they are declaring a dividend. Why should we introduce new taxation in this country? Why should we raise taxation? It is not necessary if these companies pay their share of the taxation. When do they come to us? Why do they not come to us and declare dividends? They do not do that; they only come when they want <span class="col_6205-6206" refersTo="page_0250"/>fresh capital. They have to come when they want fresh capital. But the hon. the Minister appoints the directors. When we ask questions about these enterprises, so many of them, he says that is not his affair. It is rather like the Broadcasting Corporation. &#x201C;That is not my affair; my job is simply to appoint the directors.&#x201D; Having appointed the directors, we ask, as we have asked for 20 years, who is responsible to this House? Who is responsible to the shareholders? These enterprises are being conducted by the Government. I think the time has arrived when we should have a showdown on this. Here we have the hon. the Deputy Minister coming along with his little piddling bit of border industry, which is a small item in the development of South Africa. He has something which he can take to the Eastern Province when he is in a jam. But that is not what we are discussing. We are discussing the interest of the taxpayer in South Africa and the development of the country as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish one could rely on what advice the hon. member for Kensington actually wants to give now. To-day he objected to National Selections and Industrial Selections. But he himself defended them last year and said that this was the right course for the I.D.C. to adopt, that it should make its share investments available to the public in that way. At that time he defended them. To-night he cast doubts on them and said that this was not the right way.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member defended them at the time. He was satisfied with them last year. But the hon. member says that the I.D.C. is expanding. According to the latest annual report that was tabled, it appears that, whereas financing in general, including special projects, amounted to Rill million in the previous year&#x2014;i.e. in June, 1967&#x2014; it only amounted to R96 million in 1968, i.e. a year later. Therefore there was a decrease of R8 million as regards investments in the I.D.C.; investments therefore showed a decrease. The hon. member ought to welcome that. But apparently he did not look at the report, because he said that they were carrying on and becoming bigger and bigger. Larger investments have in fact been made in other sectors, such as in border area development. The amount invested in respect of assistance granted in regard to decentralization showed an increase of R6 million, but taken as a whole its assets showed a decrease. In 1967 its total investment interests amounted to R286 million. Last year it was R278 million, in spite of the fact that more had been invested in border area development. Therefore the <b>I.D.C</b> has fewer investments at the moment than it had in the previous year. <b>When</b> State procurations were curtailed and the State reduced its own investments, they were asked to invest less and to assist in exercising a restraining influence on the economy. According to the statements which were made available to us, this did happen.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast referred to the announcement I had made in regard to the third Iscor, and said it was clear that there had been speculation. Consequently the hon. member wanted to know whether there had not been a leakage in this regard. It is clear that that was not the only place where there was speculation. There was speculation at Newcastle, but there was as much speculation in East London, Saldanha, Berlin and Richard’s Bay. There was speculation at quite a number of places. Iscor made a very through investigation into the various places where the third Iscor might possibly be located. Negotiations were conducted in that process. According to one of the statements there were negotiations with the Newcastle City Council. Discussions were not conducted with the city council only; Iscor also negotiated with other city councils, and, what is more, it was months ago that Iscor took an option on land, not only in Newcastle, but also at other places.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that that was also the case at Vryheid. I know about other places where they also took options, for the very reason that they wanted to go into the matter. By the time an announcement was made, no actions could be taken. After all, one does expect there to be speculation. That is why they took options at various places in advance. They tried to conceal this by not always taking them in their own name. They had to negotiate with city councils so as to obtain options on land before the matter was settled. If this were to be done after the matter had been settled, the prices would have been considerably higher. There is another factor as well. Approximately three weeks ago, or perhaps longer, it was made public that Iscor had made an offer for Amcor shares. Iscor holds approximately 48 per cent of the share interest in Amcor. It made an offer for the remaining shares in Amcor. It was a public announcement. I can understand that this could possibly have given rise to more speculation. But at that stage the matter had not yet been decided at all, not even when that offer was made. But this is a conclusion at which people could possibly have arrived, i.e. that since there was this offer for shares, there was a strong possibility of it being located there. Basically this decision was not taken by Iscor. Iscor made its recommendations in regard to the various places. The final decision was not taken by Iscor, although Iscor, together with its staff and directors, knew what their recommendations were. They were submitted to a full board of directors. Officials worked out the implications and cost factors. Negotiations were conducted so <span class="col_6207-6208" refersTo="page_0251"/>as to ascertain what they would be. All of these are things they had to do. From the nature of the case it is not possible for such negotiations to be conducted without people being aware of them. But even they did not know where it would be located. That decision was taken by the Cabinet. That Cabinet decision was taken 12 days ago.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was decided at the time that it would remain a secret. It did remain a secret, and even my own Secretary knew nothing about it until I told him last Tuesday or Wednesday that I had to start drafting a statement. The statement itself was drafted in my office and was only completed on Friday morning. On Friday I decided, in consultation with the Chairman of Iscor, to make the decision known. At the House of Assembly it was not even known that I would make a statement, until about half an hour before the time, when I started negotiating with the Whips about fitting in the statement here. Only then did they know that an announcement would be made. As regards the Cabinet, it was decided that it would remain a secret. Even the Chairman and the General Manager of Iscor only heard about this decision last week, and they only heard about it when finality had already been reached. If there had been speculation, it was definitely not based on a decision taken by the Cabinet. This decision was taken 12 days ago, and according to those reports which were quoted, that speculation had been going on for a long time. As I said, I am aware that there was speculation at other places as well. Therefore I am not prepared to accept at this stage that information leaked out. If <i>bona fide</i> proof can be furnished to the effect that there was in fact a leakage on the strength of which people took certain steps, I shall be prepared to go into the matter. Then I shall be prepared to consider it. If any evidence can be submitted&#x2014;hon. members do not even have to raise it here&#x2014;I shall consider taking steps, because we are as anxious about seeing to it that no leakages occur. I may just add that this decision was not even known to the other directors, except Dr. Van Eck, who heard about it last week.</p>

<p>Other aspects were also mentioned. The question of border area development was raised by several hon. members on the other side of the House. The hon. members for Parktown, Pinetown and King William’s Town referred to border area development. The fact of the matter is that it is the Government’s policy to go on implementing decentralization and granting assistance to these border areas. Assistance has to be granted in order to make it inviting and attractive for industrialists to establish themselves in the border areas. This is not a policy which is supported by the other side. The hon. member for King William’s Town pleaded for assistance to be granted to the border areas. And yet it is not their official policy that this form of assistance should be granted. In spite of that he asks for more assistance to be granted to those areas. That is, after all, inconsistent with their policy.</p>

<p>I shall come to East London in a moment. That has never been the standpoint of that side of the House. Even in this debate hon. members have said that it should be done on an economic basis and that there should be no other considerations. Hon. members also referred to the fact that reference was made in the I.D.C. report to 23,500 Bantu who had to be employed, whereas in the report of the Permanent Committee reference was made to a figure of 9,000. They wanted to know why there was such a difference. I want to point out that in its annual report, to which reference was made, the I.D.C. made calculations in respect of the number of Bantu who had to be provided with employment in the border areas. They based their calculations on the fact that they were dealing with the natural increase in population. According to the report of the Permanent Committee the natural increase is 35,000 per year, of whom 9,000 have to be absorbed into industries. They are, therefore, referring to the natural increase, but the I.D.C. went further than that and made a calculation of the total number of Bantu labourers in the Bantu homelands. They calculated the total percentage of Bantu who had to be absorbed into these industries. According to the census of 1960 approximately 12 per cent was absorbed into industry. But they foresee that this number may increase. That is why they increased the percentage from 12 per cent to 23 per cent in their calculations. Therefore this is virtually a doubling of the number of Bantu employed in industry in 1960. Let us assume that this percentage may rise. However, here they accepted a maximum of nearly 23 per cent who have to be absorbed into industry. Furthermore, they made a calculation of the total labour force, including migratory labour which is being used at present. They accepted that provision would have to be made for those migratory labourers in the Bantu homelands or in border areas. <span class="col_6209-6210" refersTo="page_0252"/>That is why they arrived at this total of 23,000. However, I want to say that this assumption, i.e. that there will be no migratory labour after 1971, is merely a theoretical assumption. In consultation with the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development I can also confirm that there is no such intention of laying down such a policy, i.e. to allow no migratory labour from the homelands as from 1971. Therefore they arrived at a very large figure in determining what their share should be. They ascertained what their share had been over the past number of years as far as employment was concerned. The I.D.C. has played a very important part in promoting employment in these border industries. Over the past seven years in which 49,000 Bantu were provided with employment in border areas, the I.D.C. granted assistance to industries which were responsible for 23,000 of that 49,000. The I.D.C. has therefore played a very important role in the development of those border areas. On the basis of that ratio they arrived at this further figure, i.e. that if in future they had to make provision in the same ratio, their share would have to be to provide 11,000 with employment. They also calculated that in order to effect this provision of employment, the I.D.C.’s contribution over that period amounted to R73 million. On that basis they calculated that as from 1971 they would have to contribute approximately R27 million. I have pointed out that they took the absolute maximum. They assumed that there would be no migratory labour and that the percentage would rise a great deal. Their contribution was calculated on that basis, and that is also the basis on which they calculate that they, along with the private sector and the public sector, will have to invest R80 million per year in the border areas. However, they also pointed out that this would involve a transfer of 20 per cent of the total investment made in industry. This is the reason for this difference.</p>

<p>Then they indicated at the same time what the demand for industrial sites would be. They concentrated on a few places. Those few places are, in the first instance, the Ciskei and the Berlin Flats. They indicated that 170 morgen of industrial land had to be available by 1971; by 1976 this had to be 800 morgen. Apart from the development at Newcastle, development is already in progress at Ladysmith. Land has been bought there, and they are engaged in subdividing it. With the assistance of the I.D.C. a new industrial centre will come into being there. The same thing will happen at Pietersburg. Reference was also made here to Brits, and assistance will also be granted at Mafeking.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has already referred to assistance which is being granted in regard to East London. Since 1960 the number of industries established in the East London area with border area assistance, has provided employment to more than 5,000 Bantu in that area. However, since the additional assistance was announced last year, there has been a major increase in that area. Assistance has been granted to 59 industries which wanted to establish themselves in the East London area, these industries are capable of providing employment to 2,700 Bantu and 317 Whites. In the East London area at the moment industrial sites with railway facilities are no longer available. East London has virtually reached full industrial settlement. The only remaining area is Berlin. As a result of this subdivision and the assistance granted by the I.D.C. and the Department of Planning, 500 acres of industrial land will be available by the end of this year. They also have a right to an additional 3,000 acres. Provision is therefore being made at present for additional industrial land in that area. We thoroughly appreciate the problem which is being experienced as regards the provision of employment. But I can also say that there has of late been strong indications of an upward trend as regards the concentration of industries in these border areas. I have with me the report of the permanent committee for January, 1969. The industries themselves have to decide whether they are going to avail themselves of the assistance that has been allocated to them. As far as Brits itself is concerned, there were seven industries to which assistance was allocated at the January meeting; at East London there were six, at Ladysmith one, Pietersburg two, Rosslyn three, Pietermaritzburg one, Mafeking one, Empangeni one, and there was even one at Bothaville. This is an indication of the degree of decentralization which has taken place and the extent to which there is growing interest in the establishment of border areas, especially since we allocated additional assistance to these undertakings last year.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown wanted to know what the position was in regard to Cabora-Bassa. I want to tell the hon. member that as far as Cabora-Bassa is concerned, basic negotiations between Escom and the Government of Portugal are taking place. As for Escom itself, they have indicated, with the approval of the Government, that they are prepared to take electric power from that scheme at prices which are the same as those for which Escom can generate it here. The undertaking was that if they could supply power at the same price, Escom would make use of it. If South Africa does not take the power generated at Cabora-Bassa, it is completely impossible for this scheme to be put into operation. We are prepared to take that power. In the course of years this may even increase, but the electric power we shall get from Cabora-Bassa will only meet a minor percentage of our total needs. As regards the tenders, negotiations were conducted with a consortium which included a considerable South African interest. There were indications on the part of the Portuguese Government that they were not sure that they would be able to carry on with that consortium. There were indications that they might reopen negotiations. In addition there is South African interest in some of the other consortiums, but that is not our affair, as neither the Government <span class="col_6211-6212" refersTo="page_0253"/>itself nor Escom concerned itself with which tenderer was accepted by the Government of Portugal. That is entirely their own affair. We gave indications as to how much power we would use. The percentage of the power we can use, is by far and away the greatest percentage; they themselves can only use a small percentage of the power. We are keeping to what we offered them, but they have not yet told us definitely that they accept our proposal; so far there has been a great deal of negotiation between us, but the ball is in their court. If they can agree with their contractors to carry on with the scheme, we arc prepared to take the electric power which will make it possible for them to construct this Cabora-Bassa scheme and to do so in an economic manner.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown also wanted to know from me what had happened to the undertaking given by the Government to Atlas. The position is that Atlas was started by a private company and that this corporation included considerable private interests, as well as the interest of the I.D.C. The I.D.C. itself invested R3 million in this corporation. A guarantee was given that certain work would in course of time be done at a 10 per cent profit. The hon. member referred to the fact that these shares had been taken over at par by Armcor. The hon. member knows what happened to the undertaking in regard to the profit. The position is that that margin of profit has been observed as far as the contracts of the State are concerned. Atlas paid a dividend to its shareholders; I think it was in February or March. A dividend was therefore paid out to the shareholders before the takeover at par.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown also referred to the position in regard to foreign capital. He wanted to know what our attitude was as regards the participation of foreign capital. I, as well as some of my other colleagues, have already stated at meetings we addressed on previous occasions that we still adhere to the view that foreign capital was welcome. Foreign investors are not forbidden to invest here, but we have also made it clear that we prefer foreign permanent capital investment to be made in partnership with South African capital. By that we mean the whole private sector. Just as is the case with South African entrepreneurs, foreign entrepreneurs are free to approach even the I.D.C. for assistance. I have already referred to that. No demands are made upon them. The hon. member wanted to know what the percentage is. Our standpoint is that if it could be 50 per cent, we shall not say no. The greater the South African percentage, the more we welcome that sort of partnership developing here.</p>

<p>The hon. member also wanted to know whether we were encouraging this foreign capital to the border areas only. The fact of the matter is that in terms of our Government policy we are trying to encourage as many industries as possible to go to the border areas. This is not always possible, and we do not make any demands on them as far as this is concerned, as long as they clear up the matter with the Department of Planning as far as it concerns the Physical Planning Act itself.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown referred here to the conservation policy. As far as our fisheries are concerned, the boundaries are already 12 miles. But then one has to do with co-operation which has to be obtained from governments. There are states which have extended this to 100 miles or even to the Continental Shelf. Even now there are other countries which are fishing in our waters or just beyond our boundaries, and which have already intimated very definitely that they are not prepared to accept the Continental Shelf as our boundary as far as fishing is concerned. They have also intimated that they will not recognize a boundary which is further out to sea than the 12-mile boundary. Hon. members will appreciate that there is not much point in this if we do it in a one-sided manner and if the fishing vessels of other countries are not prepared to recognize it. This would create endless problems for us. Reference was also made here to the conservation policy. In that respect we have already taken steps to curtail the activities of factory ships. It has also been suggested that there should be a national convention to smooth out these matters. We have for quite a number of years been engaged in talks on an international level in order to establish a convention for the South Atlantic Ocean. These discussions have reached a quite advanced stage, and it is anticipated that towards October a conference will be held to see whether there is unanimity about the possible points in regard to which negotiations have already taken place. I therefore hope that as regards this form of protection and conservation, there will be a greater measure of clarity before the end of this year.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the fisheries report and said that it would take two years or more. We have also appointed a commission member for South-West now. Since the fishing industry in South-West will be taken over by this Administration as from 1st April, it was felt that the problem experienced by South-West should be investigated along with our own problems. An additional member for South-West was designated, and therefore this commission will extend their activities. They have already taken a great deal of evidence here in our Cape waters and will shortly do the same in South-West. I may tell the hon. member that we have already obtained the first interim report of this fisheries commission a week ago and that it is being examined. It will, as I promised, be considered and it may still be tabled, but it is in addition not impossible that we may act on this interim report. However, the report is still being considered by the Department. The hon. member referred to commercial harbours and wanted to know whether facilities could not be provided at Fish Hoek, Kalk Bay, or Gordon’s Bay for <span class="col_6213-6214" refersTo="page_0254"/>private and recreation purposes&#x2014;we are prepared to go into this matter, and are prepared to help, provided that such facilities do not interfere with the fishing industry&#x2014;or, alternatively, whether such facilities should not be provided when extensions are considered.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Omaruru referred to South-West. This is an important area which has been added to our administration, and I can give the hon. member the assurance that talks are in progress. In conjunction with the South-West Administration visits will also be paid to South-West by Fishcor and by members of our Department and, it is hoped, also by the Deputy Minister in order that closer acquaintance may be established with the important fishing industry of South-West. The hon. member for Florida, is well as the hon. member for Wonderboom, referred to the importance of developing the border areas. These were positive contributions and I thank these hon. members for them. I think I have now dealt with the main points mentioned here by hon. members.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to continue my representations to the hon. the Minister for the extension of the existing harbour at Kalk Bay. I was not pleading for the extension of the harbour at Gordon’s Bay, as he thought. That is a completely different matter. In making my representations I said that the engineer who investigated the question of the providing of a harbour at Kalk Bay at the turn of the century made a very thorough investigation. He discussed the position with fishermen and other authorities before he made his report. In his report he maintained that there should be two sea walls. The one to the South should be particularly strong, because the prevailing winds were from the South-East, but there should also be one to the North, as he called it in his report, because there were also strong Eastern winds. He undertook certain float observations and these observations failed to find any sand-bearing currents so there was no likelihood that silting would take place. He said that if there should be any shoaling, in other words, if rocks were to be washed onto the seabed of the harbour a dipper or a grab crane on a barge would be sufficient to cope with them. What is interesting is that the proposal he made for the harbour would have cost in those days, namely 1902, £45,000. His report was referred to a parliamentary Select Committee constituted at that time. This committee considered his report and heard evidence on the need and desirability for a harbour at Kalk Bay. They took evidence from doctors, because the health of the fishermen was suffering as a result of their having to carry heavy wooden boats up the slope of the beach. Ministers of religion also gave evidence. Dr. Gilchrist, the Marine Biologist at the time, gave evidence in support of the building of a harbour, while the fishermen themselves also appeared before the committee.</p>
