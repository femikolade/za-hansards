<p>Mr. Speaker, with your leave I should like to indicate to the House the business to be dealt with by the House next week. In addition I should like to give the House the dates on which certain business of the House will be commenced with. Firstly, as regards the various appropriations, the position is as follows: The Part Appropriation will be presented on 17th February. The Railway Budget will be presented on 5th March, while the Post Office Budget will come before the House on 19th March. In connection with the Post Office Budget I want to say that the debate will not be adjourned after the Minister&#x2019;s Budget Speech, as is the custom in the case of the Main and Railway Budgets. The debate will be proceeded with immediately.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Since it is not worth the trouble to adjourn; there is not so much to be studied. The Main Budget will be presented on 26th March. The House will adjourn on 28th March and resume on 8th April. The Budget debate will then commence on 8th April.</p>

<p>As regards next week&#x2019;s business, the order of our business, on the basis of to-day&#x2019;s Order Paper, will be as follows: My colleagues must please write it down too! We are starting on Monday with Order of the Day No. 14 and after that we shall consider Nos. 15, 6, 9, 13, 18, 19, 20, 22, 7, 12, 16, 17, 21 and 24.

All traders in milk and other foodstuffs and all contact cases were immunized. Control was exercised over business premises of dealers in milk and other foodstuffs to ensure hygienic standards. Water supply sources were chlorinated and an appeal was made to the inhabitants by means of a loudspeaker to use only treated water. All latrines were treated with residual insecticides to prevent possible transmission by flies. Health education was directed to the population on personal and food hygiene and sanitation. A Bantu health inspector who was acting in this area on a full-time basis assisted in this education and in case finding, reporting and arranging for medical examinations. A house-to-house investigation was carried out by a White technical assistant to trace deaths and render reports thereon. Regular inspections have been carried out by officers of the local regional office of the Department of Health and a medical officer of the Department&#x2019;s head office visited the area twice on my instructions and has reported to me.</li></ol></li>

<li>(2) This position will not change if the telephone system of the Durban Corporation were taken over. As indicated in my statements of the 5th and the 19th March, 1968, the difference in the cost of telephone calls from Durban to Pietermaritzburg and from Pietermaritzburg to Durban is due to the different methods for the metering of calls at the two centres.

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since Monday we have been dealing with this motion of no confidence which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition felt himself called upon to move against the Government. We have had a discussion and once more I make so bold as to say that it has not become clear to any objective observer why any person, even my hon. friend opposite, should not have confidence in this Government. The reply to that <span class="col_0349-0350" refersTo="page_0193"/>question was not forthcoming. Perhaps the hon. member was motivated by the fact that he had stated in his New Year message that the voters were calling upon him, so that it is for that reason that he moved the motion of no confidence in the Government. With all due respect I want to tell my hon. friend that I think he did not hear properly. As far as this aspect of the matter is concerned, we of course heard once again, and we have been hearing this for years from the hon. member for Yeoville, that the people have become disillusioned, that the voters no longer want us, and that they are in fact queuing up, as they did in Vereeniging that year the hon. member had the misunderstanding to lose the election there, to welcome him as the new member newly elected for Vereeniging. It was not to welcome him, but to bid him farewell.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, as I have said, we need not speculate about these matters. It is easy for me, from my side, to declare that the people have confidence in the Government. It is as easy for anyone on the opposite side to declare that the people do not have confidence in the Government. However, as has been stated, we have certain barometers by means of which we can ascertain whether or not the voters of South Africa have confidence in the Government. The best barometer is of course an election such as the one we had in 1966. The result of this election is fresh in the memory of my hon. friend the Leader of the Opposition. I want to set his mind at rest immediately. If I heard correctly, he was one of those who made references to an early election. I can understand the problem my hon. friend has when it comes to an election. He knows that something is going to hit him, but he does not know when it is going to hit him. However, I can set his mind at rest. I know of no circumstance which will bring about an early election. As I see it, the next election will take place at the normal time. Mr. Speaker, we had that election, and the reply was given on that occasion. But in any democratic country by-elections are held after an election and then one is able to judge very easily whether or not the electorate still has confidence in the Government concerned. In fact, they are the best barometer one can have in that connection. It so happens that since the general election was held in 1966 we have had eight by-elections for this House, and for the sake of the record it is perhaps a good thing to note what happened. The first was held in Heidelberg. My hon. friend did not put up a fight; his ally, C. F. van der Merwe, did nut up a fight. Then there was the by-election in Johannesburg (West); my hon. friend put up a fight, with very unfortunate results for himself. Next the election in Worcester was held, and once again my hon. friend put up a fight. After that there were elections in Potgietersrus, Bloemfontein (West) and Bethlehem &#x2026;</p>

<p>What happened in Worcester?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know that a Nationalist M.P. is representing the voters of Worcester. It is interesting to note, Mr. Speaker, that the election in Pretoria (West) was held after we had had three unopposed by-elections, and apparently the question at issue was who was in fact the strongest&#x2014;the United Party or the Van der Merwes. Then they both fought it out and the Van der Merwes came second. [Interjections.] My hon. friend and I are both right. They came an over-all third; as far as the Opposition were concerned, they came second. After my hon. friend had heard the voice calling, according to his New Year&#x2019;s Day message, there was Graaff-Reinet. The by-election took place the day before yesterday, and my hon. friend did not put up a fight. Consequently, I maintain that if we apply that objective criterion, then even my hon. friend will concede, if we look at that barometer, that there is no indication of any kind whatsoever that there is any lack of confidence in this Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are now dealing with this motion of no confidence. It afforded my hon. friend the opportunity (a) to criticize our policy and (b) to state his alternative in this regard. The motion of no confidence caused quite a good deal of speculation. There has been a great deal of discussion and a great deal has been written about it. There are people who believed that this was going to be the debate of the year. I do not think it has been. Nevertheless a great deal has been written about it. <i>Inter alia,</i> things have been written about the alternative policy of my hon. friend. One person who wrote about it is the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. To be specific, in the magazine <i>New Nation</i> of February of this year he wrote an article in which the following paragraph appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Opposition can now recover ground, and there is no better time and place from which to operate than Parliament. The United Party will have to erase the impression that it has no meaningful alternative.</block>

<p>And then follows an extremely interesting sentence&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, I did not. I read it precisely as it stands here. I want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville again that he must not quarrel with me. He must quarrel with his hon. friend there, because he is an expert on opportunism. What the hon. member for Bezuidenhout does not know about opportunism is not worth knowing. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, we have now heard the attacks made by hon. members on the opposite side, but before coming to them I want to deal with a few incidental matters which were raised by certain hon. members on the opposite side.</p>

<p>I must refer to what the hon. member for South Coast said in regard to the hon. member for Klip River, the leader of the National Party in Natal. Let me say at once that I do not begrudge the hon. member for South Coast an iota of the little political advantage he thought he could derive from that matter. I wish him every joy with it. I am also aware that the hon. member for South Coast referred in rather disparaging terms to the Natal leader of the National Party, the hon. member for Klip River. I do not think the hon. member for South Coast had any reason for doing so. The hon. member is himself a leader of a party.</p>

<p>His party has not flourished since he became their leader in Natal in 1948. But, Sir, for the sake of the record I must just rectify what the hon. member said in that connection. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have looked in vain through the records in this regard since Union &#x2026;</block>

<p>His reference here is to the fact that the hon. member for Klip River was not included in the Cabinet immediately after he was elected as leader&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have looked in vain through the records in this regard since Union to find whether the leader of the party in power in any province was not put into the Cabinet when he became the leader of the party in that province. I have not yet found a case where this has not been done. I admit that I cannot say that my researches have been completely exhaustive. I have not approached any of the authorities in this regard, so I may well be wrong, but for the past 25 or 30 years this has certainly not happened.</block>

<p>As my hon. friend knows, this is of course not correct. My hon. friend knows that the late Mr. Havenga was Leader in Natal until his retirement from politics in 1954. Upon his retirement from politics in 1954 Mr. Willie Maree became the Leader in Natal. Notwithstanding the fact that he was at that stage already a reasonably senior member of the Party and had been in Parliament for six years, he was not brought into the Cabinet by my predecessor before 1958, four years later.</p>

I do not want to evade the hon. member&#x2019;s question. I want to give a direct reply to the question, and I am replying to it here because it is of importance to my Party in Natal, and also to his Party in Natal. It is quite correct, as we all know, that there were persons in Natal who wanted the Minister of Foreign Affairs as their leader. There were other people&#x2014;and it was not the first time that this argument was put forward&#x2014;who felt that the leadership should be drawn locally from the Party&#x2019;s ranks in Natal. I want to make this quite explicit here, because I am aware that this has given rise to malicious propaganda. As far as the leadership of the National Party in any province is concerned, the leader of that province is the man who is elected by the congress of the Party in the province concerned.</p>

<p>No, it is no use the hon. member asking me that question.

Sir, we are dealing here with a young leader, an able young man, who has not been in this Parliament for very long, and if the hon. member for South Coast is now trying in this way to make propaganda for his Party in Natal, then I want to tell him that he will not succeed. I made my standpoint in respect of admission to the Cabinet quite clear. I do not include a person in the Cabinet simply because he is from a certain province. I include him, according <span class="col_0353-0354" refersTo="page_0195"/>to my lights&#x2014;whether people agree with me or not&#x2014;because I believe that under the particular circumstances he is the right person to have in that particular position.</p>

<p>Let me now say this to the hon. member who is making that unsavoury interjection: Look what General Smuts chose in 1948. The hon. member gave up his post in Natal at the time to come to the Cape in order to join the Cabinet and today he is still sitting waiting. Sir, I say that I choose a person according to how I view the situation. As far as this case is concerned, firstly there was no vacancy and consequently the question did not arise, but I shall weigh up the abilities of that hon. member, as well as those of any other hon. member who has any claim, as and when vacancies occur in the Cabinet. I know that under the able leadership of the hon. member for Klip River the National Party will go from strength to strength in Natal. I want to say this to the hon. member: In spite of all the propaganda the hon. member for Klip River is not only accepted fully by my Party in Natal, but he is accepted by the voters of Natal as a very worthy and honourable representative of Natal.</p>

<p>I am sorry the hon. member made that interjection. One sometimes wants a specific person, and one does not always agree with the choice people make. For example, I do not agree with the action taken by the United Party members of Natal in exchanging him for Senator Cadman. I think it was a mistake.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us return now to the motion of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. An attempt was made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;and this attempt has been made on various occasions in the past&#x2014;to create the impression that the National Party had changed its policy in respect of what is generally described as total apartheid. The impression the hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave me <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;and I find that impression confirmed by words&#x2014;was that Dr. Malan immediately introduced total apartheid as the policy of the National Party. Of course, that is not the position. The hon. member for Green Point stated it quite correctly by means of the quotation he made from the speech by Dr. Malan. The Leader of the Opposition did not state it correctly. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Malan enlarged on this and said that theoretically the objective of the policy of apartheid can be fully achieved by dividing the country into two states, all the Whites in one and all the Blacks in another. The fact of the matter is that when you read those early speeches you come to the conclusion that originally &#x2026;</block>

<p>And that is the key word&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the idea of apartheid was complete separation between Black and White.</block>

<p>That was &#x201C;originally&#x201D; our policy, but we have now deviated from that policy. I find it necessary that we should exchange a few words with one another on this matter. Throughout the debate I got this tone from hon. members opposite, who are always pointing out that we are obliged to do certain things because the Black man is working for us. They pointed out, and this is correct, that they fulfilled a very, very important function in our economy. That is correct. But that is not all. That is only one side of the coin. It is not merely that we need the black man. The black man needs us a great deal more than we need him. It is a fact that we shall find it difficult at this stage to get along without him if he should suddenly be taken away from us, but we shall be able to manage in some way or other. But the fact of the matter is that he will not be able to get along without us at all at this stage. It is just as well that this matter should be put in its correct perspective.</p>

<p>Let us consider what the position in this regard is, because propaganda is always being made out of this.</p>

<p>In the time I have at my disposal I do not find it necessary to deal with the aspect of Dr. Malan. I think, and I want to repeat this, that the position in that regard was stated absolutely correctly by the hon. member for Green Point. I am quoting only the following words from the statement by Dr. Malan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would be an ideal state, but that is not the policy of our Party, and it is nowhere to be found in our official declarations of policy.</block>

<p>He then points out that it is an ideal which should be pursued. I want to put it to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: Are we not all agreed that, if it is possible to have a homogeneous population, it would be much better than to have one which was not homogeneous? That is so. I think that if one were to approach the British to-day and put this question to them, they would immediately give you an affirmative reply. I think the people of the U.S.A. would say the same. I do not think <span class="col_0355-0356" refersTo="page_0196"/>there is any country in the world which would not confirm this. Our standpoint is: This is and must remain our ideal. We must continue to work purposefully to this end, and not only to-day, but in the future. It is not only I myself or the hon. the Minister who say this; it has always been the ultimate objective of the National Party. In our election manifesto of 1948 it is stated very clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The national policy must be drafted in such a way as to promote the ideal of ultimate total apartheid in a natural way.</block>

<p>Mr. Strydom adopted a very strong standpoint in that regard in this House of Assembly.</p>

<p>The new Leader of the United Party should preferably speak when he is spoken to. Mr. Strydom had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As we have repeatedly said in the past, that would be the ideal solution, i.e. complete territorial separation. For that reason one cannot blame people who plead and strive for it, even though one thinks that it is an ideal which cannot be attained 100 per cent, and that for that reason it will not be a practical policy. Those are the foundations we are laying on which the people in future, if they so desire and if they are convinced of the necessity for it, can continue to build in the direction of this ideal, even though they might not be able for practical reasons fully to attain that ideal in this generation or in future generations.</block>

<p>This is what Mr. Strydom said in this House on 14th May, 1956.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>You have repeated it many times here already.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. That same standpoint was stated very clearly by Dr. Verwoerd in this House, <i>inter alia,</i> on 15th September, 1958. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The ideal of total apartheid gives one something to aim at. Dr. Malan, Adv. Strydom and I have said repeatedly that the policy of apartheid constantly moves in the direction of ever-increasing separation.</block>

<p>And then he went on to motivate this statement. In other words, our attitude is not and never has been that one only has separate development or that the policy of separate development has only succeeded if and when one has achieved total separation, both territorially and as far as people are concerned.</p>

<p>This brings me to the argument of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, i.e. that our policy has now failed because the numbers of black people in the white area have increased. Nobody has ever denied that for the present the numbers will increase. In all projections and calculations which have been made, this point has been conceded. But I want to take the argument with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition further by saying that he and the hon. member for Yeoville would, if interjections had not been made, have done the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development an injustice by putting words in his mouth to the effect that he had stated that numbers were not important. It would in fact have stood in Hansard that the Minister had said that, while you, Sir, know that he did not say it. For the sake of the record I just want to make very clear what the hon. the Minister did in fact say in this connection. It makes the blunder of the hon. member for Yeoville even worse. This is what the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I maintain that the reduction of the numbers of Bantu in white areas is an extremely important criterion &#x2026;</block>

<p>He said &#x201C;an extremely important criterion&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and that it is a very important task, but it is not the only criterion.</block>

<p>We saw how the hon. member for Yeoville saw his way clear to making of an extremely important criterion a non-important criterion. Then the hon. Minister continued, and after he had stated that it was not the most important criterion, he mentioned what was in fact, in his humble opinion, the most important criterion, i.e. the question of political say. Not only do I want to return to that, but I also want to agree wholeheartedly with the hon. the Minister that that is so. What is the position? Let us consider it objectively. Numbers are not the most important factor, nor can they ever be the most important factor, for the simple reason that one can have separate development with a million people in one&#x2019;s midst, whereas one can have integration with a hundred thousand people in one&#x2019;s midst. It simply depends on what one&#x2019;s policy and one&#x2019;s approach is. If one&#x2019;s policy is one of separate development, and if one&#x2019;s ideal is an ever-increasing process of separation &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, Marais Steyn in Yeoville. That is what we have to deal with. Let us consider this matter, but let us view it <span class="col_0357-0358" refersTo="page_0197"/>against the background of present-day South African politics. I am not talking about this matter alone, but about the motion of no confidence as a whole. What is it that people and nations to-day take note of, and what do the voters insist upon in this particular time in which we are living? They consider whether your currency is a stable one. In particular they consider whether there is peace and order in the country. In a country in which one has various language groups and various population groups, people take careful note of what the relationship between those language groups is, because it is very clear that whether a country will operate successfully in future or whether it will go downhill is determined to a very large extent by the relationships existing among the people in that country. I displayed the hon. member for South Coast the courtesy of listening to him. I do not mind his talking, but then he must please not talk so loudly that he disturbs me. Ultimately, a country&#x2019;s future will be determined by the relationships existing among the people living in that country. If one looks at South Africa it is very clear to any objective observer that we have more potentially&#x2014;and I emphasize the word &#x201C;potentially&#x201D;&#x2014;inflammable material in South Africa than there is in many comparable countries of the world when it comes to this aspect of human relationships. Not only do we have the elements of Afrikaans and English speaking persons, with an entire history of dispute, strife and discord behind them, but in addition to that we have the White and the various non-White elements, each of which contains essentially inflammable elements. What do we find to-day in contrast to all comparable countries in the world? When it comes to peace and order and lack of tension&#x2014;and I emphasize the lack of tension which is prevailing in South Africa&#x2014;then there is hardly any country which can be compared to South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad the hon. member made that remark, because I want to make it very clear once again that if anyone wants to declare outside this House that the peace and order existing in South Africa are the result of compulsion exercised by the Government, then I say it is a lie. What I am in fact prepared to say is that we took timeous action against communistic agitators and their fellow-travellers. If the hon. member wants to take exception to that, he is welcome to do so. That is why we have peace and order. If one views South Africa in that light, then one cannot move a motion of no confidence in the Government. Then one must agree wholeheartedly with the Government that South Africa is being governed well. I am declaring here to-day without fear of contradiction that South Africa is in fact being governed well.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went out of his way to attack separate development and to say that it was not working or it would not work and that it was not a policy. We have already devoted a great deal of debate to this question here. I think that, for the sake of the record, I must again state in a few words what the policy of separate development is, what it comprises and in what direction it wants to go.</p>

<p>Yes, that is a good idea.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member would only listen I would tell him. I made this very clear when I assumed office, and now two and a half years later I want to re-emphasize it. The policy of separate development is not intended, and must not be seen, as a denial of anybody&#x2019;s human dignity. In the second instance, it is aimed at protecting the Whites in South Africa, who have a right of existence here. My friends who have so much to say about white leadership would do well to give some attention to this. I shall come to the question of white leadership again later on. The policy of separate development is aimed at protecting the Whites and their property, because a part of the Republic of South Africa belongs to the Whites. But it is not only to protect them as regards their property, but also to protect them in their white identity; in other words, to afford them the right of retaining and reserving their identity as Whites. That is their right. However, it is not a right which they claim for themselves alone; it is also a right which they grant to every other population group, the right to preserve their identities, whether as brown people or as black people. They have an equal right to that. That was what gave rise to the few words I said in this connection before the House adjourned yesterday. What I want to say now, applies to all of us sitting in this House. If there is one thing we should guard against, it is to disparage what belongs to another population group. No matter how inferior or how undeveloped it may be at the moment, all that one has is that which belongs to one. I say that this formed part and parcel of the history of my own people and we know where it originated; we experienced this at first hand.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Did you take action against the people who mutilated the South African flag at Nationalist meetings?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The first point is that nobody mutilated the flag, and the second point is that I stated very clearly in public that I would regard it as more than infantile if any person should do that; it would be a disgrace which would not redound to anyone&#x2019;s credit. If the hon. member now wants to make a little political propaganda out of it while we are dealing with serious matters such as this, then I take it amiss of him, and I say that I change <span class="col_0359-0360" refersTo="page_0198"/>my decision that I would have preferred him to Senator Cadman. I say that we have the right to retain our identity. But there is another very good reason why we must have separate development, and that is that we will be able to eliminate friction as far as possible. As far as this particular aspect is concerned, I find that I am in full agreement with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I am referring to one sentence which occurs in his speech. He declared that it should be made possible for people who by nature want to be separated, to remain separated. There I am in full agreement with the hon. the Leader. This has always been my defence against any person who attacked the policy of separate development. Sir, you know that the weapon of offence of the liberalists has always been, &#x201C;Leave it to the people concerned; do not make rules and regulations; leave it to the common sense of the people&#x201D;. That cry was only heard for a short time. To-day we know that that cry is no longer a valid one, because to-day the liberalists are enforcing integration at bayonet point and by means of legislation in those countries in which they are trying to implement it. Britain is one example and in America another example is to be found in certain states. To-day the cry of the liberalists is no longer &#x201C;leave it to the common sense of the people&#x201D;; they, as the most intolerant people in existence, will compel you to accept it by force of law and any other forceful means. I maintain that in that respect the hon. the Leader and I find ourselves on common ground. My reply in this regard is therefore as follows: If it is immoral&#x2014;and I cannot concede this for a moment&#x2014;when people are inclined by nature to dissociate themselves from one another, to keep the few individuals separate who do not want to remain separate, by means of regulations, then it is much more immoral to bring people who by nature want to remain separate, together by means of force. Therefore I agree wholeheartedly with that argument of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I maintain that it must be our task and our function to eliminate friction, and I think that in that respect as well my hon. friend and I have no quarrel. It is a well-founded argument that in a multi-national country such as South Africa pre-eminently is, one must go out of one&#x2019;s way if one is the leader, if one has the responsibility, to allow as little friction as possible.</p>

<p>But there is a third thing one must not neglect to do. One cannot merely consider the question of identity; one cannot merely be concerned about friction and try to keep people apart. One must in fact create opportunities for people, opportunities for development, for being full-fledged human beings in every respect, regardless of colour. If we put the National Party, if we put this Government to that test, then I make so bold as to say that this Government and its predecesors have done more than could have been expected of them to meet these three requirements. But my friend wants there to be a lack of confidence in such a Government.</p>

<p>I now come back to the standpoint adopted by the hon. the Minister, i.e. that numbers are not the decisive factor, but that, as he stated it here, a political say was in fact the decisive factor. If one examines this closely one finds that what is decided in this Parliament is what ultimately settles the matter. People can be inclined by nature to remain apart, people can be inclined by nature to adhere to their own group or to their own people. But if we were to pass laws in this Parliament which made this impossible, then we would break that down in the long run, because in the last analysis the force of law is the decisive factor. Draw a comparison now between the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and us. Over the years we have consistently maintained that in respect of that portion of South Africa as far as we are concerned, as far as the Whites are concerned, this Parliament will exercise authority over Whites through Whites and Whites alone. That has been our policy. That is why we maintained that it was wrong in principle to allow Bantu representation here, and we therefore abolished it. We maintained that it was wrong in principle to give only the Coloureds in the Cape a handful of representatives in this House. We maintained that it was a bluff to say that the Coloureds in South Africa were enjoying political rights, while they did not have any. But this Government gave the Coloureds political rights for the first time, and before the hon. member for Yeoville asks me now what the end of the road is, I want to tell him that I shall come to that and shall deal with it. In contrast to that of the Opposition, the direction being followed by this Party is very clear. We know how they, the Opposition, went from one standpoint to another in this regard. I do not want to quarrel with them about that; it is an Opposition&#x2019;s right to change its standpoint, but what is it we have to deal with at the present juncture? What is the policy which is at present still valid? What does the hon. member want to do now, viewed against the background that we must do everything in our power to eliminate friction? My hon. friend wants to go out of his way to cause friction. He not only wants to bring about friction outside, but within Parliament as well. The friction which will arise here will be the spark which will set South Africa ablaze. What does my hon. friend want to do now? He does not merely want to establish an ordinary federation, he wants to establish a race federation. A federation is difficult enough where one is dealing with the same kind of people. Friction arises between the constituent elements&#x2014;a very great deal of friction, although one is dealing with the same kind of people. Friction arises between the constituent elements&#x2014;a very great deal of friction, although one is dealing with the same kind of people. One need not seek far afield to find examples of this. One has to deal with <span class="col_0361-0362" refersTo="page_0199"/>an even more highly inflammable situation if one comes forward with a race federation. Then all the inflammable elements, all the elements in the world which can cause friction, are present. One can merely refer to what is happening in Nigeria&#x2014;one feels a very great deal of sympathy for the Biafrans, who sought self-realization and found death instead. One feels a great deal of sympathy for that group of people in everything they are having to suffer at the moment. My friend wants to introduce that inflammable situation here in this Parliament. I cannot, with the best will in the world, understand why one should go looking for trouble if one does not have any! Surely my friend must be aware of that. After all, he knows what the development which has taken place in Africa has meant. Surely he knows what the world situation in this regard is. Surely he is aware of the attacks which have been made on South Africa over the years. Now he comes along and declares that the Bantu have a right to representation in this Parliament. It is all very well to motivate this and to state that these will be White representatives, because the Bantu have not yet reached a high enough level of development. But this is an argument which one could have put forward successfully 40 years ago. Surely my hon. friend ought to know that one can no longer put forward that argument&#x2014;and now I mean it purely and simply as an argument&#x2014;to any person anywhere in the world in order to justify South Africa. One simply cannot do so. My hon. friend makes light of the question I put to him: What will happen when they have developed further? In reply to this he tells me that the Whites will in turn have developed much further. If my hon. friend would analyse that further, he would realize that it is no argument. It is a debating point and not a sound argument. After all, one reaches a stage when one cannot develop any further in the political sphere than one is able to develop. Suppose one reaches the stage where most or a very large number of them have achieved a matriculation or higher scholastic level.</p>

I could say this to him because, thank God, my forefathers and your forefathers saw to it that the black man retained his land in South Africa. I am very grateful for that. Since I am talking about land now, I must express my regret at something which the hon. member for Yeoville said here in the House. I am aware, for I was sitting here, that the hon. member perhaps intended it as a joke. I readily make that concession to him.

<p>The final reply in respect of any land claims which any person may make or which any person may raise was given in 1936.

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of this section, the Trust may from time to time acquire land for native settlement and generally for the carrying out of the provisions of this Act: Provided that the land as acquired, together with any land in released areas vested in the Trust under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section <i>six,</i> which is held by the Trust at any time, shall not exceed seven and one quarter million morgen in extent, that is to say&#x2014;</block>

<p>I say that this Government&#x2019;s standpoint is very clear, that black land in South Africa is that land&#x2014;and this forms the basis of this Act of 1936&#x2014;which belonged to the Blacks in 1936, which was earmarked, described and accepted as black land by this Parliament at that time, under the leadership of the then United Party of General Hertzog and General Smuts, after many years of deliberation, plus the 7&#x00BC;<i></i>million morgen which the Whites have to purchase for them from the white land in South Africa. This is the reply to that question, and it is true that there will be a clearance of black spots; black spots will be exchanged in order to consolidate as far as consolidation is practicable. This will be a process which will continue for years, but I hope and trust that, as far as this Government is concerned, this will put an end to the story of where the boundaries are and what land belongs to the Blacks.</p>

<p>It is an exchange of black land and white land but everyone knows what land belongs to whom, and of those 7&#x00BC; million morgen more than 5 million morgen have already been purchased, and what will still be added to that will be the rest of those 7&#x00BC; million morgen. And that is the word of the white man which he gave in this Parliament and which the National Party will honour.</p>

<p>I shall continue. We are now dealing with the Bantu homelands, and once again there is a measure of agreement between my hon. friend and myself to the effect that these homelands should be developed. Of course, when it suits the Opposition, and particularly when they speak from platforms outside, particularly when they are in the vicinity of Zee-rust&#x2014;and that is a vicinity which my hon. friend the member for Durban (Point) visits on occasion&#x2014;they take great delight in talking about the great deal which is being done for the &#x201C;Kaffirs&#x201D;. But fundamentally we agree with each other that the Bantu homelands must be developed, and I am putting this question to my hon. friend again&#x2014;I have put it to him before: What are we spending at present on the development of the homelands which the United Party would not spend?</p>

Now, that is true, and apparently my hon. friend derived great pleasure from quoting certain people during the course of his speech, because my hon. friend will not take it amiss of me if I tell him that his entire speech, as far as this was concerned, consisted of quotations from what people had said; it contained no original thinking or ideas. But what he lost sight of is that of all the people he quoted, not one agrees with him that separate development is wrong.</p>

<p>They merely say that it has failed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, they do not even say that it has failed. And if the hon. member informs me that anyone of them says <span class="col_0365-0366" refersTo="page_0201"/>that it has failed, then the hon. member knows that he is unable to find it there; surely he knows that he is merely making statements for the sake of making them, and not because they are in any way well-founded. What they did in fact say was that it was in danger of failing if certain things were not done. The hon. member for Durban (Point) is quite right, and if he walks past here he must kindly whisper it in the ear of the hon. member for Yeoville. Now, it is true that this is a matter on which one can differ. There are people who maintain that the rate is too rapid. There are other people who maintain that the rate is too slow. This is a matter which one can argue about, man to man. One can argue about it in this House for goodness knows how long. It is inevitably a matter to which one must devote attention, and I have never come across a single theorist, not only in respect of this matter, but in respect of any other matter, who did not adopt the attitude that the pace was too slow. This is a customary attitude adopted by theorists, and one need not necessarily find fault with it, but the theorist does not bear the practical responsibility. He does not have the intimate knowledge. What is more, in theory one can play with money just as one pleases, and one need not account to anyone for it. One can build fine castles in the air and one can find the money to finance those castles in the air, because in theory one can do anything, like the young boy who replied when his father asked him what he was going to do one day: &#x201C;Dad, I shall never be without work, because I am going to paint the castles in the air which you are building.&#x201D; You see, one can do this very easily. Now, I say that one can argue about whether one is proceeding too rapidly or too slowly. I have discussed this matter very thoroughly with the Minister. As far as my position permitted and my time allowed I have tried to investigate this matter, and what did I find? I found that I was dealing here with an extremely dedicated Minister, whose attention is concentrated on this matter; and I found that, considering the human material&#x2014;because this is something one dare not lose sight of&#x2014;with which one has to work, and considering the means at one&#x2019;s disposal, also considering the overall picture of the development of South Africa, we are developing the Bantu homelands as well and as rapidly as it is possible to do under the given circumstances.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now levelled the reproach at us that there are a number of workers in the homelands for whom employment has to be supplied. This is not a problem which is confined to our homelands only. It is a problem which is facing the whole of Africa, in any case the Africa we know. How does one develop a homeland? One can have development by the Bantu themselves, and hon. members know how much development one can at the present moment expect from that source. One can stimulate it by means of the Bantu Development Corporation and the Xhosa Development Corporation, which have done phenomenally good work in this regard. One can expect an ever-increasing degree of development, just as one can expect that as time passes&#x2014;but one must not be hasty&#x2014;individual Bantu entrepreneurs will come forward. Or one can develop it on the agency basis. But once again that is easier said than done. Do hon. members remember, when we began with border areas, how difficult it was to get people to go there? It is only human; the people want to live near the big cities. The workers do not want to go and live in outlying areas. We have owing to the benefits we provided, drawn people to those places, and the answers have been given here in this House and we have achieved a good deal of success with that policy. But originally the people did not want to go to the border areas, and why should they now go into the Bantu areas, Where it is even, owing to the reasons which were put forward, more difficult to go? But to me it is not merely a practical problem; to me the problem is one of principle. In principle it is wrong to afford the white man permanence in the land of the Blacks, and I shall stand or fall by that principle. One can grant him a long-term contract on the agency basis, depending upon the industry he is going to develop there, but then he knows precisely that his rights are not permanent, but only temporary. In the case of a labour-intensive organization, this need not be too long, at least not relatively speaking; one could for example make it 25 years, whereas in the case of a mining industry which undertakes development there on the agency basis, one would have to make it for a longer term, depending upon the mineral it is going to mine there and the life of the mine. In that case, for example, 50 years would not be an unreasonable figure. But one cannot assume the right of giving the Whites proprietary rights there. This brings me back to the joke made by the hon. member for Yeoville. If our forefathers&#x2014;and here I do not claim the credit for our side of the House, but for both sides of the House&#x2014;had not taken the precaution and had not had the foresight to protect the land tenure of the Blacks, then the Blacks would not have had a scrap of land to-day, because the Whites with their capital, their capacity for work and their initiative would have had all the land; and the Blacks are very sensitive about this. That is why I find it such a pity that the hon. member for Yeoville should have made that joke. It is wrong in principle to allow those people to establish themselves there permanently and to acquire permanent rights there, in the same way as it is wrong in principle for the Blacks to acquire permanent land rights in white South Africa, as the United Party wants. For if you concede that principle, if you concede that the land of the Blacks can be owned by white people, how long will it be before the white people have all the black land? And then you are confronted by this danger. If the Blacks then tell you they want political rights, you cannot tell them they must acquire <span class="col_0367-0368" refersTo="page_0202"/>these in their homeland, for then you as a white Government have done away with it, and then you have stripped your argument of all its moral content. You have then kicked it from under your own feet, and you cannot accommodate them.</p>

<p>I maintain that, against this background, my hon. friend is coming forward with a policy of bringing that frictional element of race into this Parliament; instead of saying to the Blacks that they can exercise their political rights in their own territory, he is saying to them: &#x201C;I say you have the right to be here.&#x201D; And my hon. friend will be asked this question, and very soon too: &#x201C;Why can I not be represented by my own people? I can be better represented by them; it is injurious to my self-respect that I am being represented by others; I want to represent myself through my own people in this House.&#x201D; And I want to say that my hon. friend will not be able to furnish those people with a moral reply. He will not have a leg to stand on when he has to meet them, because it will be true if they were to say to him: &#x201C;You decided in principle that I could enter this Parliament, and I am now demanding of you that I be represented by my own people.&#x201D; That is where the explosion will take place. My hon. friend himself realizes the implications of this argument; he realizes that that demand will be made of him. That is why he comes forward with the story of a special election or a referendum. But, Sir, that is something one cannot entrench; we can no longer entrench things like that in a Parliament; it is merely a story. But my hon. friend went on to state:</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, I know what I am going to be told by hon. members opposite, that there will be non-white groups desiring greater representation, that they may bring pressure to bear on the government of the day, especially if that government depends for its maintenance of a majority on non-white support, and I will be told that because of that they will be unable to resist that pressure. Sir, there is no chance of horse-trading of that kind under our policy.</block>

<p>My hon. friend states, quite rightly, that pressure will be exerted, and however painful this may be, I must remind him that there was a time when he said that initially it would be Whites, but that ultimately it would be Blacks who would occupy the seats. He then subsequently altered his point of view. I asked him across the floor of this House why he had done so. He told me that it was a result of the pressure which had at that time been brought to bear on him. Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition states that he can withstand that pressure. I do not think so; I think my hon. friend was quite right in giving way to the pressure previously. He was giving us the correct information at the time. I think he will give way again; this is how I know the Leader of the Opposition; this is how I know the composition of the United Party.</p>

<p>To sum up, Sir, we on the Government side will develop the Bantu homelands. We will have to incur considerable expenditure in that regard, as my hon. friend said here. We shall do our best to achieve this through the individual Blacks or groups of Blacks who have businesses and undertakings there. We shall do it through the agency of the Bantu Investment Corporation. We shall do it on the agency basis and, if it is necessary, we shall make even greater benefits available than we are at present doing for border areas. This one can consider without compromising oneself in that respect. I say that one can give consideration to this, and we shall do so because the Blacks are entitled to that land, but that is not the only reason; we shall do so so that we can have a moral argument to present to the Blacks; If they say to me: &#x201C;I want political rights,&#x201D; then I shall tell them: &#x201C;You can have your political rights, but you can have them in your homeland, and I have left that homeland intact for you. I have not allowed the Whites to get it. In that homeland you can have your political rights.&#x201D;</p>

But that is not the end of the story. I have never asserted anything of the kind; neither did my predecessor ever do so; nor has the National Party.

That, we said, we would have to leave to the future to decide. But what are you going to get in the end? I am prepared to face up to that consequence. Sir, you will recall that in the very first debate which we conducted here in respect of the Coloureds, I told you that the Coloureds were not yet a nation. They are still finding their souls in the process of becoming a nation. They will become a nation.

<p>Sir, all the hon. member need do is to keep quiet; he need not be unnecessarily rude.</p>

<p>In this country it will eventually come about&#x2014;and none of us can escape this or argue it away&#x2014;that one will be dealing with a white nation on the one hand and a Coloured nation on the other. As far as that is concerned our children after us will have to find a solution. We must now lay the foundation for that. There are people who in that process thought&#x2014;and there is nothing wrong in thinking about this matter&#x2014;of a homeland for the Coloureds, something which I do not regard as being practical politics. But we have now set their foot on the bottom rung of the ladder, and we have stated very clearly in this Parliament that one will have to find a link between the Coloured Persons Representative Council and this Parliament. It is not going to be so easy; I know that. None of us has any illusions about the matter, but one will be obliged to find it, and I want to tell you that it will be found. By means of that liaison one will determine the relationship between he future Coloured Parliament and the white Parliament. But I want to make this very clear: None of us can bind the future, but in so far as one wants to shape the future, I say that the future does not lie in granting representation to Whites and Coloureds in the same Parliament. The future does not lie in bringing the Coloureds into this Parliament, just as the future does not lie in bringing the Bantu or the Indians into this Parliament. I have said before and I want to repeat it here as my conviction: If one wants peace, then the development must not be towards each other, but must be away from each other. We have placed the Coloureds on that political road. It would be presumption on my part, Sir, if I wanted to say to you that I saw the end of the road. Just as my predecessor did not see it, I do not see it either. But what I can in fact do is to lay the foundations as I think that road will unfold, and I shall lay those foundations with the Coloureds as and when their representatives are chosen, as and when we find the answer to the question of the liaison which there should be between this Parliament and them. I believe that as far as South Africa is concerned we can be very grateful that, despite the potentially inflammable material we have to deal with, we can live in the year 1969 in a South Africa which is calm and peaceful, in a country which is free of tension, because every ethnic group has the opportunity to develop in terms of the policy of separate development, and it is in that policy that my hon. friend has introduced a motion of no confidence. I believe that just as the people outside have rejected it, this Parliament will reject it even more emphatically.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think that the hon. the Prime Minister would expect me to anticipate the very full reply that my hon. Leader will give to his speech. The Prime Minister has spoken this afternoon for almost an hour and a half, and he spoke for a few minutes yesterday evening. During the whole course of that time he has not rebutted the arguments which had been advanced, backed by statistics and figures, from this side of the House that the policy of the Government as regards separate development is not merely failing, but has already failed. The hon. the Prime Minister has made debating points this afternoon. Among others, he has referred to the results of the by-elections. I think perhaps the one in Johannesburg West is not a very good example, because I remember that after that by-election, when the Nationalist Party expected to increase their majority, there were some rather happy faces on this side of the House when there were a few friendly wagers on the result of that by-election. When it comes to by-elections that are not opposed, I do not attach all that much importance to it, because when I entered this House, I entered at a by-election which was unopposed by the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister admitted this afternoon that he cannot see the end of the road as regards the policy of the Government in respect of the Coloureds and the Indians. I do not want to deal with that, but there are two particular matters in the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech that I do wish to refer to. He said yesterday afternoon that it was natural that there should be &#x201C;kriewelrigheid&#x201D; after a party had been in power for 21 years. I think this word &#x201C;kriewelrigheid&#x201D; is one of the greatest understatements that I have heard regarding the dissension that is going on within the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own party at the present moment over this very policy of separate development and its ultimate aims. The hon. the Prime Minister, ever since this &#x201C;verligte-verkrampte&#x201D; quarrel raised its head, has alternated between two extremes in dealing with it. He has either tried to play it down, as he did when he returned after a trip to South West Africa with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and as he tried to do yesterday when he used the word &#x201C;kriewelrigheid&#x201D;, or he has gone to the complete opposite extreme, as he did when he threw no less than four Cabinet Ministers at one time out of his Cabinet. He also went <span class="col_0371-0372" refersTo="page_0204"/>to the opposite and extraordinary extreme when he used the security police to investigate the authors of the smear letter, who were members of his own party.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman&#x2019;s Vote is still coming. But then the hon. the Prime Minister must not merely talk of &#x201C;kriewelrigheid&#x201D; if he is to go to the extent of using the Security Police against his own supporters. [Interjections.] This attempt by the hon. the Prime Minister to either play this down or else to use these extreme measures is evidence of the very great disquiet in his own party when it comes to the question of separate development. The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech this afternoon may induce all his followers to come into the Chamber when the division bells ring later, but this is not going to end this ferment that is going on within his own party. It is evidence of a fundamental difference of opinion as to what the ultimate aim of separate development should be in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to deal with just one more point in the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech. It is not a matter which I had intended to raise at all, but it was raised here yesterday by the hon. member for Aliwal. It is the question of the boundaries of the Bantu areas. The hon. the Prime Minister dealt specifically with this matter this afternoon. He said, as the hon. member for Aliwal and as the hon. Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration did&#x2014;and I am now talking about the one from Somerset East, not from Primrose&#x2014;that the boundaries of the Bantu areas, the released areas, were all laid down in the 1936 legislation. That is true as far as it goes, but does the hon. the Prime Minister not realize that those boundaries have been changed on numerous occasions since then? Was, for example, in the Eastern Cape the Welcome Wood area ever a released area in terms of the 1936 legislation? Other areas have been excised, but was the Mdantsane area ever a released area under the 1936 legislation? There was an area which the Government declared a released area, simply so that they could move the Ciskei nearer to East London in order to fit in with their policy of border areas. There are two more examples, if the hon. the Prime Minister wants more examples. The area of the Keiskammahoek commonage which, in 1965 or 1966 was declared a released area, is such an example. Then there is the area between Mdantsane and the Buffalo River, which was declared a released area at the same time. This is an area covering some 6,0 morgen. Can the hon. the Prime Minister really maintain that you are not changing the boundaries if you keep on changing the released areas and excising ground in that manner? It may be claimed that the real reference is to the total area concerned, but let me say that this constant chopping and changing of boundaries without the knowledge of where the ultimate boundary is going to be, creates consternation and holds up progress in the areas concerned. It is not merely hon. members of the Opposition who keep on running to the Government to find out where the boundaries are going to be. Hon. members on that side of the House also try without avail to discover where the boundaries of these Bantu areas are going to be.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister quoted figures from the 1936 Act. I should like to draw his attention to the summary of the report of the Tomlinson Commission. He gave us the figures in regard to the scheduled areas. He mentioned a figure of approximately 10,700,000 morgen, plus the quota of million morgen. I should like to read to him what the Commission found over and above that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission finds, however, that on the basis of the figures furnished to it, the eventual extent of the Native areas will be approximately 19,611,000 morgen, if and when the full quotas are required, that is to say approximately 1,632,000 morgen greater than was generally assumed to be the case. The main reason for this is that land acquired by Natives before the passing of the Act of 1936 does not fall within the interpretation of &#x201C;quota land&#x201D;. In other words, there is a misconception on the part of the general public as to that the eventual position will be.</block>

<p>Unfortunately, Sir, it seems that there is also a misconception on the part of the hon. the Prime Minister as to what the eventual position in that connection will be.</p>

<p>Various aspects of Government policy as regards the reserves have been highlighted during this debate, but not very much has been said about whether the agricultural development in the reserves is adequate or in accordance with the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission. The Tomlinson Commission lays great stress on agriculture. It stated:</p>

<block name="quote">Having regard to the expected increase in population, the doubt whether the non-Bantu areas will be able to provide sufficient food to meet future requirements, the obvious connection between good nutrition and health, and in view of the expected rise in food requirements, the Bantu areas must be sufficiently developed to enable them to make their proper contribution to the production <span class="col_0373-0374" refersTo="page_0205"/>of food. The undesirability of being dependent upon imports of food provides an additional reason for such development.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Chief Whip must be a little patient. We have lots of time. He need not be in such a hurry to run away from this debate. The Commission feared that the white areas would not be able to feed the people. It is in fact the white areas that have fed the people of this country. They have fed them with the use of Bantu labour in those white areas. But let us see how far the government has in fact succeeded in boosting food production within the Bantu areas. There have been improvements because the officials of the Department of Bantu Administration are enlightened. The hon. the Minister the day before yesterday reeled off a whole set of figures. He spoke, for example, of 45,000 miles of fencing. But what has all this achieved in effect? He gave us figures in regard to irrigation. The Tomlinson Commission said that there could be great progress in the field of agriculture within the reserves. The Commission stated:</p>

<block name="quote">Irrigation farming is undoubtedly the only form of farming undertaking in which, under European leadership and control, the Bantu have shown themselves capable of making a full-time living from farming and of making advantageous use of the soil for food production.</block>

<p>They proved this with figures of the settlement cost per family. Whereas in the pastoral zone it cost over R1,400 to settle a family, on irrigated land it cost only R165.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the other day the hon. the Minister made great play of the fact that while in 1960 there were some 15,000 morgen of land under irrigation in the reserves, in 1968 there were some 25,000 morgen. That might sound impressive, but what did the commission say about this? The commission said that: &#x201C;Added to the area already under irrigation, these proposed schemes that are possible in the reserves bring the future irrigable potential of the Bantu areas to 63,341 morgen on which it should be possible to settle 36,000 farming families&#x201D;. The commission reported in 1954 and since then 15 of the 25 to 30 years, that they recommended for these tasks to be carried out, have elapsed. More than half the time which was recommended, has elapsed, but the Government has not even succeeded half-way in reaching that figure of 63,000 morgen. In fact, they only have 25,000 of the 63,000 morgen under irrigation. Yesterday the hon. member for Durban (Point) mentioned an example in Natal where 2,000 acres of productive soil under irrigation under white ownership and subsequently taken over by, the Bantu Trust, was now producing a fraction of what it used to produce. Let us take the areas in the Eastern Cape, for example the Keiskamma River, which is one of the best rivers in the area with a catchment area of 1,000 square miles and an annual runoff of 85,000 morgen feet. How much irrigation has the Bantu Trust achieved along that river? There are no storage dams and only one or two very minor schemes at Keiskammahoek and down at Fort Cox. What happened when they did buy an irrigation farm on that river called &#x201C;Dank Den Goewerneur&#x201D; in the days when Dr. Jansen was the Minister of Native Affairs? It was a flourishing citrus producing farm producing citrus under irrigation. If you go there to-day, or if you go to the settlement in Natal which the hon. member for Durban (Point) mentioned, you will find only a few miserable looking mealies being grown on what is fertile irrigable ground and what used to produce good crops before the Bantu Trust took it over. What about maize, which is the staple food of the Bantu? Before I deal with that I first want to say this. It is not merely the members of the Opposition who decry the lack of agricultural progress in the Bantu reserves. What did Mr. Jan van Rooyen, the special correspondent of <i>Die Burger,</i> write on the 31st October in his series of articles entitled &#x201C;Die Transkei na vyf jaar&#x201D;? He said:</p>

<block name="quote">Die landbou is op die oomblik saam met die onderwys een van die twee hoof hoekstene waarop die ontwikkeling in die Transkei berus, maar dit het nog kwalik uit die stadium van &#x2019;n bestaansekonomie gevorder. Daar is inderdaad geen groot landbou-ondernemings aan die gang nie en die hooftaak bly nog steeds die opvoeding van die mense om reg te boer en die beste uit hulle grond te kry. Nog steeds is die Bantoe tevrede om vir die volgende jaar niks te saai en te oes as hy vanjaar &#x2019;n goeie oes gemaak het nie. Die gemiddelde mielieopbrengs is maar drie sak per morg en met we&#x00EB;moed verklaar die departement dat daar in meer as 30 jaar min verandering in hierdie verband is.</block>

<p>Let us remember that this Nationalist Government which talks so much about the agricultural development in reserves, has been in power for 21 of those 30 years.</p>

<p>The proof of that is the lack of progress there is in maize production, the staple food of the Bantu, in the reserves. Again the commission gave figures of maize production in the reserves. It said that during the period 1946-52 the average yield of grain in the Bantu areas amounted to about 3.3 million bags per annum, while with a residential population of about 3.6 million persons the annual requirement was about 9 million bags. That is, less than half of what was needed, was home grown. The position has <span class="col_0375-0376" refersTo="page_0206"/>not improved since then. If you take the latest available official figures from the latest available statistical year book, you will see that on an average the total yield during the seven years 1955-&#x2019;56 to 1962-&#x2019;63, was 2.91 million bags. For 1962-&#x2019;63, the latest year available it was just over 3 million bags. So, in actual fact, it has gone down from 3.3 million bags to 3.07 million bags, despite the purchase of additional quota ground. What hope have the reserves, whose population is growing at a rate far faster than the Tomlinson Commission envisaged, of ever making a significant contribution towards feeding themselves whilst the rate of progress is either so slow or is minimal or is perhaps even negative? It is clear that for the feeding of the reserves these people will have to rely upon the white agriculture of this country particularly if the Government keeps on with their policy of pushing people back into the reserves and removing them from elsewhere. If this Government remains in power, these people will have to rely on a white agriculture whose labour force is being interfered with more and more by governmental authority. Hon. members on that side of the House have Bantu settled on their farms who have been there for generations. The hon. the Deputy Minister himself gave us an example the other day when he was discussing the resettlement villages, of how a pensioner family had to be removed from his farm to one of those resettlement villages. He also told us how he kept this family on his farm for such a long time. That is proof from themselves that this is the traditional labour force on many of our farms. I am sorry that the hon. the Deputy Minister is not here at the moment, because I would have liked to ask him whether he really thinks that he can rely on a system of migrant labour on a stock farm for the people who herd his sheep, for the people who look after his stud cattle, for the people who have to go to the shows on which he exhibits those cattle? Does he really think that he can rely on a system of migrant labour who come for a year and then are trained after which they have to go back to the reserves? Is this really what the hon. the Deputy Minister thinks he can rely on? This is farcical. The Government is refusing for ideological reasons to do any training whatsoever, of Bantu for use of agriculture in the white areas. We have had enough instances of neglect of white agriculture in this country by this Government. This is yet another example of their adding to the burdens of the farmer, adding to the burdens of drought, of low prices, of high costs by interfering with the normal free flow of labour. One of these days, if the time has not already arrived, this Government is going to succeed in breaking white agriculture in this country which has to feed the reserves. It is not surprising that no less a person than a member of the executive of the Cape Provincial Council, Dr. Munnik, said recently that farmers should train their sons to do other work in case there was a crisis in agriculture. Mr. Speaker, it is not a question of &#x201C;in case there is a crisis in agriculture&#x201D;. There is a crisis in agriculture and this Government, because of its attitude towards migrant labour, is going to worsen that crisis. Mr. Speaker, that gentleman gave the advice to the farmers of the country that they should train their people to do other work. He would have been very much better advised to tell them to train their children so that they can farm more efficiently. Just what does this Government want? They want us to have less Bantu labour on our farms in common with the rest of the white economy, but they refuse to assist us to make the Bantu labour more efficient. This is a case of their policy just going round and round in a circle and the net result of it all is going to be that agriculture in this country is going to find it more and more difficult to feed the Bantu areas which cannot sustain themselves.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INFORMATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for five days we have been conducting a no-confidence debate on certain matters. I want to congratulate the Opposition on one single improvement in this regard. Whereas in all previous years they used bird-shot as ammunition in this debate, bird-shot in which they had substituted salt for the pellets and which was totally ineffective, they have at least succeeded this year to shoot with a Martini Henry. They took a single theme and hammered at that all the time. If only they had hammered at that one theme until they had reached its core, which would have given the people outside a clear understanding of the matter, one could still have given them credit for their attitude. However, it seems to me as though the bullet they used in this Martini Henry was a piece of candle-wax, as it was ineffective too and did not even penetrate the surface. On the other hand, this side of the House was the only one which used a scalpel and made a fine analysis. Our members were the only ones who eventually penetrated to the core of the matter and said what was being done, what exactly was happening and how the matter was developing. In other words, this entire debate which affords an opportunity for discussion on a very high level, even on this occasion where we have been dealing with a specific theme, has once again produced no result of the Opposition having penetrated to the basic concepts.</p>

<p>I do not want to react to what was said by the hon. member who has just sat down. He spoke about agriculture and that is a theme about which I do not know a great deal. I say this quite frankly and I am prepared to admit this here.</p>

<p>What about agricultural development in the Bantu areas?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall discuss that, if necessary. The hon. member who has just sat down, again raised the matter of the boundaries. I just want to tell the hon. member that the hon. the Prime Minister gave him a crystal-clear <span class="col_0377-0378" refersTo="page_0207"/>reply in regard to the boundary situation. A certain number of morgen will be purchased in each province in order to establish the final boundaries. The question of exactly where the boundaries will be, will be determined on the basis of negotiations amongst the various authorities. The hon. member spoke of having a border at some place and then again somewhere else. I want to challenge the hon. member to show me a single piece of land which used to be white land and which subsequently became Bantu land, and then once again became White land, or <i>vice versa,</i> as he maintained. Negotiations do in fact take place, but there is no such thing as land which used to be white land and which became Trust land, subsequently becoming white land again. This does not happen, and this is the allegation the hon. member wanted to make here.</p>

<p>A major part of the speech I wanted to make has become redundant because of the excellent speech made by our Prime Minister in which he gave direction in a frank and clear way and in which he told us in a statesmanlike manner exactly where we were standing and in which direction we were moving. His was the speech of a convinced man who knows where he is going and who knows the exact direction he is taking, unlike the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who is continuously chopping and changing. The matter I should like to take up with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is the question of White leadership under his policy. I think it is time that the public and everyone outside should get clarity about this conception of White leadership and what exactly it includes. I think we had better analyse that conception in some detail. I want to start by asking the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, if he would be so kind as to reply, how a leader is designated in the United Party. Surely he does not inherit his leadership, but is elected at a congress by certain people who are entitled to vote and who elect the leader in that way. In other words, the leadership of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is linked to the idea that there are followers and that these followers elect him as their leader. Or is there some other way of designating a leader in that Party? I want to proceed. There is also a way in which the Leader of the Opposition can be removed from his position of leader. He can be removed from his position because those followers no longer have any confidence in him or have confidence in someone else. On some occasion a proposal will be made and that hon. Leader will then be removed from his position if the majority went against him and another leader would be elected. In other words, the power of terminating leadership of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not in his own hands&#x2014;unless he resigns voluntarily&#x2014;but is in the hands of his followers. They decide whether he is to be leader and for how long he is to remain leader.</p>

<p>I also want to deal with a third aspect. That is that a leader can only be a leader if he has the approval, support and loyalty of his followers. If he does not have the support and the approval of his followers, he has no leadership. In other words, and this is the image I want to use, leadership in the case of the Opposition or whatever organization is automatically linked to followers. The power to decide on a leader is in the hands of the followers. He remains leader as long as his followers want him, and when they no longer want him, the followers have it within their power to elect a new leader or to reject him. Against this background I want to analyse the hon. the Leader of the Oppositon&#x2019;s concept of white leadership in South Africa. White leadership, as is also the case as regards leadership of a party, therefore rests on the fact that there have to be followers, and not only within the party itself. If he wants to make the white nation the leader in Southern Africa the followers in that case are the non-white nations who have to follow the leadership of the white nation. The non-white nations therefore are the followers and the white nation is the leader. That is leadership. The first concept about which I want to cross swords with the hon. the Leader is whether the non-Whites of South Africa, who have to accept this white leadership of the hon. the Leader, have ever indicated on a single occasion that they were prepared to accept the hon. the Leader&#x2019;s party, his policy and his leadership? Are the followers prepared to accept this leader? This is the first question, because it is a basic one. If the followers are not prepared to follow the leader, such leadership is useless. If the non-Whites are not prepared to accept the leadership of the white nation then surely that leadership is completely futile and one will not achieve anything at all. I also want to raise a second argument, and that is the argument of the election of the leader. Have the non-White races of South Africa on any occasion elected and designated the white race as their leader? Have they really accepted the white race completely as their leader and will they accept it as such at all times? I also want to ask a third question and I think that this is the essence of the whole argument. This therefore obviously means that when the non-white races decided that they no longer accepted the leadership of the white nation, they would have the power to say, &#x201C;Now we reject white leadership and now we elect our own leader&#x201D;. The threat to the whole concept of white leadership is to be found in this. In other words, eventually the power then passes into the hands of the non-White nations of South Africa to decide for or against the leadership of the Whites. This is the proof I want. Is this really what the Opposition has in mind? Does the Opposition want to see that this power passes into the hands of the non-White nations? Then the concept of White leadership is a true one and White leader <span class="col_0379-0380" refersTo="page_0208"/>ship, and the word &#x201C;leadership&#x201D; itself has any meaning. This means that the non-Whites have the free choice to reject the leadership of the Whites whenever it suits them to do so. If to-day the hon. the Leader of the Opposition were to agree with me that this was the true interpretation of that concept, I would say that his concept of white leadership had some substance. If he were to tell me, however, that white leadership meant that the followers, i.e. the non-White nations, were never going to get any say about the desirability, or the efficiency, or the necessity of the white nation as leader, I would say that his whole concept of white leadership was a soap bubble which ought to be pricked because there would no longer be any sense in calling it leadership. Then it would develop into one concept only, namely the brutal domination (baasskap) of the non-Whites by the Whites for now and for all times to come. Then the whole concept of leadership would mean nothing and would be immoral and extremely dangerous. When we told the hon. the Leader that the concept he was advocating here was that of white supremacy, he said he preferred the term white leadership. Now I want to tell him that he is bluffing no one with his white leadership. If he says &#x201C;white leadership&#x201D; and accepts the view that the followers can reject the leader whenever it suits them to do so, then the term means something, but otherwise it has no meaning under any circumstances. But I do not think that this is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition means, I do not think he means that he wants to give the non-Whites this authority, and I think that in his heart of hearts he is concerned with one thing only, and that is vote-catching. He believes that if he can advocate a disguised version of white supremacy&#x2014;this is how he interprets the present temperature and climate in this country&#x2014;he will be able to catch votes, the votes of certain people who may at present be supporters of the Government, but that he will be able to get past the international world as well as the liberalists in his own ranks with that disguised and sugar-coated version of white leadership. That is the whole object behind this. But one cannot have one&#x2019;s cake and eat it, and I want to pin him down at one concept. Either his white leadership means what it means, namely the non-White nations gaining authority over white leadership, in which case I can give him the guarantee that he will not get one single vote from this side, or it means white domination in its most brutal form, in which case I assure him he will experience numerous difficulties from overseas as well as from the liberalists in his own Party. What is more, he will not attract any of our people, because our people cannot be bought over by that point of view. That would mean that the United Party wanted to appoint itself as leader for all times to come. That is the concept he wants. That is clearly evident from the whole speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He said there was an enduring difference between White and non-White, as had been pointed out by the hon. the Prime Minister. When the non-Whites had reached our present stage in a 100 years&#x2019; time, we would have progressed another 100 years, and consequently there would be perpetual white leadership, and consequently perpetual domination. If we could be enfrachised at this stage of development and on the basis of our numbers and the Bantu reached our present stage of development in a number of years, on what moral grounds was he still going to refuse the vote to the Bantu? Would he in that case raise the voting qualifications in order to give the vote to the new super-whites alone? Will he raise them? Or will he recognize the principle that if a man reaches the stage at which we are at present, he will be entitled to vote? Because then surely his whole argument falls away. Now I want to ask him the following question. Are the non-Whites in Nigeria or in Ghana on the same level of development, or do they have the same standard of living as the Whites? The answer is no in each case, but yet they have demanded and obtained full voting rights, full authority and government. They did not ask what the level of development was, nor will the non-Whites do so in the case of the hon. the Leader.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader has one single idea in all his devising and that is to play a double game once again, to tell some people it means domination when it suits him to do so, and to tell others, &#x201C;No, no, it merely means white leadership&#x201D;&#x2014;when it suits him to do that. That double standard does not work when we want to analyse the concepts to the core and when we want to examine them in fine detail, because then we want the facts as they are. Therefore this argument of the hon. the Leader also falls away completely. He cannot appoint the Whites as for all times to come leaders&#x2014;on the contrary. The position is very clear. It is exactly as the hon. the Prime Minister has said, namely that these are the perfect conditions for a powder-keg to explode, i.e. when one tells people they will be subordinate to another group of people for all times to come, whereas they have their own ideals and their own ideas. This in no way is in keeping with or takes into account the developments of the twentieth century; it does not in any way take into consideration the development in these times, especially in Africa after 1960; it ignores every political reality of this century. It does not in any way take into account the development and awakening of Black nationalism in various black states as well as amongst our own non-Whites. Does the hon. the Leader not know that the concept of nationalism, as love for those things which are one&#x2019;s own and the awakening in a nation, is an irresistible force? Let me illustrate this with an image. It is a power similar to that of the mushroom which cracks the asphalt and reaches the surface if it wants to emerge. We have seen this in practice. It is like the grass which pushes its way <span class="col_0381-0382" refersTo="page_0209"/>through the asphalt to emerge, nothing stops it. It does not take into account nationalism, the awakening of black nationalism is completely overlooked, and this is completely unacceptable to us in this connection. It is a typical, political move, a manoeuvre with words in an attempt to get away with things because he does not want to accept the consequences of our policy and of South Africa&#x2019;s problem; he refuses to accept them.</p>

<p>Usually the Opposition takes General Hertzog to be the spiritual father of the United Party, the founder of that Party. General Hertzog is usually held up as the leader. In 1926 General Hertzog said the following, but the Opposition now completely denies the ideas he expressed at that time and now says the direct opposite. His point of view was as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The welfare and happiness of the Native during his period of minority &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x2014;I accept he meant this in the constitutional sense of the word&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; will, in the first place, always depend on the goodwill and sincerity of the White man, but when he has come of age, he will also receive his majority.</block>

<p>I stress the word &#x201C;majority&#x201D;. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What we have seen to to-day is to take the necessary measures for the transitional period between now and then. What will happen after that, how the relationship between the Native and the European will be laid down after that, we have to leave to the future.</block>

<p>This is what General Hertzog said in 1926. At that time the Bantu were under age, at a later stage they would come of age, and then a decision would have to be taken on how majority was to be granted to them. That was his attitude. Now I want to tell the hon. the Leader immediately that this minority of the Bantu is passing rapidly and is developing into majority. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout complains that the Bantu have already come of age but that we have not yet given them their majority. Elsewhere they have already come of age, the rest of Africa has already given them their majority, has already given the authority over their own affairs, but as yet we have not done this in respect of our own Bantu. This is the complaint of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. What kind of coming of age, what kind of majority does the United Party now want to give the Bantu? When they obtain their majority, does that party want to give them a subordinate role which will bind them for all times as subordinate to a white Parliament where they will be in the minority? It would be everlasting. That would mean that the Bantu would never have any ideal to strive for, and a nation cannot live without an ideal, it revolts. The Afrikaner nation came into its own because it did have ideals to strive for; that was the force which urged it on, namely the ideals it pursued. Those ideals were pursued and they are being realized one by one. What ideal can that party offer the Whites in South Africa as well as the non-Whites in terms of its policy? The highest it can offer the non-Whites in all honesty, is: Well, you may eventually have eight Whites in this House. That is the approach at present. That is the highest ideal it offers the Bantu at present. They may have eight representatives for all the Bantu nations of South Africa, with all the development they are undergoing, with all that is still in store for them. That is the most that side can offer the Bantu, eight Whites in this House; that, then, is the highest form of Government they may have. And the hon. the Leader wants to tell me that the Bantu will accept this. No, Sir, I say that the ideal which the black man sets for himself, an ideal without which no nation on earth will be satisfied because it is a nation, is self-determination as regards its own destiny in the circumstances. It will always hold up that ideal. The actual position, which I want to put to the hon. the Leader, is the following. There is one of two alternatives as regards this ideal. Either the Bantu realizes his ideal in this Parliament with full realization according to his preponderance in numbers, or he realizes the ideal in his own homeland, which happens to be our policy. But no matter what the position may be, the Bantu will eventually realize that ideal.</p>

<p>Having exposed the Opposition&#x2019;s concept of white leadership, I now want to proceed to my second analysis of their policy. That side has the so-called safeguard of a referendum by the white electorate of South Africa when it comes to increasing the number of representatives in this Parliament. The hon. the Leader said that the Bantu would have eight white representatives in this House and six in the Other Place. This is the basis from which they proceed; this is the basic concept. The Leader said that if any pressure, no matter what kind of pressure, were to be brought to bear for any change with regard to the Bantu representatives, no change would be effected with regard to the number or colour of the representatives unless a referendum on the matter had been held amongst the white electorate of South Africa. Now I want to ask a few questions to which I should like to have answers; the Leader will reply to the debate when I have resumed my seat, and I should like to have answers to my questions.</p>

<p>The first question I should like to ask, is the following. But first of all allow me to sketch the position as I see it. There would be eight Whites sitting in the House as the representatives of the Bantu. Those eight people would represent the millions of Bantu, all the various Bantu nations. The Bantu <span class="col_0383-0384" refersTo="page_0210"/>might react and say: &#x201C;No, we are no longer satisfied, we no longer want eight representatives, we want black representatives in the House, we want more representatives, we want representation in accordance with our numbers.&#x201D; Agitation would ensue and there might be a big fuss about this, and in the end the present hon. Leader of the Opposition might say: &#x201C;Very well, in 1968, when I was still the Leader of the Opposition, I said we would decide this only by way of a referendum amongst the white electorate, and I shall now accommodate you by calling a referendum.&#x201D; Surely that is what will happen in practice. Now I should like to ask the Leader this question, and I should like to have a reply. If what I have just outlined were to come to pass, what advice would he give the white electorate from the platform in regard to the way they should vote?</p>

<p>Surely that is not a new question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, but as yet I have never had a reply; therefore I am repeating the question. Let us see whether we shall get a reply to-day. A few years ago this Government held a referendum on the establishment of a Republic, and our Leader and all of us plainly said from the platforms, &#x201C;Vote &#x2018;Yes&#x2019; for the Republic&#x201D;, and the hon. the Leader and his people also took a stand by saying, &#x201C;No, vote &#x2018;No&#x2019;, we are monarchists&#x201D;; and fortunately the nation in its wisdom made the right decision. I want to ask whether anyone on that side would say to-day that we should abandon the Republic and return to the monarchy. I wonder whether there is one of them who would say that. The fact of the matter is that when that situation arises, a situation which is so important that a referendum must be held, the two leaders cannot abstain or refrain from taking a stand. They will have to take a stand. We will be forced to take a stand and so will that hon. the Leader. Now I am asking him again: What stand will he take, what will he tell his electorate in regard to the way they should vote? Will he tell them. &#x201C;Yes, those eight Whites must now be increased to 12 or 20 in number&#x201D;? Will he say to them, &#x201C;Yes, those eight Whites must be replaced by Blacks from now on&#x201D;? If he were to tell them that, and they voted for that, then that would be one point of view and our prediction would have come true, i.e. that there will be Blacks sitting in this Parliament, and once we have the Blacks here, their numbers will grow as a result of pressure. And they will not be satisfied before they have representation in Parliament according to their numbers, and that means that they will be in the majority here. If, on the other hand, the hon. the Leader were to advise the electorate, &#x201C;No, do not vote for an increase in their numbers, say no, their numbers may in no way be increased or changed as regards colour, they must remain exactly as they are at present&#x201D;, then surely this concept of a referendum is a big bluff, it is all bluff; and whom is the Leader trying to take in by it?</p>

<p>My argument is very clear and we should like to hear from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition what his advice to the electorate will be when this stage is reached. We should like to have an honest reply and I think today is the time to give a reply because the people outside are also interested.</p>

<p>I want to give the hon. the Leader credit for this and I want to accept that, for the sake of the world outside and in view of the circumstances outside as well as in the interests of his own electorate, he would recommend to his electorate, &#x201C;Let us vote &#x2018;No&#x2019;, they may not have more representatives and they may not be Black, they must remain eight Whites&#x201D;. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt, let us give him credit on the assumption that this will be his point of view. Let us assume then that the electorate would vote for the retention of eight white representatives. Now I want to ask the Leader another friendly question. Will the Blacks resign themselves to the result of such a referendum? Will they, in the first place, accept the fact that the Whites take a final decision on the matter? Will they accept the result of a referendum, in the second place, and will they retire with the words, &#x201C;They are opposed to this and now we are satisfied; we shall try again in 20 years&#x2019; time&#x201D;? Does the hon. the Leader accept that this will be what will happen? What will be the attitude of those people? Or will those black people revolt, as usually happens, against the whole idea and say, &#x201C;We do not submit ourselves to the white man&#x2019;s decision. If he tells us to exercise our political rights in this House, we want to do so according to our numbers and our ability and not according to any regulations&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville has already decided this matter for himself, and I want to quote him something which has already been mentioned here to-day. It is an old quotation, but I think it is necessary for him to be reminded of it once again. In the days when the pressure was more severe, he was prepared to say&#x2014;as a matter of fact it was as clear as crystal to him&#x2014;that the referendum would not have the result we have in mind now. He said it very clearly, and I quote what he said in 1965 (Hansard, Vol. 13, Col 605). He was referring to what the present Minister of Bantu Administration and Development had said and expressed himself as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>He said that it would not happen immediately, and now I want to ask this question as I think it is time we received an honest reply and as this debate dealt specifically with this matter. I now call on him to give the final reply: What exactly is he going to do as regards the question of advice and if the non-Whites do not accept the result of the ballot? How is he going to act against the Bantu in that case? Will he force it upon them, with military power, if necessary? Will he have the courage to do so? Or will he simply yield to the pressure? I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is in an ideal position to-day to tell the people clearly whether his &#x201C;white leadership&#x201D; means that the followers have any say over his leadership, so that the followers may decide who is to be the leader and who is to become the new leader; and if this is true as far as his white leadership is concerned, then it means that we have transferred the power to the Bantu and those other nations of many colours, and they will decide whether the Whites are to remain the leaders or not, because that is the implication. If he does not say that this is so, then his word &#x201C;leadership&#x201D; means nothing and is but the concept of domination in disguise. Then he would be departing completely from all previous policies, because all parties in this country have always said: We believe in a policy of guardianship of the Whites over the non-Whites: and surely guardianship means the gradual emancipation of the ward. It means leading them step by step until at some stage they are in a position where they will become emancipated and be a ward no longer.</p>

<p>Surely this is so, otherwise it should not be termed guardianship, but slavery. But if one wants to uplift them, if one wants to emancipate them, then one must train and uplift them step by step until such a stage is reached where one might say to them, &#x201C;No you have attained to the full status; now you have come of age and now you may be emancipated completely; now you are on your own&#x201D;. And then one of two alternatives remains, either here or in his homeland. But the hon. member&#x2019;s problem is the following. He refuses to accept the position of black domination. He would rather play a double game so that he may get around both sides, as usual. Our policy is one of emancipation and we say that we shall emancipate the black man and shall eventually put the ward in a position to attain autonomy and majority. This we say without any doubt, and we say this openly, and we say this to all our voters, and there is not one of them that still takes exception to this, except the Van der Merwes, who are not our supporters. We say that our final objective will be complete sovereign independence for the separate black states. All of us say this only the Van der Merwes say they want to do something else. [Interjections.] This idea we support namely, that we believe in, and I want to use the term as Dr. Verwoerd did, the supremacy of the white man in the country of the white man, and in exactly the same way we believe in the supremacy of the black man in his own country. This is the policy: the Bantu each in their own country&#x2014;each Bantu nation.</p>

<p>The ideal state of affairs was outlined very clearly by the Prime Minister. On the concept of complete apartheid the Prime Minister took a stand so clearly that if the hon. member does not understand it, he should simply say that he does not understand it, because I am in full agreement with what the Prime Minister said, as all of us are, and I do not want to repeat what he said. The fact remains that this is the ideal state of affairs, and we are trying to move in that direction as rapidly as one can in practice, so that one may eventually grant them sovereignty when they are mature enough for it. But this we believe to be the solution, and not what the hon. members wish to do, namely to manoeuvre its way through the various political parties.</p>

<p>I wish to touch on one more concept. [Interjections.] I want replies to these direct questions and I hope the Leader of the Opposition has sufficient courage to give me these replies. What I want to know is this: As regards this question of assistance to and development in the homeland, is the Leader of the Opposition telling us to accelerate development in the homeland? In that case he is admitting by implication that our policy is the right one, and that we should only proceed more rapidly. The criticism expressed by certain learned persons and academic men did not concern the question whether the policy was right or wrong. They support this policy wholeheartedly. They only said we were not implementing it rapidly enough. In other words, they are even stronger supporters of the policy than the Leader of the Opposition thinks. He should therefore not appeal to them. [Time expired.]</p>

He said that there was only one instance of typhoid fever. Now, that was on 10th December. But on Wednesday, if I am not mistaken, he said in this House that there had been 18 cases of typhoid fever.

But he admits that his ideal is the largest possible number of non-Whites in the reserves, and that is also his policy, but he is steadily moving away from that ideal and then he still tells us that he is making progress. He is steadily moving away from the ideal cherished by the Minister of Bantu Administration, but they say that they are making progress.

<p>He speaks of the phenomenal improvement as regards the clearance of black spots, but in spite of that we find that the Bantu in the white areas are steadily increasing.</p>

<p>I shall go further. The hon. the Prime Minister asked me why we had no confidence in his Government&#x2014;after all, they were making such splendid progress. But this is progress in reverse. They are full of confidence in their retreat. If he asks me why we have no confidence, <span class="col_0389-0390" refersTo="page_0213"/>my reply is that we have no confidence, not only because this policy is already in the process of failing, but also because it has already failed. Secondly, notwithstanding the fact that the policy is in the process of failing, the Prime Minister is still prepared to terminate white leadership over large parts of South Africa. What is the case which was made out here? I made the statement that one of the objectives of this policy was separation between black and white, and the hon. the Prime Minister admitted that this was the ideal, the goal. I quoted from the white paper on the Tomlinson Report. I said that I would accept that this was their policy, that they would be satisfied if in 50 years&#x2019; time there were equal numbers of Blacks and Whites in the white area. Notwithstanding the fact that that is their ideal, there was an influx of Bantu from their areas to white areas at a rate of 120,000 a year from 1951 to 1960 and after that, if my figures are correct, the rate increased to 142.000 a year. Mr. Sneaker, what will the population figures be by the year 2000? I emphasized the fact that even if they wanted to achieve their objective of equal numbers by the year 2000, they would have to move about 250.000 Bantu a year back to their homelands, and if the new figures which have now been released by Dr. Stoker are correct, then it is almost 400,000 a year. And what are they doing, Sir? The flow of Bantu is in precisely the opposite direction, to such an extent that in spite of everything the Government is doing and says it has done and is going to do, the Bantu population here in the white areas has increased in the urban areas alone by more than 2 million over the past 16 years.</p>

If one takes the figures for the whole of South Africa, one finds that the percentage of non-Whites in all our business undertakings here is increasing at a steadily increasing rate, and what we have here is not separation but integration at a more rapid pace than we have ever had before.</p>

<p>What was the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply to my charge? The answer was, in the first place, that numbers were not the most important criterion. No, Sir, it is possibly not the most important criterion, but it may be a criterion of success and it may be a criterion of failure, and the figures leave no room for doubt&#x2014;a very important criterion of failure as far as this policy is concerned. The hon. gentleman does not even try to deny that the figures I quoted are correct. He accepts that the numbers have increased by more than 2 million in the past 17 years. Notwithstanding the fact that I have asked him and have repeatedly asked the hon. the Prime Minister to give us an estimate of the cost which would have to be incurred to make this policy a reality, to develop it to such an extent that they would be closer to their ideal, they both remain silent. Not a word was heard from them. They do not mention cost. Now the hon. the Minister says for the second time: This is out policy, we carry it our, it does not matter what the cost is Sir, why do they remain silent? Are they afraid to tell the nation? Surely, they have economists and scientists to estimate these things for them? Why are they afraid to tell the nation? The amount is probably so large that they know that the nation will not be prepared to make those sacrifices. All we could get from the hon. the Minister was an admission that in the first ten years they spent 50 per cent more than Tomlinson recommended. I accept this. But how many of Tomlinson&#x2019;s objectives have they achieved with that extra money they have spent?</p>

<p>Tomlinson recommended that 300,000 families be resettled so that agriculture might be placed on a sound basis. How many families have been resettled? Tomlinson asked that the nature of land tenure be changed. Has this ever been <span class="col_0391-0392" refersTo="page_0214"/>undertaken? No, they washed their hands of this matter as far as the Transkei is concerned, and handed the question of land ownership over to the Legislative Assembly. In Chapter 49 of the Tomlinson Report an indication is given of what the money is to be spent on. Mention is made there of an amount of R54 million to be spent on the reclamation of ground, and we hear that the position in the reserves to-day is virtually worse than it was ten years ago. Sir, what is the use of reading out this list? If they had only implemented Tomlinson&#x2019;s plans, it would have been possible for them to have settled approximately 10 million Bantu in the reserves by the year 1986 or 1990, but at their rate, what is the position going to be? They are making less and less progress and steadily moving away from the ideal of which they themselves spoke. What are the excuses for this slow rate of development? I think that the excuses they are making are very unimpressive. There are attempts at blaming the Bantu. It is said that these people cannot develop more rapidly than they have developed up to now. It is said that the pace depends upon the consent of the white community. Sir, if it depends upon the consent of the white community, then, if I am to believe <i>Die Transvaler,</i> it is going very, very slowly, because was it not <i>Die Transvaler</i> which stated in a leader that the Afrikaners in particular were indifferent to the policy, that they were not interested in it?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, have you ever heard such a ridiculous question? Forty-five per cent of the voters of South Africa voted for this policy. The hon. the Prime Minister would be surprised to hear how many of his former supporters are supporting this policy. But, Sir, there was another phenomenon which was a tragic one, and that was the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement that he did not know as yet what the numbers of the Bantu were. He said that one might just as well try to count the birds of the heavens. Is this the position in which we now find ourselves, that the hon. the Minister in charge of this Department does not know how many Bantu there are? Is that why he cannot give me an estimate of the cost of future development, and is it not possible that these figures may even be much higher than my estimate? The hon. gentleman is apparently quite unaware of the danger of migratory labour and the evils connected with it, because the entire Bantu labour force in South Africa must be converted into migratory labour in terms of their policy.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister was supported by his two Deputy Ministers. One of them is not here this afternoon, but let us draw a veil over his speech. However, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education is present. Sir, his was indeed a tragic speech. The hon. gentleman tried to attack the United Party policy; he said &#x201C;You want to give the people family life,&#x201D; and then he came forward with a figure for the number of single Natives in South Africa. He multiplies it by five; he says the answer is 8 million and that that will be the number of Natives in the white area, over and above those who are there now, if the United Party came into power. Sir, the hon. gentleman is wrong. There are only <i>4&#x00BD;</i> million Bantu left in the reserves. He forgot that large numbers of single Bantu were coming from abroad, people who are not our own Natives, to whom we never promised family life. Then the hon. gentleman tells us that he has decreased the Bantu population of the Peninsula by 4.184 in one year. But at the same time he tells us that he has removed 5.256 children. In other words, the number of adults increased by considerably more than 1,000. He then asked, &#x201C;Does this look like a policy which is a failure?&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, to me it looks like nothing else. It is a policy which is a failure. Then the hon. gentleman boasts of the new agency basis with which he is going to lure more industrialists to the reserves. He does at least admit that the present system is unsatisfactory and that criticism against it over the years was justified. The present policy has never made any progress. Now he realizes that he must make it very much more attractive. Why does he not once and for all do the right thing and take over the policy of the United Party! [Interjections.] Is that a reply to the charge which I levelled in connection with separation? There has not been and there is no division. There is more and more integration; the hon. members only speak of separation.</p>

<p><span class="col_0393-0394" refersTo="page_0215"/>Then there was the second statement I made, i.e. that their second objective was to create separate states. We agreed that anybody could create a separate state, but that it would be extremely irresponsible if there were not sufficient development so to enable that State at least to provide employment to a decent percentage of the population. What do we find? How many opportunities for employment have been created in the reserves over the past six or seven years? A mere 1,000 in industry. It is estimated that within the next four or five years work will have to be provided for at least 39,000 new work-seekers in the reserves each year. If the Government&#x2019;s policy is implemented and they try to decrease the Native population in the white areas at the rate of 5 per cent per year, Professor Sadie estimates that as from 1975 opportunities for employment will have to be created in the reserves for 180,000 new employees annually. What hope is there at the moment that the majority of the Bantu will ever be able to make a living in the reserves under that policy? I challenged the hon. the Minister to deny that in the reserves there were at least 400,000 families which had to be resettled and that it would most probably cost R800 million. Nobody contradicted me. Nobody queried my figures, but what is being done and where is it being done? Every day that we delay there are additional families that must be resettled. I spoke of the situation in Zululand, where there are at least 2 million people who must be resettled. It is quite clear that 1&#x00BD; million of them must be resettled in an industrial area. Where are the employment opportunities going to be created for them? After all Zululand is the easiest, because virtually the whole of Zululand is a border area. When we ask what has been done, we hear of the creation of various kinds of authorities and we hear about how many miles of fencing have been put up. We hear of all kinds of development, but there are not sufficient opportunities for employment in the reserves to afford employment to the natural increase of the Natives who are living there. What is more, the Bantu are still flowing into the White areas in tremendous numbers The worst, however, is that the standard of living of the Bantu in the reserves is getting lower.</p>

It is stated there. Then the hon. the Prime Minister still tells me that they are developing as rapidly as possible. If they are developing as rapidly as possible, then I must frankly tell the hon. the Prime Minister that his policy has already failed.

Do you think, Sir, that if that Native could choose, he would not be prepared to accept partnership?

<p>I have also given those previously, but I am not going to do so again. Having levelled this criticism and mentioned these figures, which were never contradicted, what do I find? I received a request from the hon. member for Prinshof to put forward positive steps for the development of the homelands. Is that hon. member not knocking on the wrong door? Ten years ago, when I promised the then Minister full cooperation and support for the development of the homelands, what was the reply I received? A slap in the face. It was said then that they did not want my help, because it was said that I wanted to develop the homelands for a purpose other than the one for which the Government wanted to develop them. That is where the whole difficulty is to be found. It is precisely because it is for another purpose that such slow progress is being made. It is definitely because the emphasis is being laid upon sovereignty and independence that the pace is so slow and that economic progress is not being effected. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Then there was also the usual criticism. At first it came from the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and of Bantu Education. He said that if one really wanted to retain one&#x2019;s position, one should not begin with a little integration in the economic and political fields, because that would inevitably lead to absolute integration. Mr. Speaker, is there a little economic integration in the border industries, or is there massive integration on a tremendously large scale? If we do that, it is integration; if they do it, it is not integration. But let us put the other question: In that case there is no integration in the political and economic fields as far as the Coloureds are concerned?</p>

<p>There is one criterion for the one Party and another criterion for the other Party. What a ridiculous question! They know as well as I do that they are not heading for equality as far as either the Coloureds or the Bantu are concerned.</p>

<p>Then there was the question from the Deputy Minister: What happens to our policy once the reserves have become independent? Of course, then we can no longer apply our policy to them. That is one of the weaknesses of the policy of this Government. They take steps which they can never retrace when they have made mistakes. It is a final step. Once the harm is done, one cannot restore the position. We shall not make that mistake.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni, the hon. the Prime Minister as well as the Minister of Information referred to the influence of these representatives of the non-Whites in the House of Assembly. The hon. member for Benoni said I should take care lest it is the tail that wags the dog. Well, it all depends on what kind of dog it is. You know, a wet <i>(nat)</i> dog is a very pitiful thing. I can understand that it can be wagged by its own tail, but this does not apply to a U.P. dog!</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister gave me advice and his recommendation was that it was right to yield to pressure in this instance. I know of course, that his whole Party yielded to pressure when they accepted that policy of sovereign independent states. At the time Dr. Verwoerd rose here and said: That is not what we would like to do, but in view of the forces descending upon us we have no other choice. The whole lot of them yielded to pressure.</p>

<p>Then there was the question by the Minister of Information: Supposing there was pressure, and there is a referendum, what advice would my party and I give the nation? If there were to be a referendum now, or as far into the future as I can see at the moment, my advice would simply be that they stand by the number we determined and that they remain White.</p>

I always find this so interesting: These members are quite satisfied that they can maintain to the position, even if they grant those people no rights. What rights did they grant the Coloureds? No rights! But according to them we shall not be able to keep the Bantu in check, even if we do give them a few rights.</p>

<p>I have also changed my views. The only difference is that I used common sense in order to change. The hon. gentleman knows that. Then there are a few members on that side who complain because I speak of a federation, and the various components of the federation will not receive equal rights. But do they not know that it is only under a federal constitution that one can do something like that? One of the oldest federations was that of Germany, i.e. the old Bund of 1870 to 1918, when Prussia virtually dominated the country with the rights it had been granted under the constitution. That was a federation. This is nothing new. It is recognized throughout the world. Surely, the Government ought to understand the German model.</p>

<p>Then the Prime Minister raised the question of the elimination of friction. He claims that there will be less friction under his policy than under the policy I propose.</p>

<p>Sir, can a Minister of Information say that they are getting more than they had? Seventy-five per cent of the Coloureds in South Africa had the right to be placed on the common roll in the Cape if they had the qualifications. What do they have now? [Interjections.] The whole question of friction was raised. I think that we must compare the policy of the Nationalist Party with that of the United Party. I think that any South African who takes an objective interest, would concede that the Government&#x2019;s policy of fragmentation, which relinquishes responsibility, holds dangers for South Africa which our policy avoids. There is safety under the United Party&#x2019;s policy. Uncertainty and unknown dangers lie ahead under the panic-stricken policy of the Nationalist Party. Let us take seven or eight examples. The Nationalist Party wants to divide South Africa up and create eight Native states, which will develop towards sovereignty. This Parliament is going to lose its authority over those areas and over the majority of South Africa&#x2019;s black population. We shall be faced with millions of people in our midst who would owe no loyalty to South Africa. Under the United Party policy this sovereign Parliament remains the authoritative, sovereign government over the whole of South Africa and over all the people of South Africa. Under the Government&#x2019;s policy the Native is taught that he must cultivate a loyalty towards a new, foreign state.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">*HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>A foreign state?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, foreign to South Africa. In the meantime he owes loyalty to both the new state which is coming into being and the old state. Sir, you already know what difficulties there have been in South Africa in the past as a result of double loyalties, with their inconsistencies. This is now envisaged for the immediate future by the Nationalist Party. Under our policy everybody retains one loyalty towards South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am going further. Under the policy of the Government our entire Bantu labour force consists of migratory labourers. They are not allowed to take root in South Africa. This can only accentuate, disunity amongst the population, as the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration explained so well in that thesis he wrote at Oxford. In terms of the policy of the United Party we shall gradually be able to develop amongst our own South African Native population a loyal, orderly middle class&#x2014;something which is inconceivable under the policy of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>There is a fourth comparison. Under the policy of the Government this labour force of migratory people will steadily degenerate and become alienated, not only from their morals, but also from those of Western Christianity, a matter in respect of which the Dutch Reformed Church is in fact giving evidence at the moment and which it is emphasizing. Under the policy of the United Party the Natives will enjoy the character-forming stability of home ownership and sound family life. The policy of the Government wants to teach the labour force to look to foreign states and governments to look after their interests. They want to stand by and see every dispute about employment opportunities and labour forces become an international issue in South Africa. We want to retain all our labourers under one authority, under the one government of South Africa. This Government wants to surround South Africa by eight independent states, each of them a strategic weakness in the planning of defence policy in South Africa. Thousands of miles of our vital coast line will be surrendered to foreign states. We retain South Africa as one military unit. This Government wants to terminate white political control over large parts of South Africa. We retain white political control over the whole of South Africa. Under their policy, once they have made a mistake and granted independence, they cannot go back. They cannot retrace their steps. No, then they are in a position similar to the one in which the British Government found itself in Kenya, and then there is nothing they can do. Under our policy we do not lose that control. I have merely given seven examples of how we can maintain white leadership in South Africa. There are two principles which we accept. One is that our party advocates white leadership, not only in South Africa, but also for the whole of South Africa. The second is that we accept that, attendant upon that white leadership, there are certain obligations and responsibilities towards the non-White population which we are confident the white man will accept. There is a world of difference between this policy and that of the Nationalist Party. They want to terminate white leadership over large parts of South Africa. Furthermore, when one comes to the non-Whites, their whole policy is governed by fear. Fear of numbers, fear of competition, fear of rivalry and fear of the fact that they will deprive them of their opportunities for employment. Now, what do we mean by white leadership? We mean, of course, that we must show that we are competent to be leaders. This also means that we must treat the people with such decency that we may gain their support. It also means that, if necessary, we shall be able to maintain our position.</p>

<p>Now the hon. the Minister wants to know how we are going to find ourselves in such a position. I think that we can only find ourselves in that position and in a position to make South Africa safe for the Whites if the</p>

<p><span class="col_0000-0000" refersTo="page_219"/>Col. 401:</p>

<p>After line 6, insert &#x201C;descendants in South Africa, but also to do his&#x201D;.</p>

<p>After line 10, insert &#x201C;Whites and the second is planned progress and&#x201D;. Line 15: For &#x201C;high&#x201D;, read &#x201C;higher&#x201D;.</p>

<p><span class="col_0401-0402" refersTo="page_0220"/>white man is prepared to develop himself, spiritually, materially, intellectually and in respect of numbers. It is only when he develops himself in that way and casts off the chains of fear that he will be in a position not only to safeguard his own future and that of his duty of civilizing the non-white population in South Africa. It is against this background that the United Party offers a policy based on two pillars. The first is dynamic progress of the advancement for the non-Whites. Quite obviously there are many facets to such a policy. But we shall only be able to accomplish it here and maintain our position, if there is national unity, if we enjoy a high standard of education and training; if we are economically strong and if we can maintain friendly relations both inside and outside South Africa.</p>

<p>The purpose of this motion is to streamline the procedure when dealing with financial business. One of the stages will be eliminated. In other words, the House will not debate a motion to go into Committee, but the relevant Minister will immediately move the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill or the Additional Appropriation Bill or a taxation Bill. The total time, however, provided for has not been reduced. In other words, hon. members will still have the same opportunity and the same length of time to discuss the different measures. But the allocation of time for individual measures will be arrived at by way of negotiation between the Government and the Opposition Whips. This is in the nature of an experiment, and if it works successfully this Session it will be incorporated in the Standing Rules and Orders. I hope that the House will support this innovation.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the House has explained adequately the purpose of this motion. I may say that the motion is put before the House by agreement between both sides. There were negotiations towards the end of last session which were continued in the recess and an agreement was arrived at between the Government side and the Opposition that this would be tried for a session as an experiment. I am certain that there is the spirit on both sides to make this work. It will be in the interests of Parliament if it does work. It depends largely on the measure of agreement we can obtain in arriving at the different times for the different financial measures that come under the ambit of the overall time provided in this motion.</p>

<p>There is just one question I should like to ask the Leader of the House, namely whether he will give an assurance on one point. We did agree on this one item, and that was that if the overall time were exhausted, and it looks as if there is little or no time left for the Appropriation Bill at the end of this Session, a minimum time will be allowed. I am given to understand that there is some difficulty in writing this matter into a motion of this nature, and therefore it would be left, I presume, to the Standing Orders Committee to take such a decision. As it is a matter of agreement between us, I feel confident that the Leader of the House will agree.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<p><i>Point of Order</i></p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to raise a point of order at this stage, and it is whether, in view of the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of section 23 of the South-West Africa Constitution Act of 1968, and in the absence of an appropriate resolution of the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa communicated to Parliament since the passing of that Act by message from the State President as required by subsection (3) of section 23 of the Act, it is competent for this House to consider the South-West Africa Affairs Bill, or, alternatively, whether the Bill is not irregularly before the House, and whether the Bill may be proceeded with further in this House.</p>

<p>The point of order arises from the provisions of the South-West Africa Constitution Act of 1968, section 23 (2) of which provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No Act of Parliament which imposes a tax, duty, due or charge or burden upon the people of the Republic, shall be of force in the territory, but this provision shall be without prejudice to the provisions of sections 5 and 104 of the Customs and Excise Act, 1964 (Act No. 91 of 1964), and to the right to continue to apply to the territory the laws of the Republic relating to customs and excise.</block>

<p>Subsection (3) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 37, the provisions of this subsection or of the preceding subsection shall not be amended, modified, or repealed, except with the consent of the Assembly embodied in a resolution communicated to Parliament by message from the State President.</block>

<p>In the Bill which forms the order of the day under consideration it is provided in clause 15 that those subsections which I have read should be deleted. <i>Ex facie</i> the Bill before us there is no such resolution, and one would normally have expected to have found it in the preamble if there had been one. Clearly, in my submission, those subsections of section 23 provide that, before this House may entertain the provisions of clause 15, such a resolution should have been presented.</p>

<p>As we are all aware, there was a message from the State President which was presented to this House, in 1964, and the minutes of the 29th April, 1964, record that you, Mr. Speaker, received a message from the State President to this House and to the Other Place, and I will read the summary at the end of this entry&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is resolved&#x2014;(1) That this Honourable House (the Legislative Assembly) adopt the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into South-West Africa Affairs in principle; (2) That this Honourable House, in order to facilitate the carrying into effect of the said Commission of Inquiry&#x2019;s recommendations, attach its approval to the amendment or repeal of the said provisions of the Constitution Act &#x2026;</block>

<p>I concede they were similar, if not identical, to those provisions with which we are dealing here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; by the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, in its discretion, and the State President be requested kindly to convey this resolution to the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<p>That was in 1964. This entrenchment of those rights was contained in the 1925 Act and in 1968, last year, by Act 39 of 1968, it was re-enacted, as I have indicated, that the provisions of this subsection should not be repealed without such a resolution communicated to Parliament. The question is: what was the intention of this Parliament last year? Was it the intention of this parliament that there should be no repeal unless there was, at some time in the future, a resolution from the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa? In my submission, that is what was intended, because if it did not mean that, it meant nothing. My submission is further that one cannot assume that Parliament meant nothing when it put something of such import into an Act of Parliament. The situation, in my submission, is that you have to decide, in the same way as you would have to make any decision in respect of our rules, whether this House, as a mere constituent part of Parliament, is enjoined by this Act of Parliament to obey what is stated there. The position is that this Act of Parliament binds the proceedings of this House. It may be changed by this House, together with the other constituent elements. But so long as the Act remains, it is binding and does place a fetter on the proceedings of this House, although not on the sovereignty thereof.</p>

<p>Now, it must have a meaning. In my submission, the resolution of 1964 related in any event to the 1925 Act, which was repealed last year. Furthermore, this provision was then re-enacted. Where it appears in subsection (2) of section 23 the expression &#x201C;No Act of Parliament <span class="col_0409-0410" refersTo="page_0224"/>which imposes a tax &#x2026;&#x201D;, was a reference to an Act of Parliament in the future. It could not be a reference to any other Act. Here is a Bill which is destined to become an Act of Parliament, and which is affected by subsection (2). When this was enacted last year Parliament may be presumed to have been aware of the resolution that existed in 1964. But nevertheless, despite that, this House and Parliament enacted the provisions which I have read out. I submit that that must indicate an intention that there should be a future resolution. But furthermore, since 1964, when that resolution was communicated to you and to the President in the Other Place, there has been a change in the Legislative Assembly in South-West Africa. There is a different Legislative Assembly now than there was in 1964. Indeed, when the Act was passed last year, there was a different Legislative Assembly in South-West Africa from the Legislative Assembly which passed the resolution in 1964. This also, I submit, is a matter of which this House was aware, of which Parliament may be presumed to have been aware at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to canvass all the decisions of which you are aware and which have been canvassed before in this House, all the cases that deal with the question as to whether Parliament may fetter itself, or may fetter one of the Houses constituting it, but I do wish to emphasize that the question of the sovereignty of Parliament does not arise. It is a question as to how this Parliament exercises its rights. As a House, we are bound by that Act. We are bound to obey what that Act stipulates until and unless it is changed. In my submission, it was clearly intended last year that there should be a resolution from the Legislative Assembly if there were to be legislation affecting the rights which I have referred to in the future. There has been no such resolution since the passing of Act 39 of 1968. I have searched the journals of this House. I have not found any. I have made inquiries from those that I feel might know. As far as I am aware, there is no such resolution. In the absence of such a resolution, my submission is that it is not in order to proceed with this Bill, for the reasons I have mentioned.</p>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I regret, of course, that no notice was given to us of this objection by the other side of the House. I think it would have been the correct thing to do, so that we might have been prepared for this argument. But in any event, it was not done. I shall however deal with it immediately.</p>

<p>The effect of a law of Parliament is never deemed to be retrospective. When this Act of 1968 was passed last year this resolution agreeing to this legislation we are passing now had already been presented to this House. This special Act, therefore, does not affect this particular legislation which we have before the House. This is the one point I wish to make. My second point is that this Parliament, which is a sovereign Parliament, is entitled to pass any legislation in regard to any matter, but it cannot bind a future Parliament. For example, our Parliament cannot pass a law which states that our constitution cannot be changed. No future parliament can be bound by such legislation and I feel that this is perfectly clear to everyone in this House. I therefore feel that even if my first argument should not hold water this is still valid legislation. I can only agree to this extent that there will be a moral duty on a future Parliament to consider the legislation and the conditions which were imposed by a previous Act. We find in this case that the resolution is before the House and has already been passed by the Legislative Assembly in South-West Africa, so that morally too there can be no objection to this legislation.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (North) referred to section 18 of Act No. 23 of 1949, which is probably an anomaly. I think it is a settled matter that this Parliament is sovereign. If the hon. member would refer to the discussion that took place on that subject in this Parliament in previous years, when this very matter of South-West Africa was discussed, he would see that he is totally wrong. This matter was settled when it was raised by the then hon. member for Germiston (District), and I want to refer the hon. member for Durban (North) to Hansard, Vol. 2, of 21st February, 1962. I also want to quote an opinion to the hon. member which was given by one of the greatest experts on constitutional law in this country, namely Professor J. P. Verloren van Themaat. In his book <i>Staatsreg</i> he writes on page 400 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If a law expressly, or by necessary legal interpretation, imposes a tax on South-West Africa without the approval of the Legislative Assembly, such a law will in fact be valid.</block>

<p>He bases his opinion on the fact that this Parliament is absolutely sovereign. A man such as Professor Beinart is of the same opinion, namely that it makes no difference because, as the hon. member for Omaruru put it, this Parliament cannot limit its sovereignty or the sovereignty of a future parliament in respect of its benefit of sovereignty or its right to pass legislation. Therefore I submit there is an anomaly in section 18 of Act No. 23 of 1949.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think I ought to point out that the hon. member for Durban (North) appreciated this point only at a very late stage, otherwise he would have given longer notice of his point of order than he, under the circumstances, could. This is the first point I should like to make. Secondly, clause 15 of the Bill which is on the Order Paper for our consideration, states clearly that: &#x201C;Section 23 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of sub-sections<span class="col_0411-0412" refersTo="page_0225"/> (2) and (3)&#x201D;. Well, section 23 (3) states clearly that neither subsection (2) nor subsection (3) of section 23 &#x201C;shall be amended &#x2026; except with the consent of the Assembly embodied in a resolution communicated to Parliament by message from the State President.&#x201D; The question now simply is whether such communication has passed. I submit that in view of the fact that the South-West Africa Constitution Act was passed only last year, and as it seems there has been no communication since then, this legislation is not in order in terms of that Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the arguments advanced by hon. members opposite interest me. Firstly, the hon. member for Omaruru submitted that the 1964 resolution still applied. Well, I submit that it does not. It referred to a particular matter, but the Constitution was amended in 1968. He said that there might be a moral duty on us to abide by that restriction but that he was satisfied because, so he said, there was that resolution before us. But I submit that that resolution is of no effect any longer. Secondly, the hon. member for Middelland reminded us that Parliament was sovereign. Well, we all grant that to be the case. That was known in 1968 when this Act was passed. What was the object of including that section in that Act if we did not intend abiding by it? I submit that although Parliament is sovereign and can do what it likes, the mere fact that we included that provision in the 1968 Act meant that Parliament was going to abide by it. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to look at the matter from that angle.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) was good enough to inform me that he intended raising this point of order and I have accordingly had an opportunity to consider the matter.</p>

<p>As he has pointed out clause 15 of the Bill seeks to repeal subsections (2) and (3) of section 23 of the South-West Africa Constitution Act, No. 39 of 1968, which Act was a purely consolidating measure which re-enacted the law as it stood on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>The hon. member further pointed out that subsection (3) of section 23 of the Act provides that, notwithstanding the provisions of section 37, the provisions of that subsection and the preceding subsection (2) may not be amended, modified or repealed, except with the consent of the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa embodied in a resolution communicated to Parliament by message from the State President.</p>

<p>On 29th April, 1964, such a message was received by the House of Assembly which stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that on 20th March, 1964, the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa had attached its approval by way of resolution to the amendment or repeal by Parliament in its discretion of subsections (2) and (3) of section 28 of the South-West Africa Constitution Act, 1925 (which was subsequently re-enacted by the abovementioned Consolidating Act), and had requested the State President to convey this resolution to Parliament.</p>

<p>In view of the terms of this message I am unable to rule that clause 15 of the Bill under consideration may not be considered by this House.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members will remember that on 3rd June, 1968, during the previous session of Parliament, a White Paper was tabled in this House in regard to the Government&#x2019;s decisions on the recommendations of the Committee of Experts which, under the chairmanship of the then Deputy Minister for South-West Africa Affairs inquired into the practical problems to be taken into account before decisions were taken on any new financial and administrative arrangements between the Republic and South-West Africa. Hon. members will also remember that the appointment of this Committee of experts had its origin in the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into South-West Africa Affairs, known as the Odendaal Commission, which were accepted by the Government in broad principle. In this connection I should like to remind you, Sir, of the Development of Self-government for Native Nations in South-West Africa Act, which was passed last year to give effect to the Commission&#x2019;s recommendations in connection with the establishment of the self-governing areas for the various Native groups in the area, the determination of their boundaries and the amendments to their forms of government.</p>

<p>Paragraph 2 of the White Paper explains how the Committee of Experts, which consisted of representatives of the Republic as well as of South-West Africa, set to work to carry out its terms of reference, while paragraph 3 emphasizes that the sole aim of the financial and administrative rearrangements contemplated is to promote, in accordance with the principles upon which the provisions of the former Mandate are based&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the welfare and security of the Territory and all its population groups, as well as to meet the requirements of the new period of large-scale development upon which the Territory has already entered, by making greater contributions available from the Republic in the financial and administrative fields. The magnitude of the new phase of development is such that overlapping of functions and responsibilities will have to be eliminated as far as possible and greater use made of the facilities at the disposal of the well-equipped departments of the Republic in the spheres of expert guidance, technical knowledge and efficient planning. The aim of the changes contemplated is therefore to promote more efficient administration and <span class="col_0413-0414" refersTo="page_0226"/>to enable the Government to fulfil its responsibilities towards the territory and its inhabitants more effectively. When the Prime Minister announced the proposed reorganization in Windhoek in August, 1967, he emphasized that it was completely legal and in accordance with the spirit of the former Mandate, in terms of which the Government of South Africa was granted full power of administration and legislation over the Territory as an integral portion of South Africa, and that there could therefore be no question of incorporation or a change in the Territory&#x2019;s separate international status.</block>

<p>It goes without saying that if the Government Departments of the Republic must take over certain functions which are at present exercised by branches of the Administration of South-West Africa, provision will be necessary for a lawful distribution of the revenue which is obtained from the Territory. The Committee gave careful attention to the basis on which the financial rearrangement should take place and in this connection, as indicated in paragraph 5 of the White Paper, it took certain broad principles into account, the most important of which are that all taxes derived from South-West Africa should be kept separate and utilized solely for the benefit of the Territory, that any rearrangement should disturb the population of South-West Africa as little as possible and should impose no additional burdens on the taxpayers, and that the Administration should have sufficient sources of revenue at its disposal to finance the functions which it will retain. After the Committee had considered various possible systems, it submitted a recommendation about the most satisfactory basis on which the financial rearrangement could take place. The Government accepted this recommendation and relative details are furnished in paragraph 8 of the White Paper.</p>

<p>The aim of the Bill under consideration is therefore mainly to facilitate the proposed rearrangement as much as possible by means of suitable general provisions. The Government Departments concerned are being given the authority to carry out the proclaimed decisions of the Government in connection with the taking over of functions, and provision is being made for the resultant financial arrangements in so far as legislation is necessary, as well as for consequential and other necessary amendments to certain existing Acts, <i>inter alia,</i> the Consolidated South-West Africa Constitution Act (Act No. 39 of 1968), which was passed last year and which will hereafter be referred to as the &#x201C;principal Act&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The schedule to the Bill contains the list of matters in regard to which the administration of the affairs of the Territory shall be carried on by the relevant Minister of the Republic and which are, of course, being added to the list of matters in the principal Act (section 22) which already fall outside the scope of the ordinary legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory. The most important financial provisions provide for (a) the creation of a special South-West Africa Account into which revenue relating to the scheduled matters, a specific percentage of the Republic&#x2019;s customs and excise revenue, and certain other revenue will be paid for utilization in the Territory by Government Departments, and (b) the revenue which must be paid into the Revenue Fund of the Territory and will be controlled by the Administration. The last-mentioned revenue consists of (a) the revenue relating to matters in regard to which the Legislative Assembly of the Territory may pass ordinances, (b) an annual amount from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Republic, charged to the new South-West Africa Account, in accordance with a fixed formula (see paragraph 8 (c) of the White Paper) and (c) annually as much of the income tax on companies derived from sources in the Territory (except mining) as is prescribed by law.</p>

<p>In view of the establishment of a separate Post Office Fund, provision must, of course, be made for revenue from the Territory in respect of postal, telegraph, telephone and radio matters to be paid into that fund for utilization in accordance with the provisions of the legislation concerned. This arises from the separation of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the decision that posts and telegraphs in the Territory will be administered as an integral part of the Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is customary at the second reading of a Bill to furnish particulars in connection with the contents of the various clauses. In this instance I find it less essential because, as I have said, a White Paper was made available last year which furnished all the particulars in connection with the proposed legislation, and if hon. members study that White Paper they will find in it a proper motivation of the various clauses. Under the circumstances this is actually a measure, except as far as the principles are concerned, which can to a large extent be discussed in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I nevertheless find it desirable just to refer to a few of the more important clauses in the Bill. The large majority of the 25 clauses contained in the Bill are not of particular importance, but there are indeed a few that are important, and I want to begin with clause 14, read in conjunction with the Schedule. Clause 14 is actually an extension of the existing section 22 of the principal Act. Section 22 of the principal Act provided that ordinances in respect of certain matters could not be made by the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa except with the consent of the State President. This list of matters is now being augmented in clause 14, and then one also finds the same list of matters in the Schedule &#x2026;.</p>

<from><span class="col_0415-0416" refersTo="page_0227"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They very nearly correspond, but not quite, i.e. the Schedule and the particulars as set out in clause 14. In the first place clause 14 amends section 22 in certain respects and then supplements it. In other words, it is only certain of the matters that are now indicated in clause 14 as being the scheduled matters to which reference is made in the Schedule.</p>

<p>The second important clause is clause 19, which makes provision for the administration of these matters which previously fell under the jurisdiction of the Administration of South-West Africa, now to be transferred to the respective Ministers in the Republic.</p>

<p>Then there is clause 20, to which I want to refer briefly. This clause empowers the State President, by way of proclamation, to make certain laws, with amendments or additions or whatever, applicable to the Territory. I just want to mention in passing that this clause is essential. Perhaps it will never be used, but for the purposes of the practical rearrangement which is going to take place it may be necessary that certain amendments, in respect of the legislation applicable to South-West Africa will have to be made at short notice. Therefore it is necessary that such powers be granted so that if it should become necessary certain laws of the Republic, with additions or changes, can be made applicable there by proclamation by the State President. I think it goes without saying that it is not envisaged that the laws of the Republic will be made applicable <i>in toto,</i> or as they are contained in the Statute Book, to South-West Africa, but that in all probability there will be amendments, additions or omissions in respect of these laws in so far as they are to be made applicable in South-West Africa according to the circumstances there.</p>

<p>Then there are the financial arrangements in clause 22, where provision is made for a formula in terms of which South-West Africa will receive a portion of the moneys of the South-West Africa Account, in so far as South-West Africa will probably not have sufficient revenue for the administration of its own affairs. On the face of it this formula seems terribly complicated, but it is not quite so complicated, and an analysis it appears to be a highly scientific one. It boils down to the fact that &#x201C;a&#x201D; represents the average annual expenditure of South-West Africa for the past five years, and &#x201C;b&#x201D; the average revenue. In other words, the difference between expenditure, which will be greater, and the expected revenue, comes above the line in the formation of this formula. Below the line one finds in the first place the expenditure for which the Republic will be responsible in respect of the administration and handling of the scheduled matters. That is &#x201C;c&#x201D;, and to &#x201C;c&#x201D; is then added, below the line, South-West Africa&#x2019;s shortfall, in other words the difference between the expenditure and the revenue. On an analysis the formula is actually not so complicated and has been devised altogether scientifically to give to South-West Africa, for its administration, a percentage of that portion of the revenue, on the basis of the past five years.</p>

<p>I believe, and in that belief I move the Second Reading of the Bill, that what is now being proposed here not only accords with our obligations and relationships towards South-West Africa, but will also contribute greatly to the better administration of South-West Africa and the greater development of that Territory. In that spirit I move the Second Reading.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, whatever the differences may be between the two sides of the House on this Bill&#x2014;and I think there may well be considerable differences&#x2014;I want to make it clear right at the very outset that it is common cause between the Government and the Opposition that the Republic has every right in international law, whether the mandate still exists or whether it has ceased to exist, to do what it is proposing to do under this Bill. I want no mistake about that, Sir, and that is why I emphasize it at the beginning.</p>

<p>I want to say that I have looked at the provisions of this Bill very carefully indeed, as I am sure many others have done, and I am satisfied that the provisions of this Bill in no way alter the international status or character of the territory. I say this with more conviction because it was my privilege to be in this House some 20 years ago and to hear the late Field-Marshal Smuts deal in this House with the negotiations which had led to the Treaty of Versailles in so far as they affected South-West Africa. He told us on that occasion of the attempts made by General Botha and himself to get South-West Africa incorporated into the Union. He told this House it was only the programme of President Wilson of the U.S.A. that had prevented them from succeeding, but he said, and here I want to quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We came as near incorporation as possible. The declaration of this territory as an integral part of the Union brought us as near actual incorporation as we could possibly get. There is no doubt about it&#x2014;it is on record&#x2014;that at one stage the President was anxious to insert the words &#x201C;as if&#x201D; an integral part. I resisted that very strongly because I saw at once what the implication of that would be; that it would not be an integral part but would only be treated as if it were. The insertion of those words was successfully resisted. The President acquiesced, and in all the years since then South-West Africa has been an integral part of South Africa.</block>

<p>There is thus no quarrel between us as to our right to do what is proposed in this Bill. There is no suggestion of incorporation or veiled annexation. It is merely a means of administering this territory as an integral part of South Africa. What I want to debate this <span class="col_0417-0418" refersTo="page_0228"/>afternoon, what is in issue between us, is the wisdom of the steps suggested and the wisdom of taking them at the present time.</p>

<p>The Bill cannot be looked at in isolation, it must be looked at as part of a pattern, and that pattern is the Government&#x2019;s whole pattern for the development in the future of South-West Africa. That pattern is very different indeed from the pattern of development which we on this side of the House should like to see for South-West Africa. That is the main reason why we cannot support this Bill. There are other reasons too, but that is the main reason. These proposals cut right across what is our vision for the future of South-West Africa. I have outlined those proposals before in this House, and perhaps I should do so again very briefly.</p>

<p>We believe the formula should be a formula based on the acceptance of a federal concept and federal links between the Republic and South-West Africa. We accept that it is a historical fact that the territory has been divided into two areas, that north of the red line, which has always had a measure of autonomy, and that south of the red line. We have suggested that these two regions should each have their own form of autonomy and that the traditional constitutional pattern should be maintained. We believe that a further subdivision, namely cutting out the so-called &#x201C;White portion&#x201D; in the southern area, is not practical nor useful nor in the interests of the population. We believe the division between north and south should be recognized, and we have suggested that the administration of the northern region, that is to say, beyond the police zone, the Kaokoveld, Ovamboland, Okavangoland, and the Caprivi Zipvel, should be modernized as fast as possible to the point where each group manages matters of intimate concern to itself by means of communal councils, and that there should be a northern legislative body which has either a federal link with the southern area and through that with the Republic, or directly with the Republic.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister does not seem to be able to count above two or three, except when it comes to counting sovereign, independent states which he is going to cut out of South-West Africa and the Republic of South Africa. We have suggested that in the southern area, rather than limiting the powers of the present legislative assembly, it would be more in the spirit of the mandate to extend those powers and make that legislative assembly responsible for the whole southern portion of South-West Africa, with representation for the non-white group in that assembly and a federal link with the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>I think it is quite clear from what I have said that we on this side are in favour of a great measure of autonomy and of local self-government and the maintenance of federal links between the Republic and the peoples of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>I believe that such an arrangement could only lead to friendly co-operation between the racial groups, the development of one loyalty to one state and one central government. It would enable the various groups to retain control of matters of more intimate concern to themselves. Friction on those matters could be avoided, while matters of national importance would be decided by the Central Government of the Republic and South-West Africa.</p>

<p>It is quite clear from the provisions of this Bill that they are completely contrary to the direction which we would like to take. Where we would like to see more powers and greater autonomy for the legislative assembly in the south, this Bill curtails that power severely and reduces the southern area, inhabited by the Whites, to a sort of pseudo-provincial council. Here it is interesting to note two very important aspects. The first is that these proposals by the Government are contrary to what was the trend for many years before 1949. I remember that, while the 1949 legislation was being discussed, when we replaced the 1925 Constitution, General Smuts and Dr. Malan told us about their negotiations with both political parties in South-West Africa. I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that you will remember it very well. I remember General Smuts saying how South-West Africa wanted to run its own affairs, how they wanted a constitution that would give them a greater measure of freedom and how the then Prime Minister, Dr. Malan, introduced that constitution in this House, with the express purpose of giving South-West Africa a greater measure of freedom and greater control over its own affairs. What they wanted, was more power for their Legislative Assembly. They received that. They have had increasing powers from 1919, 1925 and 1949, and even in the early 1950&#x2019;s the trend was all that way when we were up there fighting the general election.</p>

<p>The second matter that is important, is that this is not only contrary to the trend which has existed over a long period in South-West Africa, until only a few years ago, but these proposals are in sharp contrast to the proposals laid down in other legislation in respect of <span class="col_0419-0420" refersTo="page_0229"/>the non-white areas of South-West Africa, the embryo non-white nation states, which the Government hopes to create in South-West Africa. In fact, while provision is being made to give the non-Whites greater and wider powers, the Whites of the Territory, in so far as their Legislative Assembly is concerned, are under this legislation going to have their wings clipped and to lose powers they have exercised up there for a very long time. The effect of this legislation is to put the clock back very many years in so far as the constitutional development of the whites in South-West Africa is concerned. It amounts to the scrapping of the existing constitution, namely the one consolidated here last year, and the substitution for it of a pseudo-provincial system, which seems to me to hold no benefits for the white population of South-West Africa, as it will deprive them of effective control over the major share of the country&#x2019;s revenue. But it leaves the international status of the territory unaltered. Likewise. I wonder Whether it holds so much benefit for the Republic. It is an advance, of course, in the direction of an ideological goal, but it is of very little benefit to our Government. While giving it effective control of the major part of South-West Africa&#x2019;s revenue, we feel that money still has to be spent in South-West Africa. Here we find that the Legislative Assembly has been stripped of its powers and that it is being deprived of its power to control a major part of the revenue of the territory.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says &#x201C;at their request&#x201D;. I will deal with this question later. We, in return, will get the power to deal with the rest, but we have to spend it in South-West Africa. It must be noted that this step is not being taken because the South-West Africa Legislative Assembly or the Administration has abused its powers or has been guilty of inefficient administration. That is not the reason. The Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s report abounds with compliments with regard to the South-West African Administration and its efficiency. What are the reasons? The White Paper gives some of the reasons and the hon. the Minister has not sought to embellish upon them. Let us look at some of the reasons given for the changeover. It is suggested that this change will promote the welfare and security of the Territory and all its population groups. But will it? This deprives the Whites of the control of the bulk of the Territory&#x2019;s revenue and how it should be spent in the interests of all the groups. I know it is going to be redistributed in a way that will give the non-Whites a large share of that revenue. At the same time, however, you are tampering with the economy of that country. Are you not weakening the position of the white man, Who is the mainstay and the backbone of the country&#x2019;s economy? For this you are not substituting a corresponding strength in the economy of the non-white areas from which the whole country will benefit in a measure corresponding to the increased expenditure on non-Whites. You are building infra-structures in those territories. The history of Africa has shown that the non-Whites prosperity is dependent on the white man and that if the white man&#x2019;s position deteriorates the non-white is often the greatest sufferer. What is happening under this legislation? You are dividing up the economy of South-West Africa into several little economies. Are they going to be able to co-operate? Are they going to work together? Are they going to be able to produce the self-same standard of living for everybody as what you are able to do at the present time? Moreover, you are taking the financial control out of the hands of the well-informed Legislative Assembly, in close touch with the needs of the territory, and you are putting it in the hands of this Parliament, where the influence of the hon. members representing South-West Africa can easily be swamped and where their effectiveness can be greatly affected by the provisions of clause 20, with which I will deal later.</p>

<p>It is also suggested in the White Paper that the change will promote more efficient administration. But will it? South-West Africa is a vast territory. It is an awful long way from Pretoria and the White Paper itself seems to recognize this by proposing the appointment of numerous supervisors in South-West Africa to provide for expeditious administration. In numerous cases officials left in South-West Africa would have to act as agents for the various departments of the Government. I foresee lots of difficulties in regard to this. I do not know that the Central Administration can be so proud of its record. I seem to remember the purchase of 340 farms in two years for R19 million for the settlement of the so-called non-white races in South-West Africa. How many of them have been settled and how many have been leased back to farmers, sometimes to the former owners? What is the state of those farms at the present time? I do not know whether this is an episode of which to be so proud. We have always recognized that South-West Africa and its Legislative Assembly could be treated differently from the other provinces. There are quotations going far back in time. General Smuts himself can be quoted as saying that he was quite happy that the South-West African legislature had greater powers than the Provincial Councils, because, he said: &#x201C;Look at the geographical position. Look at the distances involved. Look at the problems with which they are faced.&#x201D; We have, of course, recognized that. We have recognized that in this House by the fact that we have given them far more members than their population of voters would entitle them to. It is a recognition of the same thing.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, but I did not catch that interjection. It was also suggested in the White Paper that this <span class="col_0421-0422" refersTo="page_0230"/>change would promote greater security. How can it promote greater security unless there is greater clarity in respect of the international status of the territory? That status is, of course, not affected by this Bill. There is still a question mark. This Bill does not affect it. We are agreed on that. I am sure that, in making this statement, the composers of the White Paper were not thinking of security from the point of view of terrorist activity, because, as you know. Sir, the Police have always been under the control of the Central Government, and this makes no change in that regard. They suggested that the change would enable the South African Government to fulfil its responsibilities towards the territory more effectively. That I doubt, Sir, but what I do know is that it will place the Government in a strong position to spend South-West African money to create a fine display window for its Bantustan policy. In fact, one is inclined to wonder whether the real motive underlying the Government&#x2019;s plan was not disclosed in the report of the Odendaal Commission, where the commissioners say in paragraph 208 that one reason for the take-over of administrative responsibilities is that it would be more in the spirit of the mandate if the expenditure on development in South-West Africa were made in the name of the Republican Government rather than in the name of the South-West African Administration. That seems to me to be one of the real reasons for this administrative change.</p>

<p>Then there is talk of a greater use to be made&#x2014;and the Minister read this out&#x2014;of the facilities at the disposal of the well-equipped departments of the Republic in spheres of expert guidance, technical knowledge and efficient planning. I must say, Sir, that that does not impress me either. That expert knowledge and planning has always been available, as the hon. the Minister knows. What has been missing is the manpower to carry it out. Is this Bill going to make any difference to the manpower available? I am informed that there has been a shortage of manpower to do the work, not a lack of planning and departments with expert knowledge. One comes to the conclusion that this is not a Bill designed to bring South-West Africa as a whole nearer to the Republic. It is a Bill designed to reduce the white area of the territory to a sort of provincial status and to facilitate the development of the non-White areas into nation states heading for independence. That is the idea behind the Bill. It is all part of the dangerous pattern which may easily have disastrous results for South-West Africa. If the security and the safe future of the country are to be the yardstick, then I believe that the proposals which we have put forward, and which are entirely contrary to this Bill, would be of infinitely more benefit and advantage to South-West Africa and all its people.</p>

<p>Now. Sir, there is a suggestion that this is being done at the request of the Legislative Assembly. I know that the all-powerful Nationalist Party in South-West Africa got a resolution through that Assembly, but I wonder whether the people really understand what is being done. I wonder whether they realize to what extent the powers of their Legislative Assembly are going to be clipped, and to what extent they are going to be stripped of those powers. I wonder whether it was not a consent given because of a desire to be faithful to the non-European policies of the Nationalist party rather than in the interests of the Territory as a whole.</p>

<p>In the proposals which I outlined as being supported by this side of the House, there was a place for the Coloured people. But what place have they here? They are now going to be controlled by the Department of Coloured Affairs. It is suggested in the White Paper&#x2014;there is no provision for this in the Bill&#x2014;that they are going to be given certain representation on the Coloured Representative Council. We have not yet heard whether that is going to be implemented or not. But. Sir, they are not going to have any representation in South-West Africa. They are not going to have any representation in this Parliament. Because of the Government&#x2019;s lack of policy in respect of the Cape Coloured people, their future too is going to be left to be decided by our children.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, there is the position of the Rehoboth Bastards.</p>

We know the difficulties which led to a magistrate being appointed in charge of them. We know that certain negotiations have been undertaken. But where are we going now?

<p>I am very glad to hear that. The Prime Minister tells me that they now have the minutes. That is most satisfactory. But the question still remains: Where are we going with these people? What is their future in this area? One cannot talk of independence for such a small group, just as one cannot talk of independence for the Namas. What is their future going to be in this little enclave which is going to be administered as a province from Pretoria?</p>

<p><span class="col_0423-0424" refersTo="page_0231"/>I think I have said enough to make it clear that our thinking on this side of the House is so far removed from the principle of this Bill that it is not possible for us to support it, and also that there does not seem much point in discussing the details of the different clauses. We disagree with the whole fundamental concept and I do not think that details matter very much. But the hon. the Minister will agree that there are perhaps two clauses to which I should direct attention. The first is clause 9, which changes the method of election of members of the Executive Committee. It was proportional representation in the old days. It is now to be changed to the &#x201C;winner take all&#x201D; principle. We debated that matter in this House six or seven years ago in respect of the provincial councils in South Africa. This change is now being brought about in South-West Africa. I wonder whether hon. members opposite feel that it has been such a success in our own country that we should extend it further. I have considerable doubts, Mr. Speaker. When one sees the sort of mess that has been made in some provinces, then one wonders whether we have adopted the right principle in this regard. I think we should hesitate to extend it further.</p>

<p>Sir. I must confess that I was thinking of the Transvaal particularly, and particularly of some of the scandals we have had there lately. There was a little trouble in the Free State too.</p>

<p>The second clause to which I want to draw attention is clause 20 which is headed: &#x201C;Application and amendment of laws by State President&#x201D;. I think this clause is worthy of some attention. The hon. the Minister says that it is an essential clause. He says perhaps it will not be used, but it is nevertheless necessary to have power to act at short notice. Sir, the provisions of this clause are to the effect that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;If the State President considers it to be necessary for the proper administration of the affairs of the territory in terms of this Act, he may from time to time by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) declare any provision of any law of the Republic, which in his opinion relates to a scheduled matter, to apply in the territory or in the territory excluding such portions thereof as may be specified in the proclamation, subject to such amendments, additions, modifications, exceptions or conditions as he may deem fit;</li>

<li>(b) repeal, amend or modify any provisions of any law in force in the territory in as far as in his opinion it relates to a scheduled matter;</li>

<li>(c) amend or modify any provision of any law of the territory relating to the expropriation of land or other property for public purposes.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then, Sir, leaving out one subsection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State President may from time to time by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> amend any proclamation issued under subsection (1) and, if he considers it to be necessary, declare any such amendment to be of retrospective effect.</block>

<p>Sir, these are tremendous powers; these are extremely wide powers. One knows that under the old Act. No. 39 of 1968, the State President had certain powers. He had the power by proclamation to make laws for the territory in relation to any matter in regard to which the Assembly may not in terms of section 22 make ordinances, but that power in the consolidated Act which we passed last year was subject to two safeguards; the first was: so long and as far only as it is not repugnant to or inconsistent with an Act of Parliament which applies in the territory and, secondly, that those proclamations had to be laid on the Tables of the Senate and the House of Assembly within 14 days if Parliament was sitting or, if not, then within 14 days of Parliament assembling, and the House of Assembly and the Senate by joint resolution had the power to declare those proclamations to be of no force and effect. But here we have a position where the State President is given enormous powers. Of course, one realizes that it is not the State President; it is the State President acting on the advice of the Cabinet. The Cabinet is being given enormous powers here. It can decide that parts of an Act must be applied to South-West Africa. It can amend an Act passed by this Parliament and, having amended it, apply it to South-West Africa. It can leave bits out of the Act; it can put an Act in force and, having put it in force, it can withdraw it, alter it and make it of retrospective effect. Sir, these are enormous powers. There is no state of emergency in South-West Africa. Why are these powers being asked for? Why are there no safeguards? It seems to me that this is a complete admission that there may be an absolute administrative break-down. What is the reason? Do you see, Sir, what we are doing? This sovereign Parliament of the Republic of South Africa is being asked to divest itself of certain powers in favour of the Cabinet, allowing the Cabinet to put these schemes into operation in respect of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, what is the position now of the members of South-West Africa? They come to this Parliament and they give their advice. It may be accepted or it may be ignored and then the Cabinet can go and act without consulting them and do what it likes in South-West Africa virtually and they will have no say. They may not even be consulted. They seem to become almost rubber stamps and it seems to me that they are being placed in a most invidious position. Sir, if you look at clause 14 of this Bill, you find that they are placed in a most invidious <span class="col_0425-0426" refersTo="page_0232"/>position in respect of some very important matters. There is the administration of justice and a large range of subjects to do with it. Then you have water affairs, a matter of vital importance; then there are matters relating to the adoption of children, the welfare of children, juveniles and aged persons; there are matters relating to mining and matters relating to agriculture. In respect of all these matters vast powers are being given to the State President. You could understand it if they were given in respect of matters affecting the security of the State, or emergencies, but these are vitally important everyday matters which should be considered carefully and weighed up and in which the opinion of members of this House should have proper consideration.</p>

<p>I accept that the hon. gentleman has good intentions but, as you know, Sir, there is a place &#x2026; the road to which is paved with good intentions. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. That has been said so many times. What is the function of this House if these powers are to be given to the Cabinet and there is to be no control, as there should be in any democracy?</p>

<p>I think we should ask ourselves whether this Bill is necessary, whether we are embarking on a wise course or whether we are moving in the wrong direction. We on this side of the House think that we are moving in a wrong direction with this legislation. We were not entirely satisfied with the 1949 legislation. We had difficulties with it; we knew what the troubles were. We had difficulties with South-West Africa retaining control over taxation on mines; we were worried about certain taxation matters, but the general road seemed to be the right one, allowing them to manage their own affairs and giving them greater freedom. That road, Sir, is being reversed as far as the Whites are concerned, but as far as the non-Whites are concerned, they are to be helped along the road to independence. Small groups, tiny communities, people who could not even fill a village or small town in many countries of the world, are being told that they are being placed on the road to independence. Why this difference?</p>

<p>Then comes the last question: Is it wise to take these steps at this time? I have participated in this debate very largely to make it absolutely clear that the Opposition is satisfied that we have the power to do what is being done. It means no change in international status. Sir, my last question is this: Is it wise to do it at this time? There are going to be trouble-makers throughout the world who are going to try to seize on this, who are going to try to give it a different interpretation. Just at a time when it seems that the fires are burning low in respect of South-West Africa we come with legislation of this kind. Is it worth it, Sir? What real advantages do we get; what real advantages do the people of South-West Africa get? I believe that it is most unwise. I do not believe that the advantages that you will get out of it are worth the disadvantages to which we may be subjected. I believe that it is a movement in the wrong direction. For that reason we shall vote against this Bill.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for having stated explicitly at the beginning of his speech that what the Government was doing to-day was quite constitutional and that even the Opposition had no objection to it as such. But after he had spoken for some time, I was very sorry, sorry for the population of South-West Africa, for the Nationalists and the supporters of the United Party in South-West Africa, because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to-day once again placed us in the midst, one could say in the mouth, of the U.N. I can give you the assurance, Sir, that the U.N. will scrutinize every word spoken here to-day on this Bill in order to see whether it cannot draw any venom from what was said.</p>

<p>I come to the hon. member for South Coast. I remember that another debate on South-West Africa was conducted in this House approximately 20 years ago, and that at that time he gave his Party the sound advice that South-West Africa was a matter about which there was to be no party squabbling; it was a matter to be kept out of politics. I wonder whether the hon. member for South Coast has lost his influence in the caucus of the United Party this year, seeing that they have raised this delicate issue of South-West Africa in this House in this way.</p>

<p>Sir, in a few days time it will be exactly 20 years ago, February, 1949, that another debate on the same subject was in progress in this House, and I should like the Opposition to have a look in the mirror to-day so that it may see itself in the image it presented in 1949. I want to make a few quotations from the Hansard report of that time. At that time the <span class="col_0427-0428" refersTo="page_0233"/>Opposition objected to South-West Africa obtaining control over its own finances. To-day it wants to grant additional powers to South-West Africa. At that time they opposed this with might and main and called for divisions on the issue. I want to quote what the Leader of the Opposition, the late General Smuts, said about the issue. He was referring to the right which was being granted to South-West Africa to control its own finances, and on that occasion he said the following. I am quoting from Hansard of 17th February, 1949, col. 1295. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The effect is that in the future the mines in South-West Africa&#x2014;the mining revenues derived from those mines&#x2014;will be the sole concern of South-West Africa, and I say that that is most unfair to the Union. Supposing that the same attitude had been adopted at the National Convention and that the Transvaal mines and mining revenues had been left to the Transvaal; what would have happened to the Union?</block>

<p>Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why should we give this enormously privileged basis to South-West Africa? We cannot do it. &#x2026; I think it is a monsterous provision to make.</block>

<p>On the next page he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is a change which we should not allow. It is to my mind, a monsterous thing.</block>

<p>The hon. members for Yeoville and Transkei and all the other hon. members opposite spoke in the same vein.</p>

<p>Precisely. Now the Opposition comes along, 20 years later, and they say that South-West Africa should receive more of these powers; they want to introduce a federal system in South-West Africa. Is this not a complete somersault? In 1949 they objected to South-West Africa retaining only its finances, authority over its own income tax, but this year they say that South-West Africa should obtain increased powers; its solution was not to be found in its having to have its political future in close association with the Republic. One asks oneself, &#x201C;What has happened in the interim to have made the United Party undergo such a drastic change of attitude?&#x201D; I did not know what that was until it suddenly occurred to me that an election will be held in Windhoek before long. That is why the United Party is now making an attempt to pave the way for the United Party in South-West Africa, for its compeer there. But this too will not be of any avail. I can give the hon. the Leader of the Opposition the assurance that the United Party will suffer one of its most crushing defeats ever on the 5th March. There is no doubt about this. But I want to show and hold up to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a mirror of the U.N.S.W.P. and its leader in South-West Africa, so that he may see with what people he is associating himself to-day; because the attitude he adopted to-day was that of the U.N.S.W.P. of South-West Africa, which has had its day and which at present does not have a single seat either in the House of Assembly or in the Legislative Assembly. He has no chance of making any impression on the voters of South-West Africa. I have here a speech by the Leader of the Opposition there, Advocate J. P. Niehaus, which was published in their own mouthpiece, <i>Die Suidwes-Afrikaner,</i> of 19th July, 1968. He said here, and these are the people the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is echoing (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With this take-over &#x2026;</block>

<p>He said this with reference to the Bill at present under consideration in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Republic will gain control over sources which are very valuable to it.</block>

<p>The leader of the U.N.S.W.P. created the impression that this legislation was to be passed because the Republic was keen to pocket the finances of South-West Africa. Sir, I say this is a reprehensible statement. He went on to say in his newspaper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The beautiful building which has been erected in Windhoek, will be occupied by a number of people who are not worthy of the building.</block>

<p>I call this a disgrace. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Speaker &#x2026;</block>

<p>This still refers to the leader of the Opposition there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; wanted to know how much time would be devoted in that Parliament to the affairs of South-West Africa. What influence could South-West Africa&#x2019;s six members have there?</block>

<p>He continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is more, the Republic will first see to itself before it will do anything for South-West Africa.</block>

<p>This is the type of propaganda which is being made in South-West Africa against this legislation <span class="col_0429-0430" refersTo="page_0234"/>by the allies of the hon. members opposite. But, Sir, this is nothing indeed. I want to show you, Sir, what they are in fact doing. I have here a front page report which appeared in that party&#x2019;s mouthpiece of 13th August, 1968, and this report was published in consequence of this legislation. The headlines are (translation), &#x201C;Vorster attaches little importance to South-West Africa&#x201D;, and the report reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under legislation which has been announced by the Government, the White part of South-West Africa will become a sort of second-class part of the Republic.</block>

<p>Further on the following appears&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From a strategic and international point of view, however, South-West Africa is of major importance to the Republic, and South-West Africa will be able to yield large profits to the South African Government after the take-over of its finances.</block>

<p>This is what was said of this legislation by the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s ally in South-West Africa. But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does not even want to contradict him, and then he comes along with his so-called federal system. I want to read to the hon. member from Hansard, General Smuts&#x2019;s rejection of this federal system.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me every hon. member opposite has his own federal system. Nevertheless, on 17th February, 1949, General Smuts referred to these increased powers for South-West Africa, powers for which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is pleading at the present time, and this is what he said about them (Hansard, vol. 66, col. 1297)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am prepared to go far to make concessions to South-West Africa, but where it is proposed to make this concession I cannot agree to it. I think we shall be making a grave mistake. This really introduces the federal principle into our system.</block>

<p>This is the system which he rejected. This is exactly the opposite of what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to-day. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to suggest that the federal system has to be introduced in respect of South-West Africa because it was such a really advantageous one, why does he not advocate the same system for the Free State and the Transvaal and Natal and the Cape Province? It would not surprise me if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, if he wanted to be consistent, were to introduce a motion here to-morrow to the effect that our provincial system was a bad one and that we should apply the federal system in the Republic. In what respect does the position of Natal, the Free State, the Cape Province and the Transvaal differ from that of South-West Africa? Before coming to the other remarks made by the Opposition, I first want to make a few remarks in respect of this whole constitutional issue. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition associated himself with the U.N.S.W.P. to-day. I want to give hon. members in this House an image of the U.N.S.W.P. as far as this issue is concerned; a Party that has changed its attitude regarding the political future of South-West Africa from year to year and from election to election. In 1927 the attitude of the U.N.S.W.P. in respect of South-West Africa was &#x201C;annexation by the Union&#x201D;. I am placing this in inverted commas, because these are the exact words taken from the resolution adopted at their congress. In 1928 it merely was &#x201C;closer association with the Union&#x201D;. In 1929 they wanted &#x201C;a larger degree of self government&#x201D;. In 1932 they made propaganda for&#x2014;and once again I am placing this in inverted commas&#x2014;&#x201C;the incorporation of South-West Africa with the Union&#x201D;. In 1934 it was &#x201C;a fifth province of the Union or otherwise as an integral part of the Union&#x201D;. In 1940, and once again at their congress, &#x201C;incorporation with the Union without any reservations and without any strings attached&#x201D;. In 1953 the resolution of their congress was that they wanted to stand on their own feet and wanted to work out their own salvation. In 1954 they wanted an independent status for South-West Africa. In 1955 they wanted recognition as an &#x201C;independent state&#x201D;. This then is the Party of which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is a faithful ally to-day. I can think of only one person in this House who can beat this record of the U.N.S.W.P., and he is the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who has belonged to five different parties since the discussion of this legislation in this House 20 years ago.</p>

<p>I do not think there is any need to deal with rights which the original mandate agreement gave the Republic, namely &#x201C;full powers of administration as an integral part&#x201D;, as was quoted by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Indeed, there was no need for the then Union of South Africa to grant any degree of self-government to South-West Africa. It could administer South-West Africa by proclamation; as a matter of fact, the mandate agreement provides explicitly that it may administer South-West Africa with its own laws. The only condition is that it has to observe certain provisions of the mandate agreement, <i>inter alia,</i>those relating to slave trading, penal servitude, arms and ammunition, intoxicating liquor and freedom of religion. Subject to those conditions, it could have administered South-West Africa by proclamation up to this day.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. member and I now have a <span class="col_0431-0432" refersTo="page_0235"/>point about which we agree. In a short while the hon. member will agree with me even more. The only reason why South-West Africa has been guided in the direction of a fifth province and why it has obtained increased powers, is that experience has proved the provincial system to be the ideal one in Southern Africa. That is why it is possible to welcome this new legislation which was submitted to Parliament to-day and which grants increased powers to Parliament, because this has been proved to be the well-tried system which is working well in respect of the four provinces of South Africa. Consequently indications are that it will also be the ideal system for South-West Africa. As long as there is prosperity in South-West Africa, it is understandable that no change is actually necessary to the powers granted to the Legislative Assembly as compared to those granted to Parliament. At present South-West Africa possesses large sources of revenue. At the present moment South-West Africa can continue on its own, but this does not mean that that will always be the case; as a matter of fact, South-West Africa&#x2019;s sources are extremely uncertain at present. For instance, one of its sources is taxation on diamonds while diamond mines are a diminishing asset. Another source is the fishing industry which is also a diminishing one, and we are aware of the ever-increasing interest shown in the fishing industry along the West Coast of South-West Africa by foreign powers. The karakul industry in its turn is dependent on fashions from Paris&#x2014;all uncertain and changeable assets. But we cannot continue in this way for ever; as a matter of fact, the status which South-West Africa has derived from the fact that it has retained certain powers in respect of finance and other matters, has left in its wake a great deal of uncertainty about its political future, a very large question-mark. This is the most important reason why South-West Africa to-day welcomes this legislation with open arms.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>They welcome this legislation because it gives them a large degree of certainty about the political future of South-West Africa. It is being linked more closely to the Republic, and this is what South-West Africa wants. We know, and this has also been said and admitted by various foreign concerns, that one of the most important reasons why South-West Africa has had to depend chiefly on capital from the Republic and not from overseas is the fact that foreign investors have been hesitant to invest in South-West Africa because they did not know what was going to become of South-West Africa. This Bill will be the most potent injection for economic development South-West Africa has been given since the establishment of the mandate in 1920. This is absolutely true. There are various reasons why South-West Africa cannot but welcome this legislation to-day. In the first place, it will bring increased administrative benefits for South-West Africa&#x2014;more efficiency and less overlapping of the departments, as the hon. the Minister said when moving the second reading motion. As regards administrative problems, it has also been South-West Africa&#x2019;s experience that it could not readily obtain officials from the Republic because officials in the Republic are under the impression that if they accept a post in South-West Africa, they are side-tracked with fewer chances to be considered for further promotion in the Republic. Consequently we have had to grant special territorial benefits to attract officials to the territory. Now the officials of the Republic will administer South-West Africa as one of the provinces.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Will those benefits fall away?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>No, the benefits will not fall away. What is more, South-West Africa cannot expect the Republic to spend large sums of money in South-West Africa, as proposed in the Odendaal Report, while the officials of the Republic have no control over such expenditure. That is why this is absolutely essential. The financial benefits which are attached to this legislation are so great that South-West Africa in fact has no second thoughts about accepting this legislation. It has always been a complaint abroad that South-West Africa as not being developed to an adequate extent; as a matter of fact at one stage Advocate Niehaus, the leader of the U.N.S.W.P., said to the U.N. delegation under Carpio with regard to the phenomenon that South-West Africa was lagging behind in its economic development, that they had to exercise pressure on the National Government from the outside and that they, the U.N.S.W.P. would exercise pressure from the inside for increased development to take place. But South-West Africa is receiving other major advantages. For example, the split railway tariff is being abolished, which is a major advantage to South-West Africa. This will bring South-West Africa a tangible economic advantage of close on R4 million. Just consider what a difference this will make to the cost of living of the people living on the pioneers frontier of South-West Africa. But to me as a South-West African the most important advantage contained in this legislation is the fact that the changeable economy of South-West Africa will be linked to the firm anchor of the Republic&#x2019;s economy, which is at present regarded as one of the most stable economies in the world because of South Africa&#x2019;s gold production. This will bring major advantages to South-West Africa. The uniform financial arrangements which will follow on this legislation, will promote South-West Africa&#x2019;s trade, because that territory&#x2019;s foreign trade will now be included in that of the Republic. Furthermore, it will be easier for the two to combat inflation, for example, than would have been the case if South-West <span class="col_0433-0434" refersTo="page_0236"/>Africa were to have retained authority over its finances and the Republic separate authority over its own financial affairs. For that reason there will be greater advantages. In the case of the European Common Market we find that there has been integration of the economies of member countries for the very reason of enjoying greater financial advantages. Another major advantage is the following. Although provision is being made here for South-West Africa&#x2019;s revenue to be ploughed back into South-West Africa itself, provision is being made that in the event of any losses on the Revenue Account, as there repeatedly were in the past, South-West Africa will have the enormous advantage of aid from the Republic, just as the Republic at present aids the provinces financially.</p>

<p>In addition there is another great advantage which the provinces do not have at present. South-West Africa is being treated on virtually the same basis as the provinces to-day, and in addition it enjoys more representation in this Parliament than any of the four provinces of the Republic does. Let us examine the numbers. In the Republic there are 160 constituencies. According to the latest survey there are 1,840,530 voters, which means an average quota of 11,503. On the other hand, South-West Africa has 38,414 voters only and six representatives in this Parliament, in other words an average of only 6,402. This means, therefore, that the average voter of South-West Africa, as compared to the voters in the provinces, will have twice as much say in the sovereign Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. I say South-West Africa appreciates this favouritism which we are now being shown, and it is not passing unnoticed.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition alleged here that the voters of South-West Africa did not realize all the implications of this legislation, and he tried to suggest that we had not informed those voters fully. I now want to say that the voters of that territory are fully acquainted with what is contained in this legislation. After the Odendaal Report and its implications had been explained to the voters of South-West Africa, an election was held in which we won all the seats; we made a clean sweep. In other words, that was confirmation of the Odendaal Report and the White Paper tabled in this House by the Government of the Republic. That is why I am saying that the hon. members opposite should not say that the voters of South-West Africa are uninformed about what is contained in this measure. As a matter of fact, last year the congress of the National Party again adopted a unanimous resolution in which it expressed appreciation to the Prime Minister for the legislation which was to be introduced.</p>

<p>South-West Africa is standing on the threshold of tremendous development, and it is a good thing that it has at this stage of its development a ruling party such as the National Party that can see the possibilities of future development and can provide the necessary stimuli for bringing about such development. On the other hand, it would have been a tragedy had the opposite side been in power. To-day, as never before, South-West Africa is getting the opportunity of coming to the fore with a tremendous stimulation of its economy, and it is a good thing that the opposite side, which is opposing this measure, has not had the authority of deciding on the introduction or otherwise of this measure, because that would have been a tragedy to South-West Africa. As a matter of fact, those hon. members on the opposite side of this House who are using the opportunistic policy of the U.N.S.W.P. to-day in view of the fact that a by-election will be held in Windhoek before long, will be disillusioned, because after this legislation has been introduced and passed here, those hon. members will also have to take up a stand in respect of the cardinal issues of South-West Africa when the various departments of South-West Africa are under discussion in the Parliament of the Republic. Then I should like to see how the hon. members opposite are going to present the point of view of the voters of South-West Africa without their having a single branch or a single supporter in that territory, because, after all, they are boasting that they have nothing to do with the U.N.S.W.P. This legislation will have the effect that the U.N.S.W.P. and the United Party will have to fuse in order to be able to say something here about the affairs of South-West Africa, and I think this is one of the reasons why hon. members opposite are shying away from this legislation. I think they realize to some extent that when they are associated with the U.N.S.W.P., a party which indicates so many different directions that it does not know where it will be standing the next day, theirs will be a lost cause.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down referred to a debate in which I participated some 20 years ago and he referred to an appeal which I made to keep the heat out of debates on South-West Africa as far as possible. I want to repeat that appeal here to-day because I think that, although this is one of those matters which has got to be debated here in Parliament, we should try and be as objective as we possibly can, because in the last resort we know perfectly well where South Africa stands as far as South-West Africa is concerned. There is no need to elaborate on that, I think. Sufficient for me to say I think there is no doubt that South Africa stands behind a certain concept regarding its relations with South-West Africa. That concept is, however, broken, and badly broken, by the Government&#x2019;s policy regarding Ovamboland and the development of sovereign Bantu states. That is where the real big cleavage is.</p>

<p>I wish to come back to the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down, and I want to say I find it difficult to believe the <span class="col_0435-0436" refersTo="page_0237"/>hon. member could become so emotional over the actions and speeches of members in South-West Africa who are members of the United National South-West Africa Party.

<p>The hon. the Minister says as near as &#x201C;damn it&#x201D;. You see, Sir, &#x201C;damn it&#x201D; is the difference. The hon. the Minister should know it and &#x201C;damn it&#x201D;, there is a difference! So the hon. member for Middalland, with all due respect, spent a great deal of time beating a drum; in fact, beating a bale of hay. He is just making dull, thumping noises. There is no substance in it. It contained nothing substantial, except food for a donkey.</p>

<p>Just let us now have a look for a moment at the position which has arisen and go back to the earlier days in regard to legislation dealing with South-West Africa. It is no good the hon. member trying to quote from Hansard in regard to the late General Smuts&#x2019; difficulty about mining taxation and income tax. My hon. Leader pointed out that under this Bill, mining taxation is coming to us in this House. Individual income tax still stays with the Legislative Assembly in South-West Africa. But company tax, subject to a certain deduction, is taken away from them. So, the Government is moving right up to the point that General Smuts took, with his prescience and his foresight, in 1949.</p>

<p>I want to go further. General Smuts was always sympathetic towards South-West Africa. There was always in the General&#x2019;s heart a sympathetic understanding for that small group of Whites who were battling to maintain civilization and keep the territory of South-West Africa. There was always a special relationship. He was not prepared to throw the white man in South-West Africa to the international wolves. That is the truth of the matter. I remember in this House when the late Prime Minister, Dr. Malan, introduced a Bill, dealing with representatives of South-West Africa who were to be their representatives in this House. You remember, Sir, the first draft which came before this House. Those members did not have the right to deal with financial measures in this House. They had limited powers as Members of Parliament. I remember so well General Smuts sitting here, calling across to Dr. Malan, the then Prime Minister, saying: &#x201C;But why do you not make them full Members of Parliament?&#x201D; And Dr. Malan said: &#x201C;They have their own financial autonomy to a very great extent, and I thought that you would object if we also gave them a voice in the financial affairs of the Union. I am prepared to exclude them from participating in discussions of financial affairs here in the Union.&#x201D; General Smuts said: &#x201C;No, no. Make them full Members of Parliament. Give them a full say, the same as all the other members.&#x201D; It was General Smuts who said that. It is on the record. So Dr. Malan said: &#x201C;Oh! All right, the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to accept that; so be it.&#x201D; So that Bill was changed and hon. members came here. But now I want to ask in all fairness: When this Bill before us is passed, what then is any kind of reason or excuse whatsoever for having members in this House from South-West Africa? They will have taken the financial powers which have until now rested in the hands of the South-West Africa Assembly. Through this Bill they will arrange for the money to be collected and passed as a lump sum to the Treasury here in South Africa. It is then for the Treasury and the Government here in the Republic to determine under what sub-heads that money is to be spent. Back in South-West they are not interested in it. They cannot even voice a viewpoint. They have nothing to do with it. If this Bill is passed, that money will be brought from South-West where it accrues, to us and the Treasury here, to the South-West Africa Fund. Then it goes back again to be spent under the various subheads as determined by our Treasury in South-West Africa. They have no say in the matter. Their residual powers of finance rest with the Assembly in South-West Africa. They are not members of the Assembly. What are they any longer in this House?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like the hon. the Minister in charge of this Bill when he gets up to tell us what further powers this Bill will confer on the members for South-West Africa. What more say will they have? Will he kindly indicate that to us in the Bill so that we can see what those additional powers are, conferred on Members of Parliament for South-West Africa? Where in this Bill are further powers conferred upon them? The hon. member for Middelland repeated what the hon. the Prime Minister said. I noted it. It is of the very greatest importance that the people of South-West Africa knew what they were doing when <span class="col_0437-0438" refersTo="page_0238"/>they relinquished the powers which they are relinquishing in this Bill. He said they knew what they were doing. They were relinquishing powers after they had weighed the pros and cons, and they were prepared to let that go.</p>

<p>Let me make just one point. Supposing oil is struck in South-West Africa after the passing of this Bill, do the people of South-West Africa realize what they will have given away at the behest of their own Members of Parliament, who say that they knew what they were doing? They did it with their eyes open?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland said that with the passing of this Bill there were going to be tighter bonds between the Republic and South-West Africa. I do not know what kind of &#x201C;tighter bonds&#x201D; he feels there can be. My Leader has said, I repeat it and we all accept it on this side, that this legislation is legal in the sense that this Parliament, of which this House is a constituent part, can legally pass legislation such as we have before us. But that is no question. There is no argument about that. So there can be no tighter legal bonds as a result of the passing of this Bill. There can be no tighter constitutional bonds. Does the hon. the Minister deny that there can be no tighter constitutional bonds as exist at the present time?</p>

<p>No, no. I am not talking about obligations. I am saying that with the passing of this Act, there can be no tighter constitutional bonds that bind South-West Africa to the Republic to-day. If I am wrong, let the hon. the Minister say &#x201C;you are wrong. I will tell you what the tighter constitutional bond is&#x201D;. No, of course he cannot. Yet the hon. member for Middelland talked about tighter bonds. But there cannot be a tighter constitutional bond, there cannot be a tighter economic bond, because the revenues in respect of all those scheduled matters from South-West are being collected and brought to be allocated from the Republic for expenditure back in South-West Africa. Most meticulous care is being taken that every cent collected in South-West Africa should be spent back again in South-West Africa. But there it is. There is nothing tighter in the way of bonds, so far as that is concerned. Then where are the bonds? As my hon. Leader has pointed out, the Minister of Police in South Africa has always had control over the police in South-West Africa. There is no tighter bond there. There is no greater control over the police. The people of South-West Africa always wanted a greater measure of control over their own police, right down throughout the years. Even those who vote Nationalist to-day, have always wanted to have greater control over the police. There is no tighter control there. Where is the tighter control? Where is the tighter bond?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am taking the argument that the hon. member uses. I have shown how hollow that argument is. He made one point, namely the split rate on the railway. The Minister of Transport last year said that he was doing away with the split rate. It is being provided for in this Bill. But it was not necessary to bring it into this Bill. When once the Government had made up its mind to do away with the split rate, it was a simple matter then to dispose of it. Was it necessary to bring it into a Bill of this nature? If it makes for a tighter bond, what kind of a tighter bond does it mean? Does it mean that, in so far as the South African Railways is concerned now, they are prepared to suffer a further loss in the interests of South-West Africa? We have always accepted that we should be sympathetic towards South-West Africa. Where are the tighter bonds the hon. member was referring to? It is a figure of speech and it means nothing. There are no tighter bonds.</p>

<p>Now let us look at another point. My hon. Leader has dealt with a number of very important issues, including the powers of the State President, to change, alter, repeal and amend certain legislation falling within the schedule.</p>

<p>That can all be done. That. Sir, is the basic reason why the members of Parliament from South-West Africa are no longer necessary here, because that is what can be done without them. But supposing that that power was conferred on the State President in respect of the whole Republic. What would we then need in South Africa? We would then only need the Prime Minister and the Minister of Police and I think the rest of us could all go home and leave everything to the State President, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Police. The hon. the Minister of Police is also the Minister of the Interior. Perhaps he could keep that portfolio as well. At the behest of the Prime Minister, advised by the Minister of Police and of the Interior, the State President could change, alter, control and govern the whole Republic and South-West Africa. When it suited him, and he did not like what he had done he could make any legislation retrospective and date it back to the previous month or the previous year. To make this legislation retrospective is incredible, but the hon. member for Middelland sits here smiling happily and says that this will make for tighter bonds<span class="col_0439-0440" refersTo="page_0239"/> between the Republic and South-West Africa and that we will all be such friends together, greater friends than ever.</p>

<p>Let us look at another issue that arises here. In the issue before us there is nothing for the white man in South-West Africa. It is very interesting to note that in the White Paper the Government goes back to the term &#x201C;Native&#x201D; when it deals with some of the indigenous peoples of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks if I know what the reason for this is. Yes, I know what the reason is and the reason makes no difference to the facts. One can commit murder and may have good reasons for it, but the fact remains that the law will say that you have committed murder. That is all they will be concerned with. I want to suggest to the hon. member that the Government has murdered its own term &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; which it has fought with and battled with for some years, although we have pointed out that it is grammatically quite wrong to use that term. They have now had to go back because they are compelled to do so as the Natives are not Bantu.</p>

<p>Yes, the Natives there are not Bantu and so they cannot call them Bantu. They have got to use the term which was in general use before and call them Natives. When they get to the Nama they are again in big trouble. They do not like to make the Nama Coloureds and will not give them a representative in the Coloured Council. They will give the people they call Coloureds in South-West Africa a representative in the Coloured Council, but they will not give the Nama a representative in the Coloured Council. The Nama will be dealt with by the Department of Coloured Affairs here. I want to repeat that in this Bill there is nothing for the white man in South-West Africa. The limitation placed upon their Assembly&#x2019;s powers to legislate virtually reduces them to the white people in the white areas, with the single exception of public health and hospitals which extends right over. The Government goes further than that and provides here in a form for the Coloured people which they do not provide for the Coloured people here in the Republic, especially after the Prime Minister&#x2019;s <i>volte face</i> in the debate on the no confidence motion. After the Prime Minister did that complete <i>volte face</i> this makes strange reading, because provision is made here for the Coloured people, including the Namas, in South-West Africa, whereas there is no such provision for the Coloureds in South Africa. In fact, the Coloured people from South Africa now cannot go to South-West Africa and the Coloured people from South-West Africa are also apparently not allowed to travel to South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, I am sorry. I mean to settle and not to travel. Let us look at the position of the Basters at Rehoboth. There is a group of people, small, but they have been governing themselves for a very long time and have a wonderful history. It is amazing how well they have done when one traces the history of these people, and one reads Dr. Vedder&#x2019;s book on South-West Africa. But there they are and there they sit. They cannot be a viable community and cannot be a modern state in 1969. What corresponding development is there anywhere amongst the Coloured people in South Africa which is now apparently, if I read the papers correctly, going to be safeguarded by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s assurance to them that there is going to be a special subdivision in the Department of Coloured Affairs under the Minister of Coloured Affairs to protect them, their rights, their position, their way of life and their autonomy up to a certain point. This is given to the people at Rehoboth in South-West Africa but it is not given to any other Coloured persons in South Africa. Our Coloured people do not get it.</p>

<p>With regard to the Bantu the Government has now found itself in a complete fix. It cannot call them Bantu any longer and it has to call them Natives.</p>

<p>Yes, who have got a homeland and some powers, limited though they may be. I think this complete differentiation in treatment is bad and shocking. I do hope that when the Minister gets up to reply he is going to tell us categorically and clearly where he is going with regard to the Natives of South-West Africa, because there is nothing for the white man. There is something for the Coloured man and the Native people who come under that clammy, dead hand of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in South Africa. Presumably even those who are <span class="col_0441-0442" refersTo="page_0240"/>not Bantu will be treated in precisely the same way as the Bantu in the Republic of South Africa. I do not know, but I hope that the hon. the Minister will tell us what the position of the Native people in South-West Africa who are not Bantus is going to be. We are entitled to know. When I remember the statements made the other day with such force and determination about the moral and ethical right of these people to self-determination I want to ask what right to self-determination the Natives who are not Bantus in South-West Africa have. There is nothing about this in this Bill.</p>

<p>I would also like to deal with the question of the revenue in South-West Africa. At the present time, as far as I can ascertain, there are three groups of people who get specially low interest rates in the territory. They are the municipalities who want loans, the Land Bank and the farmers, although it is not clear whether the loans to farmers in fact are included in the loans to the Land Bank. But however that may be, these folk get a specially low rate of interest, and it is provided here that the rate of interest will remain low so long as the money from South-West Africa is adequate. When this has been received here in the Republic and then handed back to them to meet the calls upon their own funds, those low rates of interest will remain, but the statement is made that if adequate funds are not available from their own resources, then we will have to make loans. In the first place, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether any loan which we may be called upon to make from the Republic to the South-West African Administration for the purpose of meeting commitments to the municipalities, the farmers and the Land Bank, will be provided for in a Bill so that it can come before Parliament as an item for consideration in our own estimates clearly shown as a loan to the Administration of South-West Africa; whether in fact we will see that that money is being taken from here and loaned to South-West Africa? That is the first point. Secondly, Sir, what is the position with regard to the interest rates which are going to be charged? It is stated in the White Paper that if once the money emanating from South-West Africa, the revenue which has accrued there, comes to the Republic, to our Treasury, and is then re-allotted to South-West Africa, is inadequate for the various purposes, the interest rate will not be maintained at the present low level when once funds borrowed in the form of loans from the Republic are made available. What then is the position with regard to interest? Is the interest then to be averaged out with all those who have borrowed South-West African money, if I may call it that, in the past? Is their interest rate to be raised so as to average out with the rate for new borrowers, or what is the position? Are the old borrowers to retain their rate of interest? Do only those who come in and who utilize money which is the subject of a loan from the Republic, have to pay the higher rate of interest? I ask this, Sir, because it is quite clear that in the course of time, it must be apparent that if the development in South-West Africa which is contemplated is to take place, there is going to be a further financial adjustment necessary one of these days between South-West Africa and the Republic.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the Land Bank Bill is before the House but it is not clear on that point, as to how when the money from South-West Africa is exhausted&#x2014;and that is the low rate of interest money&#x2014;and a loan comes from South Africa at a high rate of interest, the interest is to be apportioned, whether it is to be apportioned equally over all borrowers, past, present and future, or whether it is to be apportioned only over present and future borrowers who have to borrow the money which is on loan from South Africa? Do the old borrowers who have already got their loans incur no further interest liability as the result of borrowing from South Africa?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one last point before I sit down. It is clear that the White Legislative Assembly in South-West Africa has control of hospitals and medical services in respect of the whole of the population, but nowhere can I find any reference to fees. What is to be the position here with regard to fees for medical services rendered in South-West Africa? The trouble with the Government here in the Republic, even in the Bantu areas, is that much as they would like to take over hospitals and put in their own staff, they cannot do it. They can neither train staff nor find trained staff to do the job. In this case, the Administration of South-West Africa is providing the staff and it is providing the services under certain conditions, but the provisions here do not indicate whether fees are to be charged in any shape or form. Can they levy fees; can they levy them against the Bantu? Sir, in the Republic some years ago the power was given to the provinces, contrary to the usual law, to levy a hospital fee on Bantu who came into provincial hospitals. That fell more or less into desuetude after a few years because of the difficulty and the cost of collecting a small amount and it was relinquished. What the position is to be in South-West Africa is a matter which can be of extreme moment and extreme importance because of the imbalance between the small white population, which will be paying the bulk of the revenue, and the larger number of people who are non-Whites who will have to be given public health and hospital services.</p>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast devoted a large part of his speech to particulars in regard to the small groups in South-West Africa. To us in South-West Africa <span class="col_0443-0444" refersTo="page_0241"/>this particular legislation is of so much importance that I do not wish to argue about it now.</p>

<p>As regards the powers of the State President, to which the hon. member as well as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred, I just want to say that the State President has always had those powers, and for as long as U.N. adopts the attitude that U.N. has jurisdiction over South-West Africa, these powers will be necessary there. These powers are necessary specifically because a state of emergency may arise while Parliament is not in session. As we know, all the South African laws relating to a state of emergency do not apply in South-West Africa, and therefore it is necessary for the State President to retain the power to implement legislation which may suddenly be necessary there. For instance, devaluation may take place. Not all of the Republic&#x2019;s financial measures are applicable in South-West Africa, and if devaluation were to take place, the State President would require these powers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall not reply to the hon. member any further. I just want to repeat that in terms of section 2 of the Mandate the position in South-West is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The mandatory shall have full power of administration and legislation over the territory subject to the mandate of an integral portion of the Union and may apply the laws of the Union to the territory subject to such local modifications as circumstances may require.</block>

<p>What does this &#x201C;full power of administration and legislation&#x201D; mean? This matter was dealt with in the International Court in the case of Lighthouse in 1934, and on that occasion the Court ruled as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any grant of legislative powers generally implies the grant of the discretionary right to judge how far their exercise may be necessary or urgent. It is a question of appreciating political considerations and conditions of fact, a task which the Government, as the body possessing the requisite knowledge of the political situation, is alone qualified to undertake.</block>

<p>And then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Justice Lathan, Chief Justice of Australia, said: In the case of C mandates &#x2026;</block>

<p>As in the case of South-West Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the mandatory power has full powers of administration and legislation over the territory, subject to the mandate, as an integral portion of the territory. It is clear that it was intended that in the case of C mandates the fullest powers of government should be conferred upon the mandatory power.</block>

<p>Quincy Wright points out that the descriptions of the covenant and of the mandate vary greatly in definiteness. Some regulations like those on slaves, arms and liquor traffic, etc., are quite definite. On the other hand, certain principles like the well-being and development of the inhabitants are so vague as to admit of a broad variety of policies.</p>

<p>I am pleased to hear that the Leader of the Opposition also agrees that South Africa is in fact competent to launch this legislation through this House. The only question that arises in that case, is what policy is to be implemented in regard to South-West Africa and how these powers are to be distributed. Sir, I am not accustomed to testing my premises against what this or that person said in the past, since circumstances may change, but where circumstances have changed to such an extent that they reinforce the reasons for that premise, I think that I am in fact entitled to refer to them. Nobody will deny that the world situation has changed to such an extent that it has more than ever before become vital for the Whites in South-West Africa to form a united front with South Africa. In this regard I want to refer to remarks made by a few United Party speakers in the past. Reference has already been made here to the former leader of the United Party, the late General Smuts. The late General Smuts was one of the main architects of the mandate system, and he was, of course, an expert in this field in particular. I want to quote what he said since present circumstances corroborate his argument more than has ever been the case before. While Act 42 of 1925 was being passed he, did not only come out for it, but also said that he felt that it did not go far enough. The late General Smuts said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would rather have seen these two countries having closer ties at this stage.</block>

<p>It is interesting to note that he also sounded the warning that if these ties were not forged more firmly in good time, the inhabitants of South-West would later tend to move away from the Union. This warning was also emphasized strongly by the Opposition in 1949. On 3rd April, 1944, the late General Smuts stated in the Senate that the time of the mandate system was past and that there was virtually no obstacle to the incorporation of South-West Africa with the Union, and on 11th April, 1947, the following resolution was passed by this House, under the leadership of the late General Smuts as Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This House is of the opinion that the territory should be represented in the Parliament of the Union as an integral portion thereof, and requests the Government to introduce legislation, after consultation with the inhabitants, providing for its representation in the Union Parliament.</block>

<p>&#x201C;As an integral portion thereof&#x201D;, not as a federal part of it. Subsequently the late General Smuts went to U.N. where he asked for incorporation, with the consent of virtually <span class="col_0445-0446" refersTo="page_0242"/>the whole population of South-West Africa. I do not think that the Opposition will claim that incorporation forms part of a federation. In passing I want to point out that the then U.N.S.W.P. of South-West Africa led a deputation to General Smuts in 1944, in Cape Town, to ask for the incorporation of South-West as a province. Sir, on 10th July, 1947, a very important statement as published in <i>Die Suidwes-Afrikaner,</i> the mouthpiece of the U.N.S.W.P. (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In an interview held on 9/7/1947 General Smuts informed the executive of the U.N.S.W.P. that it could still take a long time before the territory&#x2019;s new constitution was introduced. The territory would have to receive treatment somewhat different from that received by the provinces, although he did not want to deviate too far from the constitutional position as it existed in the Union. In contrast to the feeling of the U.N.S.W.P. at that stage, General Smuts turned a deaf ear to the idea of a federation.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this was published in their newspaper in 1947. Now one can see where the hon. member for Bezuidenhout got his federal idea; he got it from the U.N.S.W.P. in South-West Africa. In 1949, in the course of the debate on South-West Africa, General Smuts put his point of view here, and you will remember, Sir, that the hon. member for Midlands quoted here what General Smuts had said on that occasion.</p>

<p>Sir, I am very sorry that the hon. member for South Coast has just left the Chamber, for I want to quote what he said here in 1949 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then I feel at this stage that we are entitled to tell South-West, with a view to its legal position in respect of the Union: We want vou to join on precisely the same basis as applied to the provinces.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member for South Coast said here in 1949, i.e. that South-West had to join the Union on precisely the same basis as applied to the provinces. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a matter of principle &#x2026;</block>

<p>And one does, after all, not change one&#x2019;s principles&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; we feel that the closer the relationship between South-West Africa and the provinces is made, the better it would be for all of us. We want to make them full members who will not only enjoy the same rights and privileges, but also bear the same responsibility as is borne by the other members.</block>

<p>Then I want to quote what Mr. Russell said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The correct way is to make them now a full and equal and responsible and privileged partner in our Union &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not "in our federation&#x201D;. Then I come to Sir De Villiers Graaff (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Speaker felt very strongly that mines, minerals and precious stones should not come under the jurisdiction of the Legislative Assembly. He was afraid that South-West might enter into competition with the Union. It could happen that as a result of the different systems of taxation they would be in a position to produce their minerals more cheaply than the Union could.</block>

<p>And, Mr. Speaker, who supported him? You will be surprised, Sir&#x2014;S. J. M. Steyn of Yeoville. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said a moment ago that he had referred to minerals at the time. But I want to point out that if minerals were to be taken away from South-West, it would have no revenue for handling other matters, and then all the other powers would fall away in any event, for the revenue from minerals represents 80 per cent of the revenue of South-West. They cannot exercise the other powers if they were to lose the revenue from minerals. Next I quote from what Mr. Durrant said in 1954 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party wants complete integration.</block>

<p>He is the only person who has adhered to his point of view, and he has now joined the National Party. Mr. Speaker, you will note that every step in the direction of constitutional development and the coupling of South-West to the Republic, has been criticized by the United Party as allegedly not having gone far enough. The U.N.S.W.P.&#x2019;s policy, for those who do not know this, is at present that South-West must develop towards autonomy and independence with the approval of U.N. after which it can decide on its relations with the Republic. They and the United Party still have their differences; they have not yet been able to agree on policy, and that is why we find the dispute mentioned here by the hon. member for South Coast. But what is interesting, is this: You will recall, Sir, that I said that as far back as 1925 the late General Smuts sounded the warning that if these ties were not forged firmly in good time, the inhabitants of South-West would later tend to move away from the Union, and, ironically enough, this was emphasized by Sir De Villiers Graaff in 1949; and now it is once again ironic that the same United Party and U.N.S.W.P., these allies, are giving shape to these predictions. But I think I have devoted enough time to the past; I think the future is much more important, and the question now is merely what course is this Government following.</p>

<p>When the British Prime Minister Lloyd George introduced this agreement in the British Parliament on 3rd July, 1919, he put it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no doubt at all that South-West Africa will become an integral part of South <span class="col_0447-0448" refersTo="page_0243"/>Africa. It will be colonized by people from South Africa. You could not have done anything else.</block>

<p>I may add that if one goes into the conduct of the various parties during the drafting of the mandate agreement, it is clear that that was also the general view at the time. There is absolutely no doubt that the interests of South-West and its permanent prosperity can only be ensured by its joining the Republic. The main argument in favour of this is that South-West will in this way acquire a government which will be in a position to deal more effectively with the problems experienced there, problems with which South-West Africa on its own cannot deal in an effective manner. I may just mention the fact that when the National Party took over in 1950, the Estimates totalled R6 million, and now it is more than R100 million. With the manpower available there it has become extremely difficult to handle the position in South-West, and the latter has already had to rely heavily on the Republic&#x2019;s technical and other services. That is why we have introduced this legislation at this stage. The Odendaal Commission, which consisted of experts in every field&#x2014;and not only of ordinary people like us here&#x2014;and which inquired into the position there, stated that since South-West had to develop more rapidly, it was necessary for their departments to be reinforced as they did not have at their disposal the necessary manpower and knowledge and means for taking charge of the development there. It was therefore recommended that the Republic take over those departments; and for another reason, of course, namely that the Republic has to spend millions in order to effect that development. And the Republic is, of course, not going to entrust those millions to a small body without having any control over the way that money is spent. I may, for instance, just mention that the Kunene scheme will cost more than R50 million.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect. In any case, it is vitally important to us in South-West to seek alliance with the Republic. It would be fatal to our 90,000 Whites to be separated from the Republic in a continent with hundreds of millions of non-Whites. We in South-West do not have a single soldier; we do not have any aircraft or cannon. We do not even have one policeman. There are terrorists on our borders and there are threats from U.N. If the Republic let go of us to-morrow, we would be in the hands of U.N. the next day. We know what has happened to the Whites in the rest of Africa, in contrast to what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout still had to say here a year or so ago, i.e. that things were not going so badly. But the hon. member lives in a dream world of federations. To put it plainly, federations are out-dated. All modern federations are failures.</p>

<p>The Opposition need not think that they are so clever and so all-wise. At the time of Union the fathers of our nation considered whether we should have a federation or a union. They did not quarrel about it for months, but soon arrived at the decision to form a union and so to build a united white nation here. Would anybody propose a federation for the Whites in South Africa today? Even the United Party accepts that a united white nation is an urgent necessity. We now have a union here and not a federation. We have 90,000 Whites in an adjoining area, people who ethnically belong with the Whites here. Is it still necessary, then, to quarrel about whether we should enter the Union or whether there should be a federation for our Whites? Yes, if there is an atmosphere of suspicion, if the one suspects the other, and if there is a desire to gain as much advantage as possible for our respective political parties or for some area or another, then we can argue for days. But as I have said, we have a union at the moment and I suppose that on this southernmost tip of Africa we have enough population groups and enough problems without our having to form two white groups in addition, one in South-West and the other in South Africa.</p>

<p>There is a further question I want to put, and then the Opposition can think it over and place themselves in the position of the electorate of South-West Africa. What would Rhodesia have done, and how would they have voted if they had been made the offer of gaining the protection of the Republic, subject to these conditions?</p>

<p>I see that the leader of the U.N.S.W.P. has made an appeal for a referendum to be held on this matter. I myself think that the views of the voters are very important. What are the facts here? Before the Odendaal Plan, with the 1961 elections, the U.N.S.W.P.&#x2019;s slogan was: &#x201C;You are doing too little for the non-Whites and that is why U.N. wants to take over.&#x201D; I shall read to you, Sir, an excerpt from a speech, as reported in <i>Die Suidwes-Afrikaner,</i>made by Mr. Niehaus, their leader (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Speaker is convinced that if the U.N.S.W.P. came into power again in our country, money would once again flow into it because the world has confidence in our policy and in our race policy of live and let live. If over the past ten years a policy had been followed here in terms of which the non-Whites in this country were also granted a place in the sun, it would not have happened that one non-White after the other went to U.N. in order to lay a charge against us there. We must follow a policy of fairness towards the non-Whites, and in that way we can safeguard the future of the Whites.</block>

<p>That was their slogan. Then the Odendaal Report, which recommended this take-over, was <span class="col_0449-0450" refersTo="page_0244"/>published in 1963, and as you know, Sir, the National Party promised to consult the electorate before they relinquished these powers. Subsequently a referendum was advertised throughout South-West and 73 meetings were held in the beginning of 1964. Those in favour of these powers being relinquished, numbered 2,911 and those against, 148. Subsequently the Legislative Assembly resolved unanimously&#x2014;17 out of the 18 members were Nationalist and the 18th was Advocate Niehaus and he had walked out; he did not vote against it&#x2014;to support this step. Towards the end of 1964 there was a by-election in the Windhoek district. It was a United Party seat. That happened after the report. The whole election was fought on this report which had just been submitted to the electorate. There were only 1,800 voters and the National Party majority was 480. Then we come to the general election of 1966. Many interesting things happened there. The election was almost exclusively fought on this issue. You will remember, Sir, that I said that in the 1961 election their slogan was that we were doing too little for the non-Whites. By this time the Odendaal Plan had been put into operation and white farms had been bought out, there were white farmers who were dissatisfied and development was in progress in the non-White areas. Now the U.N.S.W.P. made an about-face and said: &#x201C;You are doing too much for the non-Whites.&#x201D; They went to the electorate with that slogan, and I just want to recount what happened to me personally. Advocate Kritzinger supported my opponent, Mr. Nel, in the Swakopmund constituency. The following was taken from the <i>Namib Times,</i> which is not a Nationalist newspaper, and this is what Advocate Kritzinger had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It hurt Dr. Verwoerd when I compared him with Dr. Philip, the famous philanthropist of the London Missionary Society, but since Dr. Philip no one has done so much for the Bantu as Dr. Verwoerd is doing. It was Dr. Philip who wanted to establish a lot of Bantu states around the old Cape Colony, just like Dr. Verwoerd to-day wants to establish his Bantustans. Dr. Philip died a broken man because he never succeeded with this. The Nationalists have placed their trust in Dr. Verwoerd, but the problem is can you trust the black man?</block>

<p>But more interesting than that is what my opponent there, Mr. Nel, had to say. The heading was: &#x201C;Nationalist Party does everything for the Blacks.&#x201D; This is not our newspaper, but the <i>Namib Times.</i> He said (translation)</p>

<block name="quote">God will never forgive the Nationalist Party for the way they treated the farmers in buying out the Odendaal farms. Many of these people have been farming on their farms since 1928. These farms are taken away from them and given to the &#x201C;kaffirs&#x201D;. I call them &#x201C;kaffirs&#x201D; and &#x201C;maid servants&#x201D; <i>(meide</i>) and not Mister or Bantu or Sir as the Nationalists are doing nowadays &#x2026; Millions of rands are being spent on the non-Whites because the Nationalist Party is afraid of the Blacks. The Blacks are receiving better treatment to-day than the Whites are receiving. The writing is on the wall. This will be the last five years of Nationalist regime, where everything is done for the Blacks only.</block>

<p>But more important than this is the election manifesto of the U.N.S.W.P. which furnishes a brief description of the most important problems with which our country has to cope, and sets out the course followed by the two political parties. Then it says that this is being done in order that the voters themselves may choose. It goes on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nor may you, in arriving at your decision, lose sight of the revolutionary recommendations contained in the Odendaal Report, which, should they be implemented, would change South-West Africa fundamentally. Their effect will be dealt with in brief.</block>

<p>The disadvantages of the Odendaal Plan were set out as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The recommendations contained in the Odendaal Plan, which was accepted by the Nationalist Party in principle, holds the following serious financial disadvantages for South-West Africa: (a) the surrender to the Republic of South Africa of control over our taxes; (b) an increase in income tax so as to bring it into line with that of the Republic, which would mean that inhabitants of South-West, and particularly persons in the lower-income groups, would have to pay much more in taxes.</block>

<p>Then they furnished a table in which a comparison was made of what they were paying at the time and what they would have to pay if they came under the Republic, and how the farmers would have to pay higher rates of interest on Land Bank mortgages. They said that whereas the Land Bank rate of interest in S.W.A. was 4 per cent, it was 6 per cent in the Republic, with an additional **1* per cent which served as insurance coverage on the mortgage; in other words, mortgage interest for the inhabitants of South-West would increase by 87 per cent, and it would also entail further disadvantages for those living in towns. Whereas in the past it was possible for municipalities to obtain a loan from the Administration at a low rate of interest, they would now have to pay more. The house rent paid by public servants would now have to be brought into line with the rent which public servants in the Republic were paying, and which could roughly be compared with the rent paid by Railway officials at that time. Territorial allowances to all public servants and Railway officials would fall away once incorporation had taken place. They went to the electorate with these arguments, and our difficulty was that <span class="col_0451-0452" refersTo="page_0245"/>the Odendaal Plan had recommended that a commission of experts inquire into these matters, and this commission had not yet taken any decision and we could not refute them. In the face of those facts we had to fight the election, and what happened there?</p>

<p>In the 1961 election the Nationalists received 19,260 votes and the United Party 13,186, a majority of 6,064. Next we had the election of 1966 which was fought on the Odendaal Plan. Here the National Party received 21,241 votes and the United Party 10,087, a majority of 11,154. Approximately two-thirds of the electorate was in favour of this legislation which we have here now. But this was still not the end of it. In 1967 there was a by-election in Warmbad, and once again they came forward with the same propaganda, and we still did not have the facts we have to-day. As you know, all those things they predicted, did not come true. Taxes were not increased and Land Bank rates of interest were not increased, but we did not know that at the time. In spite of that the Nationalist majority in the 1967 election was 442, whereas in 1966 it had only been 222. This legislation was introduced in 1968, and now we see what the position is. I can well Imagine how the people in South-West Africa will feel now. At the moment there are two vacancies, i.e. in the constituencies of Swakopmund and Windhoek. The vacancy in Swakopmund falls under my constituency. Two weeks ago the by-election was held there. But what happened? It was an uncontested election, because the United Party did not come forward with a candidate. Now I come to the case of Windhoek. The 22nd January was nomination day there. On Friday, 17th January a big heading appeared in the United Party&#x2019;s newspaper there: &#x201C;Van den Berg may withdraw as candidate&#x2014;virtually no voluntary workers turn up.&#x201D; Van den Berg was the U.N.S.W.P. candidate there, and <i>Die Suid-wes-Afrikaner</i> is their newspaper. But I want to read out to hon. members what was said under another heading: &#x201C;Appeal made to party supporters&#x201D; (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Up to now the office of the United National South-West Party has not been able to obtain much voluntary assistance for the Windhoek by-election, and the candidate of the Party, Mr. C. J. van den Berg, said last night that he was not prepared to try to make the grade with the assistance available at present, for it would be a waste of money and precious time.</block>

<p>It was learnt last night that so far only one of the numerous persons who at the congress last year had volunteered to help with the election, had turned up at the party office, and with the present number of workers it will definitely not be possible to conduct the election properly.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I think that it is arrogant of the leader of the United Party there to ask for a referendum. The Odendaal Plan makes provision for each group in South-West Africa, including the Whites, to decide for itself upon reaching maturity, whether it wants to stand on its own legs or whether it wants to join another group politically or economically. I am now discussing the economic aspects of the matter. According to the information I have given you, Sir, coupled with the fact that all 18 members in the Legislative Assembly and the six members in the House of Assembly support this legislation, the decision of the electorate there is a very obvious one.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have adduced the necessary proof. The voters of South-West Africa request this legislation. It is in the interest of South-West Africa that we should form one white nation with the Republic here on the southernmost point of Africa. The Republic furnishes proof to-day of a lasting union and a strong united and prosperous state. I want to express the hope that this step will eventually lead to a complete union with the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I cannot say this, and I should not say it to the hon. the Minister, but there is no right of appeal on that question. There is, however, a right of appeal from the debate which we will have now when the people realize what this debate is in fact all about. That brings me to the point I should like to make in connection with the speech of the hon. member for Omaruru. The hon. and learned member for Omaruru did not say one word about the Bill. I am very sorry about that because this is a very interesting Bill. I do not think that the people of South-West Africa or the people of the Republic appreciate quite what this Bill makes provision for. The remarks of the hon. members for Middelland and Omaruru, two hon. members from South-West Africa, will certainly not enlighten anyone who reads Hansard as to what is in this Bill. The hon. members quite obviously want the people in South-West Africa to read the Hansard as far as their speeches are concerned. The hon. member who has just sat down spent all his time quoting election figures and quoting from what people in the South-West Africa United Party have said, all of which has nothing whatever to do with this Bill. The hon. member for Omaruru must appreciate that if he had listened to the hon. member who spoke before him, he would have realized that there is no relationship between the United Party in South-West Africa and the United Party in the Republic. There is not even a federal relationship between these two parties! There is no relationship whatever. The hon. member talked of &#x201C;sy mense&#x201D; and &#x201C;sy koerant&#x201D; but this has no relevance whatsoever.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spent a lot of time <span class="col_0453-0454" refersTo="page_0246"/>dealing with the mandate. He said that the question that arose was what &#x201C;full powers of administration&#x201D; means in terms of the mandate. He then went on to deal with what Lloyd George said when the mandate was discussed in the British House of Commons, namely that it would become an integral part of the Republic, and so on. This is quite irrelevant to the issue before us. My hon. Leader has already said that there is no question at all as to whether the Government is entitled to introduce this legislation. This legislation does not offend the mandate at all, in the same way as our alternative plan also does not offend the mandate. The hon. member is a lawyer, a learned member of the legal profession, and I am sorry that he did not give us the benefit of his views on some of the provisions of this Bill, especially as they relate to the very people for whom he has been making his election speech here to-day. I would have liked to have heard his views on how this Bill affects them, the white voters there. He said that it must be administered as an integral portion of the Republic and not as a federal portion. This is of course not a good point for the hon. member to make. It amounts to the same whether it is administered on a federal basis or on this extraordinary basis. The question is how this measure will affect the public. The hon. member then gave us a vivid history of what everyone else who has sat on this saide had said over the years. He quoted the hon. member for South Coast, the former member Mr. Russell and the former member Mr. Durrant.</p>

<p>It treats them the same as the white people in a province are treated.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I shall demonstrate to the hon. member exactly why it does not. I shall point out to him exactly what powers exist in the hands of the Cabinet to apply all sorts of laws which do not exist in respect of the provinces, to the white people of South-West Africa. This is the crux of the matter. This is what the Bill we are debating, makes provision for. So far we have not heard anything to do with the Bill from any member from South-West Africa. Not one of them has dealt with the Bill. We listened to a lot of diatribe all of which is to go into the Hansard to be distributed for the election campaign, as the hon. member for Omaruru no doubt intended.</p>

<p>What is happening here is that we are now going back to the days of 1919 and 1925 when the then Governor-General had full power to make laws in respect of South-West Africa. But hon. members must remember that in those days, immediately after the mandate was given to us, this Parliament gave that power to the Governor-General. This Parliament passed an Act in 1919 giving to the Governor-General the power to make laws for South-West Africa by proclamation. This was done on a temporary basis until 1921 when it was given a permanent status unless it was repealed by an Act of Parliament. I want to emphasize that that power came from this Parliament. In 1925 the basis was changed and we found that provision was made for a partly elected and a partly nominated legislative council. In 1949 the Amending Act stated specifically that Parliament was to be given the power to legislate on those matters in regard to which the Governor-General had formerly had the necessary powers in terms of the 1919 Act. There is no doubt whatever as to what the intention was at that time. If one looks at the White Paper published at the time, in 1949, one sees some interesting things. The whole basis was changed. All the members of the Legislative Assembly were to be elected and the powers given to them were given on the basis of their being a completely elected council. There is no doubt whatsoever that the right given to the Governor-General was abrogated and given to Parliament; I think the Minister will agree. It was laid down that only Parliament would have the power to pass legislation having effect in the territory. In the 1949 White Paper it is specifically very clearly, laid down dealing with the then clause 22, that from a date to be proclaimed for the purpose &#x201C;only Parliament&#x201D; shall have the power to legislate in the territory in regard to those matters on which the Assembly was not competent to legislate or for the purpose of overriding the provisions of any ordinance passed by the Assembly.</p>

<p>We then had the South-West Africa Constitution Act of 1968, after various amendments, and the position at that stage, as well as now while we are dealing with this Bill, is that the Legislative Assembly may make recommendations to Parliament for legislation to be passed, emphasizing once again the power of Parliament in this regard. It may make representations for the repeal of any law to Parliament. There exists in the S.W.A. Constitution Act which we passed last year specific provision whereby the white inhabitants of the territory, if they desire such a change, can petition this Parliament for a change In section 37 (3) once again it is provided that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_0455-0456" refersTo="page_0247"/>Save as provided in sections 22 and 38, only Parliament may legislate for the territory in regard to those matters on which the Assembly may not legislate.</block>

<p>Subsection (4) states that&#x2014;"&#x2026; Parliament may by Act override any ordinance made by the Assembly&#x201D;. Subsection (5) states that the publication in the <i>Gazette</i> of any Act of Parliament, applying to South-West Africa, is deemed to be publication in the <i>Official Gazette,</i> because before it had to be published in both <i>Gazettes</i> to be effective. If the State President made any proclamation it had to be published in the <i>Gazette</i> in the territory before it was effective. We find emphasized over and over the theme of &#x201C;Parliament, Parliament, Parliament &#x2026; has the power to legislate&#x201D;. We find in subsection (6) that any ordinance shall only have effect so long and as far only as it is not repugnant to or inconsistent with an Act of Parliament. This is what we have led up to; this was the idea of the 1949 legislation in respect of the white people, and this is why they were given members of Parliament, why they were given representation here. And now (because Parliament has that power) we find a complete change is to take place and the power of Parliament is to be undermined without any reference back whatsoever, and I want to come to this point.</p>

<p>It may complete your picture.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am going to complete the picture for the hon. the Minister too, because there is section 22 as well as section 38. Section 22 states that the Assembly may not, except with the consent of the State President, make ordinances in respect of certain excluded matters, in other words, those matters in respect of which Parliament can make laws and in respect of which the Assembly cannot, can be legislated upon by the Assembly with the consent of the State President. Section 38 states that the State President may make proclamations in respect of all matters excluded from the jurisdiction of the Legislative Assembly, but, and this is very important, those proclamations which he makes must not be repugnant to an Act of Parliament. That is the important thing; it must not be repugnant to an Act of Parliament. Moreover, they must be laid on the Tables of both Houses, and if there is a negative resolution during that session when they are so laid on the Table they cease to have any effect. That is the difference between section 38 of last year&#x2019;s Act and what this Bill does. The Minister asked me specifically to deal with it, and that is the difference.</p>

<p>Now we have the position that if in fact the State President makes a proclamation in terms of section 38 of the South-West African Constitution it has to be laid upon the Tables of both Houses. It cannot be repugnant to an Act of Parliament, so there is no question of over-riding Parliament&#x2019;s powers. But even that proclamation has to be laid on the Table, and moreover it may be negatived. But there is no such provision whatsoever in relation to the power which is sought here which is a far greater power. In fact, I know of no similar power which is as far-reaching as this. There is no provision at all to return to Parliament.</p>

<p>When the Minister introduced this Bill, he said that clause 20 which gives the State President these extraordinary powers is necessary, although the powers contained therein might never be used. If the Minister really feels that way about it, then it seems to me, seeing that the Minister thinks it is unlikely they will ever be used, it is unnecessary for him to have those powers. Surely he can come back to Parliament?</p>

<p>Well, that being so, why does the hon. the Minister take such an unlikely power as he is taking in this Bill? It does not do any credit to the institution of Parliament, it offends one as a Member of Parliament and it offends the institution of Parliament itself to have powers like this, namely that a Minister, because this is what it in fact means, may declare any provision of any law of the Republic to apply in the territory, subject to such amendments, additions, modifications, exceptions or conditions as he may deem fit. Moreover, he may &#x201C;repeal, amend or modify any provisions of any law in force in the territory in as far as in his opinion it relates to a scheduled matter&#x201D;. I think one must appreciate that no Act of this Parliament applies in South-West Africa unless it is specifically stated by this Parliament to apply to South-West Africa, so that Act of Parliament already applying to the territory quite obviously come to be dealt with by the Minister. I want to ask the Minister why, seeing he is seeking such a far-reaching power <span class="col_0457-0458" refersTo="page_0248"/>here, there is no provision that the matter should be returned to Parliament for Parliament to deal with it? If the Minister has to use the power as a matter of necessity at the time, that is fine, but whatever change is made to an Act of Parliament which Parliament wanted to apply to the territory should be returned to Parliament, in the same way as a proclamation by the State President in terms of section 38 of last year&#x2019;s Act has to return to Parliament, for Parliament to negative if it chooses. I go further and say that in this case, because it is an amendment of an Act of Parliament in fact, it should come back to this Parliament with a positive resolution applying to it. By that I mean that it should be laid on the Tables of both Houses and cease to have any effect unless and until it is approved of by resolution of both Houses, instead of having the provision that exists in regard to the State President&#x2019;s proclamation, namely that it is of effect unless it is negatived.</p>

<p>Yes, not only do I think it will serve any purpose but I think it will restore to this House a right which it has, the right to legislate for the territory of South-West Africa. As I tried to indicate up to now, this has been the whole trend of our legislation, this has been the history of all our relationships with South-West Africa, namely to give to this Parliament the ultimate power of legislating for the territory.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I do not really like the clause as it now reads, but the only thing that could satisfy would be that sort of thing, namely that Parliament in fact has the ultimate say as to whether that change should be made or not. It should not be done by way of negative resolution. We know the difficulties that one has in getting a resolution when one is past private members&#x2019; days and the difficulties one has in getting the matter discussed. It should rather lie on the Table and cease to have any effect until and unless passed by both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>That is one aspect of the matter. There are other aspects which my hon. Leader dealt with. If this Bill is to remain unaltered, then what is the function going to be of these Members of Parliament elected for South-West Africa, and of the Senators elected and nominated to represent South-West Africa? You see, Sir, there is no provision that Parliament will be consulted in respect of the alteration of Acts of Parliament relating to South-West Africa or any other laws. There is no provision for the members for South-West Africa to be consulted either. That is their function in this House. They come to this House to represent the people of South-West Africa. There are four Senators. Two of them are nominated on the basis that they are thoroughly acquainted by reason of official experience or otherwise with the reasonable wants or wishes of the Coloured races of the territory. There are another two, who are elected. There are the six hon. members who sit in this House. What is their function here? Surely their function, particularly, is to advise this House of what their electorate think about legislation which we pass in respect of and applying to South-West Africa. As my hon. friend for South Coast has said, they have a say in relation to everything that goes on in this House, but that is their particular interest.</p>

<p>I do not think you understand the position, but I will explain it to you later.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I hope the hon. the Minister will try to do it. I do understand the position very well. Perhaps the hon. the Minister would indicate what the object is if they are not here as part of the consultative process. They are here as representatives in this Parliament, and in this particular House as part of the consultative process. They are here to advise this House as to what their people think. This House makes the decisions. It is very difficult. One must appreciate, and I do appreciate, that hon. members on the other side often confuse what is the function of this House and what is the realistic effect of a decision of this House with what is, in fact, a decision of their party. I think that, when the hon. the Minister said in this regard that these members will now have more powers, I am entitled to say to the hon. the Minister that he does not quite understand what the Bill entails. But I have tried, at least, to explain to him why they will not have more powers. Where in this Bill is their right to be consulted? How does this Bill enhance their right? They have no right to be consulted about any matter affecting South-West Africa dealt with by amendment by proclamation. As I have said, no Act of this Parliament applies in any event to South-West Africa, unless specifically indicated.</p>

<p>Let us now have a look at what, in fact, we have here. Sir, have you ever seen such an extraordinary constitutional dog&#x2019;s breakfast as is contained here? There are three competing legislative authorities. This is in relation to the excluded or reserved matters provided for in section 22. There is the Legislative Assembly itself, which can legislate upon those matters, if it is given permission to do so by the State President which means the Minister. Then there is this Parliament and then the State President, who can make those laws as well. Now there suddenly is an interceding fourth force. In relation to the Acts of Parliament, the Minister, in the form of the State President, comes along and says that the Acts which have been applied, can now be <span class="col_0459-0460" refersTo="page_0249"/>changed, and Acts which were not intended to be applied to South-West Africa by this Parliament, can now be applied to South-West Africa in some changed form. So there are now four competing bodies. I may say that despite this competition, there is no repeal of one or the other; they all can go on doing what they want. This Parliament can go on passing legislation applying to South-West Africa, or it can pass legislation it does not wish to apply to South-West Africa. But the Minister can nevertheless apply it to South-West Africa. That which Parliament wants to apply to South-West Africa, the Minister can now decide will not apply to South-West Africa in that form. He does not even want to come back.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says this is just the same as a province. But I want to ask him: In respect of which province does he or anyone have the power to say firstly, that the ordinances that have been passed, if they are within the purview of the subject matter and are not repugnant to an Act of Parliament, can be changed? Secondly, when an Act of Parliament is specifically intended to apply in a province, where does the power exist for the Minister to say: &#x201C;No, that shall not apply. It shall only apply in the form I want, despite what Parliament says.&#x201D; No, Sir. They do not have the powers of a province. They have the powers of a province in name only, so long as it suits the Minister that they should have them. No matter what the will of the people or the legislative assembly is, the Minister can thwart it, as he can the will of the sovereign Parliament of the Republic.</p>

<p>There are so many other aspects of this issue which I will not have time to deal with as fully as I would like to, but for example, not only does this situation exist, but we have the peculiar set-up that the Legislative Assembly can make laws with the permission of the State President in respect of all those matters set out in section 22. Then there is the situation that the State President may introduce or amend legislation in respect of those matters set out in the schedule. The matters in the schedule are different from the matters in section 22. One finds that it is only in respect of the scheduled matters that the State President can alter Acts.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Why does the situation exist that the Legislative Assembly, in terms of section 22, may, with the permission of the State President, make laws relating to civil aviation, Railways and Harbours, Public Service, military organizations or police forces, movements or operating of units of defence forces, entry of immigrants or other persons, tariffs of customs and excise, currency and banking and control of banking institutions, etc.? The Legislative Assembly may make ordinances in respect of subsections (b), (c), (d), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of section 22 with the permission of the State President, but they are not in the schedule. I would like the hon. the Minister to explain why that is so.</p>

<p>Then there is this extraordinary provision, contained in clause 10 of the Bill, that the minutes of the executive committee are no longer to be recorded in both official languages. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would explain why that is so. It is a most peculiar provision. One might wonder, at first blush, whether this was not really against the spirit of the Constitution. But when one looks at the Act, one finds that in section 26 all draft ordinances have to be in both languages. One finds in section 18 that the minutes of the Legislative Assembly have to be kept in both languages, but apparently not the minutes of the executive committee. They have gone to the trouble specifically to pick this out. It is most unusual, most odd, to say the very least.</p>

<p>While we are dealing with the question of the executive committee, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can really justify the change in the system of the composition of the executive committee. Whereas before they were appointed by proportional representation, they are now to be appointed on the basis of &#x201C;the winner takes all&#x201D;. They are not responsible to the Legislative Assembly at all. If he were to go the whole hog and do this job properly and say: &#x201C;Look, it is unrealistic to have an executive committee unless it is responsible to the council,&#x201D; then I might understand what he was saying. But merely to say that they must now be put on the basis of &#x201C;winner takes all&#x201D;, and not be responsible to the council, just does not make sense.</p>

<p>At least the object of this system, which is based upon the provincial system, was to ensure that you did have a representation of the various points of view, because the provinces were not intended to deal with matters of national concern. The politics of the provincial councils were not intended to be the politics of the Union Parliament. This position applies even more so in respect of South-West Africa which is so much further away and whose interests are so different from ours. Why change that system? The position of the Executive Committee is the most extraordinary situation anyone can wish to be in. No one can remove them. Once they are appointed they remain until the end of the life of the Legislative Assembly and no one can remove them. The Administrator cannot remove them, the State President cannot remove them and the Provincial Council cannot remove them. If that was the intention of this Bill it is one thing. If this is no longer considered to be a proper basis let us do this job properly. If we are going to have a &#x201C;winner takes all&#x201D; executive <span class="col_0461-0462" refersTo="page_0250"/>from the majority of the members of the Legislative Assembly then let us make them responsible to the Legislative Assembly and thereby give some meaning to the Legislative Assembly and the voices of the people represented therein.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat devoted most of his time to the application of this Bill, and he did not really raise any objections to it as far as the principle was concerned. His objections can be replied to more effectively during the Committee Stage, and I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister will reply adequately to them. I, however, want to confine myself to the objections in regard to principle which the hon. members of the Opposition raised here to-day and which in fact amount to three basic things. Their first objection is that this is not a suitable time, the second is that the inhabitants of South-West Africa do not know what this Act is all about, and the third objection is that the application and implementation of this Act does not really benefit the Whites. The hon. member for Durban (North) stated that he could not see how having six representatives of South-West Africa in this House could hold any advantage. He asked what their function here would be. In the implementation of this legislation greater recognition is being given to that basic idea, i.e. that South-West Africa participates in the sovereignty of South Africa. Here consideration is now being given to the Estimates in respect of Departments and the representatives of South-West Africa are being afforded this opportunity of putting the case of the people whom they represent here. The hon. member for Durban (North) raised objections and said that this legislation should not be introduced. I want to object because I think that the Opposition is not in a position, and does not have the right to participate here to-day and vote against this legislation and pretend to be the champions of the interests of South-West Africa. They have no interest whatsoever in South-West Africa, and they have not taken any trouble to acquaint themselves with the sentiments of the people there. I am going to reply to them by reading from <i>Die Suidwes-Afrikaner,</i> the official mouthpiece of the Opposition there, of 8th November, 1968. The report reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This was the second consecutive year that Senator Louw had attended our congress on behalf of the United Party of the Republic and I am convinced that he now has a better understanding of our problems. When he had to leave the congress in the middle of the discussion on the proposed take-over of our financial affairs and state departments in order to catch the aeroplane back to the Republic &#x2026;</block>

<p>In the middle of the discussion on this important matter the representative of that party left the congress. Is that the extent of his interest in South-West Africa? That, Mr. Speaker, is the interest that party takes in respect of South-West Africa when very important legislation is being discussed there. I accept that to a certain extent they did give pledges and compromise themselves in South-West Africa. I want to read from the leading article which appeared in this same newspaper on 2nd February, 1968. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The session of the Republican Parliament which is opening in Cape Town to-day is of exceptional interest to the inhabitants of South-West Africa. In addition the Opposition of this country, which comprises a very large portion of the white population, finds itself in this unenviable position that they have no representation in that Parliament. The official Opposition in the Republic has in fact, through its leader, Sir de Villiers Graaff, pledged itself in public to fight against the curtailment of South-West Africa&#x2019;s powers, and to do its best to ensure that we retain control over our finances. How well they will carry out this task time alone can tell.</block>

<p>The Opposition therefore pledged themselves in public to fight, and I want to aver to-day that they are not doing so with the deepest conviction. It is a token gesture they are making here to-day by saying to the people of South-West that they are pleading this case in the interests of South-West Africa. After all, they come forward here with arguments which do not hold water. For that reason, seeing that the Opposition in this House of Assembly is the United Party and that it is omitting to state the official standpoint of the Opposition in South-West Africa here and compare their two official standpoints, it would be no more than fair if I, who am a representative of South-West Africa, were also to state the official standpoint of the U.N.S.W.P. in South-West Africa. I am not going to do this in my own words, but by means of quotations from their own newspapers, in order to show what their approach is in respect of these closer ties with and the re-adjustment of administrative legislation and financial matters. And it is essential, in the discussion of the principle here, to note that the inhabitants of South-West Africa are aware of the standpoint of the National Party, of the Opposition in South Africa, as well as the standpoint of the Opposition in South-West Africa. They also know how these standpoints can be tested against the background of moral justification in respect of the welfare and well-being of the inhabitants of South-West Africa in the political, social and economic spheres. In respect of the first official standpoint of the U.N.S.W.P. the Opposition here is divided, and I want to thank the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for the standpoint he adopted, i.e. that South Africa has the right to introduce this legislation here to-day. The Opposition in South-West Africa is of the opinion that South <span class="col_0463-0464" refersTo="page_0251"/>Africa does not have the right to introduce this legislation here to-day. Secondly, the Opposition in South-West Africa states that South-West Africa should first become independent and should subsequently decide itself whether it wants to become part of South Africa. Thirdly, the Opposition in South-West Africa states that they would like to retain South-West Africa as a geographic whole and that they want to appoint four nominated Whites in that Legislative Assembly to represent the non-Whites, which could ultimately lead to a multi-racial government. I would like to quote what their leader himself said, and I then want to ask the Opposition whether they agree with the Opposition of South-West Africa in respect of this standpoint as well, since they have pledged themselves in public to support that Opposition. On 12th November, 1963, the Leader of the Opposition in South-West Africa said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nothing we do will avert a multi-racial government, and the sooner we have a responsible multi-racial government the better for the race relations in Southern Africa.</block>

<p>This Opposition will have to state whether they agree with the standpoint adopted by the official opposition in South-West Africa in respect of South-West Africa. In addition the opposition in South-West Africa state that they do not agree with this re-adjustment or closer ties in the field of finances and administration. The Leader of the Opposition in South-West Africa put it as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the proposed linking up of Departments and the take-over and control of the greatest portion of our finances, the National Party is undermining the position of the Whites in South West.</block>

<p>Apparently they agree that in respect of this legislation and the closer ties, nothing can be done for the Whites in South-West Africa, and that they can derive no benefit whatsoever from it. In great banner headlines the Opposition state in their official mouthpiece: &#x201C;White prosperity placed on the alter. Leader points out disadvantages of take over&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Then they go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Odendaal Report for Promotion of Blacks: White man must get along under his own steam.</block>

<p>I think this is a disgraceful approach, and I should like to know from the Opposition today whether they associate themselves with that premise of the official Opposition in South-West Africa in respect of the introduction of this Bill.</p>

<p>In addition the Opposition in South-West Africa states that we do not have the right to introduce this Bill because the people in South-West Africa were not consulted. The hon. member for Omaruru furnished full and adequate proof that this had in fact been done, and that we had fought several elections on that basis.</p>

<block name="quote">It has become clear during the past few years that since we have been given the certainty that South-West Africa will not be cut loose from the Union there has been an economic revival.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>On the contrary, the policy of the National Party in the political sphere is this&#x2014;and we are going to test it against the moral welfare and well-being of the inhabitants of South-West Africa&#x2014;that with the disbanding of the League of Nations the Mandate came to an end, and that U.N. has no supervisory powers over South-West Africa. There we apparently agree with the Opposition here whereas we differ with the Opposition in South-West Africa. In the second place, the National Party adopts the premise that South Africa is governing South-West Africa in the spirit of the Mandate, with the ultimate objective of promoting to the full the material and moral welfare and the social development of all the inhabitants of S.W.A.; thirdly that although South Africa does in terms of that Mandate have the full right to govern South-West Africa as an integral part of South Africa, i.e. full competence in regard to the legislative as well as administrative control, this power is being exercised (1) with full consideration for the desires and needs of the various ethnic groups in South-West Africa&#x2014;this is the policy of the National <span class="col_0465-0466" refersTo="page_0252"/>Party and we do not come forward here without having taken the desires of those people into consideration and having tested them&#x2014;and (2) to do so within the framework of justice, practicability, orderliness and with due consideration for the basic requirements for healthy economic growth. The National Party has consistently adhered to this. I want to go on to say that everything which South-West Africa has achieved in the constitutional sphere was given to it by the National Party. The United Party cannot tell us to-day that this is a retrogressive step because the National Party have consistently placed this constitutional development within the reach of South-West Africa, specifically for the Whites of that area. In 1925 General Hertzog was the first man to give South-West Africa larger measure of self-government. The Administrator and Advisory Council was retained, and a Legislative Assembly with an Executive Committee was established. In 1948, after the National Party had come into power again, it was Dr. Malan who went to South-West Africa again and once again looked after the interests of the inhabitants of South-West Africa. He held consultations with the two parties there, and at that time the hon. member for Bezuidenhout played an important role there. [Interjection.] Yes, if only he had remained in South-West Africa; if only he had remained member for Namib. But the hon. member came to South Africa and he now wants to become the champion of South-West Africa. I do not know whether the reason for that is that he hopes to be taken into consideration if Namib should ever become Namibia.</p>

<p>The National Party has adhered consistently to its policy and each step taken was taken against this background, as agreed to by Dr. Malan and the two Parties, which is as follows: The purpose is to continue to build, in the light of present circumstances, on the principle that South-West Africa will in terms of the mandate be governed as an integral part of the Union. I maintain therefore that the National Party is the Party which has led South-West Africa towards development.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Verwoerd came forward and appointed the Odendaal Commission, and to-day we have this legislation before the House as a result of the recommendations of that commission. We have consistently adhered to this premise. In what way can we bring about what is best for the inhabitants of South-West Africa, and what is best for each individual inhabitant? That is not what hon. members on that side are pleading for every day. What they are pleading for day after day is that we must not interfere in the desires of the inhabitants of that area. Is it not best&#x2014;and this has consistently been the policy of the National Party&#x2014;to start the population groups of South-West Africa off along the road to self-determination and individual right of possession? That is the best one can give any individual, i.e. that each ethnic group will have the right to decide on its own future, taking into consideration the principle that it is doing so with full responsibility and without dominating another ethnic group. That is the ultimate objective. Since the Government is now coming forward with this legislation, the Opposition wants to pose as the champion of the Whites in South-West Africa. While the Whites in South-West Africa want to move closer to South Africa, they now want to imply that it would not benefit the Whites of South-West Africa to move closer to the Republic. Sir, surely that is no argument. The Whites in South-West Africa have repeatedly decided at public meetings, and at two elections, that they want closer ties with South Africa on an administrative and financial level. But the Opposition now wants to deprive the Whites in South-West Africa of that right to self-determination, and try to make them believe that these closer ties with the Republic can be of no benefit to them, while it definitely would benefit them and would ensure the economic growth of South-West Africa. But the Opposition will nevertheless have to accept that there is only one of two ways. Nobody can remain static. You either move closer to one another or you move further apart from one another, and it is the policy of the National Party that what belongs together, should move closer together. That is the course we are pursuing to-day. That is why the National Party is doing its best to bring about closer ties. [Interjection.] I want to read to you what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said. It does not behove that hon. member to make interjections unless he wants to repudiate himself. On 4th May, 1954 the hon. member stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We regard the Union and South-West Africa as one indivisible country and as the united fatherland of all of us; and we regard the people of South-West Africa and the Union as joint citizens of South-West Africa.</block>

<p>I cannot understand why those hon. members now oppose these closer ties. They cannot honestly oppose them i.e. if they support what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has just said.</p>

<p>Sir, we in South-West and as representatives of South-West are grateful for the steps which the South African Government have taken. We are grateful for the degree of consultation which has taken place, for the way in which this White Paper has been drawn up and for the way in which the committee of experts which investigated the matter was constituted, and we are certain that this measure entails every advantage for us in South-West. But over against this we get the shrill contrast that the Opposition in South-West Africa does not want closer ties with the Republic, but wants to move further and further away from South Africa.</p>

<p>The benefits to South-West Africa of the implementation of the Odendaal plan are <span class="col_0467-0468" refersTo="page_0253"/>legion, and the passing of this measure promises a great deal more.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to point out the benefits which all the inhabitants of South-West Africa will derive from the passing of this measure. The premise of the Odendaal Report, and the policy of the Government, is that these closer ties must be to the benefit of all inhabitants. I want to refer specifically to the economic benefits which closer ties will entail, and in this regard I just want to quote from the <i>Financial Gazette</i> of October, 1968&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wave of expansion has hit South-West: Critics of the Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s recommendations for the development of South-West Africa have faded into silence in the face of the wave of expansion which has taken place in the territory over the past five years.</block>

<p>Yes, since this process has been set in motion. The critics of the Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s recommendations are sitting on the opposite side; they are the people who wanted to prevent this development, but everybody in South-West Africa today admits that fantastic development has taken place in South-West as a result of the implementation of the recommendations of the Odendaal Commission. Sir, for any economic revival, expansion or development, there are a few essential requirements, and the foremost of these is not the production potential or the natural resources but the safety and order prevailing in that country; that is the primary requirement for any economic development. I can mention numerous countries with greater production potential, greater agricultural resources, greater natural resources than South-West Africa, but because there is no security, there is no economic development and no economic revival. Here South Africa steps in and it guarantees the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition the Government wants to emphasize that the envisaged financial and administrative rearrangement is exclusively aimed at promoting, in accordance with the basic principles above, the welfare and the safety of the territory and all its population groups.</block>

<p>It is a basic essential that there should be security, and that is why we are moving closer to South Africa and not further away from South Africa. I think many countries in Africa envy us.</p>

<p>The second aspect which is important for any development is not mere resources, but technical know-how and people to apply this, and I want to tell you that we in South-West Africa are making use of staff in our State Departments who are from South Africa. We are dependent upon this technical know-how and its application.</p>

<p>The third important aspect I want to mention is that one cannot have economic development if the infra-structure is not right; and South Africa has seen to the establishment of this infra-structure, and that is why we want to move closer to South Africa. And South Africa not only saw to it in the past, it shall see to it in the future as well and they will make loans available in order to make this possible. We are thinking of our roads, aerodromes, railways, communications and power. A number of the hon. members who spoke before me referred to that and mentioned the benefits this would entail, and how much money was being spent on it. I want to read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Communications boost economy. The development of roads, rail and sea communication in South-West Africa has been given top priority over the past five years. The result is that to-day the territory has an excellent transport network to almost every important centre. The marked economic growth of South-West Africa in the post-war years, demands an efficient transport system, and the S.A. Railways and Harbours Administration speeded up its development programme in the region.</block>

<p>To me the reasons are obvious why South-West Africa wants to move closer to South Africa, why it wants its departments to participate in this knowledge which Departments in South Africa have at their disposal, whether it is in the field of agriculture, mining or planning. After all, we have one economy. In respect of planning I think that if we can call in the services of the Department of Planning in South-West Africa as well, and if there is co-ordination one would be able to eliminate a great deal of overlapping. Think of the development of the West Coast in respect of harbours, etc. In this is included every advantage for the revival of South-West, for the stabilization and the development of that economy. It is all included in this White Paper. In addition South Africa comes forward and in respect of what the Opposition wants to level accusations at, i.e. that it wants to swallow up the money of South-West, it under <span class="col_0469-0470" refersTo="page_0254"/>takes certain things. These are that all taxes deriving from South-West Africa will be kept separate and will be utilized to the benefit of that territory only, as is in fact recommended in paragraph 1482. South Africa has done this on the basis of the fact that the Opposition is slandering South Africa by intimating to the voters of South-West that it wants to swallow up the money of South-West. That is why this provision is being included there, so as to give the inhabitants of South-West Africa the assurance that this is not the case.</p>

<p>It states further that it is very desirable that any re-arrangement should cause as little disruption as possible to the population of South-West Africa and should not impose additional burdens on the tax-payers of that territory. This assurance is being given.</p>

<p>I now challenge the Opposition to enumerate the disadvantages of closer ties, based on the White Paper and the Bill. They must come forward with the disadvantages; they must not come forward with veiled objections. Is it that they do not want South-West Africa closer to South Africa? Is that the objection, or have they merely pledged themselves to the Opposition in South-West to oppose this matter in this way? I think they ought to act with greater responsibility. The desires of the white inhabitants of South-West Africa are that this Bill should go through, and that we should form closer ties on this basis and with this assurance which we are being given so that South Africa can participate in the tremendous expansion which is taking place in the Republic.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. C. ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>When one examines the White Paper on the Bill at present before this House, this commission of inquiry, the panel of experts, in my opinion deserves to be mentioned for the gigantic task they performed in conducting a thorough investigation into the financial and administrative arrangements between South-West Africa and the Republic. Our present Administrator was the chairman of this commission and we owe all of them a debt of gratitude for the work they did.</p>

<p>Sir, while listening to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other speakers on his side, I wondered why they were opposing this legislation. Has the hon. the Leader of the Opposition possibly committed himself in South-West Africa? Because he is no stranger there. In 1964, after Dr. Verwoerd had gone to South-West Africa to explain the Odendaal Report to the people, the Leader of the Opposition also went to South-West Africa and he explained the standpoint of the United Party on the Odendaal Report. In this regard I want to quote from <i>Die Suidwes-Afrikaner, the</i>United Party newspaper in South-West Africa, of Thursday, 26th March, 1964. The headlines are that the Republic should give more assistance to South-West Africa, and the report reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before an audience &#x2026;</block>

<p>There was a rather large audience, perhaps out of curiosity, because if they had heard him previously, they would probably not have attended the meeting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of more than 1,500 people in Windhoek last night the Leader of the United Party in the Republic, Sir De Villiers Graaff, rejected the proposed take-over of the finances of South-West Africa by the Republic and the dismantling of the country&#x2019;s administration as proposed by the Odendaal Commission, and said that it would be more in the spirit of the mandate to extend the administration of the country.</block>

<p>According to this newspaper report, if one is to believe it, the Leader of the Opposition also put forward his federation plan. This is a very lengthy report, evidently a <i>verbatim</i> one, on his explanation of this entire plan. Subsequent to that the Leader of the Opposition went there again. In 1966 he, accompanied by the hon. member for Yeoville, went to address the congress of the U.N.S.W.P. and according to the newspaper of 25th November, 1966, they expressed the following view (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Federal policy solution for South-West Africa&#x2014;United Party also believes South-West Africa should get more powers: The United Party believed that its federal policy was the solution to the constitutional problems of South-West Africa and it believed that South-West Africa should have greater autonomy, while enjoying the protection and association of the Republic, said Sir De Villiers Graaff, Leader of the United Party, at Windhoek on Wednesday evening when he addressed the congress of the U.N.S.W.P.</block>

<p>Now one asks oneself in view of these things whether they committed themselves to such an extent in the past that they cannot escape from that, and whether that is why they are opposing this Bill as half-heartedly as they have been doing to-day; because their opposition reminds one of a person who eats although he has no real appetite. They are in a difficult position because they cannot say too much against South-West Africa. Although they maintain that they do not really have an alliance with the people there, they nevertheless visit South-West Africa frequently enough. This leading article of the same date states that there is no alliance. This article dated 25th November reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More co-operation: The request of the U.N.S.W.P. congress that this party and the United Party of the Republic should maintain closer contact with each other, and that existing co-operation between the parties should be placed on a sound footing, ought to be welcomed by everyone in the U.N.S.W.P. and the United Party.</block>

<p><span class="col_0471-0472" refersTo="page_0255"/>In addition it mentions a number of things for which they should fight together. I have now come to the conclusion that the real reason for their opposition to this Bill is that they do not want to leave those friends of theirs in the lurch. As regards this federal policy of the Leader of the Opposition, we have had clear results after the publication of the Odendaal Report. We fought an election on that platform. The 1,500 people who attended that meeting learnt about that policy and they surely informed other people about it. After all, it came from the Leader of the Opposition of the Republic, in other words the alternative Prime Minister. However, I am more concerned about what the inhabitants of South-West Africa say about this legislation.</p>

<p>Now, what do we find in South-West Africa? Immediately after the publication of the Odendaal Report the people still talked because land had been bought up, but after this White Paper had been tabled last year&#x2014;and it was brought to the attention of the voters of South-West very clearly&#x2014;the people accepted it without a word. This is something I shall deal with presently. One does not hear anybody talking about that any more. They accept it as though this readjustment has been completed, except for a few United Party supporters who are trying to make a fuss about it. However, they raise a dust wherever they can possibly do so, because they have nothing else to do. That is why they find themselves in the position in which they do find themselves to-day. As far as their political policy is concerned, they are living from hand to mouth. If something happens which they can possibly exploit, they exploit it to such an extent that it falls as flat as a pancake, as happened in this case. One has the position that all sections of the population of South-West accept this. The farming community accepts it, as has been said by the chairman of their agricultural union, as do the businessmen. According to a short report published on 6th September, 1968, the farmers will benefit from this readjustment. The report states that the published memorandum on the readjustments between the Republic and South-West Africa contains nothing detrimental to the farming community. In other words, the farming community accepts that the readjustments will be made and that there will be nothing disadvantageous to them in those readjustments. Now one comes to the other communities, for example, the businessmen. The businessmen have confidence in the policy of the National Party which has developed the Republic and South-West Africa under this National Government to their present position.</p>

<p>Sir, you and other members know what South-West Africa looked like in 1950 when the National Party took it over. Because of the policy of the National Party and its implementation over the years, the people have grown accustomed to the fact that the National Party looks well after their interests, as has become evident from the results of elections held subsequent to 1950. We, as Members of Parliament, accompanied members of the Legislative Assembly to explain this White Paper to the people, and we encountered no opposition from members of the general public who are interested in South-West Africa and its affairs. We encountered no opposition either from the municipalities or from any other source. But the United Party of South-West Africa also tried to explain the White Paper. The hon. members from South-West Africa who spoke before me covered this subject to a reasonable extent. The U.N.S.W.P. behaved like an elephant with toothache. They wanted to destroy and crush everything, and they wanted to plan this in such a way that at the end of that campaign launched by them their congress would be the climax, and that was a failure.</p>

<p>Do you mean United Party supporters?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. C. ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am speaking about the people of the United Party of South-West Africa. From that date onwards they held a series of meetings with their leader in the forefront. An hon. member has already said that the leader of the United Party in South-West Africa, Advocate Niehaus, called for a referendum. I and many other people think that this was a silly request, as he had had several occasions previously for determining what the position there was. As I said before, an election was fought in South-West Africa on the Odendaal Report. At that election they lost all the United Party seats except one. In 1966 we fought another election and won all the seats. That made their leader an ex-M.L.A. I should like to read you a few headlines from newspapers, Sir, so that you may learn how they carried on and tried to exploit the election, in spite of the damage they were doing South-West Africa by doing so. The following heading appeared in <i>Die Suidwes-Afrikaner</i> of 21st Tune (translation): &#x201C;Niehaus asks for a vote of protest against take-over&#x201D;; &#x201C;Millions will be used indiscriminately&#x201D;. When one reads these headings, one can clearly deduce from them that attempts were being made to place the Republic of South Africa under suspicion in the eyes of the inhabitants of South-West Africa and to incite their feelings against the Republic. They alone will know for what reason they tried to do so. Another few newspaper headings are the following: (translation) &#x201C;Odendaal Commission for advancement of Blacks; Whites to paddle their own canoe&#x201D;. This was said by Van der Berg, the United Party candidate, who will suffer his fourth or fifth defeat in South-West Africa on the 5th March. The way in which they nominate candidates reminds me of the old man who was too stingy to slaughter a sheep for his family. If, however, his wife nagged him too much to slaughter a sheep, he would go to the kraal and startle the sheep. The one that fell was the one he slaughtered. This seems to be the method according to which <span class="col_0473-0474" refersTo="page_0256"/>they nominate their candidates. One may almost call this candidate of theirs a chronic candidate. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout knows him and I think that he enjoys this with me. It has come to my ears that the leader, Advocate Niehaus, does not feel like suffering yet another defeat. So he simply pushed in the other candidate who, as the old saying goes, is like a treadmill-donkey; he does not care what a thrashing he will be given.</p>

<p>An article appeared in the newspaper of 8th October under the heading (translation) &#x201C;Dark future for N.P., says Niehaus&#x201D;; &#x201C;Plan merely to impress the U.N. and U Thant&#x201D;; &#x201C;interests of South-West Africa neglected&#x201D;. In <i>Die Suidwes-Afrikaner</i> of 30th July the following heading appeared (translation): &#x201C;N.P. way led to dead-end&#x201D;. And so one can go through their newspapers and suspicion-mongering is the only thing one will find. They maintained a deadly silence with regard to their alternative plan for the people. They did not tell the people that they were opposed to the Odendaal plan, although they did state in their election manifesto that they would return the farms to white farmers without land. But they did not explain what alternative plan they would have followed if they had won the election. They did not say whether they would terminate the existence of the homelands or what their plan with the homelands was. They kept quiet about these things.</p>

<p>Mr. Van der Berg was invited to hold a joint meeting but one condition was laid down. Every speaker was to devote the first 30 minutes to his own policy, in other words, he had to give his alternative to the recommendations contained in the Odendaal Report. But Mr. Van der Berg did not accept that. He was willing to agree to a joint meeting, but he did not want his hands to be tied. He did not wish to discuss his policy, but the Odendaal Report and the White Paper. This shows one how afraid he is of putting their alternative. When one looks into the events of the past number of years in South-West Africa, ones which took place after the publication of the Odendaal Report, and into the enormous growth there, and when one examines the statistics of the Municipality of Windhoek to ascertain what will happen during the next 15 years, one finds that Windhoek will have more than 100,000 white inhabitants by the year 1985. At present they are faced with a problem, because they cannot keep up with taking the necessary measures to cope with the influx. This influx proves that people have confidence in South-West Africa, not only because of the policy of the National Party, but also because a start has been made with the implementation of the Odendaal Report. I want to predict that this influx into and interest in South-West Africa will increase. Big industrialists are prepared to invest money in South-West Africa. In earlier days this never happened. People like Oppenheimer are buying large numbers of plots in Windhoek. They buy up to 300 plots at a time and have houses built on them. If this does not prove that they have confidence in the country, I do not know the meaning of the word &#x201C;confidence&#x201D;. Surely those industrialists will not invest their money in a country which is unsafe, one which does not have a good future; in other words, they will not invest their money if they cannot earn a good return on their money. They can most decidedly invest their money at numerous other places. Like Oppenheimer, there are many other people who are showing their confidence in South-West Africa in this way.</p>

<p>Now we come to the ordinary inhabitants and even the non-Whites of South-West Africa. In an earlier speech, Sir, I read quotations to you from a few old speeches made by the Leader of the Opposition in Windhoek in which he said that the Nationalists were too useless to remove the old location. It was nothing to remove the old location. It could be done within half an hour. If we had wanted to push South-West Africa back into that international quagmire in which it used to be, we could have done so. But go and see what it looks like now. The location has been removed without a word out of anybody. The people of the United Party in South-West Africa wanted us to get into trouble, because they have so little to put before the people of South-West Africa that it appears as though some of them pray, before going to bed at night, for some disaster to hit South-West Africa so that they might gain some temporary advantage from that. That is the political level on which they are moving at present.</p>

<p>We as well as the non-Whites of South-West Africa realize more and more every day that the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the Administration of South-West Africa are at least being honest. The non-Whites realize that the Government has an honest plan for granting them their rights too. These people are not such fools that they do not realize what is happening in other countries which are applying the policy the United Party wants to apply. After all, they read the newspapers too; they have radios too; they know what is happening in the world where federal governments are in power. After all, they know where they stood when they were alone. They know that they are just as dependent on the Whites as the Whites are on their services. They realize to-day that we shall live in that country, each in his own territory, and they accept this. It is an accepted policy with those people to-day, except for a small number of hot-heads one still finds. Many of these hot-heads are egged on by Whites. The ideas these people are conveying are not all their own. We know them. We know that there are Whites who are trying to incite them, as we have also been experiencing in the Republic over the years. We know that there are legal practitioners who are supplying them with legal advice free of charge. One can go to the building housing the advocates and other legal practitioners at any time, and there <span class="col_0475-0476" refersTo="page_0257"/>will always be a queue of these black people waiting at the rooms of a certain legal practitioner or two. They are the ones who are inciting the people. But even if they gain nothing from this they lose nothing either. That is why I say that for Whites to do things like these, without caring what may afterwards happen to their country, is contemptible.</p>

<p>We in South-West Africa accept this measure. I represent a large constituency which is 1,200 sq. miles larger than the O.F.S. The constituency extends over an area of 51,000 square miles. The people in my constituency accept this Bill just as they do in the rest of the territory. They have confidence in the National Party, in the Government and in the Republic of South Africa. They know that our weal or woe is closely linked to that of the Republic, and that we cannot be away from each other.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as one listens to hon. member after hon. member from South-West Africa speaking on this Bill, a mere member from the Republic gets, I think, two feelings. Firstly, one feels the battle of Windhoek is being fought in this House to-day. One feels, for example, that the hon. member for Middelland was trying very hard to say there was no difference between the UNSWAP and the United Party of the Republic, but on the other hand the hon. member for Karas could find practically no agreement between the two because he found so many points of difference. Secondly, one feels those hon. members have in a sense been bluffed into accepting this new arrangement in the belief that they are going to have greater security. I want to dwell further upon that, but before I do so I want to just touch on one aspect, almost as if it were a point of order, Sir, although it is not a point of order.</p>

<p>At the outset the hon. the Minister handling this measure made a very short speech indeed, and I sincerely hope when he replies to the debate he will not then come with his real and main arguments. I cannot believe he will do this, especially as he is a lawyer and knows the courts would not tolerate such a manoeuvre in a court case and would only allow him to reply to those matters raised in the course of debate after his initial address. Lest the Minister feels inclined to follow such a course, I merely utter this warning.</p>

<p>I believe my hon. Leader made a series of points which show that this measure is neither in the interests of South-West Africa nor of the Republic. I believe that to a very large extent, whilst they have been fighting the battle of Windhoek, hon. members opposite have been in default inasmuch as they did not reply to the points made by my hon. Leader. I hope the Minister in his reply will attempt to answer these points, because my Leader and other hon. members on this side made some weighty points which I believe require a detailed answer.</p>

<p>The great justification advanced by hon. members opposite for supporting this Bill is this. They say that in one way and another it will ensure the security of the territory. For example, the hon. member for Middelland said &#x201C;&#x2019;n Groter mate van sekerheid in ons toekoms&#x201D; is why they desire this measure. He also spoke of an injection into and a stimulus for the economy. The hon. member for Omaruru said, &#x201C;Dit is lewensbelangrik vir die blankes in Suidwes-Afrika om saam te staan by Suid-Afrika &#x2026; Dit sal fataal vir Suidwes-Afrika wees om van Suid-Afrika geskei te word. As die Republiek ons more sal los, sal ons in die hande van die V.V.O. wees&#x201D;. The hon. member for Karas said: &#x201C;Ons moet nader beweeg en dit is die versekering vir die voortbestaan en groei van Suidwes-Afrika.&#x201D; This is clearly the reason closest to the hearts of hon. members opposite, particularly those from South-West Africa; they all said it in one way or another. But, Sir, I believe they are under a misapprehension, because I do not believe for a moment that it is necessary for the security and safety of the people of the territory that they should embrace this measure, or choose to pass it, and I hope to elaborate upon that. I believe the Nationalist Party has persuaded the people of South-West Africa really to trade their federal independence for virtually a mess of pottage&#x2014;&#x201C;vir &#x2019;n bordjie lensiesop&#x201D;. I shall say why. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Government is fragmenting the territory. Last year it set the six native territories on the road to independence, and now it is dealing with the balance of the people in South-West Africa. I suggest in so doing the Government is robbing the territory of the people who add most strength to it. It is true that my party stands for a different arrangement, and this is an important reason why we oppose this Bill. We have a different vision for South Africa and it includes a different vision for South-West Africa. Our vision is that of the central Parliament guiding the fortunes of the four provinces. We see it as watching over the growing self-administration of homogeneous black areas. Above all, we see it watching over the future of South-West Africa, which has always been an example of a territory with a measure of federal links and federal independence. South-West Africa is in a unique position. Its history is quite different from that of the Republic. First there was the German occupation and thereafter there were different stages of development and the control of power since that time, something which we have never had here. Its constitutional position is quite unique, and so is its international character. Moreover, its many non-white races, races different from those of the Republic, make it a unique territory. It has not two but three white groups, people from different extractions, speaking three languages. We have seen that it is best to treat a territory with such unique qualities, a territory of such size and occupying such a position, different from the way we treat <span class="col_0477-0478" refersTo="page_0258"/>the provinces of the Republic. It requires a different approach to matters of education and of language. The people of the Republic have always seen the territory as one which should be granted a greater measure of autonomy than the provinces. And this is where I return to the point with which I started.</p>

<p>There would be no less assurance of safety, security and interest for the people of South-West Africa under our approach. Though the link would be a federal one, it does not mean in any way that the interest in and the concern for the people of the territory, nor the feeling of oneness, would be any less. I believe this to be the fallacy of the approach of hon. members from South-West Africa. They believe it is only by surrendering certain of the powers of the territory and by linking the territory more closely administratively with the Republic that extra security can be achieved. Does anybody believe that the federal government of the U.S.A. or the federal government of the Commonwealth of Australia would be less concerned about the safety and security of one of its states than the Republic would be about the safety of one of our provinces. Hon. members from South-West Africa give the impression that by linking the territory more closely administratively with the Republic, it enjoys greater security. But by bringing the territory nearer to the Republic South-West Africa is surrendering so much of its autonomy and accepting a provincial position. I have shown the position which obtains in federal states, and I state that under the approach of the United Party we would be no less concerned about the future and safety of South-West Africa than that side is, now that the territory is being brought closer administratively to the Republic. But the territory is not being brought more closely to the Republic regarding the determination of the people to watch over their future&#x2014;not one whit more closely in that respect.</p>

<p>Speaker after speaker on that side has stated that this is the justification for this measure, but I have no doubt they are suffering under a misapprehension. This indeed is clear from certain other comments which came from that side. There is a suggestion that the policy of this side somehow will leave the people of South-West Africa out in the cold. But this is by no means the case. We would ensure that the peoples of the territory are watched over as carefully as ever.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude by saying this. The people of the territory may have supported the Government to a growing extent during elections in the past, but I believe when those elections were held the people were to a large extent nervous about their future. There was a time prior to the decision in the South-West Africa court case when the people of the territory were very nervous about their future. And that nervousness has not entirely been removed. It was during those times that most of the elections were held and no doubt the people were told at the time of the elections, &#x201C;You surrender these powers, you are now so much more directly ruled from Pretoria, and this must result in greater interest in your future and greater assurance for your safety&#x201D;. I stress there is no truth whatsoever in that approach, and to that extent, if they believed those arguments, I believe the people of the territory were misled and persuaded to trade their federal independence for a mess of pottage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, from what previous speakers have said in this debate it is quite clear that the United Party does not know what it wants. In the history of South-West Africa there have been good times and bad times, and as soon as bad times occurred the United Party of South-West Africa aroused interest in the possibility of closer integration of the area with the former Union, and even asked for complete incorporation. This is precisely why at the beginning of the thirties, with the economic depression, there was a strong tendency among the average South-West African, whether English speaking, Afrikaans speaking, Nationalist or supporter of the United Party of those days, in favour of complete incorporation with the Union on account of the critical financial position of South-West Africa. A commission was then appointed, namely the South-West Africa Commission of 1936. Judge De Villiers came to the conclusion that the United Party of South-West Africa really did not know what they wanted. In the debate to-day we heard the same when hon. members on this side clearly related how the Opposition Party advocated incorporation, but then, at another stage they ask again that independence should be granted to South-West Africa. I want to refer to a few points discussed in the debate. The hon. member for Pinelands referred to &#x201C;the belief of the South-West African members in the surrendering of autonomous power and thereby getting security&#x201D;. This hon. member is completely on the wrong track in this connection. I must say he is apparently not aware of the conditions there. He is forgetting that there are ties of blood between people in South-West Africa and people in the Republic. Throughout the world the trend is at present for people to unite into a larger whole. This is really where the security lies. For this reason people unite into a larger whole and the people of South-West Africa want an even closer connection with the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>However, I want to deal with some other aspects of this rearrangement. My colleagues made quite a number of references to the United Party in South-West Africa and to the policy of that party there. Quite a number of newspaper clippings were also quoted. I want to cover another field, namely the development which is at present taking place in <span class="col_0479-0480" refersTo="page_0259"/>South-West Africa. It should be realized that major expenditure has been incurred in South-West Africa at the cost of the taxpayers and the public of the Republic of South Africa, and is being incurred at present, without its having any benefit for those taxpayers. It is a fact that at present schemes are being developed which, together with the sums already spent, will probably cost approximately R400 million ultimately. This is bringing about an enormous metamorphosis throughout the area. This economic development has already been referred to. I now want to elaborate on it. Thus in the past the Republic spent large capital amounts on railways and harbours to serve the area without there being any question of compensation or repayment of capital amounts. Apart from this capital expenditure on permanent works, millions of rands were provided for the purchase of locomotives, vehicles and aircraft. Moreover, the railways accumulated a working loss on rail, road and air services, while the Republic made further contributions of over R6 million to other services. The Odendaal Commission stated in a detailed calculation:</p>

<block name="quote">This provision of capital and services without any obligation to repay, amounting to a cash value of more than R165 million or more than R300 per capita of the present total population, must surely be the most valuable aid programme per capita of the population which any area in the world has received from a friendly country. These amounts were spent over a period of many years when the value of money was greater than it is to-day. If the amount of R165 million were expressed in terms of 1963 prices, it would amount to more than R200 million.</block>

<p>The influence of capital expenditure on the economic growth of a country varies from country to country. The influence of capital expenditure by the Railways in South-West Africa was very great because it has such an extraordinarily great effect on the profitable production and marketing of its base minerals, on the marketing of its agricultural products, such as cattle, and on the provision of its most important source of energy, namely coal, which in fact had to be provided from as far as Witbank. The effectiveness of this capital expenditure is measured by the extent of its influence on the increase of the net national income, and the criterion is the ratio between capital expenditure and production. Thus it is calculated that the capital expenditure of the Railways alone increased the net national income per capita of the total population by R71.4 per annum and the gross domestic product per capita of the population by R117.6 per annum. The Odendaal Commission calculated these amounts to represent 44 per cent of the net national income or of the gross domestic product per capita of the population in 1962&#x2014;the year of the investigation by the Odendaal Commission. But the real influence of the contribution by the Railways to the economic development of the area is probably even greater than is indicated by these impressive figures, because the great influence it is having on investment in the private sector has not been taken into account here. Even if the Railways have completed their capital expenditure, further productive capital expenditure will have to take place, which in turn will stimulate further capital expenditure in the private sector. Just as the Railways owe their success to their ability to organize and fully control the development, any further great development plans can only be carried through if the means to organize and carry through the programme are available. That is the problem we are faced with in South-West Africa. History shows that in the time of the United Party regime in South-West Africa there was no progress or growth rate that can be compared with that since the time the National Party regime took over there in 1950. When the National Party came into power there in 1950 they conducted investigations into the extent to which the infrastructure in South-West Africa could be improved. This infra-structure relates to transport, roads, water affairs and electricity supply. There is also the other facet which is important in this connection and which relates to transport, namely the airports. For example, investigations were conducted to ascertain to what extent the water supplies of South-West Africa could be supplemented. With a view to that a good deal of research was carried out at the nothern rivers. The result of the investigations indicated that a very large amount of capital was necessary for the development of South-West Africa. In this connection the capital was simply not available. As I have mentioned, these development works which are now in progress there and are in fact bringing about a metamorphosis in South-West Africa, will eventually amount to more than R400 million. In view of the fact, however, that that capital could not be provided out of South-West African resources, the Odendaal Commission was appointed. As a result of the recommendations of the Odendaal Commission we have the development at the Kunene River, where in co-operation with the Portuguese the entire hydrology of the Kunene River has been worked out and the power generation potential has been determined. Hon. members have of course read the recent reports in the Press in connection with the agreements entered into with the Portuguese. Hon. members have probably heard of the pump scheme, the Ruacana hydro-electrical station, a dam in the headwaters of the Kunene situated far into Angola and which will be called the Goue Dam, and the dam at Caluequa on the Kunene River which is situated across the border in Angola. All these schemes, though situated far into Angola, will cost our Government <span class="col_0481-0482" refersTo="page_0260"/>large amounts. All these amounts could not be provided out of the revenue of South-West Africa itself. I am thinking of the amount in the case of the Goue dam, which will be as much as R9 million. Half of that will be a loan to the Portuguese and the other half will be borne by the Government. Some people consider this to be a donation, but actually it is not. We are responsible for half of the cost in view of the fact that if the dam is built, it will ensure a security of flow in the river. It will ensure a constant flow in the river and we will therefore have a guarantee downstream where the hydroelectric scheme will be established at great expense. The Calueque is also the full responsibility of the Government because it is situated closer to the hydro-electric station at Ruacana, which is of course on this side of the South-West African border. I am thinking of all the large amounts provided for all this development work. An amount of approximately R56 million is required for the Ruacana scheme. I am thinking of the present pumping scheme on the Kunene River in Angola, for which tenders will most probably be called next month. The latter also comprises an interim hydro-electric power generation scheme, which will actually be the pilot installation for the larger hydro-electric scheme. Large amounts are required for all these schemes. All these schemes will be to the benefit of South-West Africa&#x2019;s infrastructure. In this connection I must refer to the importance of technicians, who will play a very important role in all this, but who are simply not available in South-West Africa. I am thinking, for example, of hydrologists. Now, for the first time, hydrological research has become important, and the technicians had to be obtained elsewhere. In view of the extent of the hydro-electric scheme, experts in the electro-technical field had to be obtained. We do not have these technicians. In the end we had to obtain them from the Republic of South Africa. Therefore I cannot imagine how, in these circumstances, with all these large projects and development works, and with the building up of an infrastructure, South-West Africa could have provided these technical personnel from its own sources. Apart from that, what is needed is manpower, and to-day manpower can only be bought. Without the funds it would simply have been impossible to do this.</p>

<p>Capital for such a comprehensive plan can be obtained only if there is certainty as regards sound management and organization being available. That is only available on a very selective basis for selected projects aimed at supplying electricity. These projects are considered to offer the best possibility to the outside world as regards capital provision. In this respect the Republic is the only practical source of capital. However, it is clear that since the Republic has to accept the full financial obligations and the responsibility for the implementation of such a plan, it should also exercise full technical control and supervision over the entire programme, as well as over the effective expenditure of all available funds coming from South-West Africa as well as from the Republic of South Africa, and also from foreign sources. The success of such a development plan can only be ensured if full use is made of the experienced and proven institutions that are available in the Republic. That is why it is so essential that financial or economic planning, together with the political supervision, should fall directly under the Government of the Republic of South Africa. Hence this legislation.</p>

<p>I can only say that, as far as I am concerned, time has in fact passed the United Party by. They do not realize that time does not stand still. In all spheres changes are taking place and there is progress. There is a continual evolutionary trend in all fields, especially in this technological age we are living in. It does not matter where one goes, one sees it happening everywhere in all fields throughout the world. Not only in the field of science, agriculture, mining, and social affairs, but also in the political field, evolution is taking place everywhere. And still the United Party believes in the old ideas which can bring it nothing but stagnation. Stagnation of course leads to decay, and it can be said of the United Party: &#x201C;The graveyard of obsolescence claims its corpses without prejudice to disciplinary labours of the White man&#x2019;s leadership in a federation of states.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It is true, of course, that the unravelling of problems creates new problems. One finds this everywhere. If one starts something new, one always finds that there are growing pains. There are always many other problems one will have to take into account. It is true that in the initial stage of their development all communities are retarded by cultural and religious bonds together with a kind of careless antipathy. The establishment of a sound ideology&#x2014;and this is where education must play its part&#x2014;properly manipulated, can help to reduce the influence of the established concepts, and in that way bring about a solidarity among the various ethnic groups of South-West Africa. In the same way communities can use ideological concepts to draw closer together the traditions and identities of the various groups, which can sometimes be very complicated, and to bind them closer into a unit. Behind this unity there is the concept of the community as a natural and organic body in which all the separate factions have their set functions&#x2014;especially those factions which are linked to the process of development by means of the investment of State capital. In this connection there can be no doubt that the average citizen of South-West Africa and also the average Native of South-West Africa look to the State for the development of his homeland. Here I do not mean the White homeland only, but also the homeland of the Black man, because previously <span class="col_0483-0484" refersTo="page_0261"/>there had been sufficient opportunity for private capital to help them to develop, but except for the usual trade centres and exploitation, there was no development in these non-White areas by private capital. The effect of the investment of State capital is much more rational than the effect exercised by private capital on the development of the homelands, because greater emphasis can be placed on regional planning and scientific long-term investigations to combine the various facets of the national economy of the homeland and to make it function efficiently as a whole.</p>

<p>We therefore have two aspects. In the first place there is an attempt at adaptation to the technological demands of the modern period in which we are living, which makes it necessary for us, if we want to make that adaptation effective, to group the people for the efficient functioning of the planned development in the social and economical fields. That brings to the fore the desire to preserve identity and the motivation of an ideology, with the emphasis on political development and achievements.</p>

<p>Economic growth brings higher standards of living to the homelands. This applies to both the White and the non-White homelands. It stimulates in its turn self-examination in the case of the non-Whites into their own traditional communal system in order to introduce new ideas into that system and to have it used as an instrument to make the new political system function propertly. Older values are being replaced and new values or concepts of traditional tribal life must be modified to be used under the conditions of modern times.</p>

<p>At present the economy of Ovamboland is based on its labour potential&#x2014;the so-called migratory labour which is provided to the areas south of Ovamboland. Employment opportunities widen the spiritual framework of the labourer and this must necessarily stimulate his ambition and arouse his ideas for the development of his own homeland. We cannot build a Berlin wall of an Ulbricht around the non-Whites. There is, as a matter of fact, continuous contact between White and non-White, and as a result of that a streamlining of the non-White is in progress.</p>

<p>The United Party is in favour of the economic development of the homelands. According to them the evolution must proceed in all fields, except in the political field. All constructive measures and economic development stimulate ambitions, and the natural human tendency of the people there will be to increase the status of their own identity by making demands in the political field. If the Black man does not do this, it will be quite inconsistent with the law of the jungle or with the outlook on life of the Westerner in South-West Africa. Instead of displaying idealism and patriotism, the Opposition is on the lookout for possible opportunities, which obviously shows a misconception of the conditions. While there is peace and quiet in South-West, they are hoping with attacks of this nature to disturb that peace and quiet. They are only placing obstacles in the way of the natural development of South-West Africa, while it is the desire of our people in South-West Africa to become a full and equal part of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
