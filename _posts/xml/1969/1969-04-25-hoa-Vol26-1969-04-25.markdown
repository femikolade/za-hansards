<heading>Alternative accommodation for residents of private old age home in Boksburg</heading>

<question by="#reyneke" to="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<num>*4.</num>

<from>Mr. J. P. A. REYNEKE</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether arrangements have been made for the care of ailing aged persons who were in danger of being without accommodation after the building housing a private home for the aged in Boksburg had been sold; if so,</li>

<li><span class="col_4745-4746" refersTo="page_0860"/>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_national_education" to="#reyneke">

<from>The MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION (for the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions):</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) After the matter was brought to my notice by the hon. member early in February, 1969, I gave instructions that senior officers of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions should give immediate attention to the matter.

<ul>

<li>It was ascertained that the buildings of the old age home were sold and that the lease was terminated from the 1st March, 1969. The 48 frail aged persons who were cared for in the old age home would therefore have been without any refuge. Although the home was a private undertaking and did not receive subsidies from the State, the Department started negotiations with the new owners of the buildings and obtained their approval that the lease be extended until the 30th April, 1969.</li>

<li>The Department immediately made further efforts to find other accommodation for the inmates. Alternative housing was in fact obtained but it was subsequently learned that the owner had succeeded in finding another building in which the aged persons are now being cared for.</li>

<li>I may also mention that the Department is busy with an extensive investigation as to the needs for the care of frail aged persons in the entire Witwatersrand area. If it appears from this investigation that frail aged persons are not sufficiently cared for, the Department will give further urgent attention to the whole matter.</li>

<heading>HOUSING AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Third Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Before the House adjourned last night, I had mentioned that we on this side of the House had certain questions which we would like to put to the hon. the Minister, questions which might perhaps more suitably be directed to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. During the course of the debate the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration interjected to say that the powers to be vested in the Bantu Trust in terms of this Bill would and could only be exercised in Bantu townships established by the National Housing Commission within urban areas adjacent to scheduled or released areas in terms of the Bantu Trust Act of 1936. But is that in fact correct&#x003F; Because if one looks at this Bill, although I have no objection, I believe that the Bill goes much further in regard to the powers conferred by the Bill and here I should like to refer to the long title in the fifth line of which it says that this Bill is to empower the S.A. Bantu Trust to take over the interests and liabilities of local authorities in certain housing schemes. The only restriction in regard to housing schemes relates to those financed by the National Housing Commission and controlled by the local authority. If we go further, clause 2, in line 26, says &#x201C;the Trust may by agreement with any local authority take over the interest and liability of such local authority in respect of any such scheme&#x201D;, these powers are very much wider than was indicated by the hon. the Minister, and they are very much wider than the restrictions suggested by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, namely that they could only be applied in townships adjacent to scheduled or released areas. I want to say that we on this side of the House accept wholeheartedly and support wholeheartedly the provision and the wider implication of what is laid down in this Bill, because first of all it recognizes that there is such a thing as a settled urban Bantu population in South Africa because it empowers the Trust now to take over the townships in urban local areas. Added to that is the second point, that when once the Trust takes control of such a township the Bantu is entitled to home ownership within that township area. We <span class="col_4753-4754" refersTo="page_0864"/>welcome that provision which has been introduced by the Government. It is a step in the right direction, although it has been taken with great reluctance.</p>

<p>One other point which I wish to emphasize in relation to this Bill and which I think is an important matter is that this Bill gives full recognition to the existence and to the rights of local authorities in that no steps can be taken under this Bill without the consent of the local authority. If the hon. the Minister would listen for one moment, I want to say that by recognizing the necessity for the consent of the local authority, he will avoid having to take action and taking decisions and having dissension and disagreement from organizations such as the United Municipal Executive. I think the hon. the Minister of Community Development should realize how important it is to safeguard and to provide for this consent when he sees what happened in Port Elizabeth last evening, when a resolution introduced at the U.M.E. meeting by none other than Mrs. Otto du Plessis and seconded by Mr. Boet Erasmus condemned this Minister&#x2019;s action in respect of the Community Development Bill because he did not seek consent. Therefore we welcome it that the Minister in this instance is making himself subject to the consent of the local authority.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The fears of the hon. member for Green Point are completely unfounded. All I am doing here, is to protect the interests of the Housing Commission. We are giving this money to the local authority, and the Bantu Trust cannot take over those assets and liabilities without the permission of the Commission and of the Minister. I know the hon. member for Green Point has so much confidence in me that he will know that I shall not do anything wrong and that I shall not grant permission if there is anything amiss. So their fear that the Bantu Trust will take over in other Bantu residential areas is, of course, completely unfounded. But seeing that the hon. member supports the Bill so wholeheartedly, I do not want to say any more now and perhaps make him change his mind.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>We supported this Bill at the Second Reading, and accordingly we support all the various clauses as well. The first clause is an improvement on the old legislation. There is only one question which I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. It is a highly improbable state of affairs, but what would happen if, by coincidence, two vacancies should arise on this Board&#x003F; Is any provision being made for such an eventuality&#x003F; Does the hon. the Minister not think it would be desirable to insert a provision at some time or other&#x2014;not necessarily now&#x2014;in order to prescribe how many members of the Post Office Staff Board will constitute a quorum, if two vacancies should perhaps arise&#x003F; That is all I want to say under this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>It may, of course, happen that two vacancies arise, but that is highly unlikely. Then it will, in effect, mean that for that period of time the Staff Board will not be able to function, as was the case last year after the death of one member. Then we just carried on with the business and made the appointment of the other member with retrospective effect to the date on which the member had died. It can present a problem, but it is highly unlikely that it will happen.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this is not a very important clause. It purports to change the name of the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C. to &#x201C;Control Board&#x201D;. I do not think personally that it is an improvement really. We are not going to oppose this particular clause, but I should like to know whether there really is a good reason for changing the name of the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C. to &#x201C;Control Board&#x201D;&#x003F; In the minds of hon. members of this House and of the public outside the term &#x201C;Control Board&#x201D; is associated more with agricultural control boards such as the Maize Control Board, and so forth. I do not think that it really improves the status of the Board of Governors when they are given the same status, from the point of view of nomenclature, as, say, the Dried Bean Control Board or the Banana Control Board. I want to know why the board is now to be known as &#x201C;Control Board&#x201D;, and why they are to have a chief controller, I take it, instead of a chairman&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>I think this is an unnecessary question. This is only an improvement in language. If you have a board of governors, then you have to refer to a member of the board as a governor. I think that control board is a much better designation, because now one can speak of a control board member or a board member. I feel that &#x201C;control board&#x201D; is a much better designation than &#x201C;board of governors&#x201D;.</p>

I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice that there is a feeling amongst English-speaking South Africans who listen in to the A programme that they are not receiving what they would regard as a fair deal, when they contrast the service in South Africa with the service in other English-speaking countries.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of the proposed paragraph (a) inserted by paragraph (a):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that where such powers are exercised outside the Republic in respect of the matters referred to in this paragraph, the Minister shall lay upon the Table of the Senate and of the House of Assembly all details of the acquisition or erection contemplated in this paragraph and of the cost or estimated cost of such acquisition or erection, within 14 days after receipt thereof by him, if Parliament is in ordinary session, or if Parliament is not in ordinary session, within 14 days after the commencement of its next ensuing ordinary session.</block>

<p>Sir, in his second reading speech, the hon. the Minister explained the reason why he wanted to give the S.A.B.C. the power to erect broadcasting stations not only in South Africa itself, a power which it has always had, but why it should now have the power, with his approval, to erect broadcasting stations, relay stations, buildings and so forth outside the borders of South Africa. We admit that there are certain instances where such a station, particularly a relay station, on, say, a high mountain range just outside the borders of South Africa, might be useful for improving the relay service and the ordinary broadcasting service of the S.A.B.C. But I maintain that this amendment which the Minister is now asking the Committee to consider goes much further. It is giving the S.A.B.C. the right, with the approval of the Minister&#x2014;and that is some sort of safeguard &#x2014;to erect or to acquire broadcasting or television stations or sub-stations anywhere in the rest of the world. Sir, that is a dangerous power. That is a power that I would not like to give to a body which is now becoming even more independent of Parliament than it has ever been in the past.</p>

<p>We have had some strange events which have not yet been completely clarified in regard to a broadcasting station which was erected in Malawi, where the S.A.B.C. was involved, and I do think that this is an opportunity for the hon. the Minister to give us further particulars as to what happened in that case. It appeared from the reply to one of my questions that he had no direct say in that matter. I would like to ask him whether that station was erected without his permission&#x003F; Did he know about it; was his permission asked, and is this amendment changing the position to this extent that in future, should the S.A.B.C. do what it has been doing in Malawi, it will have to ask his permission&#x003F; Or will the S.A.B.C. still have the right, as it apparently had in Malawi, to erect at least the building, if not the station itself, without his permission&#x003F; You see, Sir, it is an unheard of thing for a corporation such as the S.A.B.C. actually to take over some of the functions of foreign aid normally exercised by the Minister of Foreign Affairs or by the Government itself. I cannot see any reason for allowing the S.A.B.C. to do a thing of this nature, which is going against the very spirit of parliamentary control. Sir, I do want to know more about these deals and what is contemplated. After all, if you give the S.A.B.C. the right to erect a broadcasting station wherever it wishes to do in the rest of the world, it can start its own pirate radio station off the coasts of some other friendly or unfriendly country. The possibilities are endless. That is why I do want this proviso in this particular clause so that Parliament can control what the S.A.B.C. is doing.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have very little experience of this matter and I do not have the necessary information available at the moment. However, I shall deal with this question of the hon. member for Wynberg later on. I now want to come back to the question put by the hon. member for Orange Grove. The South African Broadcasting Corporation has not erected a broadcasting station in Malawi and I do not know where the hon. member gets those particulars from. In the course of my Second-Reading speech I indicated why it was essential to erect foreign broadcasting stations. This is a technical improvement of our services, and I think that everybody is agreed that it is essential&#x2014;and this is the way I have always interpreted the Opposition&#x2019;s standpoint&#x2014;that we improve our foreign services, since to do so is in the interests of South Africa itself. If we want to do so, it stands to reason that we might have to erect stations in foreign countries so as to contribute to the technical improvement of those services. I do not think that there is any difference of opinion in this regard. I am not prepared to accept this amendment of the hon. member for Orange Grove. It would compel me statutorily to publish, in all cases, the particulars in regard to the acquisition or erection of broadcasting stations. Such stations will, from the nature of the case, have to be established in conjunction with other governments.</p>

<p>Political considerations may at the present moment or in the future make it undesirable in some cases for the countries concerned&#x2014;for the sake of their foreign relations&#x2014;to disclose particulars in regard to these matters at a particular juncture or even at any stage. For that reason I am not prepared to accept this amendment which would place me under a statutory obligation. Since the acquisition or erection of such broadcasting stations is subject to the approval of the Minister, the South African Broadcasting Corporation will not act unilaterally in regard to this matter. I shall be prepared to reply to all questions in this regard, i.e. where circumstances such as I have already mentioned do not make it undesirable to furnish certain particulars or to disclose them at a particular juncture. In all cases of this nature I want to give the assurance that the Government will act with a great deal of responsibility and circumspection, and I am really not prepared to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I think the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude here is unreasonable. The South African Broadcasting Corporation is asking for powers greater than the powers of our own Department of Foreign Affairs. The Department of Foreign Affairs has many &#x201C;secret&#x201D; activities, but they disclose each year the total amount of money that has to be made available for these services. The hon. the Minister, however, will not even meet the hon. member for Orange Grove with his amendment, by agreeing to disclose the total cost. Are we not to have any details of these transactions&#x003F; Surely the hon. the Minister is not prepared to give the S.A.B.C. this discretionary power which exceeds the power granted to any Government Department&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the amendment of the hon. member for Orange Grove actually seeks to impose restraints on the hon. the Minister by prescribing certain steps he has to take. The amendment proposes that he should give an account of all the transactions of the S.A.B.C. within 14 days after the opening of Parliament, or if Parliament is not in ordinary session, within 14 days after the commencement of its next ensuing session. In looking at the section in the old Act of 1952, one sees that it is being provided very clearly that information in regard to the S.A.B.C. must be tabled in this House before 30th April. Since 1952 this has been the correct procedure and nobody has objected to it. But when this Bill, which provides for the acquisition of broadcasting, stations and property outside our borders, is presented to this House, these hon. members want to force the hon. the Minister by means of this amendment to report to this House on such transactions within 14 days after they have been entered into. To my mind this is completely impracticable, and I want to state very clearly that the motive behind this amendment is not so much that the hon. Opposition and the House should get to know and be aquainted with all the particulars of similar transactions, but it is a deliberate attempt at questioning here the integrity and the honesty of the hon. the Minister as a member of the Cabinet.

<p>I withdraw them, but I want to say that a very strong attempt is being made here at conveying the impression to the House that this would be the position, and that in regard to these matters the hon. the Minister cannot be trusted in future. That is the whole idea of this amendment. I want to ask the hon. Opposition why this has not been essential over all these years, and why it has become so essential now&#x003F; In the light of the service having to be improved through the acquisition of stations in foreign countries, this amendment has now become essential all of a sudden! There is nothing sinister in this Bill. It merely seeks to facilitate and improve the services of the S.A.B.C. That is why I say that there is something sinister in this amendment. I am glad that the hon. the Minister has already announced that he is not prepared to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister is asking for additional powers in this clause. The amendment of the hon. member for Orange Grove seeks to limit these powers to ensure that the hon. the Minister informs Parliament of his actions. I submit that all the hon. member for Orange Grove is trying to illustrate to us is how he wants to have the powers of the Minister controlled. It is unthinkable that the hon. the Minister should virtually be given unlimited powers to establish broadcasting stations outside the country. I submit that the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2019;s amendment is a competent one to ensure that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s powers are controlled.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that matter to which the hon. member for Orange Grove is referring, has absolutely no bearing on this clause. The hon. member asked me a question; I replied to it and furnished the information he requested. In the course of the Second Reading Debate I also replied to this in detail, and if the hon. member does not know where to obtain the information, I am not going to tell him again. I am sorry that the hon. member for Kensington is not here at the moment, because he said that I was being unreasonable towards the Committee. I should rather think that hon. members opposite are unreasonable to expect me to accept this amendment. And I shall tell them why I think so, because there is a very valid reason for it. I told hon. members that one of the main reasons why I cannot accept this amendment, was that the erection of these radio stations obviously had to meet with the approval of the governments of those countries where such stations are erected. Hon. members are aware that amongst those countries there are some which, for political reasons connected with their foreign relations, are not keen to have it known that any co-operation is being given to South Africa. Such countries do exist. This amendment will now oblige me to disclose the names of those countries whose governments gave permission for radio stations to be erected there.</p>

<p>Malawi is not one of the countries which are under discussion. I am not even referring to Malawi. I think hon. members will concede that I am adopting a quite reasonable attitude. The hon. member for Kensington asked me something, and I deplore the fact that an hon. member says certain things during the Committee Stage and then leaves the House so that I cannot reply to him.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Then I withdraw my words. The hon. member for Kensington asked whether I would not disclose any information. I repeat what I said in saying that I could not accept the amendment. I say that I am prepared to reply to any questions in regard to that matter if I consider the disclosure of such information to be desirable. The control exercised by Parliament is not in the least being curtailed by this. I can still be called to account as the responsible Minister, because everything that is being done in regard to these foreign stations, is subject to the approval of the Minister. Consequently the control of Parliament is not being curtailed in the least. The hon. member is now asking for more extensive powers than Parliament has had in regard to the erection of radio stations up to now. As far as domestic radio stations are concerned, the principle Act granted the S.A.B.C. the right to erect domestic stations anywhere without the permission of the Minister. As far as foreign stations are concerned, it is being provided here that this has to be done with the permission and approval of the Minister. In other words, I can be called to account here. But that hon. members want to force me to disclose everything at my disposal, also when there are difficult cases such as those I mentioned in regard to governments of other countries which do not want their names to be disclosed, is something I cannot accept. I cannot accept that I should be placed under such a statutory obligation.</p>

<p>Let me repeat, I do not think this is an unreasonable attitude to adopt. Nor will I refuse to furnish any information, as the hon. member for Orange Grove now wants to suggest. I think that to-day it was probably the first time that I did not want to furnish the hon. member for Orange Grove with information. The hon. member knew why he put this question to me. He merely wanted to indicate that what I said, was not right. He knows that in the past, too, the Minister did not have the statutory powers to disclose this information. In terms of the principal Act this is treated as an internal administrative matter of the S.A.B.C. A previous Minister of the United Party, the late Minister Clarkson, granted the S.A.B.C. this power. It is very easy to ask me a whole lot of questions to which I cannot give any reply, because those powers were specifically granted to the S.A.B.C. by a statute of this Parliament. Does the hon. member expect me not to adhere to the provisions of the principal Act&#x003F;</p>

<p>This is not a question of additional powers being requested here for the S.A.B.C.; it is still being done subject to the permission of the Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington is back. He suggested that I was adopting an unreasonable attitude, but I do not think that I am adopting an unreasonable attitude. I think I am quite reasonable in saying that I cannot commit myself to this amendment. I cannot be expected to tell Parliament in all cases what the names are of the governments with which agreements have been concluded in regard to the future erection of radio stations. The hon. member for Kensington knows just as well as I do that there are certain governments which, for the sake of their relations with other countries, are not keen to disclose the nature of the negotiations they are conducting with us. I know the hon. member as a very reasonable person, and I think he will acknowledge that I am right on that point. I cannot report on what is being done in every single case.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington asked me whether no information would be furnished. I want to repeat that I shall reply to any question, since the approval of the Minister has to be obtained for the erection of these stations.

<p>I merely wanted your ruling as to whether I might discuss this clause, in view of the fact that the hon. member for Port Natal had moved a further amendment.</p>

<p>I must respond to what the hon. member for Orange Grove had to say here to-day. In the first place, he said that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance meant nothing to him. To my mind this is an extremely deplorable attitude for an hon. member to adopt when a Minister gives him certain assurances in this House. I cannot see how he can go so far as to say that those assurances do not mean anything to him. To the same extent we on this side are giving this back to him, and I say to him that the goodwill or lack of it on the part of the Opposition can hardly mean anything to us on this side. The hon. member said that he was very keen to have certain information, and he said that the hon. the Minister had to furnish that information in regard to the acquisition of radio stations, sites, etc., outside our borders. What advantages would the disclosure of those transactions possibly hold for us&#x003F; The hon. the Minister referred to this, and I want to emphasize what he said. To my mind this is deliberate &#x2026; I beg your pardon, Mr. Chairman, you will probably order me again to withdraw my words, and I shall withdraw the word &#x201C;deliberate&#x201D; forthwith, without waiting for your ruling.

<p>I am coming to that, Mr. Chairman. I say that this is actually aimed at upsetting the relations between South Africa and the other countries where these radio stations are being acquired. We know that all <span class="col_4767-4768" refersTo="page_0871"/>transactions, trade agreements, etc., are scrutinized by the outside world, and from certain quarters there are always unfavourable reactions to what we do. That is why I can only conclude that this request for information is actually aimed at placing South Africa in a difficult position. The hon. member wants the information to be tabled within 14 days and also to be published in the annual report, and no other advantage can be derived from doing so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in all fairness to the hon. member for Wynberg I should like to say the following. As regards her question in connection with copyright and the disposal thereof, I want to tell her that I cannot tell her. One probably sells them. There probably is no other way. I want to give her the assurance that as far as this matter is concerned, regard will, of course, have to be had to the requirements of the Copyright Act. No further powers than those laid down in the Copyright Act are being given to the S.A.B.C.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Port Natal. The amendment of the hon. member seeks to introduce a new principle, i.e. the publication of details of the investments of the S.A.B.C. Up to now this has not been done. He now wants to introduce a new principle into the Act.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should put that question to the people who introduced the principal Act of 1936. There probably are good reasons why that information should remain secret. I have to approve the stocks or securities of all investments made by the S.A.B.C. I shall be prepared to reply to questions in the ordinary course of events, if that is at all possible and desirable. The questions may be put to me. It is strange, of course, that the amendment of the hon. member for Port Natal applies only to the housing fund and the bursary fund. There are other funds as well. The existing provisions of the Act also make provision for the funds in the interest fund, the redemption fund, the reserve fund and the development fund, which are not required for immediate payment, to be invested in securities approved by the Minister. There is no requirement in the Act that details of the investment of money from those funds should be published. The hon. member does not mention this in his amendment either. He is requesting this merely in respect of the housing fund and the bursary fund.</p>

<p>I do not deem it necessary to accept this amendment, nor do I regard it as an improvement of the Act. Other State corporations, Escom, Iscor and the I.D.C., are under no legal obligation either to publish details of their investments, and in my opinion the S.A.B.C. should continue to have these powers.</p>

<p>Clause 10:</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>This clause is an important one in that it deals with a new clause providing for the issue of free licences. I have standing in my name on the Order Paper an amendment which I would like to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 58, to omit &#x201C;and&#x201D; where it occurs for the first time; and in the same line, after &#x201C;State&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and other&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The purpose of this amendment is to endeavour to get further clarity from the Minister as to incorporating other institutions where it is perhaps desirable that free licences should be issued. If we look at the long title of the Bill we see that it refers to the issue of free licences to certain categories of educational and other institutions and persons, but the provisions of the Bill then narrows it down by mentioning in line 57 &#x201C;educational, charitable and state institutions&#x201D;. The object of my amendment is more or less to bring the provision into line with the words of the long title, where it includes &#x201C;other institutions&#x201D;. This will be subject to the regulations because the clause provides that the Board may prescribe these matters by regulation after the Board has satisfied itself that these institutions meet the requirements of such regulations. The Minister knows that in terms of the regulations which were published in 1962, the granting of concessionary licences is limited to certain groups, just as this clause wishes to limit it to educational, charitable and State institutions. In terms of the regulations there has been a good deal of confusion in specifying which are the deserving cases and, in terms of this clause, which will be the institutions which will be able to enjoy this privilege of free listeners&#x2019; licences. In terms of the regulations of 1962, this concession was confined to organizations receiving subsidies from the Central Government, the Provincial Administration or the Municipality, or one of the churches represented on the Corporation&#x2019;s Advisory Council on religious broadcasts. Difficulty has arisen where you have organizations which can be classified as charitable although they do not receive any subsidy from the Government. I would therefore ask the Minister to elaborate upon the use of the term &#x201C;charitable institutions&#x201D;, in order to get some clarity. The position is that there are organizations, some of them registered welfare organizations, which do not receive any subsidy. There are also other organizations which are not registered welfare organizations which provide a charitable service in that they provide accommodation for indigent persons, people who rely on the radio to a great extent as their main means of keeping in contact with the outside world and for entertainment. The object of the amendment is to provide for other institutions which might be able to satisfy the regulations in regard to the issue of <span class="col_4771-4772" refersTo="page_0873"/>free licences. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment because as I said before, looking at the long title, it does not restrict the institutions merely to educational, charitable and State institutions, but also refers to other institutions and persons.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that charitable institutions need not necessarily be subsidized by the State only. There can also be other institutions which are not subsidized by the State. Now my difficulty in respect of the amendment of the hon. member for Umbilo is that the provision in the Bill includes all educational, charitable and State institutions. What other institutions can there be&#x003F; I do not think the hon. member has business institutions, which are based on a profit motive, in mind. I do not know what institutions the hon. member can have in mind in any event, because I tell him that charitable institutions include institutions which are not subsidized by the State. In any event, I do not know whether the acceptance of the amendment will help the hon. member in any way, because all institutions will nevertheless have to be approved by the Minister. As I see it, the amendment actually has no meaning.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps I should elaborate a little more in regard to the institutions I have in mind. I refer to institutions which have not been accepted as institutions entitled to the concessionary licences in terms of the existing regulations. Now the privilege of free licences is to be extended also by regulation in terms of this clause. The Minister would like an indication of the type of institution I have in mind. I would like to illustrate by mentioning such an organization as the Moths, which administers homes for the aged but does not register itself as a welfare organization and therefore possibly would not be classified as a charitable institution. They are not a registered welfare organization. They administer homes for the aged on a non-profit basis and they themselves try to raise funds to keep that institution running. The point is that there could be a situation arising whereby a person can qualify for a free listener&#x2019;s licence due to the fact that he is in an organization termed a charitable institution in terms of this clause, but there might be an organization such as the one I have mentioned which could perhaps not be classified as a charitable institution because it is not a registered welfare organization although it does charitable work. Perhaps the Minister could give an indication that an organization like the Moths would be accepted as a charitable institution in terms of this clause.</p>

<p>What the hon. member for Umbilo has just discussed actually is the regulations which are subject to my approval and not the clause. I repeat that nothing the hon. member has just said has convinced me to accept his amendment, because the institution to which he has referred can also be regarded as a charitable institution. I have stated explicitly that other institutions which are not subsidized by the State will also be regarded as charitable institutions and, if there is any justification for this on the grounds of merit, the Minister may give his approval for such institutions to be granted this concession. I want to tell the hon. member in all love that his amendment will have no effect.</p>

<p>I support the hon. member for Umbilo. I can appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s difficulties, but we do have institutions in the Western Cape which are not subsidized by the State, but the inmates are pensioners. While the S.A.B.C. has assisted them to the extent of relieving them from paying licence fees to a certain extent, it has not been able to give overall assistance to the institutions. I discussed the matter with the former Minister and the interpretation is very broad, but the Board has always taken the line that they are not empowered to give these institutions the relief they request, although they are sympathetic. I do not think this goes far enough and I think the amendment clarifies the position. I think we should encourage these institutions which do not call upon the State for subsidies.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I support the amendment of the hon. member for Umbilo. I believe that what he suggests would give greater powers under the regulations to make these licences at a lesser fee available to more people. But there is one important thing I wish to point out in regard to the clause itself. The impression seems to have been created outside that this is an entirely new, fine and splendid concession, granting concessionary radio licences to people, and even granting free licences, but for the record I think it should be stated what the present position is. The present position is laid down in the principal Act which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Different fees for radio licences might be prescribed for different classes of listeners and educational and charitable institutions or hospitals, and they may under the said paragraph be exempted from the payment of fees in respect of such licences.</block>

<p>Sir, that proves that the institution of free licences has been in this country since the passing of the original Broadcasting Act in 1936. Although basically there are improvements in this amendment, it does not alter the fact that the possibility has been there for <span class="col_4773-4774" refersTo="page_0874"/>more than 30 years now to grant free licences. One of the small but nevertheless significant changes is the fact that where individuals had to pay 25 cents in the past, they will now get their licences free. I concede that that is a good idea.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to raise one matter in regard to the actual wording of this section. There is a reference here to hospitals but the reference is to categories of hospitals as determined by the board. The wording is, &#x201C;such categories of hospitals and persons as the board may approve&#x201D;. Sir, I take it that with the new approach of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs there is no intention that this should apply to any of the provincial hospitals, for instance, which fall under the control of the provincial administrations. The provision as it stands appears to me to give the power to the board to exempt certain classes of, say, provincial hospitals and not others. The board has a discretionary power.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>All public hospitals, including provincial hospitals, will be given free listeners&#x2019; licences. I may just say that the hon. members have not convinced me. I am not prepared to include the words &#x201C;other business institutions&#x201D;, as that can only create misunderstanding. It may perhaps be interpreted to mean that business institutions which operate with a profit motive should also be included. Here provision is being made for free listeners&#x2019; licences to educational, charitable and State institutions, and to my mind this provision is broad enough. It is as broad as we want it to be at the moment. If the word &#x201C;other&#x201D; were to be inserted here, it could only cause confusion. I assure hon. members that the institutions which have been mentioned here will be regarded as charitable institutions. In terms of the Act as it stands, the Board of Governors will in any event be able to consider the merits. I do not think that the insertion of the word &#x201C;other&#x201D; will make any difference.</p>

<p>Clause 14:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to express, as we did at the Second Reading, our dissatisfaction with this clause on account of the fact that it gives the S.A.B.C. very great powers in regard to the expropriation of land for its own purposes. I believe it is not a right that should be granted to an organization such as this which has no shareholders and no annual general meeting where it can account to its shareholders or to the people who provided it with its funds, for what it has been doing. We might have something in the S.A.B.C. annual report in the future about these expropriations and we can then ask the Minister, who has to grant his approval, what these expropriations were. I trust that when we do put questions in regard to this matter in Parliament in future, the hon. the Minister will give us full information, as he undertook to do under the previous clause. Sir, this power of expropriation is a vast one; it is an important one. It is a power which should be exercised by the Government itself. I want to ask the Minister why it is not possible for the expropriation to be done by the Post Office, instead of by the S.A.B.C., as this clause provides. In effect the position would be the same really, except that the Post Office is much more under the control and scrutiny of Parliament and also under the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. If the Post Office were to do it&#x2014;just to show the hon. the Minister that I am not doubting his <i>bona fides;</i> he will have to approve of it&#x2014;then we on this side of the House will be satisfied. We would not object if this expropriation were done by the Department of Lands or by the Department of Public Works, or whichever other Government Department does expropriations at the moment. We do not like the fact that this clause provides that any reference in the Expropriation Act to the Minister and the State shall be construed as a reference to the Corporation. In other words, under the original Expropriation Act there was a reference to the Minister and there was a reference to a State Department, and now instead of the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; we have the word &#x201C;Corporation&#x201D; and instead of the word &#x201C;State&#x201D; we have the word &#x201C;Corporation&#x201D;. I feel that it is a wrong principle to give these extended powers to the S.A.B.C.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>It is not a new principle that is being introduced into our legislation here. Escom has the same powers. I cannot see why the S.A.B.C. should not be granted these powers of expropriation. It is in the interests of the country that our broadcasting services should be supported, and the S.A.B.C. should have powers of expropriation in cases where people charge unreasonable prices. The hon. member said the S.A.B.C. could not be called to account, but it can be called to account through me, because I have to approve all expropriations carried out by the S.A.B.C. As the Minister concerned, I can be called to account here. When I approve an expropriation, it is carried out in the same way as is prescribed in the relevant provisions of sections 4 to 13 of the Expropriation Act, 1965. in terms of which land is expropriated by the State. The following are the more important matters dealt with in the relevant provision: (a) The serving of a notification upon the owner to the effect that the land is going to be expropriated; (b) the passing of ownership in such land upon the body which expropriates; (c) the duties of the owner of and the holder of a mortgage bond over the land expropriated; (d) the procedure recording to which compensation for the land shall be determined by a court in cases where agreement cannot be reached in regard to it; and (e) the basis on which compensation is to <span class="col_4775-4776" refersTo="page_0875"/>be determined. I want to tell the hon. member that the Post Office has no powers of expropriation. Accordingly the Post Office cannot undertake expropriations on behalf of the S.A.B.C. If the Post Office had these powers of expropriation, we would have had to charge the S.A.B.C. for expropriations, because the Post Office is a business undertaking now which has to be paid for the services it renders.</p>

<p>In the White Paper on South-West Africa a recommendation was made to the effect that the powers which the Archives Act, 1962 (Act No. 6 of 1962), conferred upon the Administrator should be transferred to the Minister concerned in the Republic. In this Bill effect is given to this recommendation. Provision is also made in this Bill for certain other amendments which are necessary to facilitate the administration of the principal Act, <i>viz</i>.&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) authorizing the Minister to establish archives depots and intermediate depots <span class="col_4777-4778" refersTo="page_0876"/>at places in addition to the seats of the Provincial Administrations, because problems arise in obtaining suitable accommodation at the Provincial seats and also for security purposes.</li>

<p>We find a good example of this in Cape Town, where it is simply impossible to accommodate everything, with the result that an intermediate depot will have to be established at Stellenbosch for a part. Further amendments are&#x2014;</p>

<li>(b) the dates on which the five-year periods in respect of granting the public access to archives shall commence are determined so as to be the same for both the Republic and the Territory of South-West Africa, except that archives in the Territory have to be safeguarded in an archives depot for five years longer than is the case at present, before becoming accessible to the public;</li>

<li>(c) a departmental head or person in charge of archives of a local authority may grant permission to any person to consult such archives as he may still have in his possession, that is to say, files and papers which are still in use, subject to certain general regulations as the Minister may issue. The Act allows such permission to be granted in a very limited number of cases, which impedes necessary research work for the Public Service.</li>

<heading>HERALDRY AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill covers the entire heraldic issue, which is a very technical matter. In 1962, when the Heraldry Act was placed on the Statute Book, history was made, because it was the first time that a Bill dealing purely with heraldry was passed by Parliament. It was pioneering work and the time has now arrived to review that Act in the light of the experience gained and with a view to greater efficiency and taking more modern tendencies into account.</p>

<p>I hope hon. members will not argue that I am acting over-hastily by introducing amending legislation at this stage already, because I may mention that the Heraldry Council already recommended certain amendments after its first meeting in October, 1963. In our opinion the Council was a little hasty, and it was then decided to give the Act a reasonable chance so that we could determine all its bottlenecks. The work study officers of my Department conducted an investigation into the operation of the Act, and acting on their recommendations, we then proceeded to draw up amending legislation. The Heraldry Council was also consulted in regard to the matter, and the result of all this work is the Bill now before the House. The amendments proposed are mainly the following. Firstly, the Heraldry Council is being elevated to the highest heraldic authority in the Republic. Secondly, the State Herald is being enabled to deal with many more applications for the registration of coats of arms himself; to assist him in cases where legitimate doubt exists as to the heraldic correctness of an application, a heraldry committee is being established. Thirdly, the Protection of Names, Uniforms and Badges Act, 1935 (Act No. 23 of 1935) is being repealed and the provisions of that Act in respect of the registration of names, special names and uniforms are being incorporated in the Heraldry Act. The object we are seeking to achieve by these means is to deal with applications quickly and efficiently, and it is also hoped to reduce the cost connected with the registration of an application.</p>

<p>I just want to outline briefly the difficulties experienced in applying the Act. The functions which the Act entrusted to the Heraldry Council and the State Herald are in fact identical, but with the exception of a number of coats of arms introduced by law and dating from the period before the coming into operation of the Act, the State Herald could not deal with any application, even if it were heraldically absolutely correct. He had to refer all applications to a committee on coats of arms which the Council had established to advise it. The committee on coats of arms, of which the State Herald was a member, checked the application and recommended its acceptance or rejection, as the case may be, to the council, which always accepted the recommendations of the committee. Experience showed us that. You will immediately notice how much delay takes place, especially where an application is heraldically correct and could in the first instance have been approved by the State Herald for registration purposes. Apart from this, the finalization of applications was further delayed by all the rules <span class="col_4779-4780" refersTo="page_0877"/>laid down by regulation. To change a rule which has been laid down by regulation is a cumbersome procedure. Let me just give you an example of how much time was lost as a result of the regulations. The average period from the day on which an application for the registration of a coat of arms was received until such application was disposed of by the council was one year and five months. However much the Council and the State Herald would have liked to shorten the procedures, they could do nothing about it, because the procedures were prescribed by regulation in terms of the Act. Neither would amending the regulation have solved the problem completely, because it was not possible to foresee all the circumstances and, moreover, the duplication of the functions of the Council and of the State Herald would have continued to exist. It is also the considered opinion of the Public Service Commission that procedures should not be prescribed by regulation and we have now had practical experience of the truth of that point of view. We were overcautious with our first pioneering steps in the field of heraldry, but now we have discovered the bottlenecks so that they can be eliminated.</p>

<p>Another anomaly cropped up in the Act which simply has to be eliminated. Section 9 of the Act made provision for appeal to the Council against a decision of the State Herald. As has been indicated, the State Herald could not make any decision without consulting the Council, and it was only after such consultation that he could make his decision known. If an applicant appealed to the Council against the decision, it meant that the Council would in fact have had to hear an appeal against its own decision. This also had to be eliminated. As far as the Council itself is concerned, it is necessary to explain that the Bill is now investing it with final authority in the field of heraldry. The Council&#x2019;s decision will be final now, and it will no longer be possible to appeal to the Minister against decisions by this body, because Judge and Appeal Judge are now in fact becoming the same person. This was a completely overcautious move which has now, after six years, been proved to be unnecessary in practice. The Council is made up of experts in this specialized field and it is only right that its decision should be final.</p>

<p>To place the position of the Council beyond any doubt, it is now being provided that it will determine the policy which will apply in regard to the approval of an application. In the past the Council was restricted in dealing with an application to take into account only the principles and the rules of heraldry, but while the Council will now become the highest authority, it was deemed fit to invest it with increased powers. What is more, the Council will now become the final authority in respect of a related matter, namely the registration of names and uniforms. Since the coming into operation of the Heraldry Act, 1962 (Act No. 18 of 1962) only uniforms and names were registered in terms of the Protection of Names, Uniforms and Badges Act, 1935 (Act No. 23 of 1935). All coats of arms were of course dealt with in terms of the Heraldry Act itself. Consequently it was decided that the provisions of the Act of 1935 relating to names and uniforms could just as well be incorporated in the Heraldry Act itself, especially since the Heraldry Council will now be the final authority in connection with the registration of names and uniforms.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult to make a useful contribution to this debate and to offer any constructive suggestions. I still remember when the original Bill was introduced an hon. member who had to say something about the Bill contented himself with quoting from Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy written in a Country Churchyard&#x201D;. Every school boy knows this verse&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not wish to introduce a lugubrious tone into this discussion, but the hon. the Minister has told us that in the light of experience it is necessary to introduce this amendment. On many occasions I have suggested here that he should refer a Bill to a select committee, but on this occasion I want to say please do not refer it to a select committee. As the hon. the Minister has told us, one needs special technical knowledge to deal with this question. We speak here of a function of the Heraldry Council and the Bureau of Heraldry. The name I am accustomed to is the College of Heralds. They are men who make a special study of the subject. I am afraid I cannot offer any constructive suggestion. We support this Bill and we leave it to the hon. the Minister to appoint his experts. I know he will appoint them very carefully, because he has knowledge of these matters. There might be one or two members in this House who are interested in heraldry, but I doubt whether there are many. The hon. the Minister has told us that he has come with this measure, because these people encountered some difficulties. Difficulties are inevitable. Once when I was president of an institution I became involved in designing a coat of arms. Having been involved in that once I have decided never again to be involved in such an undertaking. We support the Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during the adjournment of the discussion about this legislation last week, I had only touched upon a few points. On that occasion I said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following. Since 1937 no change has been made to the Marketing Act in respect of its principles. When the Marketing Act was passed in 1937 the farmer obtained greater control over the marketing of his product. In the legislation he saw a way of obtaining price stability for himself. What every control board does in this connection we do not want to discuss now. We cannot discuss it, and it is in any case well-known to each hon. member who is concerned with agriculture. As the hon. the Minister has explained to us, the measure now before the House briefly contemplates the following. Firstly, it contemplates the repeal of old legislation prior to the passing of the Marketing Act in 1937 and, secondly, it is repealing certain sections of legislation subsequent to that. The retention of those provisions is becoming altogether redundant, as the hon. the Minister explained. I do not want to deal with all the clauses which the hon. the Deputy Minister explained to us; I rather want to focus my attention on clause 15 of this legislation. I regard it as a new principle which will now be included in the Marketing Act. The Minister now obtains the right to impose a levy on an unregulated product. This makes considerable additions to section 84 of the principal Act. In the case of those products for which no scheme previously existed, the Minister may now impose a levy. While I am now dealing with this, I want to express the gratitude of this side, and especially of the agricultural group, to the Department for this memorandum about these important changes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, we can also thank the Minister for that. I specifically wanted to thank him for something else. He <span class="col_4783-4784" refersTo="page_0879"/>usually makes his speeches available to us when he delivers them, or shortly afterwards. When he made his Second Reading speech on this measure, he spoke extremely quickly and it was difficult to follow every word. We want to thank him in any case for making his speeches available to us in this way. In the memorandum it is stated very clearly that the imposition of a levy is not contemplated on every unregulated product. It nevertheless surprised me that the Minister did not, in his Second Reading speech, indicate what products he contemplated placing certain levies on. There are certain obvious products, for example perishable products, and I trust that the levies will merely have a bearing on that class of product. If the Minister also has other products in mind we should like to know about them when he replies to this debate.</p>

<p>Clause 15 brings about a very great change; it could even be termed far-reaching. However, the necessity for the imposition of a levy on unregulated products does exist, and we on this side would not want to deny this. But in terms of this clause the Minister can impose levies in accordance with section 43 of the principal Act. This levy can be imposed in this way for years without a scheme being created or without the producer of unregulated products being consulted in any way in respect of how much the levy will be. Nowhere in clause 15 is the producer consulted in this respect. We find this deficiency altogether strange. We are not against the principle of the imposition of the levy. What we find strange is that the producer concerned is not consulted when the levy is imposed. I hope that this state of affairs is not deliberate. If it is being done deliberately then the Minister has not explained his actions. We regard it as an absolute disregard of the rights and wishes of the producers of unregulated products, however few they may be.</p>

<p>The Marketing Act was consolidated last year, and if one studies it thoroughly, one can deduce that certain basic principles must constantly be kept in mind. When a scheme is drawn up, the farmers who propose it and who participate in it through the medium of their control board, have a measure of control over what the levy will be. Normally it is also submitted to the Minister for his approval. There are the amendments to the Wool Acts and so on. A levy cannot be imposed except by way of legislation or as a result of the approval of the Minister. The farmers must also know what levy is being imposed upon them. However small the number of these producers of unregulated products may be, we regard their rights as important and we are not prepared to entrust the Minister with the sole right of saying what the levy will be if he has not consulted them. I think that the attitude of this side about this matter is altogether reasonable and realistic. I now want to give the Minister timely notice that at the Committee Stage we are going to move such an amendment, not to amend the principle of clause 15, but to ensure that he will consult the people concerned and will give them a chance to make their points of view known to him. Only subsequent to that will he be able to impose the levy upon them by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<p>I want to say again that this deficiency is a conspicuous one in this measure. One must remember that there must be producers even of the unregulated products. One cannot have a product without a producer. The Minister cannot say that it is difficult to get in touch with these people. It may be that they are not yet organized in an association, for example an Association of Producers of Perishable Products. He can nevertheless tell the people by means of the <i>Gazette,</i> for example, that he intends to impose a levy on their products and invite them to put forward suggestions to him.</p>

<p>As I have said, we are completely satisfied with the principle embodied in this. The reason for that is, of course, obvious. It is because it will be of great value to the farmers themselves. Such a levy will make it possible to make propaganda for, to publicize and to promote their products. When surpluses have to be disposed of, such a levy is necessary to defray any expenses involved.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said very clearly that his Department does not have the staff to establish such a scheme for unregulated products. They are going to try to obtain the cooperation of our local authorities in respect of vegetable markets, etc. I think that the Minister must explain to us how he thinks it is to be done on an altogether voluntary basis and without expense being involved. I believe that there will be considerable expense involved and therefore we regard this levy as essential. But we say this with the reservation that these people be properly consulted before steps are taken by the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side, of course, support the principle of this legislation wholeheartedly, and we are glad that the other side of the House also supports it. As the hon. member for Newton Park said, clause 15 of this Bill provides for the collection of a levy on an unregulated product, i.e. a product for which there is no control board and the producers of which therefore have no representation anywhere in order to make recommendations in regard to the extent of the levy, how it must be applied and how the marketing of that product should be dealt with in general. I regard it as essential that levies should also be collected here. The producers of unregulated products sometimes come up against problems, for example surpluses, for which a market must be arranged. Hence the advisability of also collecting levies here. One asks oneself whether it is worth while establishing control boards for these products as well. Usually the extent of production of these products, although of importance to their producers, is not so great that the additional expense of the establishment of a control board is justified.</p>

<p><span class="col_4785-4786" refersTo="page_0880"/>Since this Bill is now making provision for the collection of a levy on these products, I want to express the hope that this will take place after consultation and that the Department is going to collect this levy in the proper way. But the Minister is a responsible person and therefore the Opposition need not fear the imposition of an improper levy on these products. I assume that he and his Department are going to determine this levy on a proper basis so that the product itself will not be detrimentally affected by it, but so that the levy will be applied for the benefit of those products. The Minister will probably reply to questions which have been put to him in this connection. However, I do not think that an improper levy is going to be imposed here, neither do I think that the administration will not take place to the benefit of the product itself. I think that we may accept that these things will be done with a sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>We have this legislation before us this afternoon as a result of, <i>inter alia,</i> a request from the Meat Board. With the modern development of your meat industry, the modern marketing of meat and the altered circumstances as well as buying habits of the public, this industry has slowly begun to develop in a certain direction. We have a system of auctioning on the hook in controlled areas. Here the Meat Board guarantees the producer a price based on grade and weight. In order to carry out all the activities involved in this the Board needs funds. On the one hand there is the Stabilization Fund and on the other the administrative funds which enable the Board to function. In the controlled areas there is therefore a levy on livestock which are sent there on the hoof. The levy is in respect of the carcase. The handling agents are responsible for the payment of this levy to the Board. He normally deducts it from the account of the supplier and pays it to the Meat Board. This is the procedure in the controlled areas. But we are changing the basis on which the levy is determined. Meat is no longer only brought from Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the hoof, but also as carcases and meat cuts. These are also offered for auction. A way must now be found of also imposing a levy on these carcases and meat cuts because there are also expenses involved in their handling. Therefore the Meat Board must also be in a position to undertake the handling of this meat. As I have said, there are expenses involved in its handling and it would be unfair to burden the person with those costs, who sends the meat to the market on the hoof. Hence the powers now being given to the Meat Board to collect a levy on this as well. On account of its control over the product, the Meat Board also receives a levy from the uncontrolled areas for the stabilization of the industry. In the uncontrolled areas this levy has had to be claimed by owners of abattoirs. They are responsible for collecting it and paying it to the Board. But we now find that meat cuts and carcases are also coming to the controlled areas from the uncontrolled areas. In this Bill provision is now being made for the collection of a levy on these carcases and meat cuts as well. By those means there will also be a contribution from these quarters to the stabilization of the industry. Secondly, we have another problem, and this is that export meat must not be marked. This is because of trade agreements and also because of the unattractiveness of the carcase when it is marked. In this Bill provision is being made for a levy to be claimed on such carcases.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I merely want to say that we welcome this Bill. Our less important agricultural industries really need such an Act. I am, for example, thinking of one small industry, i.e. the seed industry. The seed industry, i.e. vegetable seeds and other kinds of seeds, is slowly finding itself in a difficult position as a result of over-production and other problems. Therefore I say that stable prices and orderly marketing are essential for that industry. This Bill also contemplates giving the industry the benefits of control. The idea that there is now to be a simpler and most probably a cheaper scheme than the Control Board scheme is therefore welcomed.</p>

<p>However, I want to bring two matters to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. The first is that it will not be quite so easy for the Minister and his Department to control such a scheme, because they do not have the necessary machinery to do so. I want to suggest that, where possible, if these small industries apply for such control, investigations should be made as to whether it would not be possible to appoint one of the other existing control boards as an agent, acting on behalf of the Minister. I think that this would be possible in many cases. It would also be very much more practical to use other control boards to act as agents. There is also the possibility of using other organizations for this purpose. I am thinking, for example, of central agricultural corporations which can be used. I think that it may be very much more practical, and perhaps also cheaper, to do it in this way.</p>

<p>The other matter I want to mention is the question of who has to apply for control. I see here in the explanatory memorandum that the Minister states that voluntary application will be made for such a scheme. We can get the position, however, that the vast majority of the members of an industry, such as the seed industry, want such a scheme. Ninety per cent of the producers could perhaps be interested in such an organization. If everyone is to ask voluntarily, one or two producers can put a spoke in the wheel and thereby make it impossible for the industry concerned to obtain this desirable control. Therefore, I just wonder whether it would not be possible to provide in the Bill that when, for example, 80 per cent of the members of an industry apply for control, it should be made compulsory. Just as we at that time had compulsory co-operatives which subsequently became the control boards, so I feel that provision should probably be made <span class="col_4787-4788" refersTo="page_0881"/>here for the vast majority of the members of an industry to obtain it if they ask for it.</p>

<p>I also just want to reply to the hon. member for Newton Park&#x2019;s argument in connection with the levy. The proposed section 84C of the principal Act states very clearly wbat the objects of such a levy are going to be. I assume that if such a levy is imposed, close attention will be paid to what that levy is, in fact, going to be used for. I think that we may rest assured that the Minister will also use his discretion here and not impose an unnecessary or a too high levy which will make it difficult or impossible for the producer to take part in this scheme. I also assume that all the objects in the proposed section 84C will not necessarily be applicable to all industries. Different actions as proposed in the Bill will be applicable to the various industries. I am certain that the Minister will only do what is necessary for the industry concerned.</p>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I firstly want to express my appreciation for the fact that we are, in fact, able to discuss this legislation in the House to-day. In my opinion it is very important that we discuss the problems of agriculture from time to time. The marketing problem is one of the most important problems that agriculture is faced with. The marketing problem consists basically of surpluses and shortages. Another problem is to get the farmers, who produce the various products, to work together, thereby achieving an orderliness in the marketing of that product. Through the years we have included various commodities in this system of orderly marketing, but in the course of time certain shortcomings in existing legislation have also been brought to the fore. Therefore I welcome this opportunity to discuss it. Perhaps we shall have another opportunity at a much later stage because difficulties have developed in the marketing of many of the products and inevitably the producers have also experienced problems. We now have the opportunity of reviewing this whole position. In my opinion this Bill is a very practical proposal. It ought do away with many of these bottlenecks and points of friction. I now want to refer to the marketing of bananas as an example. For years there was a struggle among banana growers when over-production reared its head, when their prices began to decrease and when the deficiencies of an uncontrolled marketing system came to the fore. They differed for years among themselves about the desirability of controlled marketing in their industry. Meetings were held and if there was anyone eloquent enough to convince the people, they declared themselves prepared to support controlled marketing. A further difficulty develops when one or two producers feel that they can take advantage of the chaos. They then address other meetings and destroy everything that was achieved. Then there are the producers of fresh products, who are faced with over-production in one season and a tremendous shortage in the following season, owing to weather conditions. Then there is also the tendency among certain farmers to plant one product or another if they see that the price of a certain product was high during the previous season, or if they discover that climatic conditions are poor. Certain farmers spend great amounts of money to supply a specific product. From the nature of the case this is wrong because certain products require intensive cultivation, and when they come to the marketing of those products they find that the market is overloaded. At times we are faced with the same phenomenon when there are shortages. People gather together all the rubbish which is at all acceptable to the market and prejudice the producers who supply a good quality product. They prejudice these producers because they market products which are not actually acceptable but which are nevertheless marketed owing to the demand. In this way they bring the prices down and prejudice the people who are, in fact, placing a quality product on the market. If we take all these problems into consideration, we must particularly welcome clause 5. Clause 5 now opens the door to a measure of organization on the part of the State in that levies can be claimed. If all these farmers, after long discussions, after persuasion from the one side or the other, decide that there should be orderly marketing, there is still no basic organization and no funds which will help them to make a start. Then one finds the tendency among them to have to appoint staff and they must perform a wide variety of duties, and basically the people have nothing to begin with and concessions must be made here and there on the part of the authorities to try to get these people going in an orderly fashion. As you know, all the boards established under the Marketing Act must employ staff to study the entire problem, to keep in touch with producers and to find out about their problems. Funds are necessary for that staff which is needed and which often consists of experts. I do not think the hon. member for Newton Park need worry unnecessarily. It is necessary for such questions to be asked about how these people are going to be consulted in such a departmental undertaking. As I see it, the approach is simply that channels must be created whereby money can be collected so that that money can again be applied in the interests of the farmers concerned.</p>

<p>We can go further. I want to draw your attention to the amendments, actually the repeals. which are subsequently proposed here. It is very clear what happened in those years of great marketing problems. The first Act which was drawn up was the one in 1930 to control the dairy industry. A Marketing Act did not yet exist then under which these schemes could be established. Others subsequently followed, the Mealie Control Act, the Tobacco Control Act and the Livestock and Meat Industries Act. These Acts appeared on the Statute Book after 1930 because orderly marketing in the country had become an ever <span class="col_4789-4790" refersTo="page_0882"/>increasing necessity. After the Marketing Act was passed we had the position that year after year we had to ask for certain of these control schemes which were placed on the Statute Book by the previous Acts, to be suspended, and I am glad that the stage has been reached where it is no longer necessary for us to come back and to request that these Acts, or portions of these Acts, be suspended. Look at an industry such as the tobacco industry, or even the citrus industry. We find that in order to deal with these problems of orderly marketing the farmers had to begin on a small scale by establishing co-operatives. They subsequently began to organize on a nation-wide scale and it took many years before the farmers could organize their co-operatives in such a way that there was co-operation.</p>

<p>But it always had the deficiency that a percentage of the farmers stood to one side, obstructed these co-operative arrangements, and tried to take advantage of the situation. There was also an obsession with some of the farmers that anything eminating from the authorities was actually being forced upon them; they are now being compelled by the Government to accept things which they did not ask for. The fact that the farmers organized themselves voluntarily in respect of certain of these commodities, had profitable results, but eventually they also had to say that this small percentage of farmers who were not participating were hampering orderly marketing. There were continual problems.</p>

<p>We had the case in the citrus industry of about 85 per cent of the farmers belonging to co-operatives, and through the co-operatives the Citrus Exchange was established which functions on a nation-wide basis, and this built up the entire marketing organization throughout the country. But now we have these 10 to 15 per cent of the people who dissociate themselves and who did not assist in the building up of the market for that product and who are trying to impede organized marketing, at the same time wanting to reap the benefits brought about for them by this co-operative body, without accepting the disadvantages and the expense involved. I therefore find it very important for the door to be opened here for the State to establish means whereby our farmers can be compelled, to a certain extent, to contribute to a fund, because this is what it is all about. The same thing that happened in the citrus industry happened in the tobacco industry, and therefore we had the Tobacco Control Act which is now being repealed and which at least ensured orderly marketing after the farmers had organized themselves on a co-operative basis.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is important that co-operation should exist between the farmers, especially where the marketing of perishable products is concerned. I am here thinking especially of the vegetable producers throughout the country. In the lowveld of the Eastern Transvaal a great deal of vegetables is produced during the winter months. In fact, the country is largely dependent on those vegetables at this time of the year. We have the problem that the farmers are cutting one another&#x2019;s throats and that there is a lack of co-operation. I am referring, for example, to the production of tomatoes, beans and peas in these areas. There is no co-ordination between farmers. If, by way of a levy, one could make a start in organizing certain of these groups of farmers, who share something of a common interest, to build up a fund, the Department can, on that basis, create an organization for the people which is based on sounder foundations.</p>

<p>The logical result of that is that a board could then be established for these commodities. I was not in a position to examine everything, but as far as I could determine, the intention is actually that as soon as the establishment of such a fund from levies on certain commodities is contemplated, consultation should take place. I know of no instance as far as marketing is concerned, where the State has done anything from above without consulting the people. I know that in the banana industry people said: &#x201C;A Banana Control Board has been established and they are now compelling farmers left and right to do certain things.&#x201D; Complaints have also recently been made to me that the Banana Control Board was collecting a levy from the farmers and that the farmers did not know what had become of the money. The man who is producing today makes a contribution to the fund by way of a levy and he has no share in or control of the spending of that levy. The same sort of arguments can also be used here, but as far as these matters are concerned, we must not meet our troubles half-way.</p>

<p>It is necessary for us to review the overall position of our farmers and their problems and to realize that these laws are made after very careful study and consideration of the farmers&#x2019; problems. These laws are not made in order to satisfy a Department or a Minister, and neither are these amendments being introduced here to-day for that reason. These laws are made to deal with various problems which arise from time to time, especially in these disorganized communities which often consist of small groups. One of the basic problems of our agriculture is that we have 90,000 farmers each of whom, independent of the rest, must wrest a living from the soil, or off the land, in the case of livestock. There is now mutual competition to a large extent. It is actually surprising, under these marketing conditions, that many of our farmers are still in such a good position. Therefore it is particularly important that each of us who has the interests of farming at heart, should study this Bill and its implications.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Marketing Amendment Bill is one of those pieces of legislation which will contribute towards making the Marketing Act more streamlined. The orderly marketing and the proper distribution of products are of the most important functions of our Marketing Act. It is important, not only to the producers, but also to the consumers, that there should be proper distribution and control of food products. At times it does happen that there are surpluses in certain parts and shortages in other parts of the country. In order to grant the necessary powers, it is essential for us to pass this legislation. As regards the objection of the Opposition in respect of clause 15, which empowers the Minister to impose a levy on uncontrolled products, I want to say that it is absolutely essential to make provision for the orderly marketing of products and proper control over the marketing of products. Sometimes the quantities produced of some produot are not sufficient to allow of the establishment of a board of control, or it happens that it is essential to exercise control only in times of surpluses. Consequently it is of the utmost importance that these powers should be granted to the Minister to enable him to exercise such control. It is also a case of having to impose a levy on certain food commodities in order to regulate the distribution and orderly marketing of such commodities. This has happened in the case of several of these products. Some time ago, when there was such a large surplus of bananas that it was hardly possible to find a market for them, it was necessary to introduce control. Furthermore, it is desirable that the prices of products should not be too high. If too many people start producing a certain commodity, this leads to a surplus in the end as everything produced cannot be marketed. All these matters have to be regulated and controlled.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to discuss clause 15 in particular which empowers the Minister to make certain arrangements. It happens in the case of dairy products that farmers may be discouraged to such an extent by prices that are too low that that may destroy the whole breeding policy of farmers who have been breeding herds for many years. Therefore it is of the utmost importance that these powers should be granted to the Minister in respect of products which do not fall within the ambit of the Marketing Act.</p>

<p>The final matter I want to raise is the question of fluctuating prices. In this respect too, it is equally important for the necessary arrangements to exist. Last night we heard over the radio that the cattle stock of the country was insufficient and that we were heading for an eventual shortage of beef. If there are too many fluctuations in producers&#x2019; prices, production may be discouraged. It happens at times that there is too big a difference between the floor price and the average marketing price, while the average price yields a decent income, and production can be affected very adversely if prices subsequently slump to the floor.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this afternoon we are again dealing with an amendment of the Marketing Act. Allow me to say at the outset that since I have been a member of this House it has happened quite a number of times, virtually every year, that the Marketing Act has had to be amended. Last year we consolidated the Marketing Act in order to make it readable. All of us expected that the Marketing Act had been placed on a sound basis and that it would be able to function properly. But for the very reason that this Government and the Minister maintain very close contact with the agricultural economy in South Africa, they have deemed it necessary to introduce this amendment this year. This amendment has a very favourable effect particularly on our highly perishable products which are being marketed mainly on our nine large municipal markets in the Republic. This applies to the vegetable and fruit industries. It is very difficult to introduce a scheme for the control of most of these products. Consequently surplus conditions develop on these nine large markets, which make it impossible for the producers to obtain a decent price for their products, especially in view of the fact that the markets are supplied during a specific period of production when all producers send their products to the market. The levies which may be imposed on the various products in terms of this amendment, enable the Minister to appoint certain interested persons to act on the open market and to support the prices in that way and, if necessary, even to buy some of these products themselves for re-distribution. We have the position in South Africa that people produce large quantities of a certain product within a particular area during a certain season which are sent to the nearest market. In view of the fact that the products have to be transported over long distances, it is not possible to bring <span class="col_4793-4794" refersTo="page_0884"/>about a balanced distribution of these products spread over the nine different markets in the Republic. I foresee, because of this amendment, that it will be possible to utilize the funds which the Minister has at his disposal in such a way that he may he able to subsidize certain things in connection with transport in order to encourage in this way the marketing of such products on other markets in that production area. We have a very specific example of this in the case of potatoes. As hon. members are aware, potatoes are already being controlled under a specific scheme. But there are many other products which are being marketed under similar circumstances as those under which potatoes are being marketed. Last year we had the position that the Potato Control Board was obliged to introduce transport subsidies when the market prices in Cape Town, for example, were higher than those in Johannesburg. Instead of the farmers of the Highveld marketing their products in Johannesburg, it is now possible for them to market their products in Cape Town as well, as the high costs of transport are being subsidized. The same principle applies also in respect of the marketing of tomatoes and other highly perishable products, i.e. the principle of bringing about a more balanced distribution by means of this fund.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to raise a second point which is also very important in connection with this amendment. This amendment creates the possibility of establishing a reserve for the possible introduction of a scheme for the marketing of a certain product. In this respect I should like to refer to the wheat industry in particular. There is a type of control scheme in respect of the wheat industry which we call a pooling scheme. The production of a certain commodity may possibly not be sufficient to justify the administrative costs in respect of the introduction of a pooling scheme. If levies were imposed in respect of a specific product over a long period, it would be possible to build up a fund in that way. We have, for example, the case of a product such as buckwheat. The annual production of buckwheat in the Republic is approximately between 300,000 and 400,000 bags. The number of bags produced does not, however, justify the introduction of a control scheme, particularly not a pooling scheme with its high costs. At present the introduction of some form of control is envisaged. When one starts a pooling scheme, one has to impose heavy levies on the producers in order to finance the administrative costs of such a pooling scheme. As soon as such a scheme is introduced the speculative dealers who market the product, are immediately intent on trying to outbid such a control scheme. The result of this is that a kind of resistance to the introduction of such a control scheme develops amongst producers because of the fact that high levies have to be introduced immediately in order to finance the administrative costs of such a scheme. Consequently I say that it is important to adopt this amendment before the House so that we may be able to eliminate this problem as well.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park raised two very important matters. In the first place he wanted an indication of what products would fall under this scheme. The other matter he raised was that the rights of the producers should not be denied.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell the hon. member that we cannot define all these products. I can mention a few to him, namely tomatoes, cabbages and pumpkins. During the implementation of this legislation in practice there will be surpluses. In that case, if a levy is imposed, we will have the means and the machinery of assisting the producers. The period over which the levy will be imposed, is another matter about which we cannot take any decision today. This we leave in the hands of the producers who will make representations to the Department through their agricultural unions. At that time attention will be given to the matter. In the past it happened that a specific market had surpluses. If we make this applicable to, say, tomatoes, that does not mean that it will be applicable to Cape Town, Johannesburg, and the other seven major marketing areas. It will only be applicable to the specific place where this problem arises. But, as a result of representations we have received from producers, we simply want to create the machinery at this stage already in order to make provision for this eventuality.</p>

<p>The other matter, i.e. the denial of the rights of the producers, is something about which all of us are concerned. But now I should like the hon. member for Newton Park to have regard to the way in which the potato scheme is operating at the moment. There is a Potato Board on which the producers have the majority vote; but this Board does not really have contact with the producers on the farms. It decides, for example, to impose a levy on a bag of potatoes. All these things are to the advantage of the producer. In times of surpluses there are times when the Potato Board has funds at its disposal to buy the potatoes itself, to withdraw the potatoes from a particular market, and to export them at a loss, and then to utilize the funds for stimulating the industry. The whole idea behind this legislation, which I can see the hon, member for Newton Park also wants, is to have peace and calm in an industry when one does at times have a surplus of perishable product. For this reason I feel that I do not want to say at this stage whether we will accept his amendment. I have not read his amendment as yet. When we have had the chance to examine his amendment, we shall see whether or not we shall accept it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karas asked for the assurance that this levy would not be implemented improperly. I want to tell the hon. member that the representations for this came <span class="col_4795-4796" refersTo="page_0885"/>from the agricultural unions. In the past these representations also came from them. The levy affords protection to products which are sometimes offered in large surplus quantities on the market.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Humansdorp asked for one board to be selected to act as agent for the various other boards. But to what board is one to allocate that duty&#x003F; For example, one cannot say that it should be the Mealie Board. The board must have some association with the product. The hon. member for Bethal spoke of buckwheat. One can link control over the production of buckwheat to the Mealie Board, as the production of kaffircorn is at present linked to the Mealie Board. But surely one cannot link the production of pumpkins to the Mealie Board or the Wheat Board. They are not birds of a feather, or should I rather say, pips of a pumpkin.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Nelspruit mentioned a very important point, and that is that problems are created on the markets by people who market products of poor quality. One has a period during which the producers of tomatoes obtain a reasonable price of, say, from 60c to 70c per case. But then a person markets from 2,000 to 3,000 cases of rubbish and that, from an overall point of view, forces down the price of the product completely. I am pleased the hon. member made that point. We are trying to find ways and means of solving these things.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethal mentioned the case of buckwheat, to which we should also have regard. This is not something we can link to the part dealing with the levy. One cannot, after all, establish a buckwheat control board; we cannot have a control board for each product. This, however, gives us the opportunity of affording protection in this respect. The question merely is what it is to be called We are investigating these matters.</p>

<heading>ANIMAL DISEASES AND PARASITES AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Animal Diseases and Parasites Act of 1956 (Act No. 13 of 1956) was primarily a consolidation of the Animal Diseases Act of 1911, which was probably one of the most important pieces of legislation ever placed on the Statute Book. This far-sightedness ensured that our livestock could be saved from dreaded diseases such as East Coast Fever and Scabies, which have virtually been eradicated. It has already been possible, with a good deal of success, to prevent various other diseases, which had already assumed vast proportions overseas, from entering the Republic. The measure of success which has been achieved can to a large extent be attributed to the statutory control which the Veterinary Services section of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has applied over the years with great diligence and zeal.</p>

<p>The Amendment Bill which is being laid before the hon. House to-day was drafted in conjunction with the South African Police as a result of the smuggling trade in poultry and brood eggs which has presumably assumed disturbing proportions recently and which constitutes a great disease threat to our country&#x2019;s livestock. The proposed measures must be seen in the light of the outbreaks of disease which have occurred during the past few years, and which have already cost the country millions of rands. In this way, for example, the outbreak of Newcastle disease in the Western Cape in 1968 was a direct result of smuggled poultry. I may also add that the South African Agricultural Union and the South African Poultry Association are deeply concerned about the entire position and have recommended that urgent steps be taken to deal with the situation. In broad outline the principles contained in the Amendment Bill amount to the following: Firstly: Additional duties and penalties are now being imposed upon persons in control of conveyances arriving in the Republic. Of these persons it is now being expected that they should ensure that animals, parasites and infectious things on board such conveyances, or belonging to the crew of such conveyances, may in no way be removed without written authorization. In the past, when this did in fact happen, the defence of the person in control of the conveyance was that the crew had not executed his orders. These offences are now being made punishable, and in addition the onus is being placed on the person in control of the conveyance, as well as on the crew. This measure will possibly have the desired effect or curbing the smuggling to a large extent.</p>

<p>Secondly: Powers are now being requested, in circumstances where conveyances are being used to bring illegally imported animals, parasites and infectious things into the Republic illegally, to seize those conveyances and even to confiscate them. This drastic step has become necessary owing to the increasing use of private aircraft plying between the Republic and its neighbouring states. Passing ships are to an increasing extent making use of coastal vessels and helicopters to load or offload goods such as post, fresh vegetables and other essentials while these ships are in the territorial waters of the Republic. Unfortunately there were persons who availed themselves of these methods to introduce in the main brood eggs, poultry, fancy birds such as budgerigars, parrots, etc., into the Republic illegally and on a large scale. I can only hope that this measure will cause prospective smugglers <span class="col_4797-4798" refersTo="page_0886"/>to think twice before continuing their undesirable activities. The danger that diseases, introduced by illegal imports, may constitute can probably never be over-emphasized. Persons plying this smuggling trade are by no means concerned about the health of our livestock, for their main concern is private gain.</p>

<p>Thirdly: Additional powers are being granted to officers and police officers to enable them to take steps in cases where there is a presumption that animals have been smuggled in. Owners of such animals can be ordered to place them under official supervision until such time as certain investigations in regard to the origin of the animals have been completed. This measure is necessary because it is not always possible for the State to detain and to care for animals and their progeny. Practical problems are being experienced when a person smuggles in infectious things like brood eggs and the progeny thereof runs into thousands or even millions. In such cases, therefore, it need not be ordered that the animals be destroyed before sufficient information has been collected concerning the origin of the animal. Should there be insufficient reason for prosecution and confiscation the animals can therefore be returned to the owner without any real disruption having arisen. I may add that the Department is thoroughly aware of the large scale smuggling which is taking place, particularly with poultry and brood eggs. With the acquisition of the new statutory powers there will be no hesitation in taking steps against suspected persons, particularly in order to determine the origin of certain blood lines. It is also being provided that the premises where smuggled animals are found, may be declared quarantine stations, which means that adequate official control will be applied there.</p>

<p>Fourthly: Because progeny is a very important aspect in regard to smuggled animals, parasites and infectious things, it is necessary to make special provision for seizure thereof if it should be found that smuggling had in fact taken place. There have also been cases where animals were imported which were apparently healthy, but after a while the disease appeared. Some of the diseases have an exceptionally long incubation period, and the virus is borne in a latent or dormant state in the parent. When the progeny are bom they are also infected and the danger of disease becomes so much greater. That is why it is necessary, in these cases, to take steps against the progeny.</p>

<p>I hope that I will receive the support of the House for these measures, which are aimed at keeping our livestock as healthy as possible and preventing disease conditions from being caused by unauthorized imports.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the confidence which the hon. the Deputy Minister expressed in his last sentence is certainly not misplaced because we on this side of the House will support the passing of the Second Reading of this Bill. It was particularly interesting to hear from the hon. the Deputy Minister in how many ways smugglers can bring infected animals into South Africa. To draw the net closer about those people who have already caused so much damage, <i>inter alia,</i> with the outbreak of Newcastle disease last year, we are prepared to give the Minister our support. We on this side are thoroughly aware of the scope of the damage which animal diseases cause to South Africa&#x2019;s stock industry annually. Any steps which may be taken to limit the damage, we on this side will be prepared to support. This legislation is the result of consultation and negotiation which took place with the Poultry Association and the South African Agricultural Union. Because they, too, agree with this measure, we are prepared to support the Minister. We want to join with him in expressing the hope that we will not have a repetition of the outbreak of Newcastle disease which we had last year in the Western Cape and in parts of the Transvaal. We received complaints from people who lost thousands of birds. I think it is the duty of every hon. member of this House to give his support to the Minister and the farmers in regard to steps which can be taken to prevent this kind of thing in South Africa. For that reason only we support the Minister. Extensive powers are being granted to the police and to customs officers here. We realize that. We see that conveyances can be confiscated when it is thought that these people may perhaps be involved in the smuggling trade. These wide powers are necessary, however, because this is an extremely important matter. Consequently we on this side of the House are prepared to support the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I welcome the fact that the Opposition, as stated by the hon. member for Newton Park, supports this important Amendment Bill. Smugglers are unscrupulous people who stop at nothing to make money. As their ingenuity increases, it is necessary for the hon. the Minister to keep on coming forward with new measures to counteract their activities. We have the very good example of the outbreak and steps taken to counteract Newcastle disease last year, to which the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Newton Park referred. It cost the Department and the State millions of rand. It could probably have been prevented if the powers contained in this measure had, at that stage already, been granted to the police. However, I want to congratulate the Department on having succeeded in such a relatively short time, in completely eradicating the disease here in the Western Cape. The steps which they took and the way in which the officials the veterinary surgeons, livestock inspectors, and all who assisted in counteracting this plague, acted, redounds to the credit of all. I think the Department deserves our congratulations for the competent and skilful way in which they dealt with this entire matter.</p>

<p><span class="col_4799-4800" refersTo="page_0887"/>It is well known that the smuggling trade in poultry and brood eggs is increasing, and that it constitutes an increasingly grave danger to our country&#x2019;s livestock. Consequently it has become necessary for very drastic steps to be taken. This measure contains very drastic powers. Certain kinds of conveyances can even be confiscated. However, I welcome the powers which are being granted, because we cannot take measures drastic enough to counteract this kind of thing. I do not know whether this means the end of the smuggling trade. As the smugglers display more ingenuity, so stricter steps will continually have to be taken. I want to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister and thank him for this legislation. Consequently I want to give this measure our complete support.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In 1967, during my Second Reading speech on the Immorality Amendment Bill, I informed this House that homosexuality was not unknown in our country and I said that it was not up to one person alone to cope with this problem. I then indicated that I would come to this House the following year with a measure which would serve as a basis for an investigation by a select committee. Last year I subsequently introduced the Immorality Amendment Bill in which provision was made, <i>inter alia</i>, to make the commission of certain deeds between persons of the same sex punishable. As hon. members know, I moved, before the Second Reading, that that Bill be referred to a select committee for investigation and report, the commission to have power to take evidence and call for papers, and with leave to submit an amended Bill. The amended Bill now before us, is the Bill submitted by the Committee.</p>

<p>With your leave, Mr. Speaker, and before I deal with the Bill, I want to express my thanks and appreciation to the hon. member for Omaruru (Advocate Frank) and all the members of the Select Committee for the time and energy which they devoted to the investigation of this matter. I feel convinced that they had a very difficult and unenviable task, but I also feel convinced that they acquitted themselves very well of their task. I find it particularly gratifying that the recommendation of the Committee on such a difficult subject was unanimous.</p>

<p>The Bill, which has now been recommended by the Committee, differs considerably from the Bill which was originally referred to it for investigation, but this is understandable if we consider the scope and the nature of the evidence which was submitted to the Committee. The first clause in the Bill ought undoubtedly to receive wholehearted support since it is aimed at protecting our young boys against the commission of immoral or improper deeds up to an age at which their sexual orientation is regarded to have been completed, and when they are no longer so susceptible to seduction by more mature homosexuals. In the case of young girls it would appear that in general the sexual direction is already confirmed at an earlier age. For the sake of interest I want to mention that according to a Press report which appeared some time ago it was alleged that more than 100 self-confessed young homosexuals demonstrated in front of the Parliamentary building in The Hague for the abolition of a law prohibiting homosexual practices with juveniles. With the amendment which is now contained in clause 1 of the Bill, homosexuals are being unequivocally informed that rather than relax existing measures we are going to take stricter steps for the protection of our youth. Fortunately this amendment was not only the unanimous recommendation of the Select Committee, but it is understood that everyone who gave evidence in this connection was agreed that juveniles should be protected. There were of course, as is understandable, different opinions on what the age between the age group 16 to 21 should be up to which young boys should be protected against immoral or improper deeds, nevertheless 19 years appears to be the most suitable age in the light of considered opinion. The amendments in clause 1 (2) are merely consequential amendments which arise from the preceding amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 2 requires no lengthy argument. This clause deals primarily with specific kinds of articles which are used to give females sexual gratification in an unnatural way. The object is to get at the person who makes this type of article available for use rather than at the person in possession thereof. A prohibition on the manufacture, sale or supply of the article must inevitably lead to possession <span class="col_4801-4802" refersTo="page_0888"/>thereof also being made virtually impossible. With this prohibition young girls, will, <i>inter alia,</i> be prevented from being seduced into committing sexual deeds by older women, and in this way as well the young girls of our nation are being protected.</p>

<p>Clause 3 of the Bill is an important provision. I do not intend to give a survey of the wealth of evidence which was submitted to the Select Committee by experts, and by homosexuals themselves. That evidence is accesible to hon. members if they want to know more of the details in regard to this subject. Without in any way derogating from any existing legal rules, whether in common or in statutory law, and I repeat, Mr. Speaker, without derogating from any existing legal rules, whether in common or in statutory law, it is envisaged with this clause to deal with the malpractices which occur at some homosexual gatherings. Evidence about the most immoral deeds imaginable, which were committed at some of these parties, is on record, and it can serve no purpose to emphasize this further. It appears from an analysis of the legal position that the various statutory provisions which are already contained in the Statute Book in regard to the commission of immoral deeds, plus the common law which according to a recent decision, still prohibits the commission of unnatural deeds between males, plus the new offence for which provision is now being made in clause 3 are, as far as we can see, comprehensive enough to counteract the evil with which we are dealing properly. It is particularly gratifying that the Committee did not recommend concessions in regard to the existing law on the matter concerned. There is apparently a tendency in some countries where prohibitions against homosexuality still exist to move in the direction of concessions. However, we cannot allow anything like that. With reference to the Press report which I mentioned earlier I want to mention that the Lower House in The Hague rejected a motion submitted on behalf of the demonstrating homosexuals to delete the appeal provision prohibiting sexual intercourse with a juvenile. I also want to mention that, according to another Press report, a petition was submitted to Parliament in New Zealand a few months ago in which it was requested that homosexual deeds between consenting adults in private should be legalized. The chairman of the petition committee subsequently informed Parliament that the committee had no recommendations to make and expressed his own personal opinion that he regarded homosexuality as repugnant and was amazed that there were church leaders who advocated a change in the Act. Therefore, Sir, we do not stand alone when we stand firm and make no concessions.</p>

<p>Clause 4 of the Bill contains the penal provision for the offences which are now being created by clauses 2 and 3, and is the same as for the commission of immoral deeds in public or enticement to the commission of such deeds.</p>

<p>Clause 5 repeals a pre-Union statutory provision in Natal in regard to the commission of gross immoral deeds between males. That provision now becomes unnecessary in the light of the existing statutory provisions, the common law and the offence for which provision is being made in clause 3.</p>

<p>With that, Mr. Speaker, I have covered the field.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The House will be indebted to the hon. the Minister for the summary of the Bill he has given us. I think the Minister very wisely decided that the original Bill should not be debated and decided upon in this House, but that this was particularly a matter which should go to a Select Committee with power to call evidence from all the people concerned, those affected by the Bill and those who could give expert evidence on the subject, especially the medical men and the psychiatrists. I think it is a tribute to the Select Committee that the Minister has accepted <i>in toto</i> the Bill they have submitted to the House. I am very pleased about that because I was a member of that Select Committee and we sat for six hours a week every week during the whole of the last session hearing the evidence of all the persons concerned, on either side of the fence, in this rather delicate and difficult matter. The Bill which the Select Committee has submitted to the House, and which is acceptable to the Minister, is one which is quite different from the original Bill. This subject was dealt with and there was a unanimous decision, and the Bill is, to use a legal expression, a true judgment according to the evidence. The evidence has been published and it is there for everyone to see.</p>

<p>I want to pay one word of tribute to the Chairman of that Select Committee. One seldom has a unanimous decision without some sort of guidance from the Chairman of such a Committee. The Minister has payed tribute to the hon. member for Omaruru as Chairman of that Committee, and I would like to pay tribute to him also on behalf of all the members of the Select Committee for the manner in which he chaired us and the manner in which he managed to get complete unanimity on this difficult and delicate subject which was entrusted to us. It was the proper thing to do to refer this Bill to a Select Committee and we are encouraged by the views expressed in the Press and elsewhere, which seem to confirm that the Select Committee has done the right and proper thing. Therefore we support this Bill completely and unanimously.</p>

<p>In the first instance I want to thank the hon. member for Durban (North) for the complimentary words he addressed to me, and also to the hon. Minister, and at the same time I want to thank the hon. member and all the other members of <span class="col_4803-4804" refersTo="page_0889"/>the Select Committee for the capable way, and the representative way in which they, for their part, dealt with the matter.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that this Committee was not appointed as a commission of inquiry into homosexualism and which had to bring out a report, but to examine a Bill which was introduced here in this House of Assembly, and then to submit an amended Bill, if the Committee deemed fit. But because the Committee did not bring out a report, and as a result of the wide interest in this matter, I now consider it my duty to give a short summary of the purport of the evidence submitted.</p>

<p>In its activities the Committee had to deal with very irksome questions of a most complicated nature. <i>Inter alia,</i> it appeared that it was not merely a question of the protection of morals, but that the sphere of application of criminal law came into the picture. In other words, what is the object of criminal law and what spheres of society should it cover&#x003F; You can therefore realize, Sir, that the matters we were dealing with were extremely complicated.</p>

<p>The evidence indicated, firstly, that homosexual tendencies in a person are the result of the combination of hereditary factors and environmental conditions, but this hypothesis, however, is not conclusive because there is evidence to the effect that one child in a family may be a homosexual while other children from the same family, and from the same home circumstances, are not, which in turn indicates that there may also be cases where the hormone structure is the cause. In the light of the scientific knowledge we have to-day, it must be accepted that a person with confirmed homosexual tendencies can only be changed by treatment in extremely exceptional cases, and that an adult homosexual cannot change the nature of his homosexual urges. Then, according to the evidence, homosexualism is not confined to one language group or to certain races. Nor has it been increasing to any disturbing degree in recent years. We are more aware of it because there are more psychologists and psychiatrists available to-day and people are going to them with more confidence, and in addition we have the emergence of the sensation-seeking Press. In addition there was no evidence that lesbianism is being practised to such an extent or in such a way that it in itself justifies criminal sanctions. But according to police evidence, certain raids were carried out in 1966, following certain complaints, and it was established that parties, which could be described as shocking, were being held by homosexuals throughout the Republic on a large scale and that our legal system is without the necessary legislation to counteract these evils effectively. It was also the unanimous opinion of the witnesses that juveniles should be protected and that the present age limit of 16 years should be increased.</p>

<p>With few exceptions the Bill as submitted to the Committee was immediately regarded as undesirable by all the witnesses. It must be noted that the evidence was submitted by the most eminent authorities in this field in South Africa, including professors from the most well-known universities and the Government Departments concerned. I also want to thank these persons for having taken all the trouble to give evidence. We found it very valuable and we could not have performed our duties without that valuable evidence. It appeared that those few exceptional bodies or individuals who desired drastic legislation were not fully conversant with the present position of penal code, namely that sodomy and attempted sodomy is in fact an offence, and that even the commission of an unnatural deed by one male with another male is already an offence. To sum up, then, it appears that homosexualism is a psychological and social problem which can only be counteracted by making a thorough study of the causes thereof, and establishing a constructive programme of counsel and education of children by parents, teachers and even doctors. It would appear that there is a great deal to be done in respect of preventative work as regards adequate mental health services which are not linked to institutions. We all felt that homosexualism cannot in any respect be excused, and we found that even the most hard-baked homosexual would give anything to be able to live a normal life. Consequently we felt that the existing statutory sanctions should remain.</p>

<p>In the light of what I have just said, we submitted this Bill which is to-day before the House. Consequently provision is being made in the first instance for the age limit for juveniles to be increased from 16 to 19 years. As far as the articles are concerned, there was in fact evidence that these articles are in circulation, but not that the use thereof was creating a social evil or that it in fact was a threat to society. Consequently provision has been made to the effect that the articles may not be sold or manufactured. Then there is the other clause which deals with the immoral parties, and this is just about the entire purport of the Bill. It is my opinion that if this Bill is accepted like this, the penal provision in respect of homosexual activities ought to offer sufficient protection to society.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. member for Durban (North) for what he has just said. I have already expressed my gratitude to the Chairman, the hon. member for Omaruru and the Committee as a whole. In conclusion I just want to say that this is a very delicate subject we are dealing with, but that what I find gratifying is that the final statutory provisions have been passed unanimously by this House. In other words, what we are stipulating in the Bill has the approval of the representatives of the nation as a whole, and that says a great deal. Not only does it meet with the approval of the representatives of the nation, who did not act precipitately, but it also meets with their approval after all <span class="col_4805-4806" refersTo="page_0890"/>concerned in this matter had done their duty and had heard the evidence on this difficult subject.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there has been excellent co-operation between the parties, and I pay tribute to the Leader of the House for the manner in which he has arranged the business of the House. There has been accommodation given both ways. We are not here to hold up the House unnecessarily. There has been evidence of this to-day, because where there have been agreed measures we have allowed stages of Bills to be taken. We have already allowed more than one stage of other legislation taken during this Session but when measures call for debate we are prepared to debate and argue with the Government on the legislation that they put forward. But the position is simply that this Government, through its Ministers, has little or no regard for Parliament. They absent themselves, when they are responsible for legislation which appears on the Order Paper, and it does not matter what happens in Parliament. They are away addressing public meetings. Perhaps some of them are away arranging a welcome committee to a certain Member of Parliament! That may be the reason for their absence, I do not know; but they are not here in Parliament where they should be and I hope that this sort of thing is not going to go on. Exactly the same sort of thing nearly happened a week ago. There have been other times when, with the assistance of the Opposition, the Government has been able to continue with the business on the Order Paper because the Opposition agreed to deal with measures which were not scheduled to come up for discussion. I do not believe that an Opposition should be put in that position.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Everything has gone smoothly because there has been good co-operation from the Opposition. It is absolutely nonsense to say there has been no opposition. The Opposition are prepared to oppose where they do not agreed but they do not waste time unnecessarily when there is agreement. That has been our attitude. If some of the other Bills which appear on the Order Paper had come up for discussion to-day, we would not have been adjourning at this hour or for that matter on Monday or the next day. The hon. member must not tell us, therefore, that there has been no opposition. This Opposition is a responsible Opposition, in contrast to this irresponsible Government which allows its Ministers to go away when legislation of which they are in charge appears on the Order Paper. Sir, I hope that in future there will be some co-operation between Ministers and the Leader of the House. I do not blame the Leader of the House for this. It appears that Ministers simply go off without ascertaining first whether they have business in the House or not. As I said, they show a total disregard for Parliament and a total disregard for this democratic system under which we work, and the sooner the Ministers realize that the better.</p>

They fought like lions on the Opposition side and then one had an interchange of debate. But the powers of the Opposition have wasted away; they are a small group; they can no longer conduct a debate, and the people outside know that they cannot do so, and now they want to pose here as a pugnacious Opposition on a Friday afternoon, simply because there are no Ministers here. Sir, this fight is the greatest political sham fight one can get from an Opposition that does not fulfil the function of an Opposition. I say their urge to do things has been blunted. All their fingers have become thumbs; they were born tired; that is their difficulty. The Chief Whip on that side even wrote out his speech beforehand. He has been waiting for this opportunity all along, and after he had written out his speech, he read it out too.

<p>They should really know better. Sir, I say that, had the Opposition done their homework, we would not have been in this situation to-day. Had they done their homework, we could have dealt with those items I mentioned a moment ago. But the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration has many official duties outside.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite asked where the Ministers were. Hon. members know as well as I do that the Ministers concerned with this legislation have urgent official commitments. Hon. members opposite know that if we should have proceeded with Order of the Day No. 10, i.e. the Resumption of the Committee Stage of the Appropriation Bill, they would have been in difficulties. We have enough Ministers to proceed with that. The hon. the Minister of Justice is sitting over there. I warned the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs and various other Ministers, who at the moment are carrying at their duties in the Senate, that we might possibly need them here after this Order Paper had reached a certain stage. What was the attitude of those hon. members&#x003F; They were not prepared to proceed with those items, because they had not done their homework. This is the situation, Mr. Speaker. What happened to the various Bills the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture dealt with this morning&#x003F; This is important legislation. Marketing in South Africa is one of the most important matters affecting the <span class="col_4813-4814" refersTo="page_0894"/>farming community in this country. The hon. member for Newton Park made a half-hearted speech of approximately ten minutes. After that the United Party collapsed and this side of the House had six or seven speakers in a row. Hon. members opposite are not doing their duty. They do not know what their duty in this House and to the voters of South Africa is. That is why this state of affairs has arisen. If anyone is guilty in this connection it is hon. members on the opposite side. They should hang their heads in shame. If one thinks of their predecessors, one could say that they had eaten sour grapes and that the teeth of their children became blunt.</p>

<heading>AMENDMENTS TO THE FIRST SCHEDULE: DEFENCE ACT, 1957</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, in terms of section 104 (2) Of the Defence Act, 1957 (Act No. 44 of 1957), approves the proposed amendments to the First Schedule to the Act, laid upon the Table of the House of Assembly on 6th March, 1969, and of the Senate on 10th March, 1969. [A. 2&#x2014;&#x2019;69.]</block>

<p>These proposals were made available to hon. members quite some time ago. Subsequently, as a result of arrangements I had made, discussions were held with legal officers of the Defence Force and an amended document was presented to this House. A need exists in the South African Defence Force for the proposed amendments to the First Schedule to the Defence Act, 1957, which were tabled here, as well as in the Other Place, on 6th March in order to effect these essential changes. Military law, of which this First Schedule serves as an important source, is being administered by military courts, i.e. officers of the S.A. Defence Force and in particular of the Permanent Force. In the administration of this law certain problems have been revealed by experience, and it is essential, in order to combat these problems, for the aforementioned amendments to be effected now.</p>

<p>These problems are of a fourfold nature. Certain relevant sections have been phrased in such a way that they are open to more than one interpretation, as a result of which there is confusion and some uncertainty on the part of those concerned in the implementation of those sections in practice. If in addition regard is had to the fact that such persons do not always have legal qualifications and have to deal with the implementation of the First Schedule every day, this becomes a real problem. In the second place, the narrow interpretation of certain penal provisions gives rise to a lack of freedom for the executive authority, as a result of which military discipline is being prejudiced. In the third place, administration is being hampered by incorrect terminology and directives, and some of the sections are defective as a result of in completeness. In the fourth place, the First Schedule is inadequate to meet particular needs, i.e. the intensification of control in order to make the maintenance of discipline more effective and to facilitate the procedure as far as administration is concerned.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that there are several sections in the First Schedule which are affected by the aforementioned shortcomings, it is obvious that many amendments will be of a purely consequential nature, and I shall indicate these.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words about clause 1. In terms of section 2 of the First Schedule, the provisions of the First Schedule are applicable only to persons who are subject to the Military Discipline Code. The First Schedule contains the statutory provisions in terms of which a military court is established, and consequently it can try only persons who are subject to that Code. The terminology &#x201C;with offences under this Code&#x201D; may possibly lend itself to an, interpretation that the military court was presumably precluded from trying persons for offences other than those under the Code. Such an argument can be strengthened by a closer inspection of paragraph 5 of subsection (1) of section 1 as well as section 70, where a distinction is drawn between civil offences and offences under the Code. In order to remove any confusion with regard to the jurisdiction of a military court, the amendment in its new form is being proposed.</p>

<p>Then I come to clause 2. In, any prosecution for a contravention of section 26 of the Schedule, it is essential for the State to prove the element of negligence. The difficulty, if not the impossibility, of proving this element in a court has become evident in practice. After the analogy of what is prescribed in subsection (2) of section 24, the State is being released of this onus of proof now, and it is being expected of the accused in such a prosecution to furnish at least a reasonable and a satisfactory explanation to the court of the circumstances which form the basis of the facts which have given rise to that prosecution.</p>

<p>Clause 3: The amendments to section 30 are being effected for the sake of completeness, but they are important and are removing the possibility of a one-sided interpretation of section 30. In its existing form a person could be implicated by these provisions only when he had been required to complete the documents for official purposes. If he had submitted a document out of his own free will, without his having been requested officially for such a document, one in which he had made a false statement or entry, with the intention that it should be dealt with officially, his action would hardly have been punishable by virtue of a one-sided interpretation which can be attached to the relevant provisions of section 30. Now the amendments are removing this shortcoming as well.</p>

<p><span class="col_4817-4818" refersTo="page_0896"/>Clause 4: This amendment is necessary, in the first place, to avoid unnecessary repetition. A person who is &#x201C;in diens&#x201D; can be &#x201C;diensvry&#x201D;; a person &#x201C;aan diens&#x201D; is not &#x201C;diensvry&#x201D;. In addition there is the omission of something which is superfluous as there is no other penalty prescribed in the Code for any contravention of section 33 (and there is no necessity to prescribe any such other penalty) and may cause unnecessary confusion as far as a court is concerned.</p>

<p>As regards clause 5, &#x201C;prejudice&#x201D; in section 46 is now being qualified in order to eliminate any argument with regard to what is to be understood under that. Actual prejudice leads to punishment. Conduct which has not given rise to any actual prejudice to good order and military discipline, but may nevertheless have contained the possibility or likelihood of prejudicing good order and military discipline, ought to be punishable. In a given circumstance the conduct of a person may possibly not have any perceptible effect on the persons in his presence, with the result that actual prejudice is completely out of the question, but such conduct may be prejudicial to good order and military discipline in the S.A. Defence Force in general, and therefore it ought not to be overlooked merely on account of the circumstances in which such a person found himself at the time of his conduct.</p>

<p>As regards clauses 6, 7 and 8, they are more or less of a consequential nature.</p>

<p>Clause 9: The further amendments are being effected, in the first place, with regard to the provisions of section 56, and, in the second place, to delete a procedure which is in fact not prescribed.</p>

<p>As regards clause 10, the need for this new provision is to be found in the fact that there is no provision for formal action against officers of the rank of commandant or major for minor offences. The procedure then usually is either to reprimand these officers informally, which is not always desirable and conducive to discipline in given circumstances, or to bring them before the only competent military court, namely a general court martial, which, on account of practical and financial circumstances and circumstances of service, is not always desirable either for minor offences.</p>

<p>The reasons for clause 11 are threefold: In the first place, by extending the punitive jurisdiction of commanding officers, discipline is intensified; in other words, increased punitive jurisdiction serves as a deterrent. Coupled with this there is the provision in rule 28 of the Military Discipline Code with regard to the penalties which may be imposed on an accused when he pleads guilty to any charge brought against him and the trial officer convicts him on that charge without any evidence having been led. In that case it is being envisaged, for various reasons, the most important of which is to alleviate the administrative burden which rests on the trial officer with regard to the procedure at the summary trial, to increase the maximum penalties of fines and detention which may be imposed, with the result that as far as clause 11 is concerned, those penalties in section 62 also have to be increased in order to maintain a proper balance. The third most important consideration is to limit the number of courts martial convened in respect of minor offences merely for the sake of imposing a heavier penalty than that which a trial officer has jurisdiction to impose. The envisaged increased punitive jurisdiction of trial officers should not be regarded as a tremendous power which may have farreaching and indeterminable consequences for an accused. The interests of the accused are still being protected through automatic channels of review, and the very object the amendments contained in clauses 13, 14 and 15 seek to achieve is to benefit accused persons by means of an accelerated procedure of review in order to avoid too much time elapsing.</p>

<p>The proposed subsection (2) of section 63, as embodied in clause 12, is not creating anything new. In this subsection, in which the provisions of the existing subsections (2) and (3) have been embodied, the procedure to be followed in the event of any objection to a trial officer is simply being stated more clearly, as the procedure which is outlined at present is inconsequential, incomplete and difficult to understand.</p>

<p>The amendments contained in clause 13 as well as in clause 14 are being effected purely with a view to benefitting the accused. In terms of the provisions of section 118 of the First Schedule, every sentence commences immediately after the sentence has been announced in open court. Nevertheless, in terms of existing legislation, any revision of such a sentence cannot take place prior to the expiration of a period of three days in order to afford the accused the opportunity of making representations with regard to his trial. If such an accused had been sentenced to detention, for example, that sentence would be put into operation immediately, and regard being had to the aforementioned provisions concerning revision as well as to postal traffic, it could happen that he would have served a considerable portion of that sentence before his case could be reviewed and any irregularity could possibly be detected in the proceedings as a result of which his sentence would be set aside. By expediting the procedure with regard to revision, the period of possible irregular detention of an accused is being limited to a minimum. In this connection I have already referred to clause 14.</p>

<p>The provision in clause 15 is essential as a result of the provision in clause 10 in which a criminal court is empowered to hold summary trials in order to make provision for the channels of revision in respect of the proceedings before that trial officer.</p>

<p>Clauses 16 and 17, too, are of a consequential nature.</p>

<p><span class="col_4819-4820" refersTo="page_0897"/>I now refer to clause 18. In terms of section 70 a general court martial may try a person for any offence excluding an offence under section 56, i.e. treason, murder, rape and culpable homicide committed within the Republic by any person subject to the Code. In terms of section 71 an ordinary court martial has jurisdiction to try any person subject to the Code, not being an officer, for any offence, other than a capital civil offence or an offence under section 4 or 5. Treason, murder and rape are civil capital offences. As culpable homicide, which is mentioned in section 56 and is excluded in section 70, is not excluded in section 71 as well, this amendment removes this shortcoming.</p>

<p>Clause 19 is of a consequential nature.</p>

<p>Clause 20 is included merely for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>The reasons for the amendment in clause 21 are important. As far as offences are concerned, the jurisdiction of a general court martial outside the borders of the Republic is unlimited, and that court martial would be competent to try an offender on a charge of murder. For various reasons it may be deemed necessary to adjourn such a court martial for a period longer than 14 days, and in that case the accused would be entitled in terms of existing legislation to be released from custody, which could create an undesirable situation. This would apply even in the case of a deserter, the last person a court would want to have released from custody. In terms of the amendment a discretion is now being vested in the court with regard to the dismissal from custody of an accused. This discretion is not unlimited. In the proviso to the amended subsection (1) of section 87 the interests of the accused are protected in that the person who convened that court martial controls the acts of the court martial.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to clause 22. Except for the particular circumstances in which an offence under section 19 (1) is committed, the basic punishable act contained therein, is the same as that contained in section 19 (2), i.e. disobeying any lawful command of a superior. Because of this affinity between the two subsections, a court has the jurisdiction to convict an offender, charged with an offence under section 19 (1), of an offence under section 19 (2) as an alternative.</p>

<p>In the case of clause 23 we have the position that in the case of an offender who repeatedly commits offences, any sentence of imprisonment which has been suspended will be applicable and will have a very beneficial effect. Other than in the case of detention a sentence of imprisonment is accompanied by either cashiering or discharge with ignominy from the South African Defence Force. Consequently the services of an offender in the South African Defence Force can only be retained if the whole of the sentence of imprisonment is suspended and not only a portion of such a sentence, in which case his services will be terminated summarily on account of the automatic sentence. As regards subsection (2) of section 94, a confirming or reviewing authority is now also being empowered to suspend a portion of the sentence of detention and not only the whole or the unexpired portion thereof. Subsection (3) provided that the authority having power to confirm the findings and sentences of general courts martial, might at any time during the currency of any sentence of imprisonment, order the operation of the unexpired portion of the sentence to be suspended. By the deletion of subsection (3), such power is now being vested, in terms of the provisions of section 117, in the General Officer Commanding, South African Defence Force, only. The amendment to subsection 4 is necessary because of the deletion of subsection (3).</p>

<p>I now come to clause 24. The same consideration which applies in respect of clauses 13 and 14, as far as the accelerated procedure in respect of the revision of the proceedings before a trial officer is concerned, now also applies to the proceedings before courts martial, i.e. the ordinary court martial envisaged in this clause, and the general court martial envisaged in clause 25.</p>

<p>The amendment contained in clause 25 once again is a purely consequential one.</p>

<p>As regards clause 26, in accordance with the amended procedure for accelerating the revision of proceedings, and in order to be able to give effect to that procedure, section 111 is being amended so as to enable the offender to send his representations directly to the reviewing authority, to whom the court in the first place now also has to submit without delay the minutes of the proceedings of the trial.</p>

<p>The insertion of paragraph (b) in clause 27 intensifies control. The finding and sentence of an ordinary court martial are not implemented unless and until they have been confirmed by the officer who convened that court martial, which officer has the power to nullify the conviction and to set aside the sentence. Yet this discretion is not an arbitrary one and ought to be exercised judicially. Therefore it is merely to be able to determine whether these requirements have been met in cases where the finding or any of the findings of the court martial have not been confirmed, that the General Officer Commanding, South African Defence Force, is being given the power in aforementioned paragraph to ask for reasons why the confirming authority has refused to do so.</p>

<p>As regards clause 28, the position is as follows. As not only a civil court, but also a military court has the power to impose a sentence of imprisonment in appropriate cases, the amendment is merely indicative, i.e. only a sentence of imprisonment imposed by a military court may be served in a detention barracks. The person who may order the offender to serve the sentence in a detention barracks, <span class="col_4821-4822" refersTo="page_0898"/>is now being designated, i.e. the Adjutant General.</p>

<p>The sole object of clause 29 is to improve obscure terminology.</p>

<p>Clauses 30, 31, 32 and 33 are consequential of nature.</p>

<p>As regards clause 34, as far as paragraphs (a), (c), (e) and (f) are concerned, the amendments are merely being effected for the sake of completeness, as it may be argued that a distinction, although slight, can nevertheless be drawn between arrest and custody. Taking into consideration the provisions of sections 91 and 93, paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 128 is incorrect. Cashiering which can be imposed only in the case of an officer, is not accompanied by a sentence of detention, which sentence is not a competent sentence in the case of an officer. As a sentence of detention can be accompanied only by a sentence of ordinary discharge, the amendments are necessarily consequential. Field punishment is an isolated sentence and is not accompanied by other sentences. Apart from the amendments in paragraph (d) which make provision for various eventualities and effect on improvement in the grammar of the Afrikaans version, there is the insertion of the important proviso to make provision for those cases where the trials have been completed but the offenders intend appealing against their conviction or applying for the revision of the proceedings of their cases. In such a case the Adjutant General will have the power to order that the offender shall not return to his duties during the period concerned. As regards paragraph (e) of this clause, the sequence of words is being changed purely on account of the amendment in paragraph (b). In addition subsection (4) of section 128 is being amended in such a way by paragraph (g) as to allow of the designation of the authorities that will have to determine whether an offender has been charged before the court within a reasonable period.</p>

<p>As regards clause 35, membership of the Citizen Force, Commandos, or the Reserve is not sufficient to cause the members thereof to fall under the provisions of the Military Discipline Code, nor, consequently, under a military court. There is a second prerequisite, i.e. training, duty or service in terms of the Defence Act. As a military court does not have jurisdiction in respect of these members at all times, or, if it does have jurisdiction, is limited with regard to the sentences it may impose, it does happen at times, particularly towards the end of the training period of such a member, that he commits an offence and is then summoned, with the approval of the Adjutant General, to appear before a civil court, very often also for an offence in the case of which the action led to the loss of or damage to Government property. If he were summoned to appear before a civil court for such an offence, the civil court would not have the jurisdiction on the conviction of the accused to order the damage to the State to be recovered from him. These amendments are now making provision for this as well.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a) of clause 36 merely gives the correct version of the particular section to which reference is made. The amendment in paragraph (b) seeks to remove, because of practical considerations, the necessity for a witness to appear in person in a court merely for the sake of giving a piece of formal evidence.</p>

<p>The amendments contained in clause 37 are, in the first place, consequential because of the definition of &#x201C;institution&#x201D; contained in section 1 of the First Schedule and, in the second place, they are being effected for the sake of completeness as far as the presence of interpreters and shorthand-writers at boards of inquiry is concerned.</p>

<p>Clause 38 contains consequential amendments in paragraphs (a), (c) and (e). The amendments in paragraphs (b) and (d) of the relevant subsections of section 140 are merely procedural of nature, and are being effected for the sake of completeness in pursuance of the provisions contained in subsection (1) of that section.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 39. The substitution of &#x201C;during service&#x201D; for &#x201C;in time of war&#x201D; seeks to extend the provision. In paragraph (xxvi) of subsection (1) of section 1 &#x201C;service&#x201D; is defined as &#x201C;service in defence of the Republic or in the prevention or suppression of internal disorder in the Republic&#x201D;. This, from the nature of the case, includes war. Hence this term is preferred.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 40. In order to alleviate the administrative burden which rests on the General Officer Commanding, South African Defence Force, he is being empowered in paragraph (a) to delegate the power of appointing a chief disciplinary officer and assistant disciplinary officers. In paragraph (b) the powers of the chief disciplinary officer and the assistant disciplinary officers are being restricted, in the first place, in that they may only arrest persons subject to the Code, and extended, in the second place, in that they may arrest such persons not only for an offence under the Code but also for any other offence. As section 52 (2) clearly specifies that an officer may only be arrested by another officer, and as assistant disciplinary officers need not necessarily be officers, the further amendments to subsection (2) of section 147 are required for the sake of being consequential.</p>

<p>Apart from making an improvement in subsection (2) of section 151 of the Afrikaans version, the amendment contained in clause 41 now specifies who may remove any person who is not subject to military law from the precincts of a military court on the order of the court and take such a person into custody.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is an extremely difficult and highly technical amending schedule, and for that reason I arranged, as I said at the outset, for hon. members who are usually interested in defence to discuss these matters <span class="col_4823-4824" refersTo="page_0899"/>in detail with a legal officer so that they need not participate in this debate without being prepared. I am pleased that hon. members made use of this arrangement. These proposals are generally accepted by the people who have to maintain discipline and have to implement the Code, and consequently I hope that this House will pass these proposals so as to enable them to do so on an improved basis.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>First of all I should like to express our appreciation towards the Minister for the arrangements he made to enable us to discuss these amendments with the responsible officials. Actions of this kind by a Minister make it very much easier for Parliament to function in a smoother and more effective way. The hon. the Minister is aware, although he did not mention it, that the schedule before us now is a different one to that originally laid before the House on the 5th February. During our discussions numerous points on which we were unhappy were discussed and agreement reached on amendments. Thus, in the schedule now before us clauses 2, 21, 23, 37 and 41 are amended clauses. If we had not had these discussions we would have had to discuss all these matters in this House. But we were able to iron out our differences by discussion and negotiation. We welcome these changes, particularly those designed to expedite review. We accept others which are necessary for the smoother operation of military discipline and the carrying out of the Military Discipline Code. Consequently, it is not my intention to deal in any detail with those clauses upon which we are agreed. But there are, unfortunately, two points, one in particular, on which we could not reach agreement because these contain matters of principle and of policy about which it was not possible for an official to express an opinion or to make concessions. Therefore it is necessary to bring them to the House before the hon. the Minister who is the only person qualified to make such amendments will be able to deal with them.</p>

<p>I would like first, however, to refer briefly to some of the original differences of opinion, because I think it is important that there should be no misunderstanding. I refer to clause 2 which places the onus of proof of responsibility for military property upon a person who is in charge of such stock or money. We were unhappy about this, because we have always been unhappy about placing an onus of guilt upon a person before he has been tried. We have always believed that a person is innocent until he is tried. I mention this because the clause, as it stands, now has the addition of the words &#x201C;unless a reasonable and satisfactory explanation to the contrary is given&#x201D;, which we believe removes that problem and which therefore makes this clause acceptable to us. I mention this, because I want to say that in principle we are still opposed to any person being presumed guilty before he has been tried. However, we feel that in this case the mere responsibility for stock or money can be an onus upon the person responsible. The addition of this proviso regarding &#x201C;a reasonable and satisfactory explanation&#x201D; makes it acceptable to us, and we believe, acceptable as an amendment of our Military Discipline Code.</p>

<p>It is in clause 5. however, that we strike our real problem. Clause 5 amends the famous section 40&#x2014;now section 46&#x2014;which dealt with &#x201C;an act or omission to the prejudice of good order and military discipline&#x201D;. I do not think any commanding officer has ever had a bigger favourite in the M.D.C. than this clause. Whenever he did not know with what to charge anyone. then it was the good old &#x201C;prejudice to good order and military discipline&#x201D;. I think this is the most popular clause that has ever been used by any commanding officer. Because of our experience in this and because we know how this clause can be used when a specific offence cannot be pinpointed, we looked at it with considerable care. We recognize that it is necessary to have such a broad omnibus clause, because one cannot always pinpoint an offence under any of the other specific sections. However, the amendment now proposed broadens a provision which has been in operation for many, many years; a provision which has stood the test of time, of world wars, of internal troubles and of both peacetime and wartime operations. It is a clause which has over the years been one of the cornerstones of military discipline. It is now suggested that this clause should be expanded from an omission causing prejudice to good order and military discipline to read, &#x201C;causes actual or potential prejudice to good order and military discipline&#x201D;. We have difficulty with the word &#x201C;potential&#x201D;. As I have said, the clause as it stood, has stood the test of time. Now we will have to determine what is the &#x201C;potential prejudice&#x201D;. That term is so wide and gives such power, that we do not believe that we can or that we should support it in this House. Who is the hon. the Minister or this House, but much more so. who is an inexperienced person with the authority to use and apply the Military Discipline Code to decide what is potential prejudice&#x003F; One may say that because a person has red hair he is creating potential prejudice. because he may have a short temper and that may lead to difficulties. I am perhaps giving a ridiculous example. However, it may be said it is a potential prejudice when, let us say, a short-tempered man who is known as a trouble-maker uses words which in another man would not create trouble. It is then a potential prejudice to good order, because it happens in certain circumstances, or because it is a certain person who is committing a certain act. We do not believe that this can be defined to the satisfactory protection of any person tried under the M.D.C. How does the Minister define it; how does the Department define &#x201C;potential prejudice&#x201D;&#x003F; Anything could be potential prejudice. An act which is perfectly legal could, because of a subsequent event, become <span class="col_4825-4826" refersTo="page_0900"/>an act of potential prejudice to good order. Because of something that happened after the act was committed&#x2014;because of a change of circumstances&#x2014;a person could be punished for what was adjudged to be potential prejudice. We wish to move the deletion of that particular extension of this definition. At this stage I therefore move, as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After &#x201C;Act&#x201D; in the third line, to insert &#x201C;subject to the deletion of Clause Five&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That will leave section 46 as it is. We believe that that is wide enough and broad enough to provide all the control that is necessary. I feel that the hon. the Minister has made out no case in this House for the extension of that definition. He has not given us adequate reason other than that it widens the scope. He has not explained to us why this should be necessary, but above all, I believe he has not explained to us how this word &#x201C;potential&#x201D; can and will be interpreted in practice in regard to the activities of persons tried under this section.</p>

<p>Sir, we also had and to a certain extent still have some difficulty with clause 11, where again we get the principle of extension, in this case an extension of punishment from 28 to 40 days. There is an increase in fines from &#x00A3;10 to R40&#x2014;a doubling of the fine. While we recognize that money may have lost its value and that we may have to increase the amount of a fine, there are still 365 days in the year, and we do not feel that time has devalued or depreciated and that we can therefore happily agree to the extension of 28 days to 40 days as the punishment which a commanding officer can apply. Sir, these people are not trained judicial officers. They are not people who have taken courses in military law. They are often and can be junior officers in charge of a detachment. I myself as a second lieutenant have used these powers up to 28 days, and the position is that any junior officer has the power to apply the punishments provided for here. Although we are not moving an amendment at this stage, we would like a greater justification from the hon. the Minister for extending this power to an individual to sentence a man to up to 40 days instead of 28 days. We accept that there is an automatic review but, although the hon. the Minister did not mention this, it is also the intention to increase under the rules the period of sentence after which the conviction will be automatically reviewed. In other words, the automatic review will now only apply to a more severe sentence than was the case formerly. So admittedly the sentences over 28 days will go for automatic review, but it means that in the case of lesser sentences, the evidence will not be recorded, and they will not go for such review. We feel that we would like more explanation in regard to that clause.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 21, the hon. the Minister met us in regard to a proviso which makes it possible for us to accept a provision which originally was unacceptable to us. The position was that where a court martial was adjourned for more than 14 days, the accused was automatically released. The original proposed amendment meant that he could be detained without conditions. The proviso now adds that it shall be reported to the convening officer. That is an improvement and whilst it is perhaps not the final answer, we recognize that there are circumstances which may make this necessary and therefore we are prepared to accept it. Similarly, in respect of clause 41 there was an amendment suggested by us which makes this clause acceptable to us.</p>

<p>So in conclusion I would say that we welcome the improvements and we support the necessary amendments, but we cannot give our unqualified support to the extension of the provision relating to conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline to include undefined, vague and potential offences which neither we nor, we believe, the Defence Force will be able adequately to define and adequately to apply in practice. I therefore move the deletion of that clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to avail myself of this opportunity, first of all, to thank the hon. the Minister very sincerely for the cooperation he showed by placing one of his legal officers at the disposal of members on this side so that they might discuss their problems with him. I am therefore associating myself with the previous hon. member who expressed his gratitude in this connection. It saved a lot of time and also afforded us an opportunity of having fruitful discussions. As the hon. member has just said, amendments were moved to several of these clauses by the other side of the House as well as by this side of the House. Those amendments were discussed with this officer who had been placed at our disposal, and the document which has now been presented to this House is in this form following on the decision of the hon, the Minister not to have various amendments moved. It is also saving a lot of time in the debate to-day and we thank the Minister for that.</p>

<p>But the hon. member who proceeded me disputed two points. Before I come to that I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the provisions of clause 2. I want to ask him whether, at a later stage in the Other Place, he does not want to consider the introduction of an amendment in respect of the wording of clause 2. This has a bearing particularly on the portion which reads &#x201C;it shall be presumed, unless a reasonable and satisfactory explanation to the contrary is given by the accused, that he so negligently performed his duties that the said deficiency was caused&#x201D;. What this clause amounts to is that if the State has proved certain aspects it need not prove anything else; the onus of proof then rests with the accused to prove the contrary. One does not like presumptions very much, but they form part of our administration of justice and of our law of evidence in criminal cases. But here we are faced with the problem, in my opinion, that if both <span class="col_4827-4828" refersTo="page_0901"/>words, &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; and &#x201C;satisfactory&#x201D; are used, they may confuse the presiding officer. They may confuse the man who must give a ruling about this clause because in our legal system it is very clear what is required if the words &#x201C;reasonable explanation&#x201D; are used on their own, or the words &#x201C;satisfactory explanation&#x201D;. Throughout the years a particularly great deal of authority has been built up in our law in connection with the interpretation of these two explanations. The Appeal Court has given us direction in this regard. What it amounts to in brief is, that in the case of an explanation of this nature the position used to be that the courts took the view that an accused could satisfy any onus of rebuttal rest ing upon him in terms of a statute, by proof on a balance of probabilities. In later years this decision was taken further and it was laid down that an accused could acquit himself of any onus of rebuttal, and not merely of a statutory onus of rebuttal, by proof of the balance of probabilities. The following is a matter that I am concerned about that this is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give attention to it again. If this new subsection (2) of section 26 of the Schedule were to come before this trial officer, whether a trained or untrained person, he is faced with the problem of two words, i.e. &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; and &#x201C;satisfactory&#x201D;. He must ask himself whether these two words are synonymous. He already knows what interpretation is given to a &#x201C;reasonable explanation&#x201D; or to a &#x201C;satisfactory explanation&#x201D;. However, now both are mentioned and he is faced with the question of interpretation. Are they synonymous&#x003F; If not, what is meant by them&#x003F; Is a heavier onus of proof being placed on the accused or not&#x003F; These words can create all manner of problems, especially for an uninitiated person, and for one who is not trained in law. These can be presiding officers, as are provided for in this new subsection. If the hon. the Minister would therefore consider it, I can say that the omission of either of the two words would be satisfactory and I should be glad if the hon. the Minister could do so in the Other Place. It would still be sound legislating and the implementation of this clause would give satisfactory results in a court of law in the sense in which it would be used here, and not necessarily as we would understand it in civil courts.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Durban (Point&#x2019;s) objections to these various clauses are concerned, I should like to refer to clause 5. As the hon. member said, section 46 of the Schedule is actually the section which could be used if one were not completely certain what these people bad to be charged with. This section is very popular and is also used a great deal. Certain adjectives are used by the three different services, i.e. the military, police and the prison services, in referring to this section a fact which is well-known. However, this section has also produced problems through the years. Because the article was satisfactory during the First World War, the Second World War and in peacetime, we cannot accept that it will still provide satisfactory results to-day. We live in different circumstances to-day and the Military Discipline Code has also been adapted to make provision for these changed circumstances. I think that everyone agrees that the Defence Force has to operate under very difficult circumstances today. To-day many more of our young men are doing compulsory military service and provision must therefore be made for the Military Discipline Code to make provision for all cases. The present section 46 reads as follows: &#x201C;Any person who by act or omission causes prejudice to good order and military discipline, &#x2026;&#x201D; The interpretation attached to this is that there must be an act or omission which is positive to one side or the other. A mere omission is not always something which can be included under this section and this creates a problem. A mere omission (nalating) is not completely covered by this section.</p>

<p>The term &#x201C;omission&#x201D; (versuim) is used here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to go into this in detail, but also in the case of an omission (versuim) a mere omission (nalating) is not always an offence. I do not want to detain the House any further with technical explanations. and I leave the matter there. It is necessary for this prejudice to be defined, i.e as it is stated in Clause 5 that it should be actual or potential. I do not think that the word &#x201C;actual&#x201D; has created any problems for the hon. member who spoke before me. The definition of the word &#x201C;potential&#x201D; perhaps created problems for the hon. member. The words &#x201C;potential prejudice&#x201D; are not unknown in our legal system. The most familiar aspect of their use is, for example, in the case of the offence of fraud. Through the years many explanations have been given about what is understood by potential prejudice and in this connection I should like to refer the House to what our courts have said in this connection because I then think we shall be clear in our minds about this. I am now referring to the case of <i>Rex v. Muller</i> about which the Transvaal Supreme Court gave a ruling in 1953. In that case the Judge also referred to the judgment in the Eastern Province Division by the then Mr. Justice Kotze in the case of <i>Rex v. Firling.</i> The law report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Discussing potential prejudice the Judge said: The reasonable or well-grounded risk of sustaining a prejudice or loss is considered to amount to an actual prejudice in order to support a change of forgery or fraud. It is not any fanciful, possible or remote risk of prejudice that will suffice.</block>

<p>I think that this is what the hon. member is concerned about. He himself said that he presented the cases he mentioned in a somewhat far-fetched way. He said that those cases were not cases to be taken into account when potential <span class="col_4829-4830" refersTo="page_0902"/>prejudice was to be determined. In addition, the Judge had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be a probable, direct or reasonably certain risk &#x2026; It is clear that the risk of prejudice must not be fanciful or too remote, and it may sometimes not be an easy matter to say whether the prejudice relied upon by the prosecution falls within the category allowed. Whenever, in the opinion</block>

<p>In my opinion this is the most important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of a person of ordinary sense and judgment, that is of a reasonable man, it appears that the risk of prejudice has been caused, by the requirement of the law that some prejudice must be shown in order to support a charge of fraud or falsity, had been satisfied.</block>

<p>In other words, it is that same ordinary, reasonable man, and even the commander who is still young in years, to whom the hon. member referred, whom it is expected should judge as a reasonable, ordinary person whether there was possible prejudice. I think that we may surely accept that even the hon. member for Durban (Point) had those characteristics when he was a second lieutenant, i.e. of being able to give a ruling, as a reasonable person, as to whether or not there was potential prejudice. I should like to credit the hon. member with that; if the hon. member feels that he did not have those characteristics, I am sorry, but I feel that in future we can have the same confidence in our officers. This standpoint, which eliminates concern about the interpretation of a potential prejudice, has also repeatedly been adopted in the Appeal Court. Therefore my standpoint about this matter is that I think that the hon. member is unnecessarily concerned and it is really essential that this section be amended in this way.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) was also concerned about clause 11. This clause amends the jurisdiction which the presiding officer has in certain cases, and the objection was raised that this person could be a junior officer and that the jurisdiction was being increased beyond the limits of necessity in this case. However, there are several safety valves which are applicable in respect of section 62 of the Schedule. In subsection (3) of the same section, provision is made for who the commanding officer should be who may make these rulings. Here already we have the first safety valve. Not any commanding officer or second lieutenant may try the person and sentence him to 40 days&#x2019; imprisonment. It is only that second lieutenant or commanding officer defined in subsection (3) who may sentence a person, i.e. &#x201C;&#x2026; any officer under the command of a convening authority who has been empowered in writing by such convening authority &#x2026;&#x201D; In other words, what it amounts to in ordinary cases is that a commanding officer of a unit, for example, is so empowered by the chief commanding officer. This must be done in writing. If it is not in writing then he has no authority to try a person.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What are you referring to now&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>I am now referring particularly to subsection (2) and (3) of section 62 of the Schedule. For the hon. member&#x2019;s information I should like to quote the subsections concerned. Subsection (2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>A commanding officer may delegate in writing to any officer under his command, all or any of the powers conferred upon him under this section.</p>

<p>In the next subsection the following is provided:</p>

<block name="quote">For the purposes of this section, &#x201C;commanding officer&#x201D; means any officer under the command of a convening authority who has been empowered in writing by such convening authority to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon a commanding officer by that subsection, and includes an officer to whom powers have been delegated under subsection (2).</block>

<p>In other words, the powers to try someone are not given to any irresponsible person. Those powers are only given in writing to a responsible officer in terms of the provisions of this Code. If one takes note of the provisions of section 64 (1), one finds that a commanding officer is subject to review from this convening authority. In other words, there are so many safety valves which are applicable to clause 11 that it is really not necessary to object to it because there has now been an increase in the penal provisions. The amount of &#x00A3;10 may perhaps have been a large amount in the past, but it is no longer so to-day. The amount of R40 is perhaps more in accordance with what the amount of &#x00A3;10 was in the twenties and thirties. These provisions are much more realistic than the old provisions. I am therefore referring to the period of 28 days which has been increased to 40 days. We must take note of the other amendments in the Code whereby a person who pleads guilty can be given a heavier sentence; and also that in order to impose a heavier sentence a court martial must be convened. The constitution of a court martial is a technical matter which takes time and in which more than one officer is involved, <i>inter alia,</i> in a presiding capacity, and where they must comply with certain qualifications. The summoning of the court martial is a lengthy process. In order to make provision for such offences and sentences, which may be regarded as less serious, it is surely not necessary to set all this State machinery in motion for the composition of a court martial. Therefore I think that the hon. member on the other side of the House should ask himself <span class="col_4831-4832" refersTo="page_0903"/>whether it is really necessary to object to clause 11. I do not want to comment on any of the other clauses. I want to associate myself with what was said here by the hon. member for Durban (Point), who said that what the hon. the Minister had presented to this House in this instance was really good and major improvements which could only contribute to the easier and less cumbersome operation of the Military Code of Discipline.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Potchefstroom thanked the hon. Minister effusively for the amendments which have been proposed here. He did, however, have some criticism to offer against several of these clauses. On clause 2 the hon. member said that he objected to the use of the term &#x201C;a reasonable and satisfactory explanation&#x201D;, because this might be a subject which can cause some confusion. The hon. member for Durban (Point) made the point that as this clause existed before the negotiations with this side of the House and the amendments which were made, it was much more onerous.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_grange">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>I proposed the amendment myself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member proposed the original amendment, I must remind him that the amendment said that there was a presumption that if any stores were missing the person in charge was negligent in the performance of his duty unless the contrary was proved. Now, there is a big difference between having to prove to the contrary and having to give a reasonable and satisfactory explanation to the contrary. We all know in cases where there are deficiencies, especially in Government departments, Railways, the Defence Force and so on, but in private concerns as well, where there are certain rules and regulations laid down, where certain people have responsibilities, that where something is missing, if anyone is ever charged with fraud or theft, all one has to prove is that there is some other means or source of outlet of the store. The person charged is inevitably acquitted. In principle there is nothing wrong with this provision, provided it does not go too far. In principle it provides that there shall be a presumption that the person in charge of the store is responsible for negligence. His negligence, not theft, caused that deficiency, unless the contrary be proved. This is as it was. Now it says that he shall give a reasonable and satisfactory explanation, which is less onerous and, I think, far more equitable in the circumstances. Although he is in charge, he carries the legal responsibility, without being, in fact, responsible for that loss. It might be impossible for him to prove the contrary, but it would be possible for him in terms of the new proposal which is before us to-day, to give a reasonable and satisfactory explanation. I hope the hon. the Minister will keep that provision as he has presented it to us.</p>

<p>So far as clause 5 is concerned, the hon. member for Potchefstroom says that he cannot accept that because the situation has existed during two world wars and operated satisfactorily, it should remain the same now. The circumstances, he said, were quite different now. It is very difficult to appreciate quite what the difference is. The principle involved is that one is going to punish a man for his conduct, in which the mental attitude of that man is a most important element, the mental approach for which he is responsible and for which one is going to punish him. The hon. member dealt with the case of <i>Rex v. Muller,</i> I think it was, which concerned a forgery. The Judge said that the remote risk of prejudice would suffice in that case, in a conviction for fraud or forgery. He went on to quote the learned Judge as saying that it was a &#x201C;probable, direct or reasonable risk&#x201D;. It must not be too remote. He further quoted the learned Judge as saying that &#x201C;it is a difficult matter to decide&#x201D;. Indeed, this is perhaps the nub of the whole matter. It is a difficult matter to decide for a Judge, despite all his years of learning, training and experience. It is even difficult for him to decide what is potential prejudice. I want to say to the hon. member that he misses the point altogether. We are not dealing here with a criminal in a fraud or forgery case. One has to prove, first of all, that he had the intention to defraud. Then one has to prove in addition that the act concerned caused prejudice. The Judge was here dealing with the fact that it could be potential prejudice. Once one has proved the intention to defraud, you may only prove potential prejudice resulted. One need not prove actual prejudice resulted. Here we are dealing with a criminal, a person who is charged, not only with having the intention to defraud, but also that there was in fact actual or potential prejudice. These are two quite different matters. In this schedule the man is being charged with having done, in fact, something which will by any act or omission cause actual or potential prejudice. This is a matter of fact. We are dealing here with the soldier who has done something, not with a criminal who has a certain intention. We are dealing with a soldier who has done something which, in fact, causes prejudice to good order and military discipline.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) raised the point, in my submission quite rightly, that this introduces an element which is almost impossible for the person accused to bear. He ought to know, as it has been in the past, that it will cause prejudice. As a matter of fact, this is a matter within his knowledge. He ought to know that, whatever he does, it could cause prejudice to good order and military discipline But potential prejudice raises yet another element, puts the matter in another plane. It puts it, without his particular knowledge, within the knowledge of the persons, perhaps, who <span class="col_4833-4834" refersTo="page_0904"/>try him. He does not know necessarily that it could cause potential harm, because there might be aspects of the matter that he is not entitled to know, that his superiors are entitled to and do know. In their judgment it might result in potential prejudice, whereas he did not know that. To put it quite simply, it is a case of whether he might or might not know of certain facts which could cause this act of his to cause potential harm.</p>

<p>I think it has the other difficulty that, if one talks about potential prejudice, one is talking about something which is really a matter of opinion. It might or it might not. It is potential. One cannot say that it will cause prejudice, but one can say that it might cause prejudice. That is not a matter of fact. To put it in non-legal terms, it is a little &#x201C;airy-fairy&#x201D;. If it, in fact, causes prejudice, the person should be punished if it can be shown that he did cause prejudice.</p>

<p>I want to say that, if the learned Judge in the case quoted by the hon. member for Potchefstroom, felt that this was a difficult matter to decide, then <i>a fortiori</i> it is going to be even more difficult for those persons who are charged with the administration of these matters in our Defence Force to do the same. I think that, if one is going to have a military discipline code, it should be something that is understood by everyone, by the ordinary people who make up our Defence Force. In other words, I think that it should be a code which, when properly applied, in the ordinary way, is a code of which one can say, not only that justice was done, but justice was seen to be done by the ordinary man in the street and not by the lawyer. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will have regard to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (Point), and in the interest of clarity and of an appreciation by the ordinary man in our Defence Force, will accept the amendment which the hon. member has moved.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to agree with what the hon. member for Potchefstroom said in regard to the points he mentioned. I also want to support him in his request to the hon. the Minister to consider whether the words &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; and &#x201C;satisfactory&#x201D; should both be retained in clause 2. As far as the Opposition&#x2019;s argument in regard to clause 5 is concerned, I want to say that the clause as it stands is clear and understandable to me and that I cannot see the objections mentioned by the two hon. members on the Opposition side in this regard.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>We are dealing here with a Schedule to the Defence Act, a Schedule which is popularly known as the Discipline Code, a Code which has been established, on the one hand, to protect the soldier and the members of the Defence Force against the exploitation which one may possibly foresee in an institution such as the Defence Force, where one has higher and lower ranks. The purpose of the Code, on the one hand, is to protect officers and privates. On the other hand it is there to provide the proper discipline which is necessary in a body such as the Defence Force. In view of this one can very well see that, if a situation were to arise where there was intent to prejudice the Defence Force, but where this prejudice was not applied in such a way that it might be interpreted as being real, one might get a conviction on the ground of potential prejudice. I think the important point here&#x2014;a point which has been mentioned time and again&#x2014;is that there is an opportunity for review, and the test is always whether it is reasonable, in this case as well. As far as potential prejudicing is concerned, it is not a matter of the opinion of the presiding trial officer; it is a question of whether he applies his opinion as a reasonable person would apply it. Therefore I can by no means agree with the hon. member for Durban (North) in connection with the technical problems which he mentioned here. This is a trial body with its own particular character and provision has accordingly been made for reviews with their own particular character.</p>

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister told us that there was a need for these amendments and I wholeheartedly agree with him. I think this need has been felt for many years already, and therefore we welcome the amendments which he is introducing here, except for the few amendments to which we objected.</p>

<p>Sir, the last three hon. members who took part in this discussion are all lawyers, and once lawyers come along with technical points and the hon. the Minister told us that this law is highly technical&#x2014;and start discussing the definition of words, then poor laymen such as you and I, and I think the Minister as well, get rather confused after a while. Therefore I am not going to venture into this field; as a layman I just want to ask the hon. the Minister, as far as our objection to clause 2 is concerned, whether he will not consider changing the words &#x201C;reasonable and satisfactory&#x201D; to &#x201C;reasonable or satisfactory&#x201D;. To me as a layman this seems understandable, and I do not think we can argue about it.</p>

<p>As far as clause 5 and the word &#x201C;potential&#x201D; are concerned, I just want to say that I do not like the word &#x201C;potential&#x201D; either. When someone committed an offence and he could not be brought to book, in terms of the Code, we always resorted to the old section 46, as it read up to now. I do not think it is difficult for the layman to understand that confusion may arise under the old section 46. I think it is so wide that it is not necessary to insert the word &#x201C;potential&#x201D; here. I think that the word may very well be left out and the Act still be implemented just as effectively.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to say a few words about clause 10, in which powers are granted to chiefs of staff. In terms of this clause chiefs <span class="col_4835-4836" refersTo="page_0905"/>of staff are allowed to try officers of the rank of major and commandant. In the past, when such officers committed an offence, they had of necessity to be reprimanded unofficially, which was unsatisfactory, or brought before a court-martial. Trial by court-martial is a matter which is regarded in a very serious light in the Defence Force, and one must not bring someone before a court-martial lightly. The procedure is complicated; the trial takes a long time; many people are sometimes taken from their normal work for days, and in addition, whether the accused before the court-martial is found guilty or not, a stigma always attaches to him to a certain extent for having appeared before a court-martial. I think this amendment is a step in the right direction. The persons who are going to try these field officers now are their chiefs of staff; they are men with years of experience; they are men who have a thorough knowledge of human nature, and I think they are extremely well qualified to carry out these duties. If such an officer&#x2019;s chief of staff comes to the decision during the trial that the charge is of such a nature that he cannot try the case, he can always refer the case to a court-martial. I think this is an excellent change and I think that all of us can welcome it very much.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. members for the spirit in which this discussion was conducted. I also want to thank them once again for their cooperation in judging the original document which was laid upon the Table. The hon. member for North Rand quite rightly said that here we were concerned with a whole number of legal men and that in this sphere one had better tread warily once they started arguing. I want to say at once that if there is one hon. member who convinced me that clause 5 should not be amended, that hon. member is the hon. member for Durban (North), not because he argued his case badly, but because he showed me what a lawyer could do if this provision were not to remain as it was. I think the hon. member did not do the hon. member for Durban (Point) a good turn by speaking, because the clause as proposed by the hon. member for Durban (Point) will afford an able lawyer, who can argue as eloquently as the hon. member for Durban North has just done, the very opportunity of allowing a man to go free. I shall furnish a few examples in this connection. But, first of all, I want to begin by saying that although this House has to guard against any injustice, I think that what we are dealing with here here is not the Defence Act but the prescribed Military Discipline Code laid down, which is used daily by the people who have to maintain discipline, we should allow ourselves be guided by them to a certain extent. It has been reported to me that objections have been raised, and I have been satisfied by examples which have been placed at my disposal&#x2014;and I should not like to publish them here&#x2014;that situations arise when potential prejudice does indeed occur.</p>

<p>It may for example happen that an officer in the absence of his superiors and in company of his inferiors or his equals, speaks of his superiors in a way which may have the effect of prejudicing the authority of the superiors. I say this may happen. It may not prejudice him there, because he may be speaking outside of his official duty and then it is not actual prejudice. It may be potential prejudice. In the second place, there is the question of swearing to which hon. members and all of us are opposed. I am not saying that swearing takes place in the Defence Force, but complaints are being lodged continually. The hon. member for Durban (Point) should not hold it against me, but he is one of the members who come to me from time to time with matters against which he says I should guard. We shall take this up on another opportunity. This is intended precisely for handling situations of that kind. There is the question of giving orders in connection with dress. The manner of dress of a man on parade may not prejudice discipline at that moment, but it may hold potential prejudice. We have had examples of such parades which have been held, and with a lawyer like the hon. member for Durban (North), those provisions give a person all the scope in the world. I do not want to give that kind of lawyer all that scope. For that reason I regret that I am unable to concede to their wishes. I think I have been very accommodating to hon. members of the Opposition by negotiating in a reasonable way with them as well about this matter, but now they want to be like Shylock, and have everything. That is why I do not see my way clear to concede to their wishes.</p>

<p>As far as clause 11 is concerned, I think the hon. member for Potchefstroom gave a very adequate reply by referring to sections 62 and 64 of the Military Discipline Code. I think those sections contain all the guarantees and assurances that this will not take place in an irresponsible way. The people who usually conduct that kind of trial in most cases are men who have training in military law but as the hon. member for Potchefstroom pointed out. immediate revision is possible. Consequently it is not as though one is delivering an accused into the hands of an irresponsible person in such a case, because the officer ordering that investigation is surely not irresponsible. The hon. member should not make us use ridiculous examples. Action will be taken with a sense of responsibility; otherwise we will in fact prejudice discipline. I say that with the guarantees contained in sections 62 and 64 I do not think the objections of hon. members hold water.</p>

<p>As regards the point which the hon. member for Potchefstroom made and to which the hon. member for North Rand also referred as regards the words &#x201C;reasonable and satisfactory&#x201D;, this is a matter which I have considered from all angles. I shall only make the promise that I shall consult the law advisers in this regard and if the point which the <span class="col_4837-4838" refersTo="page_0906"/>hon. member for Potchefstroom made, namely that this is not correct in legal terms, is a valid one, I shall try to effect an improvement. The hon. member for North Rand asked whether we should not have &#x201C;reasonable or satisfactory&#x201D;. I shall consider both suggestions. I shall also discuss this matter with the hon. members personally once again, and if I can be convinced that a change has to be effected, I shall do so in the Other Place. But I regret that I am unable to make further concessions in regard to clause 5.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House long on this matter. As you will remember, Sir, we decided to support the Second Reading and also the Committee Stage of this Bill. The Minister now has what he has been seeking for some time. Actually the Minister has wider powers than any previous Minister of Posts and Telegraphs ever had in relation to his own Department, and I trust that these powers will now be used wisely and with immediate effect. There are certain matters to which he can now give his immediate attention. Amongst these will be the alteration of the post structure, and in particular the narrowing of the very wide gap there is at the moment between the few higher posts and the very large number of lower-paid posts in his Department. That is his first task and the second task to which I take it he will give and has already given attention, and will now be able to give even more attention, will be to see that the shortage of technical personnel will be diminished by immediate steps in terms of this new Bill and the new powers we are giving him. I trust that there will soon be good news for the whole of the Post Office staff as the result of this Bill being adopted by the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, the Opposition strongly objected to this Bill at its previous stages. The hon. the Minister met our demands in one respect in the Committee Stage by accepting an amendment we had moved. Unfortunately, this is not enough to satisfy us on this side of the House. The two main principles of the Bill about which we are really concerned, remain unchanged. The S.A.B.C. is being granted the power here to erect broadcasting stations and broadcasting plant within or outside South Africa, although this can only be done with the approval of the Minister. Moreover, the S.A.B.C. is being granted wide powers as regards the expropriation of property. Here, too, the Minister has the final say. In other words, the approval of the Minister is linked with the performance of both these functions. I hope the Minister will give us a broad interpretation of the words &#x201C;with his approval&#x201D;. I want to suggest to him that he should have the annual report of the S.A.B.C. indicate at what places radio stations have been erected. In the second place, I want to express the hope that he will reply to any questions we might put to him in this connection. We have been told that cases may occur where radio stations are erected outside our borders which may affect our foreign policy, and that it will therefore be undesirable to furnish details. I admit that such cases may occur, in which event we shall not be unreasonable in demanding information which may not be divulged. However, I hope the hon. the Minister will furnish us with as much information as he is in a position to do. The same applies in respect of the powers of expropriation which are now being granted the S.A.B.C. We hope we shall be given full information in that regard when we ask for it.</p>

<p>The other provision in this Bill meets with our approval. In terms of this provision the S.A.B.C. is authorized to grant free radio licences on a larger scale. I hope the Minister will use his influence in this respect as well and will see to it that the S.A.B.C. will be more generous and lenient in this regard. For the rest, we are still of the opinion that the powers which the S.A.B.C. is being given here, are too wide, particularly in the case of a corporation of this nature. For this reason we shall vote against the Third Reading of this Bill as well.</p>

<p>I gladly give the hon. member for Orange Grove the assurance that if he asks reasonable questions I shall reply to them. I have done so in the past. Why should I not <span class="col_4839-4840" refersTo="page_0907"/>do so in future as well&#x003F; As far as the granting of licences is concerned, I just want to point out to him that it is not a question of a lack of sympathy here. Sometimes it is a question of funds. On a previous occasion I told the hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) that since we are now going to introduce a new system of collecting radio licence fees, the results of this new system may be such that we shall be able to be more generous as regards the granting of licences either free or at a reduced rate.</p>

<p>For the rest, the fears of the hon. member that wide powers are here being granted to the S.A.B.C. are unfounded. As has been said by the hon. member himself, the S.A.B.C. may only exercise those powers with the approval of the Minister concerned. Of course, I have to account for these things, and for this reason it is obvious that I shall act in a responsible way.</p>

</ol>

<block name="quote">(2) Subsection (1) shall be deemed to have come into operation on the first day of March, 1969.</block>

<p>I should like to inform the House regarding the necessity of including a further amendment to the Marketing Act in this Bill at this stage. The Eastern Transvaal Co-operative Society recently submitted to us a proposed amended maize and kaffircorn scheme on behalf of the producers of buckwheat in a number of magisterial districts on the Transvaal Highveld. This amended scheme, which we are prepared to accept, provides for the introduction of a single channel marketing scheme for buckwheat. The idea is that the Mealie Board will exercise the necessary control because the extent of the buckwheat industry is such that the establishment of a separate control board for this product is not justified at this stage. The amendment of the existing maize and kaffircorn scheme suggested by the co-operative society concerned, does not affect the constitution of the present Mealie Board. When this aspect was tested against the provisions of the Marketing Act, however, doubt arose as to whether buckwheat could be added to the scheme without changing the constitution of the Mealie Board. The matter was discussed with the Government Law Adviser. He is of the opinion that section 28 (3) of the Act, which implies that a product may toe added to a scheme without the constitution of the control board concerned being affected, can never come into operation under the present provisions of the Act. Consequently the constitution of such a control board has to be amended in such circumstances so that the additional interests may also receive representation on the board. In the case in question if means that an additional member representing only the producers of buckwheat has to be appointed to the Mealie Board, or that the existing representation for maize and kaffircorn producers must at the same time represent the producers of buckwheat as well, and that the existing representation for either maize and kaffircorn consumers or merchants or millers or exporters must at the same time represent buckwheat consumers, buckwheat traders, buckwheat millers or buckwheat exporters, as the case may be. Taking into consideration the fact that buckwheat is being included in the maize and kaffircorn scheme on a limited scale, and the undesirability of making over-hasty changes to the constitution of a control board, the Mealie Board is not in favour of administering a scheme for buckwheat if its present constitution will in any way be affected thereby. Since the buckwheat producers insist that buckwheat be placed under control at the earliest possible stage, the only alternative is to amend the Marketing Act in order to provide specifically that the constitution of a control board may be left unchanged when a new product is added to an existing scheme. However, this provision will only be used in special circumstances in future. Since the consideration of and arrangements for the proclamation of the amended scheme had to be proceeded with in the meantime, this amendment, if agreed to, will have to have retrospective effect.</p>

<p>New clause 9 put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 15:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, duly authorized by the hon. member for Albany, I should like to move the amendment standing in his name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 9, after &#x201C;may&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;subject to the provisions of subsection (6), and after consultation with representatives of the persons referred to in the said subsection,&#x201D;; and to add the following subsection at the end of the proposed section 84A:</block>

<block name="quote">(6) Before imposing a levy under subsection (1), the Minister shall, by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> notify his intention so to impose such levy, and invite the producers of the product in respect of which he so proposes to impose a levy, to make such representations to him there-anent as they may think fit.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate we already hinted that we wished to move an amendment on the lines of the one appearing here. We are doing so for the simple reason that we consider it unfair that producers of uncontrolled products, the people who are going to pay this levy, will have no say in regard to the determination of such a levy. Producers of uncontrolled products may realize full well that the levy will be in their own interests. This we already conceded at the <span class="col_4843-4844" refersTo="page_0909"/>Second Reading. Although they realize that it will be in their interests, I think those people will still want a say in the determination of that amount and will want to be able to tell the Minister whether they will be satisfied with it or not. Of course, according to our amendment, the hon. the Minister need not necessarily listen to what those producers say to him. I will deal with this later. These producers will realize, nevertheless, that they had an opportunity to inform the hon. the Minister whether they approved of the levy or not. We are not suggesting that the hon. the Minister will necessarily levy an arbitrary amount in an arbitrary way. As the clause reads as present, he may do so. Furthermore, I think that we on this side of the House recognize that, apart from protecting the producer, the hon. the Minister should also protect himself in this regard. When Ministerial action is based on consultation, it will be so much more effective than when we have the hon. the Minister acting on his own as is provided by clause 15. Neither will this amendment of ours limit the actions of the hon. the Minister unnecessarily. It may be necessary to act in a state of emergency resulting from surplus conditions. But the hon. the Minister will still have the power to act, also when he has consulted those people. In other words, we on this side of the House are not prepared to tie his hands altogether; we still want to give him the power to impose a levy on uncontrolled products, but only on condition that he has duly notified the producers thereof. This, briefly, is the object of this amendment, and I trust that the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment. This amendment is based on realism, it is fair and it takes the producer into consideration. Therefore, we on this side of the House hope that the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment.</p>

<heading>ANIMAL DISEASES AND PARASITES AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am a little concerned about subsection (b). Subsection (b) gives the definition of the word &#x201C;progeny&#x201D;. The question has been raised as to whether this definition is wide enough to cover animal semen and eggs. As I understand it, these are both substances of animal origin. However, it seems doubtful as to whether this definition is wide enough. I wonder whether provision should not be made to make assurance doubly sure, by providing for those items in this definition. I do not propose to move an amendment, for this is a very tricky matter. This matter requires great care on the part of the Minister&#x2019;s legal advisers, as well as his professional people. It is not a matter for laymen, such as myself; I am only a poor farmer from the platteland, and it is not for me to meddle with the legal phraseology which is necessary to put such a matter right. Both these substances are capable of transmitting disease from parent stock to the second and third generation. In subsection (b) the following definition is given&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Progeny&#x201D; in relation to any animal &#x2026;</block>

<p>I am leaving out &#x201C;parasite&#x201D; for the moment.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; means any animal &#x2026; produced by, from or by means of an animal &#x2026;</block>

<p>I think that there may be some doubt in this regard and I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to this matter.</p>

<p>I understand we are not taking the stages of the Bill to-day and there is in any event Another Place where anything which the Minister wishes to put right can be dealt with. I understand that the hon. the Deputy Minister is taking the whole of this Bill in review <span class="col_4845-4846" refersTo="page_0910"/>with the assistance of competent veterinary authorities. It may well he that on reconsideration, this particular clause could he amended. I make this request to the Minister because I want to draw the attention of the people assisting the Minister to this matter. I believe that the Minister might have a difficult time in making a prosecution stick. I am sure he will have the whole Parliament behind him if he feels that it is necessary to make a prosecution stick where he takes action against people who are infringing the provisions of this Bill. If the hon. the Minister could close any gap, I hope he will take the opportunity to have the whole matter reviewed so that it could be put right either here or in the appropriate Other Place.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to assure the hon. member for South Coast that the progeny was precisely the problem we had. We asked the law advisers who drafted the Bill to make sure that there could be no loopholes in this legislation. They said that if we used this wording it would cover the progeny. I am thinking specifically of the smuggling of hen&#x2019;s eggs. During the Second Reading of this Bill&#x2014;I was glad to see we had the support of the hon. members on that side of the House &#x2014;I said we would try to put an end to the smuggling of hen&#x2019;s eggs and roasting chickens. This smuggling enriches only one section, while the other people who are honest do not make any money. Therefore, we intend putting an end to this offence as well. I can assure the hon. member that if we do not close all the possible loopholes in this Bill in this House, we can, in any case, do so in the Senate. However, we agree with him that we should put an end to this practice.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 5 is one of the clauses of this Bill which sets up involved administrative machinery placing a great responsibility not only on the Department but also on a lot of other people. I want to deal for a moment with the provisions of this clause because I am seeking an assurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard thereto.</p>

<p>I want to draw attention to the fact that in subsection (1) (b) of clause 9 the word &#x201C;progeny&#x201D; is again used. This word has been defined and was the subject of my remarks a few minutes ago. It is used throughout the Bill and it is correctly used. Here the Government is attempting to deal with infection which can be transmitted through progeny. It is not only the infected animal itself, nor the parasite but the progeny which is provided for in this Bill. The Good Book tells us that the sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children to the third and fourth generation. In this Bill the hon. the Minister and his Department are trying to do the same thing. They cannot go wrong if they follow that good precept.</p>

<p>In clause 5 it is stated that the Minister &#x201C;may confiscate it or cause it to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, as he may deem fit&#x201D;. What may he confiscate or cause to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of&#x003F; Subsection (1) (b) defines this, namely &#x201C;any animal, parasite or infectious thing which in the opinion of the Minister is the progeny of any animal, parasite or infectious thing which in his opinion was introduced or came into the Republic in contravention of the provisions of this Act or of a law repealed by this Act&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The Minister may confiscate it, cause it to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, as he may deem fit. I submit that this is very wide language indeed. I want to ask the Deputy Minister whether in terms of this it means that he can hold it, clear it of disease and then dispose of it as he sees fit after it has been cleansed itself or through its progeny. If the progeny are cleansed can they also be disposed of without limiting the power of the Minister in any way&#x003F; I ask this because the widest possible language is used in this clause. I want to emphasize that this is most important and I will have to come back to it during the Third Reading. This matter is fundamental. One cannot give powers like this to a Minister unless one is absolutely clear in one&#x2019;s mind as to what must be done. It has been said that I am wanting a tighter Bill than the hon. the Deputy Minister wants. This may be so, but I want this Bill to be watertight.</p>

<p>I therefore want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether this means what it says, namely that the progeny of these infected creatures, whatever it may be, parasites or animals, the Minister may confiscate them and order them to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of. Can these animals be cured&#x003F; When it has been cured of all disease and it is safe to be distributed can it be in fact disposed of in a manner such as the hon. the Minister may deem fit&#x003F; I ask this for the benefit of South Africa and for the benefit of the people who have suffered and who are not culprits in terms of this Act. There are innocent people suffering to-day. Are they going to be left on the sidelines to continue to suffer because they did not participate in an illegal operation in the past, or are the people who acted illegally in the past now to be made to realize that the honest man is in the future going to be put on exactly the same basis with equal opportunities to compete in the markets of South Africa and that they are not going to be prejudiced in any way because they remained honest against the temptation of other people who fell for the temptation and have been acting dishonestly all along. Will the Minister take the powers given to him under this clause to see that these people are given an opportunity of acquiring stock which has been cured by itself or through its progeny <span class="col_4847-4848" refersTo="page_0911"/>of any disease and is available for distribution&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the wording of this clause is correct, namely as the Minister may deem fit. I should like the hon. House to realize that the whole Bill should be viewed in its entirety. Problems are being encountered when steps have to be taken in connection with smuggled goods and when the progeny tests have to be carried out as well. I should like to quote a practical example in this connection. The old Act laid down that the Government should look after the smuggled goods until such time as the court found that such goods were in fact smuggled goods. For example, when one million chickens had been smuggled or had presumably been smuggled into the country, the problem was to find a Department that could feed the chickens and look after them for a period of approximately three months until the court had given its ruling. That is why the Act is now being amended. When one views the Act as a whole, one appreciates that it should be worded the way it reads in this clause. The hon. member for South Coast also wanted to know whether everyone would still share in the cleansed stock or poultry which had been rid of parasites. I cannot tell the hon. member now whether it is possible to say that there are smuggled goods and that those people who have not indulged in smuggling will be able to have a share in the smuggled goods.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Because I do not know what the legal implications of this are. I do not know what the position will be if we were to confiscate smuggled goods and give it to people who did not indulge in smuggling. On the other hand, this seems to me as a human being to be the correct procedure to follow. I think people who had no share in the smuggling should also receive some of the smuggled goods. Discussions in this regard will be held to-morrow and attention will be given to this matter. Amendments may possibly be effected in the Other Place. I should not like to commit the hon. the Minister at this stage by saying that everyone will be able to share in smuggled goods which may have been recovered. Practically this seems to be a solution that people who did not make money in the past will then be able to do so. However, I do not want to commit the hon. the Minister by giving a reply at this stage. The hon. member must be fair as this matter is still going to be discussed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not propose to pursue this matter too far, but I want to say that it seems to me that the hon. the Deputy Minister has placed his finger on the sore spot. Illegal transactions, detrimentally affect the agricultural and live-stock industry in South Africa to an extent running into tens of thousands of rand of loss with a possibility of a national disaster overtaking one section of our livestock industry. There are people who are deliberately courting a national disaster for profit. They will now be apprehended in terms of this Bill. I want that there should be no doubt about this and that is why I want the definition in clause 1 to be reviewed. We cannot afford those people who, because they have the money and command the resources, can obtain the services of the finest legal brains to defend them if they are apprehended. We do not want this. We want to know that we have a cast-iron case against them. We are now making the law and we want the law to be able to clap its hands on them without any shadow of doubt when the time comes. This is only the first step. These people have been threatening our livestock industry and are costing the Government and the taxpayers of South Africa, let alone all those who are participating, a lot of money. There are breeders of livestock who have been running this terrible risk of contamination. They have suffered terrific losses, let alone the loss they may suffer in markets. Now the Minister steps in, as provided for in this Bill, and takes these animals in order to cure them through their progeny. This will then be clean stock. Why should the people who have been threatening our security be placed in the privileged position when the stock is free of disease, to claim that the Minister should hand it back to them&#x003F; They will then be able to exercise the monopoly in South Africa again. The people who have been honest and abided by the law, who have assisted the Government all the way through and who are suffering economically have no gains to set off against possible losses. Indeed, they have been losing their businesses. I want the Minister to say categorically, &#x201C;We are not going to leave the honest man to suffer hereafter when we have cured these flocks of the disease with which they are infested at the present time&#x201D;. When that flock is cured it will be cured by the State of South Africa; our Government will take all the necessary steps to see that they are cured, and when through the progeny that disease is wiped out, the infection is ended and there is disease-free stock, then I suggest that the Minister under this clause should have the right to say: &#x201C;The people who have been honest and have played the game are not going to be placed in a worse position than those who offended and who have been breaking the law, to their own personal advantage, for some years past&#x201D;. I think that would be most unfair and a very bad example to set. Let us play the game by the honest man and let us also see that the evil-doer, whoever he may be, who has been breaking the law and has been making profits in the past, is placed in no privileged position over the honest man.</p>

<p>We agree with the hon. member who spoke a moment ago and <span class="col_4849-4850" refersTo="page_0912"/>who said that it is important that people who acquire things illegally, should not he allowed to benefit by it, but I do not think it is fail to expect the hon. the Minister to say at this stage what is going to happen with the animals. This is laid down in clause 2, line 33&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Minister may confiscate such animal, parasite, infectious thing or progeny or cause it to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, as he may deem fit.</block>

<p>To me this is adequate proof that the Minister may, according to circumstances, decide what should be done with such confiscated or infected animals after they have been cleansed of parasites or some infectious disease. I think we should accept that the hon. the Ministai has the power to do this, and I do not think it is fair to ask the Minister at this stage in which way he is going to exercise that power. I think we should leave the matter at that. The Minister has that power, and we accept that he will not allow the people who bring animals into the country illegally, to derive all the benefits. For example, the Minister may put these animals up for sale at a public auction. I do not think he can merely give these animals to somebody, but he has the power to dispose of those confiscated things as he may deem fit. I think we should leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, I must say to the hon. member for Karas that subsection (3) does not apply. If he reads subsection (3) carefully he will see that it deals with the case of the holder of a permit, under subsection (1) (c) who has infected stock, and now he has to pay. It is only if he refuses to pay that the Minister can step in. If the hon. member will read subsection (3) carefully he will see that it only deals with the prescribed fees payable in respect of the feeding, watering and tending of such animal, parasite or infectious thing or the progeny of such animal, and if he refuses or fails to do so, then the Minister may confiscate such animal, parasite, infectious thing or progeny. I am quite satisfied that we have the crux of the matter in this particular clause.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>With the implementation of the Medical Schemes Act, No. 72 of 1967, certain practical problems arose which threatened to disturb the sound relationship existing between the providers of services, i.e. the doctors and dentists on the one hand and medical schemes on the other hand. The most important of these, according to the Medical Association, are that the tariff of fees for medical treatment as laid down in terms of the Act is unrealistic, and that the prescribed arbitration procedure for the amendment of the tariff is too costly and too cumbersome. As a result of this many doctors exercised their right under the provisions of the Act to give three months&#x2019; notice of opting out of the tariff of fees. This action on the part of the doctors to a large extent undermined one of the most important principles on which medical schemes are based, i.e. the provision of medical services to members of schemes and their dependants at reduced rates by way of compensation for guaranteed payment of the accounts concerned. In an attempt to remove the aforementioned as well as certain other points of difference as far as possible, I convened a conference under my chairmanship at which all interested parties were represented. i.e. the Medical Association, the Dental Association, the National Association of Medical Benefit Schemes, the National Association of Medical Aid Schemes, the Central Council for Medical Schemes and the Department of Health. These discussions took place in Pretoria last year, and I just want to tell <span class="col_4851-4852" refersTo="page_0913"/>hon. members that they lasted no less than four days. The conference also considered the advisability of effecting certain amendments of an administrative nature which experience with the implementation of the Act had shown to be necessary.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, I want to express my thanks to all the bodies and persons that participated in the conference for the objective way in which they undertook their task. I cannot speak with enough praise of the approach of everyone that attended that conference and their efforts to make the conference a success, and in any event to bring about better understanding among the interested parties. The good spirit that prevailed there also contributed considerably to the success of the conference. In this connection it was very noticeable that the interests of the patient, for whose benefit the Act had been passed by Parliament in 1967, were always kept prominently in mind by all those present, and for that I am very grateful to them.</p>

<p>With one single exception, in respect of which I shall inform the House later on, this Bill gives effect to the decisions of the conference. The principles of the Bill may be classified under two heads, i.e. firstly, those dealing with the tariff of fees and related matters, and secondly, matters of a general nature.</p>

<p>As regards the question of the tariff of fees, the present position is that where no agreement is reached between the Medical Association and the National Association of Medical Aid Schemes on the amendment of the tariff, if such amendment is deemed necessary by either of those parties, the matter has to be referred for arbitration to two arbiters and one referee for decision. As the implementation of the prescribed procedure in this regard is cumbersome and costly, provision is being made in the Bill to replace it by a simpler but more satisfactory system, according to the opinion of the interested parties.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment concerned envisages the appointment by the Minister of a body known as the Remuneration Commission. The members of this Commission consist of a Judge of the Supreme Court as chairman, a medical practitioner appointed by the Minister from a list of names submitted by the Medical Association for this purpose, or, if dental fees are concerned, a dentist appointed by the Minister from a list of names submitted by the Dental Association for this purpose, and a person appointed by the Minister from a list of names submitted to him by the National Association of Medical Aid Schemes.</p>

<p>Initially, at the discussions in Pretoria, the four parties attending the conference decided unanimously that the Remuneration Commission should consist of four members. The Medical Association has since raised certain objections, and it has become clear to me, also from representations from other quarters, that it would be better and more appropriate to have only three members on the Commission, which is what I am now proposing. I may just indicate that the proposal that there should be four members emanated from me alone at the conference, that there was no lengthy discussion and that I hope that the proposal I am now making here, i.e. that there should be three members, will be acceptable to all parties. However, I shall be prepared to listen to arguments that may be advanced by hon. members, if any hon. member should feel that four members would make out a more balanced commission than a commission consisting of three members as is now being proposed here.</p>

<p>The commission, whose exclusive function will be to examine the tariff of fees every two years and to notify the Minister within three months of amendments to the tariff, if any, will not be a permanent body, but will be appointed by the Minister every two years, or at more frequent intervals, if necessary. The Minister is only obliged to do this at least every two years. Within a month after the submission to the Minister of the decisions of the commission he is obliged to amend the tariff of fees accordingly by way of publication in the <i>Government Gazette.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am convinced that this Remuneration Commission, the appointment of which is provided for in clause 12 of the Bill, will provide the solution in order to eliminate the constant dispute about fees and the lengthy processes that had to be followed previously. I want to add that this proposal was made and that this, in my opinion, wise decision which is now being incorporated in the legislation was taken with a view, <i>inter alia,</i> to raising the status of the medical profession in the eyes of the public in general, because by doing so the opportunity is being created for negotiations, as conducted by trade unions in regard to tariffs and remuneration, no longer to take place between doctor and employer, but for the tariff of fees to be determined in this way. I also just want to point out that the intention is that the Remuneration Commission will meet in private and hear submissions by the various parties provided for, or which the Commission may deem advisable to ask to appear before them.</p>

<p>Concomitant amendments or amendments closely connected with this matter or arising from the implementation of the tariff of fees, are the amendments in respect of certain of the definitions for which provision is made in clause 1, and the amendments contained in clauses 6 and 11.</p>

<p>As regards the definitions, the position is briefly as follows: Firstly, the amendment of the definition of &#x201C;tariff of fees&#x201D; by the deletion of the reference therein to the preferential tariff. This amendment is necessary as the preferential tariff is no longer applicable as before. Secondly, the insertion of a definition of &#x201C;Commission&#x201D;. This has become necessary as a result of the establishment of the Remuneration Commission provided for in clause 12.</p>

<p><span class="col_4853-4854" refersTo="page_0914"/>Thirdly, the amendment of the definition of &#x201C;medical aid scheme&#x201D; by the deletion of the reference therein to the tariff of fees. This amendment is necessary because certain schemes have made provision in their rules for their own tariff of fees, and consequently cannot be classified as medical schemes.</p>

<p>Under the existing section 30 of the Act, which lays down the present procedure for the amendment of the tariff of fees, the establishment of statutory bodies, i.e. the National Association of Medical Aid Schemes and the National Association of Medical Benefit Schemes, was necessary in order to give effect to the system prescribed in respect of the amendment of the tariff. With the establishment of a Remuneration Commission, as is being proposed here, the necessity for the existence of statutory national associations of the aforementioned nature falls away. Consequently provision for the abolition thereof has been made in clause 6. Nevertheless the continuation of such national bodies is highly desirable, but then on a completely voluntary basis in order to co-ordinate and protect the interests of medical schemes, just as the Medical Association, for example, is a voluntary association to co-ordinate and protect the interests of doctors.</p>

<p>The last of the proposed amendments in connection with the tariff of fees is that provided for in clause 11. Experience in connection with the implementation of the Act has shown that these amendments in respect of matters concerning doctors (practising outside the tariff of fees are extremely necessary, for the following reasons. I shall only mention a few. In the first place, as many benefit schemes also offer benefits according to the tariff of fees in respect of specialist services, it is desirable that the section concerned should be made applicable not only to aid schemes, but to all medical schemes. In the second place, for administrative reasons and in order to promote efficiency, it is deemed desirable that notices of doctors and dentists operating outside the tariff of fees should take effect on the first day of the month. This is merely to facilitate the administration thereof. A third reason I want to mention is that where, as at present, it is deemed necessary to give three months notice to practise outside the tariff of fees, it is also deemed logical that three months notice should be given when doctors or dentists want to practise within the tariff again, in order to afford the Central Council for Medical Schemes and the schemes themselves sufficient time to make the necessary adjustments.</p>

<p>The fourth amendment in this connection relates to partnerships. This amendment is necessary only to make it clear that notices under this section are binding for all members of a partnership. In the past it has always been accepted in this way by the Medical Association and by schemes, but as doubt may arise it is better to make it clear. This is also the way it should be, otherwise endless problems will arise, for example where a partner who operates outside the tariff of fees must act for his colleague who operates under the tariff of fees. I do not think it is necessary for me to argue this any further. It virtually goes without saying that all the medical practitioners in any one partnership must adopt either the one or the other course in regard to the tariff of fees.</p>

<p>The last amendment in regard to this matter is to prohibit schemes from circulating the names of medical practitioners and dentists practising outside the tariff of fees to their members, because circulation thereof only affects such medical practitioners detrimentally and serves no useful purpose. I think it is an important matter that we are covering here and one that has caused many problems during the past few months. I may add that the inclusion of this in the Act has met with general approval among the schemes as well.</p>

<p>That, then, disposes of the matters concerning the tariff of fees, and I now come to those provisions of the Bill which are designed to eliminate certain anomalies that have come to light, or to effect certain other amendments of an administrative nature which experience in regard to the implementation of the Act has shown to be advisable.</p>

<p>The first of these amendments is the one provided for in clause 2. It affects those schemes which have been exempted under section 2 of the Act, i.e. the Railway Sick Fund, the medical schemes established by the Departments of Police, Defence and Prisons, respectively, and schemes established under the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act, No. 28 of 1958. The position in the aforementioned connection is that section 38 of the Medical Schemes Act provides that no person may belong to two registered medical schemes and that no scheme may enter a dependent of a member as a member of a scheme. As the aforementioned group of schemes are exempted in terms of section 2 of the Act from the provisions of the Act, including the registration provisions thereof, the said section 38 cannot be implemented in sufficient measure. That is in regard to what I mentioned a moment ago. This unsatisfactory state of affairs is clearly illustrated by the following. Many women who, as dependants of their husbands, enjoy medical cover under the medical schemes of their husbands, but who are also working for the firms concerned, are being obliged by their employers to become members of their schemes, such a family therefore has to pay double membership fees. Another example is the following. The wife of a man who is working for the Railways accepts employment with another firm which has its own scheme, and as the Railway Sick Fund is exempted, the firm obliges the wife to become a member of its own scheme, notwithstanding the fact that she already has comprehensive medical insurance under the Railway Sick Fund as a dependant of her husband. This also causes problems to the doctor. As he is a part-time panel doctor to the Railways, he <span class="col_4855-4856" refersTo="page_0915"/>must treat the wife free of charge as a dependant of the man who is on his panel, or he can treat her as a member of the scheme to which she belongs. This is unnecessary duplication.</p>

<p>As the Act reads at present, a great many problems arose, and the only way in which these can be dealt with effectively, is to regard the said schemes as registered schemes for the purposes of section 38 only. Provision for this is made in clause 2 of the Bill. I just want to say that the proposed amendment has been brought to the notice of the Railway Administration and the other Government Departents concerned, and that no objection was raised to it.</p>

<p>Clause 3 of the Bill contains a similar provision to that in clause 2, but in this case it concerns the schemes exempted from the registration provisions of the Act in terms of section 3 thereof. This amendment is necessary to make it clear that the prohibition on membership of more then one registered scheme also applies to a scheme that is exempted from registration.</p>

<p>The next amendment, i.e. the one contained in clause 4, applies to the constitution of the Central Council for Medical Schemes. The proposal in this regard is to provide for the appointment of nine instead of &#x201C;not less than seven and not more than nine&#x201D; ordinary members on the Central Council for Medical Schemes, as well as to make it compulsory for one of the nine members to be a lay member of the Medical Council. In other words, while the membership could previously be seven or at the most nine, it will now be nine, and there is an obligation that one of the nine members must be a lay member of the Medical Council. As regards this amendment it is deemed logical that the membership of the council be determined more precisely and that one of the members be elected from the lay members of the Medical Council, as such a member will from the nature of the case concentrate more specifically on the interests of the members of schemes and their dependants, that is to say, of the patient. In fact, it is precisely in order to see to the interests of the patient that lay members are appointed to the Medical Council.</p>

<p>Under section 11 of the Act a member of a scheme may be assisted out of the Medical Schemes Fund established under that section, only in those cases where the scheme has already rendered him the maximum financial aid to which he is entitled. As the annual maximum aid differs from scheme to scheme, one member may&#x2014;and this is a possibility&#x2014;receive greater financial assistance than another. For that reason it is desirable to leave the grants from the Fund to the discretion of the Council, and provision for this is made in clause 5.</p>

<p>Clause 7 relates to the Registrar of Medical Schemes, who is appointed under section 13 of the Act. The present position, in terms of which the Central Council for Medical Schemes has no authority over the registrar, is unsatisfactory for obvious reasons. In order to ensure that the policy of the Central Council is implemented, it is now proposed that the registrar perform his functions and carry out his duties &#x201C;subject to the control and directions of the council&#x201D;. I may just say here that while we now in this amended Bill want to give all interested parties an opportunity of seeing how it will work in practice over a period, I should also, as regards myself and the Department, like to see how this matter will function. I mention this because, although the Central Council for Medical Schemes and the registrar are appointed by the Minister and although the Minister and the Department are held responsible for everything they do, I should like in the years ahead to keep an eye over the functioning as matters stand now, and to look at the whole matter with an open mind, and perhaps in a few years&#x2019; time come back to this House in this connection.</p>

<p>The object of the insertion in the Act of the new section 16A, as proposed in clause 8, is to rectify a weakness in the Act by requiring the registrar to publish the name and address of a scheme that is registered, and the date on which this took place, in the <i>Government Gazette.</i></p>

<p>The establishment of a benefit fund by each scheme, as is proposed in clause 9, is embodied in the Bill only to ensure that the moneys paid by members as premiums to the scheme, will be applied exclusively to the benefit of those members who pay such premiums, and not to the benefit of members of another fund. This amendment does not introduce any new idea, but only serves to supplement deficiencies in the present definitions, in view of the fact that certain schemes have found a way of utilizing moneys from one fund to the benefit of other funds with larger or smaller claims. Here too I am aware that certain schemes are experiencing problems with this, but I feel that we must allow this to remain as it is and that we must apply it in practice in this way in the interests of the patients, and if it then gives rise to insurmountable problems, which I do not think will be the case, we can look at it again.</p>

<p>The amendment of section 20 for which provision is made in clause 10 involves no departure from the present practical application of the existing section, except that it also protects the rights of a dependant of a member subsequently who becomes a member in his own right of the scheme of which his father or mother is a member. As the section reads at present a scheme must accept a member unconditionally as a continuing member, even if he was a member of the scheme for only one day. All schemes have a qualifying period before a member can become a continuing member, and the object of the amendment of the section is to enable the council to lay down the conditions according to which a member may claim continued membership, in order to bring about greater uniformity <span class="col_4857-4858" refersTo="page_0916"/>in schemes. The proposed amendment also relates to the automatic membership of a widow of a member of a scheme.</p>

<p>In clause 13 of the Bill provision is made for the deletion of section 31 of the Act, which prescribes the procedure to be followed in regard to the amendment of remuneration payable to a medical practitioner under any agreement entered into with him by any medical benefit scheme in respect of services rendered by him to members of the scheme. As the Act reads at present, a medical practitioner who has entered into an agreement with a scheme regarding his remuneration, cannot refuse to render services to a member of the scheme until such time as any dispute between himself and the scheme in respect of his remuneration has been settled by way of arbitration. Apart from the fact that it is not logical that a medical practitioner should be restricted as regards the exercising of his rights under any agreement he has concluded with a scheme on a voluntary basis, this provision serves no useful purpose. It merely disturbs the relationship between medical practitioners and schemes. The deletion of the provision concerned is therefore deemed to be in the public interest.</p>

<p>A flaw in the Act that should be rectified is the fact that, although provision is made in section 37 for appeals against decisions by the registrar, the latter does not have the right to appear before the Appeal Board to offer evidence in support of the decision which is the subject of appeal. Clause 14 grants the registrar this right. This, therefore, is merely a rectification.</p>

<p>Clause 15 of the Bill amends section 41 of the Act. The position in this connection is that while the present section provides that the Central Council for Medical Schemes may issue regulations in regard to the minimum benefits to which members of registered medical schemes are entitled, provision is now being made for the maximum benefits also to be determined by the Council. In this connection I want to make it very clear, however, that the maximum only applies to the percentage benefit of the service, and not to the extent of the annual benefits. This amendment is to combat both abuse of our medical services and personnel and money-making by certain parties. Where, for example, 100 per cent benefits are granted, it has been found that the claims figure is far higher than in the case of those schemes which only grant 80 per cent benefits, with the result that the cost per member is increased unnecessarily. Doctors are called out to attend to trifling matters and are consulted one after another because it does not cost the member anything and there is no discouragement. Our medical manpower, of which there is already a shortage, cannot be abused in this way.</p>

<p>In the second place there are entrepreneurs who are allowed a certain percentage of membership fees for their administration. Now it goes without saying that the greater the abuse, the higher the membership fees must become, and, consequently, the greater their profits.</p>

<p>Another amendment provided for in clause 15 is the inclusion in section 41 of a provision in terms of which every medical scheme is required to provide their members with written proof of membership of the scheme, containing the prescribed particulars. The object of this amendment is to rectify a flaw in the Act.</p>

<p>Finally, provision is made in clause 16 for the deletion of section 44, which relates to the original determination of the tariff of fees in respect of services rendered by dentists to members of schemes and their dependants. As the determination of this tariff has already been settled, this section is now redundant.</p>

<p>I sincerely trust that this measure will to a large extent solve the problems that arose with the application of the Medical Schemes Act, so that medical and related services may continue to be provided to members of medical schemes at a reasonable cost and on a sound basis.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in the points made by the hon. the Minister. I must say that it strikes me that this Bill is, among other things, at least a further attempt on the part of the Minister to improve the relationships between the medical schemes, the contributors to the medical schemes, the doctors and the paramedical services, who are allied to this scheme. It is their hope, I take it, that matters will move at a much more even pace and that there will be more co-operation between these various branches of the services than there has been during the past year.</p>

<p>This type of Bill, if not handled properly, could very easily cause a lot of trouble between the doctors and the medical schemes. The whole basis of the success of the patientdoctor relationship, as we see it in South Africa, depends to a great extent on the functioning of this Bill. It has to function in such a way that those who contribute and those who give service must firstly, feel secure and, secondly, they must work in harmony. Otherwise there is going to be trouble. Up to now hundreds of thousands of people have been helped either by medical aid schemes or by benefit societies. Doctors who serve these schemes have had their difficulties, but I think they are starting to iron them out. I am pleased that the Minister was able to call a conference together where he had unanimity and agreement after the four days&#x2019; discussion. Perhaps if this took place two years ago, we would have been able to obviate the present difficulties that we have. The point is that these difficulties have been ironed out.</p>

<p>Now let us see what could happen even now. I know, and the Minister knows, that as far as medical benefit societies are concerned, many doctors have objections to this scheme of prepaid insurance. The benefit societies, as we know, have been in existence in the main and <span class="col_4859-4860" refersTo="page_0917"/>they have given a service over very many years. Some of them came into existence at the turn of the century. It would be a pity if the people who have been receiving a service from these benefit societies should find that, because of the action of a group of doctors, my own colleagues, these benefit societies would have to disappear. It is the wish of the doctors in South Africa in the main to change benefit societies into medical aid schemes. But I would appeal to my colleagues and say to them that where a medical benefit society is in existence, they should be prepared to give a continued service to those benefit societies which are in existence. It is up to them not to cause confusion and disruption in that service. Of course we know that the doctors who serve a benefit society are not being paid as well as they should be. But there are other matters that go hand in hand with the payment they receive on a capitation basis. It is quite well known that many doctors have built up a very good private practice as the result of the treatment they have given to their benefit patients. They have been recommended. That, alone, is something which the doctors must not forget. When it comes to remuneration, negotiation can take place. If doctors are dissatisfied with the capitation fee they are getting at the moment, in terms of this Bill as it is now going to be amended, we find a machine which is well able to deal with the complaints that may come from the side of the doctors.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I feel that the patient must also be protected. If the patient feels that he is not receiving the attention he should receive for the contribution he is making, he should have also some form of redress. I must appeal then to the Minister to make sure that he will give his assurance that he will do his utmost to protect the medical benefit societies which are in existence to-day. It would be a great pity if those large benefit societies, like the South African Railways and Harbours Benefit Society, the Mines Benefit Society and some of the others, were to find themselves in difficulties because of action taken by the doctors. I would appeal to my colleagues as well to give those people who are subscribing to benefit societies their continued good service. It is quite obvious that benefit societies would have gone out voluntarily if they had not received the good service from the doctors. But it is because they are satisfied with the service they are receiving that they wish the benefit societies to continue existing. I, for one, would support that wish.</p>

<p>The medical aid societies are not yet quite as uniform as the benefit societies. Here we get a variety of services which are provided by the medical aid schemes. These services are provided according to the means of the contributors. Those contributors who can afford to contribute at a high level, will naturally get a better service. To me it would seem that the benefit patient, the one who in most cases is forced to belong to a benefit society because of his conditions of employment, should receive the same protection as the medical aid scheme contributor. As I was saying, if we are going to have a successful scheme, we have to have co-operation from every single contributor, every single doctor working on the schemes and every single person who provides a service.</p>

<p>Here I want to remind the House that it is not only the doctors and the contributors who are responsible for the even keel that should be kept in this form of insurance. I want to draw the attention of the Minister to what is happening at nursing homes, where I feel that many people who are admitted as benefit patients, are not receiving a square deal, and that the medical aid societies and the benefit societies are not getting value for money. That is a point which we have to watch. It is difficult, I know, for nursing homes, for instance, to run their affairs on an economic basis on the fees that are paid per head per day for benefit patients. But the turnover is so large in most cases, especially in view of to-day&#x2019;s methods of treating people and the short stay in nursing homes, that I feel that the nursing homes should play a better part in bringing down the costs of the contribution by the contributor to the benefit societies for the medical schemes as a whole.</p>

<p>The same applies in the provision of medicines. Perhaps the hon. member for Berea during his speech will deal with this matter of the provision of medicines to the contributor to a medical scheme. It is a very important point and we know that some of the schemes have already imposed restrictions. Doctors very often object to these restrictions. Contributors very often object to the levy that is placed on a prescription. Brakes and checks will have to be made; otherwise schemes will find themselves in great difficulties. The cost of running those schemes can only go up. I therefore appeal to contributors of medical schemes to be as frugal as possible and to remember that any doctor can only do a certain number of calls a day. A doctor can only see a certain number of people a day. I would appeal to them to remember that if they want their scheme to act properly, they must allow the doctors time and they must not overburden him with trivialities. It is common knowledge that a man who belongs to a benefit society very often goes to a doctor unnecessarily and causes friction between himself and the doctor. The hon. the Minister mentioned that.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about those doctors who have decided to opt out of the scheme. If I may I should like to explain to the House what is happening. There are certain doctors who do not wish to attend patients at the tariff of fees as now laid down by medical schemes. What they wish to do is to attend to the patient as a private patient. They wish to be able to send an account to the patient direct and they wish to be paid direct. Now, if I belong to a medical aid scheme and I have a free choice of doctors and I wanted to go to Dr. A, I would like to <span class="col_4861-4862" refersTo="page_0918"/>know that Dr. A is going to treat me at a rate as laid down by the tariff for medical schemes. The doctor who opts out is not keen that the patient should know that he has opted out. The result may be as follows: I may go to a doctor who has opted out. I am not told that this doctor has opted out and I may be faced with paying a bill which I cannot afford, even though the medical aid scheme would give a certain percentage to me, as laid down by the tariff, to pay for that call. But it goes further than that. This call that I have made to the doctor may entail other procedures. It may entail a visit to an X-ray department. It may entail an operation. It may also entail a stay at a nursing home. I should have the benefit of knowing which doctors will attend to me under a set fee and which doctors will not, which nursing homes will accept me at benefit rates and which nursing homes will not. It is then my privilege to be able to go to the doctor that I want. If I still want to go to the doctor who is going to charge me benefit fees, well and good. But if I go to a doctor who is going to charge me above benefit fees, I should at least know beforehand what he is going to charge me. I should like to urge my colleagues therefore to tell the patient when they come for examination that they will undertake the examination but that the patient must understand that they are outside the tariff of fixed fees. When you tell a patient that you have opted out, it does not mean much. When you say that you will charge a fee outside the tariff of fees, the patient will understand. The patient will then protect himself and say to the doctor: If you send me for an X-ray, please send me to a doctor who is going to do it under the tariff as laid down. And if I have to go to a nursing home, please inform the nursing home that I belong to such and such a medical aid and that I cannot pay more than is laid down. Some people today are being faced with bills they cannot pay. The doctors will be the sufferers.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F; Do you think notices should be put up in doctors&#x2019; reception rooms to indicate that they are not prepared to charge the tariffs prescribed by the medical societies&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think doctors are very keen on doing that sort of thing. There are other ways of doing it. I would say that if you go into the reception room of the doctor, the receptionist should inform the patient that Dr. So-and-so is outside the medical schemes.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Doctors do put up a little notice to-day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am agreeable to that. Whatever method is adopted by the doctor, the doctor should inform the patient that he is outside this scheme. I am quite happy, whatever way he does it. The other thing that I should like to see, and there is reference to it here, is that the doctor should be protected as well. If he belongs to a medical scheme and he has patients belonging to such a scheme visiting him for professional reasons, then that patient should carry a card on which his identity and that of his family is reflected. General practitioners will tell you how many times there has been a swindle over this sort of thing. It is very unfortunate. I therefore think that where the patient is protected on one side, the doctor must be protected on the other side. I would also appeal to the medical schemes to see to it that the patient&#x2019;s account is paid promptly. It is too often found these days that doctors have to wait from three to four months before their accounts are settled. I think this sort of thing causes dissatisfaction. Machinery must be instituted in the medical schemes whereby doctors&#x2019; accounts can be paid as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I should just like to say one word about the commission that is going to deal with tariffs. I know that the hon. the Minister has an open mind on this matter. It is suggested that there should be four members and that the representatives on this commission should either be a doctor or a dentist, depending on whether the tariff affects the doctor or the dentist. The fourth person to which reference has been made would then have to come, not from the doctors, the dentists or the medical schemes, but would have to be a lay person. If he is going to vote, it is obvious that in most cases he is going to protect himself. I have an open mind on this matter and I think I could be convinced if a good argument can be advanced for the appointment of a fourth person. I would be inclined to leave it to the three persons mentioned. I have every hope, especially if there is going to be a fudge sitting as an arbitrator on this commission, that a fair and reasonable alteration in the tariff will be made. Let us say then that we on this side of the House will agree to three persons. The Minister will have two or three years time to review the position. If he finds that it is not workable, there is nothing to stop an amendment being made to provide for another person. For that reason I feel that we should rather have three people at the moment who, we know, will come to a reasonable finding.</p>

<p>Lastly, Sir, I want to bring to the notice of the House the fact that there have been complaints by medical schemes that they have no redress if doctors over-visit or if their charges are not reasonable or if they have any other complaints. I do not know what happened at the conference, and perhaps the Minister can tell us in his reply whether or not the medical schemes made any request for the Medical Council to receive complaints directly from the medical schemes. What happens now is that a complaint has to go via the patient. If a complaint comes to the notice of a medical scheme, the medical scheme cannot take that complaint to the Medical Council. It has to be <span class="col_4863-4864" refersTo="page_0919"/>the individual, who has complained to the medical scheme, who has to make the complaint to the Medical Council. It happens occasionally that complaints could be brought directly by the medical schemes to the notice of the Medical Council. Now that a member of the Medical Council is on the Central Council, will it not be feasible to approach the Medical Council and ask them whether they will not accept complaints directly from the medical schemes&#x003F; This is a complicated business, but the Minister knows what I am talking about. I hope that the Minister will reply to this point now or in the Committee Stage and tell us whether he feels that this is feasible. With those few words I want to tell the Minister that we are pleased that he has introduced this Bill and we on this side of the House are going to support him.</p>

<speech by="#morrison">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House are of course very pleased to hear that the Opposition have also promised their support to this measure. Arising out of what the hon. member for Rosettenville has just mentioned in regard to benefit schemes, I want to give him the assurance that we on this side of the House have no intention of abolishing those benefit schemes. You will recall, Sir, that there was a time when the Medical Association was exerting itself to have these benefit schemes converted into ordinary aid schemes. But in due course the association also began to realize that these benefit schemes occupy a very definite place in our medical set-up. That is why I do not believe that it would be advisable on the part of any Government to abolish these benefit schemes. I do not think therefore that there are any real grounds for the hon. members&#x2019; concern regarding this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of a patient&#x2019;s taking cognizance of whether a medical practitioner is in fact a member of a medical scheme or not. I personally believe that this ought not to present the patients with too many problems, for the simple reason that we have already reached the stage where most patients visit their medical practitioners after they have arranged for an appointment. When such an appointment is being arranged, it is quite simple for the patient to inquire as to whether the medical practitioner concerned is prepared to treat patients at medical scheme tariffs or not. In cases where such a patient does not arrange an appointment beforehand, if is also easy, when entering the consultating rooms, to ask the receptionist whether the medical practitioner concerned is in fact a member of a medical scheme or not. I do not think that this will present patients with any major problems.</p>

<p>When the 1967 Act was passed by this House, an undertaking was given that the situation in respect of the regulation of these schemes between medical practitioners and the schemes concerned would be placed on a firm basis. At one time the measure was also welcomed by both sides of this House. But, after the passing of that Act, a fierce controversy unfortunately arose. I maintain that it was unfortunate that it arose because there was a great deal of misunderstanding. This controversy caused very serious harm to the image of the medical profession in this country. I do not want to go into the merits of this matter. I am simply mentioning a fact, i.e. that the image of the medical profession has definitely suffered damage. You will recall that the Press contained daily statements by some or other body, followed by counterstatements from opposing bodies, which at the same time created the impression that the medical profession was out to make money, and that its only objection to the legislation was the fact that the tariffs at which it had to render its services to patients who were members of medical schemes would be cheaper than those for private patients. The public involuntarily gained the impression that the matter was concerned with fees only, and nothing else. As I said, I do not want to go into the merits of the case, but I want to ask my colleagues to give very thorough consideration to this aspect now and to restore that image of the medical profession which suffered damage. The medical profession, particularly in South Africa, is based on very high ethical norms. It would be a sad day if those norms were demolished, or if the impression arises among the public that service to the ill is no longer the primary motive of the doctor. We must at all costs avoid, and eradicate completely, that impression which can arise, i.e. that doctors are in the profession to enrich themselves at the expense of the suffering of other people. The majority of medical practitioners in this country are dedicated to the service they render to their patients. They feel they are called upon to do so, and in that spirit, as well, they then render service. If there are those who want to destroy that fine and healthy image of the medical profession, I am asking them to give this matter a great deal of thought and to ask themselves whether they are on the right road. It is my appeal to the medical practitioners of South Africa to prove now, by word and deed, that the impression which has gained ground during the past few years, particularly during the past two years, among the lay public is unfounded. We cannot afford to have the prestige and status of medicine in South Africa suffer harm. For that reason we welcome the fact that a change is being effected by clause 12 in respect of the determination of fees which are made applicable to the medical aid schemes. It will no longer be necessary for the medical practitioners to approach the Government or the House in an organized group through the Medical Association and request that the fees be reconsidered. This is now an automatic process. It now takes place without publicity, and in my opinion, it is a much healthier arrangement, and an attempt to place this extremely important matter on a firm basis.</p>

<p><span class="col_4865-4866" refersTo="page_0920"/>Mr. Speaker, I just want to refer the Minister to the new section 29 (3) where mention is made of an agreement of partnership. I can understand the purpose of this clause very well. For example, where partners co-operate with one another and are in partnership, they must treat each other&#x2019;s patients. However, I want to ask the Minister whether he will not consider the advisability of defining &#x201C;partnership&#x201D; more closely. These days we find in practice that there are various types of partnerships. In particular there is the concept of group practices which has come into existence. According to such a group practice a group of medical practitioners work together, but they nevertheless d-o not divide their fees equally. One finds various types of group practices where medical practitioners share consulting rooms, and where each nevertheless derives his own income from that practice. I do not know whether it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention, in all cases where doctors cooperate, on whatever basis, to regard them as partners. However. I just want to offer it for the consideration of the Minister that he consider this aspect of the matter as well.</p>

<p>In addition I also want to refer to the new section 30 (4) and (5). The hon. the Minister told us and it is stated in this way in the Act that this Remuneration Commission will consist of three persons only, because when a matter affecting doctors is discussed on the Remuneration Commission the dentist who has been appointed to the Remuneration Commission, is not represented at that specific juncture. It now seems to me as if the provision in subsection (4), i.e. that the chairman of the commission shall have a deliberative as well as a casting vote, is unwarranted for the simple reason that there will always, at a given moment, be only three persons present. This is perhaps a merely academic question, but I am just bringing it to the attention of the hon. Minister.</p>

<p>We can extend our cordial congratulations to the hon. the Minister on the initiative he has displayed in convening this conference with the association of medical practitioners in Pretoria. The problems, the turmoil and suspicion which existed in regard to the original Act would simply have dragged on and created a situation which would ultimately have become unendurable if the hon. the Minister had not intervened and on this friendly basis, arranged a conference with these people. We want to congratulate him on that. We also want to make an appeal to the medical practitioners to make an actual and positive attempt to make this Act work. This is an honest and well intended attempt to place a situation which has existed for many years on a firm basis. I think I can ask my colleagues to make every possible attempt to cause this Act to function smoothly and successfully.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is gratifying to hear through the hon. member for Cradock that, as far as his side of the House is concerned, they too recognize the need for the continued functioning of the medical benefit societies. They fulfil a very important need, particularly with the lower income groups. I am pleased to know that no attempt is to be made to do away with them in any form.</p>

<p>Both the hon. member for Rosettenville and I had the privilege of serving on the Commission which dealt with the original Bill. We had the opportunity of listening to the evidence and the difficult task of weighing it up and recommending to this hon. House what we considered would be a satisfactory way of combining the evidence in creating a good Bill. The hon. the Minister has indicated that there have been considerable discussions with the view to clearing up difficulties which arose mainly as a result of questions of tariff and questions of dissatisfaction among the medical men who rendered services. I think it is most gratifying that advantage was taken of consultation to overcome these difficulties. I believe that with the goodwill that has been extended from both sides of the House, there is every possibility that most of the difficulties will be ironed out and that the public will get a medical scheme service to which they are entitled in this country. However, there is one aspect which I would like to refer to the hon. the Minister. If one considers para, (b) of the definition of a medical scheme in the Act&#x2014;&#x201C;medical scheme&#x201D; means a scheme established with the object of making provision for the supply, free of charge, to members thereof and to dependants of such members, of medicines or of medical, surgical, dental or optical requirements. Then it goes on to deal with the question of nursing homes.</p>

<p>I want to make it quite clear that I speak as a public representative and not as a member of the profession which may be called upon to give service. These are my feelings in what I regard to be the interest of the public. I know that I do not enjoy the full support of many of my colleagues who are chemists and druggists and who fee1 that as the situation is at the moment, it is working satisfactorily in that chemists and druggists are not included in the tariff. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that basically in the interest of the public, it is desirable that consultation and discussion should continue with organized pharmacies with the view ultimately to putting into effect fully this particular clause whereby members of the public will receive medicines and will receive them on a basis which I believe will be more satisfactory to them. I know there have been problems and I fully appreciate the difficulties which precluded the inclusion of the suppliers of medicine when the Act was promulgated.</p>

<p>At that stage the argument was advanced that here we have difficulty in establishing a tariff for the reason that a tariff includes a professional fee together with the supply of a medicinal article. I realize that there are difficulties in that respect, because if the manufacturer finds it necessary to increase the price <span class="col_4867-4868" refersTo="page_0921"/>of the article, obviously it must affect the tariff. This could in many respects involve a continual fluctuation in the tariff laid down. I realize that that is a difficulty. However, I believe it can be overcome; I believe it at this present moment and I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that in so far as the Government dispensing contract is concerned, it can be overcome. This contract has been an arrangement with Government departments through the Department of Health and through organized pharmacy for many years. As I understand the position to-day, that tariff which operates under the Government dispensing tariff, is a tariff acceptable to the State, calculated on an equitable basis, less a discount. On that basis it automatically takes care of certain price increases which may occur as a result of manufacturing costs fluctuating. I believe that if this tariff can operate on that basis in so far as the Government dispensing contract is concerned, there is every reason to suggest that continued negotiation should be made with a view to extending this particular arrangement so that it will be possible that chemists and druggists will supply medicines on a tariff on a similar basis to the tariff which operates now for medical men and dentists. I feel that it will have to be by negotiation, it will have to be by give and take. I think that in so far as the supplying of medicines to members of the medical schemes is concerned, except with minor exemptions, this should be the prerogative of the chemist and druggist. In other words, as regards the supplying of service to members of medical schemes, medicines should be supplied and dispensed by chemists and druggists. Dispensing doctors should only be allowed to supply those medicines in extreme cases where it would not be convenient for members of the public to avail themselves of pharmaceutical services. I believe that that is one basis on which there could be discussion and I hope agreement.</p>

<p>There is also another matter which I should like to put before the hon. the Minister. Before doing so, I wish to raise a question which the hon. member for Rosettenville asked me to raise. He had referred to the question of medical fees charged by doctors. He indicated that cases were on record where the doctor wished to charge the full fee and then required the patient to pay that full fee and to recoup himself from the scheme the amount which the scheme was prepared to pay in terms of a tariff. The hon. member for Rosettenville thought that this was a situation which was not a very happy one and he hoped that at least consideration would be given to eliminating that practice as far as possible.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the matter of minimum benefits. The hon. the Minister will be aware that in Government Notice 1977 published on the 9th February, 1968, certain conditions were laid down by the Council for Medical Schemes as to how medicines would be supplied to members of medical schemes.</p>

<p>Obviously there could not be fixed conditions because the various schemes had various financial arrangements and operated under different circumstances. I fully appreciate this position, but every variation of circumstance and every change of condition under which a medical scheme is administered, creates certain administrative difficulties on the part of the person who has to supply the medicine, namely the chemist and the druggist. I just want to mention to the hon. the Minister some of the factors which at present are causing, I believe, a lot of administrative work which could be eliminated once one has been able to obtain a certain amount of uniformity of minimum and maximum conditions. I refer to the question of membership identification; I realize that this amendment Bill will make this position easier by virtue of regulations and I think this is important. Obviously any supplier under this Act needs to be safeguarded in relation to the identification of the various people who get these benefits.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the levy. The regulations lay down that a medical scheme may stipulate that patients are to pay up to R1 in respect of a prescription. I have no basic objection to this, but the problem arises when medical schemes suggest different amounts as levies. At the moment I have details here of schemes operating in a certain area where the amount of levy varies from 25 cents, and if there is an additional item on the prescription another 15 cents and in some cases an amount of 50 cents is charged. There is therefore this variation. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that administratively this creates difficulties. There is also the matter of repeat prescriptions. Here again medical schemes have different systems. This can also be extremely awkward. In some cases chemists and druggists are entitled to repeat a prescription, having been satisfied that it is the wish of the patient, and that it is not necessary at that time to contact the medical practitioner. This is not always the case and as a result there are difficulties.</p>

<p>There is also the question of exclusions. Certain medical schemes, in the light of their experience and by virtue of their financial arrangements, refuse to pay for certain items which may be issued on a doctor&#x2019;s prescription and could be regarded as medicines. These items are excluded from payment by medical schemes. This too leads to administrative difficulties on the part of the people who have to supply prescriptions. In so far as payments are concerned, there are also difficulties. Sometimes members are called upon to pay direct to the supplier and in other cases accounts are sent to the medical aid society. There is no standard system there either. In certain cases discounts are also allowed, but we have no particular standards. Some are net and some are on a discount basis. All these lead to complications.</p>

<p>My point is that these variations which lead to administrative difficulties must obviously <span class="col_4869-4870" refersTo="page_0922"/>have some effect on the ultimate supply of the medicine and the basis on which the charge should be levied. I feel that if the conditions can be simplified and standardized as much as possible there is a possibility that the public will benefit in the end as a result of a tariff worked out strictly on the basis of the time involved minus the time which is at present involved in the solving of administrative problems. There is only one other matter that I would like to raise with the hon. the Minister and that concerns some form of report. I notice in the Act that there is a Medical Schemes Fund which will be supervised by the Secretary for Health. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is the intention to make available information about the financial activities of the Medical Schemes Fund and whether it will be by way of the report of the Auditor General or in what form it will be available, because I believe that this is something which is of particular interest to many professional people. It is desirable that they should have access to information with regard to the over-all financial workings of the Medical Schemes Fund.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>I want to extend my wholehearted gratitude to hon. members who participated in the debate for the support they have given this amendment Bill. Sir, this was really a serious attempt, after many days of consultation and hard work by the bodies concerned, to see whether we could not effect an improvement in a situation which had almost got out of hand. The Press and the doctors gave great publicity, not only to what happened, but to any possible conclusions which could have been drawn. None of this did the profession any good; it did not do the relations between patient and doctor any good, and certainly did not do anything to promote the sound and correct fundamental principles of this Act. That is why I am pleased that we are able to discuss this matter in this atmosphere to-day. I want to say at once to hon. members that I do not think that this offers a final solution; I do not think we have heard the last word in this regard, but the fact of the matter is that we are dealing here with something which is based on a principle which is not only acceptable to us all, but which can only be beneficial in regard to the provision of medical services and for the promotion of the welfare of the patient, and since this is the case, it is a good thing that we can discuss the matter here in a spirit of friendship and unanimity. I want to give the hon. member for Rosettenville the assurance that the entire object with this legislation, <i>inter alia,</i> is not only to ensure that the scheme remains in force, but also to allow the number of schemes to increase. The first idea I want to emphasize is that, since a high percentage of our people are covered by medical insurance, it will and ought to be the task of the Central Council and of the various associations to include as many people as possible, who have not yet been covered in this regard, in these schemes. I find it gratifying to note that even the farming community is now putting its own scheme into operation in order to cover the farming community. I think in the Free State membership of a medical scheme is now available through the agricultural union there. I just want to say that I have covered myself and my family for many years in this way, and that I can speak only with the greatest praise of the schemes and feel myself quite at liberty to recommend to any person that he should join some medical scheme or other to make certain that in future, when ill-health occurs and he has to incur major expenditure, he will not be ruined financially. I think the message which should be carried abroad from this House to-day is that every person in South Africa, every individual who does not yet have medical cover, should see to it that he protects himself and his dependants in this way. That is why I am assuring the hon. member that the whole object is to expand schemes, and not to let schemes disappear or diminish.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised the question of tariffs at nursing institutions and hospitals. I may just inform the hon. member that I raised this matter very specifically at the discussions we held in Pretoria and that I also raised the question of the tariff which would be charged by nurses, and that I received no complaints or any problem in regard to the schemes or from a single body in this connection. The reason may be that one is dealing here with a uniform service; in other words, payment is only being made for accommodation; payment is only being made for nursing care and not, as in the case of the medical profession, for a hundred and one different items. That is why I want to say to the hon. member that this matter has not escaped our notice, but that we had enough problems with other matters, and since no complaints were forthcoming in this connection, since there was no problem whatsoever, we left the position as it was, but an eye will of course be kept on the position if it presents problems in future. Nor did the Central Council for Medical Schemes receive, I do not want to say, any complaints in this connection, but in any case no complaints of such a serious nature that they were brought to my attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about doctors who had opted out. He said that the public should be protected in the sense that they should at least know, when they are treated by a doctor, whether the determined tariff of fees will be charged or whether they will be charged a different tariff. The hon. member made certain suggestions in this connection, and a question in this regard was also put by the hon. member for Brakpan to the hon. member for Rosettenville. A very great percentage of doctors have opted out. I do not like the word, but I am using it because it is the term my colleagues and other people understand. I understand that at the present moment there are about 3,000 of them who do not accept the tariff of fees. This is a misleading figure because, <span class="col_4871-4872" refersTo="page_0923"/>as hon. members will concede, the vast majority of these 3.000 or more doctors who do not accept the tariff of fees, nevertheless charge the tariff of fees. They have in fact opted out, but they are still charging the prescribed tariff of fees. I also want to point out to hon. members that we do not accept this as adequate protection for the patients, and that is why section 29 of the original Act contains the following provision&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No medical practitioner or dentist shall in respect of the rendering by him of any particular service to a member or a dependant of a member of a registered medical aid scheme, who under the rules of such scheme is entitled in respect of the rendering of such service to assistance on the basis of the tariff of fees, recover an amount exceeding the amount of the fees calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the said tariff of fees &#x2026;</block>

<p>I then come to (b) (ii)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; unless, if it was reasonably possible to do so, he had informed such member or such dependant before the rendering of such service that he was not bound to render any service at the tariff specified in the said tariff of fees.</block>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and &#x201C;if possible&#x201D;. In other words, the medical practitioner is, according to the legislation, obliged to indicate to the patient that he is going to charge a higher tariff than the one laid down. I think there is also a cover in this regard in amendments which I have made to the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, earlier on in the Session. But I just want to point out further that what happens in practice is&#x2014;and this is what I myself experienced when I recently consulted a doctor&#x2014;that he had a notice in his consulting rooms on which is indicated whether he participates in the tariff or not. But I shall return to that again later. In addition the hon. member stated that the doctor should also be protected. I want to state here to-day that I think that the relations between medical practitioners and patients in a very high percentage of cases are sound, good, relations. I think in the vast majority of cases in the country and in the cities there are very close ties of friendship and confidence between doctors and patients, and I want to make an appeal to the public and to the schemes not to pay the doctor&#x2019;s account last. I think that that person who enters the house in time of illness, who must in time of illness be the counsellor and support, is perhaps entitled to be taken into consideration first and not last as far as the settlement of his account is concerned. In this connection I want to make a very serious appeal to the schemes that they should make every possible attempt to ensure the smooth functioning of the settlement of accounts and should not delay them for too long.</p>

<p>Then, too, the hon. member raised the question of identification of members. I should like to refer the hon. member to the amendment Bill, clause 15.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This clause amends section 41 of the principal Act by the insertion after paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of the following paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(aA) the provision by registered medical scheme to their members of written proof of membership, and the particulars such proof shall or may contain.</block>

<p>In other words, there will now be a way of identifying a member or a dependant as belonging to a certain scheme and also of making sure whether a dependant is the real dependant of the principal member of the scheme.</p>

<p>*In addition the hon. member spoke about complaints which could possibly be submitted directly to the Medical Council by the Central Council. This is a very delicate matter, as hon. members know, which has given rise to considerable problems, because the medical profession and the dental profession have felt that when it comes to ethical matters, when it comes to the question of their conduct, when it comes to matters where only one professional man can judge the conduct of another, laymen must not be concerned in this matter; and now it is the case to-day that the only body which can act in regard to complaints on matters of ethics is the Medical Council. But the fact of the matter is that the only person who can institute proceedings is a layman, in other words the patient, and it is also the case that the Central Council can form no judgment whatsoever on the conduct of a medical practitioner, but that the Central Council can draw the attention of the Medical Council to it. This is the position to-day, and I think that this is what the hon. member wants. The Central Council can form no judgment, but it can in fact bring a matter to the attention of the Medical Council. I think that with this I have dealt with the few matters raised by the hon. member.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member for Cradock mentioned a matter which is a very important one, and that is the prestige of the medical practitioner. I want to agree with him that medical practitioners are been shown up unnecessarily in a bad light, that too much publicity is given to the isolated cases where there has perhaps been a misdemeanour, or where the relations between the medical profession and the public have not been placed in a favourable light. But I think you would agree with me that, as I have already said, good relations between patient and doctor are by far and away the rule rather than the exception, and as I have already said, the tariff is being charged even in those cases where <span class="col_4873-4874" refersTo="page_0924"/>doctors have opted out, and that this was merely a method by means of which the profession gave expression to its dissatisfaction with the legislation as it was, and not of charging the public excessively high tariffs.</p>

<p>But now there is something else I want to point out and that is that one may not lose sight of the fact that there are, to a very large extent, still doctors in South Africa today who are doing charitable service for which no fees are ever charged. I think a debate such as this would be incomplete if I did not broach this matter and make it very clear that we have reason to be grateful towards the profession for the charitable service, the free service, which is being rendered day after day and night after night throughout South Africa by doctors. Opposed to that one has the small group of black sheep, and let me state now that as long as I hold this portfolio I, and the Medical Council as well, will leave no stone unturned, where there are doctors who are conducting themselves in a way unfitting to the profession, to eradicate them completely, because they are the small group which sometimes place this wonderful and noble profession in a bad light.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member mentioned the question of partnership and asked whether it was not advisable to define this more closely. I take it the hon. member has no problem with the fact that we are introducing this into the Act as it stands at present, i.e. that when one member of a partnership does not participate in the tariff of fees, this must apply to the entire partnership. He has no problems with the principle; his problem is whether the word &#x201C;partnership&#x201D; will be interpreted correctly if it is not defined more closely. I have been told by the legal advisers that this is not necessary because it is in fact clearly indicated in the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act in rule 8 of the ethical rules. I will in any case reconsider the matter to make certain whether it is covered, since one wants no misunderstanding in regard to precisely what &#x201C;partnership&#x201D; means. In addition the hon. member mentioned clause 12 (4) of the Bill where it is stated that the chairman of the commission has a deliberative as well as a casting vote. Now it is the case that a casting vote can only apply when there is an eauality of votes, and this commission consists of two members. But now the hon. member for Cradock will concede that although the commission consists of two members, one may be absent. He may be absent at that very moment when the decision has to be taken. I hope it does not happen but it may just happen that at that moment there are only two persons. I take it that a Judge in his wisdom&#x2014;and I hope I will be able to arrange with the hon. the Minister of Justice to find a Judge of eminent standing to perform this task&#x2014;will quite probably not force a vote. But it is merely for practical reasons that it has been written in and in any case it does not do much harm.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member for Berea held forth on the provision of medicines. I am grateful to him for having made no demands and for requesting that the discussion be continued and that consideration should be given to the question of whether there cannot be an expansion in regard to the provision of medicines under the schemes as well. He also mentioned the question of repeating prescriptions.</p>

<p>I just want to inform the hon. member that this is a very difficult matter, but I think we have already progressed to the point where we virtually have the situation to-day that the provision of medicines under medical schemes is far greater and more comprehensive than it was a few years ago. I am pleased of this progress because the ideal should be that the drugs the patient needs should perhaps be supplied to him in the same way as expert advice is supplied to him. But I am very grateful to him for not requesting that this be made compulsory and that we should write it into the Act, but that we should continually seek to attain it, <i>inter alia</i>, by means of negotiations, as he proposed. In addition he spoke about the regulations in regard to the provision of drugs, and the repeating of prescriptions. I do not want to express an opinion on this, and I shall tell the hon. member why. These are regulations of the Central Council. I cannot prescribe to the Central Council, as the hon. member knows, but what I can in fact say, is that the Central Council&#x2014;and this I will bring to their specific attention through my Department&#x2014;ought to take very thorough cognizance of this discussion, and should do whatever is necessary if that is in any way possible.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member inquired about the funds for medical schemes. As the matter stands, all the activities of the Central Council as well as the administration of the funds for medical schemes will be subjected to thorough audit by the Auditor-Genera]. It will be a function which will be carried out by the Auditor-General, and no one else, and that is why this Parliament will also scrutinize it and will be able to discuss it under the Vote of the Minister of Health.</p>

<p>I think that with this I have covered most of the points. Now in conclusion I want to make a very serious appeal to the medical profession to give this amended legislation a chance over a period of, say. four or five years; but I want to tell you why I am mentioning a period of four or five years. It is because as soon as this legislation is promulgated, the judicial commission, the Remuneration Commission, will be appointed and the fees determined. I think it is reasonable to ask this: Let it work for two years and let it then be revised, which will take a further two years, approaching four years, when the second revision will be made. I do not think that is too much to ask of any man or group of people, since we have had all these discussions, to enter a period of peace and quiet now and to see whether we cannot let this <span class="col_4875-4876" refersTo="page_0925"/>matter work and to get these principles established in South Africa.</p>

<p>In addition I also want to request the associations, the Medical Association and the Dental Association, to give positive guidance to their members, asking them to opt in again, because I think it would be irrefutable proof of the goodwill of the association and of its members if they afforded this legislation an opportunity of proceeding on its normal course and to see whether this cannot bring peace and quiet to South Africa where, some time ago, there was discord and problems were being created. I am making this appeal because the most favourable position must be achieved before the Act is put into effect; for the moment the Act is put into effect it takes, according to the Act itself, three months before any re-acceptance of the tariff of fees by any doctor is valid, whereas if it is done now, before the promulgation of the Act, it is immediately effective, and then we have the situation that the vast majority of our doctors will once again find themselves in the position in which they were before the Act was originally put into effect. In any case it will make no difference to the practical situation since they are to-day still applying that tariff. I am making this appeal because I can give the absolute assurance that there must be no possibility of lay persons prejudicing, or being able to prejudice, the ethical and professional matters pertaining to medical practitioners and dentists in our country.</p>

<p>This was one of the things in regard to which there was doubt and dissatisfaction, and with this amendment these things are being finally eliminated, and it will in no way be possible to read anything like that into this legislation, and I think that is a very important aspect, which will be of value to the profession. Lastly I want to say that I am prepared at any time in the future, when practical problems crop up again, and they will, to conduct discussions with interested parties and bring them together, as we did last year in Pretoria, in the best interests of the patient, to the satisfaction of the profession, and, what is very important, to the enhancement of the prestige and the status of the noble profession of medicine, because if that is the case, it is also in the interests of the patient and of the entire community.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the principle of control over arms and ammunition is nothing new in our legislation. The existing legislation in terms of which control is, for instance, being exercised over the possession of, dealings in and the importation of arms and ammunition in the Republic, was in fact placed on the Statute Book as far back as 1937&#x2014;Act 28 of 1937. Since then circumstances in our country have changed a great deal, and in order to adapt to these changed circumstances this Act was amended from time to time, on several occasions. Therefore I believe that it is unnecessary to decide whether we do need this legislation. The principle has already been accepted.</p>

<p>In the times in which we are living other factors have also arisen, factors which make the strict control of arms and ammunition an even more urgent necessity. What we particularly have in mind here, is the terrorist threat and infiltration across our borders and the changed pattern of crime in which more and more use is being made of firearms in cases such as robbery and the various manslaughter cases.</p>

<p>The need for legislation to exercise stricter control over arms and ammunition, has always been appreciated by the authorities concerned. Consequently one of the measures envisaged in this regard, i.e. the keeping of a central firearms register at the South African Criminal Bureau of the South African Police, was made possible as long ago as 1965 by means of the Arms and Ammunition Amendment Act, Act 46 of 1965.</p>

<p>A start was made with the compilation of this central firearms register, but it was soon found that it was practically impossible to compile from existing records a reasonably reliable register of firearms which would in any way serve the purpose for which it was intended.</p>

<p>The re-licensing of arms was considered to be essential for the accurate compilation of the central firearms register, and in order to make provision for that, to consolidate the existing laws relating to arms and ammunition and where necessary to amend them further, this Bill was drafted and is now being submitted for consideration.</p>

<p>The most sweeping change embodied in this Bill is that the administration of this Act is being relinquished by the Department of Justice and will be taken over by the Department of Police. When the Arms and Ammunition Act was placed on the Statute Book in 1937, the South African Police still formed an integral part of the Department of Justice, and it was simply a matter of course that the latter Department should be charged with the administration of this Act. If the Police had at that time been an independent department, they would quite possibly have been charged with the administration of this Act at that stage already. Since then the Police has developed into a fully-fledged Department. The control over arms and ammunition relates for the most part to the maintenance of law and order, and at present to internal security as well. These are purely police functions and therefore it is <span class="col_4877-4878" refersTo="page_0926"/>only logical that the administration of related legislation should also be in the hands of the Department of Police. In fact, in most Western countries such laws are administered by the police. In the course of discussions between the representatives of the relevant two departments, this aspect was given thorough consideration and it was decided that Police was the obvious Department for the administration of this Act.</p>

<p>This Bill makes provision for licences to possess arms. In the first instance, just as is the case under existing legislation, no person may have any arm in his possession unless he holds a licence to possess such arm. Such licence will be issued by the Commissioner to any white person over the age of 16 years. This minimum age has been raised from 14 to 16 years. This raised minimum age is also being applied in other clauses where the minimum age of the individual constitutes a factor. I should like to refer to clauses 8 (1) and 37 (1). The minimum age in terms of existing legislation is 14 years. However, in practice the police do not recommend applications by such juveniles for licences to possess arms, and magistrates do not approve such applications either.</p>

<p>The following few incidents recently reported to the police once again prove indisputably how dangerous an instrument a firearm is in the hands of children:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On 19th December, 1968, a 15-year-old white youth tampered with a shotgun and a 5-year-old Coloured child was shot dead.</li>

<li>(2) On 5th January, 1969, an 11-year-old boy fired his father&#x2019;s shotgun and killed a Bantu.</li>

<li>(3) On 10th January, 1969, six white children were playing with a .22 pistol and one of them (a 4-year-old) was shot dead.</li>

<li>(4) On 9th January, 1969, a 14-year-old youth was doing target shooting. He hit and killed a 17-year-old Bantu youth.</li>

<li>(5) On 1st March, 1969, only the other day, two white youths of 14 and 11 years, respectively, were playing with a .22 rifle and a 14-year-old Bantu youth who was with them, was shot and killed.</li>

</ol>

<p>Taking these cases into consideration, I am convinced that the minimum age ought to be raised from 14 to 16 years.</p>

<p>In the second instance, as regards licences, the Bill provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) a licence may only be granted to a person other than a natural or white person with the approval of the Minister (clause 3 (4));</li>

<li>(b) whenever the Commissioner refuses an application for a licence, the applicant may appeal to the Minister against such refusal (clause 3 (2));</li>

<li>(c) arms which are in private possession at the commencement of this Act must be re-licensed (clause 4).</li>

</ol>

<p>As I have already said, the necessity for relicensing firearms with a view to the compilation of a central firearms register has to a large extent given rise to this Bill being drafted and introduced. I can assure you, Sir, that it is definitely essential that re-licensing takes place. In many cases existing records of firearm licences previously issued are out of date and damaged. They do not contain all the latest particulars, such as the address or identity number of the licence holder, which are essential for compiling a proper central register of firearms. A final decision has not yet been taken on the procedure to be followed in registering such licences. This aspect is being investigated thoroughly in order that this may be effected with the least possible inconvenience being caused to the public. The owners of arms are being granted a period of 12 months after the commencement of this Act to apply for the re-licensing of arms in their possession. The new licences are being issued free of charge, and in order to encourage persons who may be in possession of firearm for which they do not hold a valid licence to apply for such arms to be re-licensed when re-licensing takes place, indemnity from prosecution for unlawful possession of such arms is being granted to them. Provision is being made for that in clause 4 (7). Consequently it is being anticipated that in this way recent particulars will be obtained in respect of the approximately 1,500,000 arms which are estimated to be in private hands in the country, for the compilation of the central firearms register (clause 42). The object in view with the central firearms register is to provide a comprehensive source of information in respect of all firearms and owners of firearms. Such a source of information is simply indispensable for effective control over firearms. If a firearm were found at the scene of a crime committed in Durban, for instance, it is at present practically impossible to determine on the basis of available records who the owner of that firearm is. That firearm could have been bought by the owner and licensed in Cape Town in 1940. Since then the owner might have moved all over the country and never have lived in Cape Town again, whilst the only record of that firearm, i.e. the licence in his name would still be kept in Cape Town.</p>

<p>Clause 8 has been included to enable the holder of a licence to possess an arm to permit the possession of arms with consent of the licence holder in certain circumstances&#x2014;(a) by a white person over the age of 16 years with the written consent of the licence holder; (b) by such white person in the immediate vicinity of the licence holder on any land belonging <span class="col_4879-4880" refersTo="page_0927"/>to or lawfully occupied by the licence holder, or for the purpose of protecting any property or premises, or any game on land, belonging to or in the care or custody of the licence holder; (c) by a non-white person over the age of 16 years employed by the licence holder for the purpose of protecting any property or premises, or any game on land, belonging to or in the. care or custody of the licence holder/. This clause does not differ substantially from section 35 of the existing Act. So much for the licensing of arms.</p>

<p>Just as is the case in the existing Act (sections 8 to 18), provision is also being made in the proposed legislation for the declaration of a person to be unfit to possess arms. This is being done in clauses 11 to 17. The Commissioner may in certain prescribed circumstances declare a person to be unfit. There is a right of appeal to the Minister against such declaration of unfitness (clause 14). A judge or magistrate presiding at the trial in any criminal proceedings, is also being granted the right to declare the accused to be an unfit person. The provisions of this Bill, as far as this aspect is concerned, are for the most part in accordance with those of the existing Act, but with one, difference, as already mentioned, i.e. that whereas at present a magistrate declares persons to be unfit, that function is now being assigned to the Commissioner of Police.</p>

<p><b>Dealers in arms and ammunition</b></p>

<p>Clauses 18 to 24 relate to dealers in arms and ammunition, and clause 19 provides that the Commissioner may, subject to the directions of the Minister, only issue white persons and &#x201C;white&#x201D; companies with licences to deal in arms and ammunition. A right of appeal to the Minister is granted if the Commissioner should refuse to grant a dealer&#x2019;s licence. These provisions are mainly in accordance with the existing provision.</p>

<p><b>Importation and exportation of arms and ammunition</b></p>

<p>Clauses 25 to 27 relate to the importation and exportation of arms and ammunition. These provisions are mainly of an administrative nature and merely prescribe procedure which, it is expected, can be carried out without problems. In broad outline this is also in accordance with the existing provisions of the Act. It will be possible to prescribe further procedures in this regard by regulation.</p>

<p><b>Manufacture of arms and ammunition</b></p>

<p>As is the case in existing legislation, the manufacture of arms, is being restricted to a factory registered under the Factories, Machinery and Building Works Act (Act No. 22 of 1941), and that of ammunition to an explosives factory licensed under the Explosives Act (Act No. 26 of 1956) or the corresponding Ordinances of the territory of South-West Africa, and in both cases in accordance with a permit issued by the Minister (clauses 28 to 36).</p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous provisions</b></p>

<p>The following are the most important provisions under this heading:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Clause 32 places a prohibition on the unauthorized importation, supply or possession of certain classes of firearms or articles, such as cannons, machine guns, grenades and bombs, etc., and is verbally identical with the provisions of the existing section 1.</li>

<li>(2) Clause 3 grants the Minister wide powers which he may exercise in the interests of pubic safety and maintaining law and order, and in terms of which he may prohibit or restrict the importation of certain articles. Basically these provisions are in accordance with the existing sections 26 and 27.</li>

<li>(3) Clauses 35 and 36 place a prohibition on the unauthorized supply of arms and ammunition and are for the most part in accordance with the present section 23 of the existing Act. Clause 35 (2) has been added to enable, for instance, members of the Defence Force, Prisons and Police to purchase ammunition for official arms for purposes of sport.</li>

<li>(4) Clause 37 deals with the possession of firearms by juveniles, and its wording is for the most part identical with the corresponding provision of the existing Arms and Ammunition Act (seotion 29). The age limit here is also 16 years to fit in with the provisions already discussed (see clauses 3 and 8 above). However, in order to enable youths to use a firearm under supervision, I intend to add the following subsection to clause 45&#x2014;</li>

<li>(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act contained it shall be permissible for any white person over the age of 21 years who is in lawful possession of an arm, to allow a white person under the age of 16 years to use such arm under his immediate supervision.</li>

</ol>

<p>This new subsection has already been placed on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>(5) Clause 38: In terms of this clause any person must report to the Police the loss of any firearm which used to be in his possession. These measures have become essential owing to the large number of arms being lost or stolen through irresponsibility and subsequently landing in undesirable hands. This provision has already been embodied in the existing Act&#x2014;see section 3 of Act 64 of 1965 &#x2014;but the date of commencement has not been announced as yet.</p>

<p>The obligation to report to a policeman the loss, theft or destruction of an arm within 48 <span class="col_4881-4882" refersTo="page_0928"/>hours, is not an unreasonable one and does not place any major burden on the citizenry. This is essential for the effective control of arms in general and definitely for the keeping of the firearms register.</p>

<p>(6) Clause 41: This clause makes provision for the powers of the Police to search and seize, and is in accordance with the existing provision in section 33.</p>

<p>(7) Clause 42: This clause grants the Commissioner the power to keep a central firearms register, which has already been referred to. A similar provision has already been effected in the existing Act in terms of section 4 of Act 64 of 1965. Clause 42 (2) is necessary for the furnishing of proof.</p>

<p>Other miscellaneous provisions include offences and penalties, presumptions, regulations, savings and the repeal of laws, which are not considered necessary to be discussed any further at this juncture.</p>

<p>This legislation will apply in South-West Africa, including the Eastern Caprivi Strip, and will come into operation on a date to be fixed by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<p>This Bill affects many citizens of the Republic, i.e. all those people who are in lawful possession of firearms or even those who possess firearms for which they have no licences. The Bill has been drafted in such a way as to exercise control in respect of practical circumstances. Consequently it is simple to read and fairly easy to understand. I think any hon. member of the House who takes an interest in this, would not have experienced any difficulty in grasping the implications of this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister is quite right that the Bill, as it now reads, certainly makes it much clearer for the public exactly where they stand and what their rights are. However, I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that where you bring a Bill which both consolidates and amends, it seems to me that it is always wise to produce a White Paper with it so that members can in fact see what the changes are that are being brought about. A consolidating Bill is one thing; an amending Bill is another. But one that consolidates and amends at the same time without any indication being given as to what the changes are, is not a Bill that, I believe, members can easily find their way around. Although this Bill reads very well, it is very difficult to know quite what changes are made.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has given a very good exposition of the provisions of the Bill and what they are intended to meet. However, there is just one thing which I would like to refer to. I think the hon. the Minister mentioned all these various cases of the children playing with guns, who wounded each other, killed each other or killed other people as a reason why the age was being raised from 14 to 16. I think that will not help us at all. That is a case of clear negligence on the part of the parents in allowing their firearms to be in the vicinity of small children. I do not think I can speak too strongly about this sort of matter. One cannot deal too strongly with these matters. There is no doubt that this can be dealt with under the provisions of this Bill. The principle that is involved here, as the hon. the Minister rightly says, is a principle which we have really accepted in the existing legislation.</p>

<p>The idea behind this re-registration is to provide&#x2014;and this is the only way, as the hon. the Minister points out, it can be provided&#x2014;a central register for firearms in the Republic. Without such a central register we shall never be able to control firearms properly. Therefore, we are very pleased to see that this has been provided for in the Bill. It is something for which we on this side of the House have pleaded both here and in the Other Place. We agree that when the general re-registration takes place an amnesty period should be given to people so that they cannot be prosecuted if they go to the Police and present the firearm to them whilst they are not in possession of a firearms licence. They can then hand it in and if they are fit and proper persons to possess a firearm they will eventually on payment of their fee receive a licence together with the firearm. Surely, one should also provide if there is going to be any sort of decent register so that the firearms which are found by the Police can be traced, that with this general registration persons who have licences, but who have either lost their firearm or it has been destroyed or stolen should also be obliged to satisfy the Commissioner that they have firearms for which the licences were issued. Otherwise the people will not come forward if they do not have this protection. We feel that it should be provided for that not only should the licence be produced, but also that the person concerned should also satisfy the Commissioner that he is in fact in possession of a firearm. I do not suggest by that that he should necessarily have to take all his weapons if he is a collector and has 30 or 40 of these weapons to the Police Station. He should merely satisfy the Commissioner in whatever way applies to his case.</p>

<p>The other aspect of this Bill, to which we shall give more attention in the Committee Stage, follows directly on the Department of Police taking over the control of arms and ammunition. That is the matter the hon. the Minister referred to in dealing with clause 11. There the Commissioner can now declare persons to be unfit to possess arms. At the moment the Act provides that a magistrate may declare a person to be unfit to possess an arm. The procedure at the moment is that if the magistrate receives an affidavit or any information given under oath that a person has, <i>inter alia,</i> discharged a firearm at a person or threatened to kill someone, or by his negligence had injured other people or grossly negligently has <span class="col_4883-4884" refersTo="page_0929"/>injured someone, then the magistrate must call upon the person concerned to show cause on a certain day why he should not declare him to be a person who is not fit to possess a firearm. In other words, the very basic maxim of our law and our jurisprudence is obeyed, because you do hear the other side. It is a most serious matter to deprive someone of a firearm, because it applies for a minimum of three years. We feel that he should at least have the opportunity of indicating that the information obtained on oath is false or that it is misleading or that it was not he who committed this act or whatever the case may be. He at least should be able to put his case. One of the reasons why a person can be declared unfit to possess a firearm is if he loses that firearm through gross negligence. I know that there is an amendment on the Order Paper which provides that the Commissioner may not use that power without getting approval of the Minister, but if we look at (c) it also provides for a person &#x201C;who has by means of an arm killed or injured any other person through negligence or wantonly or through negligence endangered the life or limb of any other person&#x201D;. This is a matter of fact and a matter of law; therefore, it is a matter in which one should hear the other side and in which the person concerned should be entitled to put forward his version of the case. Moreover, the law, at the moment, provides that this should be done by a trained judicial officer. This officer sifts the facts and determines in a conflict of facts what the position really is. We feel that this protection for the individual should remain. We shall move an amendment to this effect in due course. However, members will appreciate that as the clause stands at the moment, it is wide open to abuse, it is open to persons who may carry a grudge to lodge their complaints and there is no obligation on the Commissioner at all to verify those facts or to find out from the persons concerned whether those facts are true. I appreciate that the hon. the Minister may feel that if a statement is made on oath that a person has conducted himself with a firearm in such a way as aforementioned, he should immediately be dispossessed of the firearm in the interest of the public. We agree that if it appears to the Commissioner that this person is a danger to the community or himself, he should be declared unfit to possess a firearm and that he should be dispossessed of it immediately. What we should like to see is that this should then be reported to the magistrate of the district and that the inquiry, which is provided for in the present law, should continue to be held. In other words, the power exists and the situation can be dealt with immediately. A magistrate then investigates the matter, after calling on the person to show cause. Whether he is there or not, he will hold an inquiry.</p>

<p>The magistrate then, in his discretion, should be entitled, after having heard all the facts, to determine whether that order should stand or whether it should be withdrawn. Thereafter, there is still, as it exists in the present law, and if the amendment is accepted, an appeal from that decision to the Minister. I hope that the hon. the Minister will give this his consideration, because we believe that it is a provision which it is necessary to have because it has withstood the test of time and it certainly does not in any way influence the action of the Commissioner in depriving irresponsible persons of arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>As regards this whole question of losing arms through gross negligence, I may say that there are many differences of opinion. I have had a case during the last recess, of someone who went away on holiday and he locked his revolver in a drawer. He consciously applied his mind to the hiding of his firearm; he locked it away in the drawer and went away for a few days. When he came back the revolver was gone. He had forgotten that it was quite easy to take out the drawer just above it, and remove the gun. Now, this was unfortunate because that man actually applied his mind to the problem and thought he was putting it away safely. Now, by virtue of the present Act, the Minister of Justice refused to allow this person to possess a firearm, despite the fact that he has had the firearm for many years and that he needed it for the protection of his family. In my own judgment this is a matter which should go to a judicial officer. I should have said he was not grossly negligent, although he might have been careless, because he actually applied his mind to the subject. I might be considered grossly negligent if I am out for the evening and I put my firearm in a certain place. I shall not mention the place across the floor of this House, but I can assure hon. members that it is the safest place where a firearm can be put. However, the place where I keep my firearm might not be regarded as properly safe.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, with pleasure. If I were to go away and lock my firearm in the wardrobe or in a drawer and lock all the drawers it would probably not be regarded as negligent. However, if your house is burgled the first thing they will go for is your wardrobe, because they will look for clothes and they will most probably find the firearm there. In such a case the person would probably not be accused of being negligent as he did lock it up. Now, this brings me to the whole problem of losses of firearms. So many firearms are lost or stolen when people are away from their homes. They might be on holiday, they might be overseas or whatever the case may be and they do not want to take the firearms with them; very often you cannot take them with you, especially if you have one or two shotguns. Therefore, if you go away, you try to put your firearm in a safe place or you <span class="col_4885-4886" refersTo="page_0930"/>try to lock it up. However, there is no safe place in a house.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Even a safe is not safe.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>As my hon. friend says even a safe is not safe. I plead that there should be provision made by the State for some sort of repository for firearms. This repository should be a safe place where people can deposit their firearms when they go away. We earnestly make this suggestion because we believe it will help to avoid the theft of arms from people when they are away on holiday. The difficult position at the moment is that if you go to a local police station, they are not prepared to accept the responsibility of storing your firearm during that period. They simply will not do it. Now what is a person to do&#x003F; He will either take it with him, or if he does not want to have this dangerous weapon with him, he will put it away in some safe place in the house. But apart from the place which I can suggest as I have said, there is no real safe place in a house. We shall suggest in the Committee State that the Minister takes power to provide for repositories for arms in various centres, wherever it it feasible and practicable. If necessary the firearms can be deposited at the repository for a certain fee or on the conditions as he would like to prescribe. If this is done, then there will be a place where the public can leave their firearms with the assurance that they will not be stolen. They will have the assurance that their weapon will not endanger the lives of others if it is stolen, as it is at the moment. I want to say that this could also be enlarged so as to provide that private persons such as gunsmiths who have the storing facilities, might be able to keep firearms. At the moment these people are not entitled to do it because of the definition of the possession of firearms in the present Act. I may say that provision for repositories was made in Kenya during the Mau-Mau crisis and it helped a great deal to prevent the arms from getting into the hands of the wrong people.</p>

<p>Therefore, at this stage we offer no objection to this Bill at the Second Reading, but we shall move these amendments as I have mentioned. These amendments will appear on the Order Paper and we hope the Minister will give them his earnest consideration.</p>
