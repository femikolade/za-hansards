<heading>MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE</heading>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House has no confidence in the Government.</block>

<p>It will be seen that the motion is in general terms. When one has regard to the number of subjects which we wish to discuss with the hon. the Prime Minister during the course of this Session then I should say it is correctly phrased. You see, Sir, there have been a number of controversial administrative decisions, there have been questions like manpower, research, the drought, and what the Government&#x2019;s agricultural policy is in connection with that drought. There has been growing dissatisfaction in the civil service and there has been a deterioration of Post Office facilities. There is moreover a host of other matters crying out for attention. At the same time, when one examines the legislative programme of the Government in so far as it has been revealed in the State President&#x2019;s speech, and the flexibility of the new procedure which we hope to adopt in this House this Session, then I think it is clear that opportunities will arise later for a discussion of all those matters.</p>

<p>I have therefore decided this afternoon to concentrate on what is perhaps the fundamental matter in South African politics, namely the race relations issue. I was constrained to say on a former occasion in this House that it was an illusion to believe what this Government was doing was in any way providing a solution to that problem. Another year has passed since then and during that time it has become increasingly clear, not only to me but also to many members of the public outside, and I believe to many supporters of the Nationalist Party that the Government&#x2019;s policy in this regard is an arrant failure.</p>

<p>I believe the Prime Minister is in a dilemma: I believe he has three groups amongst his supporters. I limit it to three groups at this stage, though we may agree to extend the number later. I think the first group consists of those who believe that, if only the Prime Minister would spend more money on developing the Bantu reserves, and developing them more rapidly, he could still rake the chestnuts out of the fire and make a success of his policy.</p>

<p>Then there is a second group. They believe he is already spending too much money on the Bantu and too little on the Whites. They are showing signs of resentment. To put it mildly, they are showing a lack of enthusiasm for his policy.</p>

<p>Then there is a third group, who accept that the ultimate objectives of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy are unattainable. They are urging him to settle for limited objectives and to give us blueprints of the steps which the Government are going to take to achieve those limited objectives.</p>

<p>Then the Prime Minister is faced with two other very important and very awkward facts. The first is that, whatever may be the position of the Bantu in South Africa generally, the standard of living of the Bantu in the reserves over the last 15 or 16 years has either been static or it has fallen. The second fact is that the figures on which the policy was originally based have turned out to be inaccurate figures. It seems that there must have been some mistake in that 1951 census. It is quite clear now that the projections for the year 2000 are very different from what they were when this policy was originally formulated. The Prime Minister is faced with the fact that in the next 25 or 30 years he will have to make provision, not for the number of Bantu originally envisaged, but for at least 8 million additional Bantu, all of whom will probably be outside the reserves. That means that they are going to be 18 or 19 million in all outside the reserves, even if he achieves the rate of development laid down by the Tomlinson Commission. The question is: How does he fit them into his policy?</p>

<p>If one has regard to these facts and the impact they have had upon the public, it is small wonder that there have been calls for a &#x201C;volkskongres&#x201D;. The calls for a &#x201C;volkskongres&#x201D; seem to have come from two quarters. <i>Die Vaderland</i> says that there should be a &#x201C;volkskongres&#x201D; to reaffirm the belief in the sovereign independence of the different races uncompromisingly before the world, and to mobilize the people of South Africa for the biggest attempt in their history to make separate development a reality in the next 10 years.</p>

<p>Professor Rhoodie of Pretoria University believes that they should take the initiative at a &#x201C;volkskongres&#x201D; in providing South Africa with a blueprint of minimum objectives, since the maximum targets of the apartheid policy will never be achieved. I believe that the policy has failed already. I do not believe that a &#x201C;volkskongres&#x201D; is needed to find that out. Therefore I would say that, even before a &#x201C;volkskongres&#x201D; let us try and decide what the <span class="col_0017-0018" refersTo="page_0026"/>targets of this policy really are. I think the main objectives are twofold.</p>

<p>The first objective is the separation of Black from White. The second is the establishment of separate states, what hon. members opposite regard as separate nations. [Interjections.] When hon. gentlemen opposite have been able to rearrange their thoughts, let me remind them of the election manifesto of 1948 of the Nationalist Party, on which the policy was based, and which set out what were called the &#x201C;fundamental principles of apartheid&#x201D;, stating that the Natives would be given the chance to develop morally, economically, and politically, &#x201C;maar alles op hul eie terrein&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Dr. Malan enlarged on this and said that theoretically the objective of the policy of apartheid can be fully achieved by dividing the country into two states, all the Whites in one and all the Blacks in another. Then SABRA went on and said the purpose should be to develop the Native territories so intensively as to draw in all those Bantu who are resident in the European area. Dr. Verwoerd was Minister of Native Affairs at the time and he responded in the Senate by saying that the attitudes of the churches, the Sabra people and his own were the same and he deplored any attempts to drive wedges between them. In later statements he made it clear that his objective at that time was not only to give a home for the natural increase of those who were there already but also for those who were outside the homelands in the White areas. The fact of the matter is that when you read those early speeches you come to the conclusion that originally the idea of apartheid was complete separation between Black and White. One gets the idea that that was their target. I know that this idea has been modified and I am not going to hold hon. members opposite to this. They have quite obviously changed their ideas, because when the White Paper was issued on the Tomlinson Report we were told that they will be satisfied if, within 50 years, there were equal numbers of Black and White in the White areas. I have indicated in this House before what the implications of such a policy are, but I think it will be well to refresh the memories of hon. members as we are going to discuss this matter in some detail. Hon. members will recall that this White Paper was published in 1956. The elapse of 50 years will bring us to about the year 2000. This was the furthest date for which we had realistic population projections. Our latest population figures were estimated in 1967. It was estimated that there were 3.6 million Whites, 12.7 million Bantu, of whom only 4.5 million were in the reserves. Previous to these projections it was estimated that by the year 2000 there would be 6 million Whites. That means that if the objective of the party was to be achieved, namely equal numbers of Whites and Blacks in the White areas, only 6 million Blacks could be left in the White areas. Since there are already 4.5 million in the reserves, and assuming that they can absorb the natural increase in the reserves, it means that approximately 8 million Bantu would have to be moved from the White areas to the reserves over the next 32 years. This means an average of about 250,000 a year. I do not say that it is a quarter of a million every year, as, obviously, smaller numbers will be moved at the start. If one has regard to the numbers which have to be moved the average will be 250,000 a year. The figures on which that projection was based have been proved to be wrong and the present Director of Census, Dr. Stoker, has made it clear that he believes that by the year 2000 there will be 7 million Europeans, but that there will be round about 28 million Bantu. If one wants to achieve one&#x2019;s objective with those figures, it means that one will not have to move 250,000 a year, but that one will have to start by moving 400,000 a year in order to get them all back into the reserves in 32 years time. One will then be left with equal numbers of Whites and Blacks in the White area. This is always assuming that the reserves can absorb their own natural increase. This is what is meant by separation in accordance with the policy of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, let us deal with the target of creating separate states for what hon. members opposite call &#x201C;separate nations&#x201D;. This is supposed to be the second target of their policy. This has been stated on many occasions, but I should like to recall only two speeches made by Dr. Verwoerd when he was still Prime Minister. In 1963 he said that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not take the road of oppression and we also wish to remove discrimination. One wants to grant to the other man what one wants for oneself.</block>

<p>He made it clear on many occasions that what he meant was sovereign independent states for the various ethnic groups, now called separate nations. Then the present Prime Minister gave unequivocal support for that policy when he took over from Dr. Verwoerd, and made it quite clear that he believed in the policy of separate development, not only as a philosophy, so he said, but as the only solution, the only practical solution to do justice to every population group as well as to every one of their members. I want to be fair to hon. members opposite and say that I believe that this is their moral justification for their policy. I believe that this is the moral justification which, they believe, can be reconciled with Christian principles. For that reason I am sure it came as no surprise to them to find that the Afrikaanse Galvinistiese Beweging indicated that the Church would have to fight apartheid unless there was such an intensification of development as to make it clear that discriminatory measures at present being applied were justified only as transitional measures and not as permanent measures. It was stated that if there were not development to indicate that these measures were only transitional measures, these measures would become <span class="col_0019-0020" refersTo="page_0027"/>oppressive and intolerable and that as such the Church would have to fight them.</p>

<p>I know, Sir, that it is easy to grant independence. One can grant independence to any group of people living within a state on their own, but I say that it is extremely irresponsible to grant independence unless the group concerned conform to certain requirements. The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has made it clear that he regards one of those requirements to be the requirement that the State concerned should be reasonably viable and that it should be able to create employment possibilities at decent standards of living for a large section of its population, if not for everyone of them. I do not think I am doing the hon. the Minister an injustice by putting it in this way. But, Sir, if these are the objectives&#x2014;I think hon. members opposite would agree that I am doing them no injustice in stating their objectives in this way&#x2014;let us then ask, how far has this Government got in reaching those objectives? I have certain facts and figures available. We do not, of course, always agree with one another and how these facts and figures should be interpreted. Therefore I should like to give the views of one or two intellectuals, one or two experts, one or two moral leaders, even one or two leader writers of the otherwise subservient Nationalist Press, to see what they think about the progress that is being made.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I can understand the perfectly understandable disquiet of the hon. the Minister. After all, he was Minister of Information for some time. Hence he should be an expert on this matter. However, I want to start by quoting the views expressed by Professor Rhoodie of the University of Pretoria. Professor Rhoodie is the professor in anthropology and Bantu administration. His writings have often been quoted in this House by hon. members opposite. In fact, so well-known is he that I believe the Ministry of Information supplies copies of certain of his books to its offices throughout the world so that these books may be available to those wishing to study South African affairs, especially people whom they want to impress. I have already quoted Professor Rhoodie as having said at Kempton Park that the maximum targets of the apartheid policy would never be achieved. In making that statement, he was quite clearly unhappy about what the Government had done so far to develop the homelands. He was, quite clearly, unhappy about what they have done to make separation a reality. He stressed that the development of the homelands was the key to the successful application of apartheid. He made two observations which I think are very important. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All our pretty plans for the elimination of Bantu labour will work out to a round nought if such a process is not synchronized with the creation of substitute employment in the homelands.</block>

<p>That, I think, speaks for itself. Later on he dealt with the tempo of the development in the reserves. He examined it carefully and felt that it was far behind what was necessary to create the economic magnetism which would attract the Bantu out of the White areas into the reserves. He went on to say that if one reviewed the figures, there were massive arrears and that the figures in respect of the job needs of the Bantu tell the same story. To put it in his own words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Even in relation to the minimum demands made by the supporters of apartheid for the successful application of the policy, there will have to be radical intervention if there is to be any chance within the next 30 to 50 years of the establishment of a White South Africa in which the Whites would have the majority within their homeland.</block>

<p>That, Sir, is his view. And he is not alone in expressing this view. It is quite clear from the October issue of <i>Woord en Daad</i> that what upset the Calvinistiese Beweging was disillusionment and disappointment at the slow rate of development within the reserves. Furthermore, there was a spate of reaction from the Afrikaans Press. There were two long editorials in <i>Die Transvaler,</i> expressing deep concern about the slow development and calling for a massive Volkskongres &#x201C;to make the average White aware of the urgency of the issue&#x201D;. They also indicated that although they thought there had been progress, the pace had been far too slow. They expressed the opinion that the policy can only succeed if the Government get the co-operation of the public. They went on to make this extraordinary statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is no exaggeration to say that Afrikaners particularly display no interest in a policy aimed at safeguarding their own future.</block>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I read <i>Die Transvaler</i> very often indeed and it is so that there are few other papers which amuse me more. I have already quoted <i>Die Vaderland.</i> Then there was <i>Dagbreek</i> as well. <i>Dagbreek</i> posed the question whether it would be possible materially to reduce the Bantu labour force without reducing the tempo of economic development in the White areas and without getting it below the 5 per cent annually aimed at by the Government. They lay <span class="col_0021-0022" refersTo="page_0028"/>emphasis on the key question, i.e. the more rapid development of the homelands. The editor went on to write that at the present rate of development there was little prospect, as development would be far short of the 180,000 new jobs annually which would be required from 1975 onwards to cope with the &#x201C;tuisland-inwoners en hulle natuurlike aanwas&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman wants to know why I see this problem only as a problem of numbers. It is because if it is quite clear that the policy is impracticable, then theories about it will not help you. This is the trouble with hon. members opposite&#x2014;they have the most beautiful theories and they satisfy their consciences with those theories although these theories are quite unrealistic when they try to put them into practice. Here you have the editor of <i>Dagbreek</i> indicating that if the Government is to develop the reserves to get anywhere within reach of its objectives, then it will have to be supplying 180.000 new jobs annually for the inhabitants of the reserves; and it realizes that there is no possibility whatever of that happening. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is &#x2019;n groot ideaal van selfhulp waar voor egter die tyd hopeloos te min is.</block>

<p>Then the hon. gentleman goes on to indicate that he believes that the only way to do this or to be realistic about it is to allow in private White capital, which the United Party has been pleading for for many years.</p>

<p>Sir, I have quoted these views just as a background, because I think they are an impressive contradiction of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s publicly expressed belief that the race problem has been solved in practice and in theory in South Africa.</p>

<p>Now let us come to the facts and figures of which this House should be aware and in respect of which I want to refresh their memories. If the present new projections are correct, then the average rate of removal from the White areas to the reserves must be at a tempo of 400.000 per year over the next 32 years. Now, what has been happening up to now? First of all, there is the period 1951 to 1960, and here I am dealing only with the urban areas in South Africa and not with the rural areas. In the nine-year period, 1951 to 1960, the Whites in the urban areas increased by 486.000, but the Bantu by 1,080.000. Then comes a projection for 1967, which comes from the Department of Statistics, and it suggests that over that seven-year period, while the Whites in the urban areas increased by 559,000, the Bantu increased by 996,000. If those figures are correct, then between 1951 and 1967, under this apartheid Government, one of whose objectives is separating Whites from Blacks, the number of Bantu in our urban areas has increased by over 2 million. Sir, what does that mean? It means that between 1951 and 1960 the Bantu in the urban areas were increasing by 120,000 a year, and between 1961 and 1967 the pace has gone up to 142,000 or 143,000 a year.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman is perfectly correct. How is he going to separate the Bantu from the work opportunities; and having separated them, how is he going to maintain the economic standards of the Bantu and maintain the tempo of economic development in the White areas? Is this the separation of the races? [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Is this the separation of the races? And you will notice, Sir, that I have made no mention of the rural areas. I am not satisfied with those figures and I prefer not to be associated with them. But there are indications of a very large increase as well.</p>

<p>Now, let us look at it from another angle. Take the figures for the manufacturing industry in South Africa, and you find that in 1961, in manufacturing industry, there were 30 per cent White workers in industry. By 1967 the figure was down to 25.4 per cent, and in 14 out of the 22 major industries in the manufacturing industry field there was an increase of Bantu. By 1971 it is estimated that the percentage of Whites in manufacturing industry will be 20 per cent. For just one year. 1966-&#x2019;67, there was a news release from the Bureau of Statistics and they indicated that in certain leading industries, mining, manufacturing, construction, electricity, Railways and the Post Office, there was an increase of 38,000 Bantu in one year and a decrease of 3.000 Whites. Sir. I would say that these figures leave no doubt whatsoever that the South African economy is entirely dependent on the use of its non-White labour force. I think this was borne out last year when in October Mr. Tom Murray, the secretary of the Boilermakers&#x2019; Union, suggested to the Government that they should apply their own job reservation policy in the engineering industry in the White areas only. But what happened? There was an immediate reaction from the Minister of Labour who was most indignant. He wanted to know what was going to happen to the 200-odd thousand Bantu in the engineering industry; where they were going to get employment, and he wanted to know where the Whites were to be obtained who were going to do their work. He said it would create chaos in the industry. Mr. Speaker, I agree with him; it would have created chaos in the steel industry. But by the same token is there any industry in South <span class="col_0023-0024" refersTo="page_0029"/>Africa in which there would not be chaos if the Bantu labour force were removed?</p>

<p>That is the problem, Sir, and the whole fact of the matter is that separation is not taking place; integration is taking place and at a faster rate than at any time in our history. And yet their objective, Sir, is separation of the White from the Black. I know the Government has been trying desperately to window-dress the situation. First of all, there was the job reservation policy. Sir, that has not reduced the number of Bantu in white industries. In any event, it affects only 2 per cent of the entire working population. Now we have the Physical Planning Act, and one of the objectives of that is to decrease the number of Bantu labourers in the metropolitan areas. The hon. the Minister is on record as saying: &#x201C;If any new zoning of industrial land meant an increase of Bantu workers then I would not give permission for it. Even a ratio of one white worker to one Bantu worker would mean an increase of Bantu labour and therefore would be disallowed.&#x201D; Sir, that is all very well, but there are certain hard facts of life about South African industry, and the first is that in only one industry of the 22 major industries do Whites outnumber Bantu, and the second is that in the rest, Bantu outnumber Whites by approximately three to one. But when you come to agriculture and mining, of course, the figure is nine to one. If the Minister is planning to reduce that labour force, then he is planning something very drastic indeed. I believe he is not going to succeed, number one, because white industries need Black labour; and number two, because the Government is failing to create sufficient employment for the Bantu in their own areas, and that is one of the vital things. Then, Sir, there has been another device and that is to turn all Bantu labour in the Republic into migrant labour. We know what is happening. They are allowed to work here for a period; then they have to go back to the reserves and queue up to come again, and there seems a danger that in due course they may lose the protection which some of them have under Section 10. I suppose the object is to strengthen their bonds with the reserves and to create the impression with the public that they are only here temporarily. But, Sir, is that going to reduce the number of Black workers? I do not believe that it is going to reduce the number. I believe it is merely going to mean that all of them are going to be foreigners and migrants and that we shall find that 80 per cent of our labour force consists of foreigners and migrants and that we have all the evils of migrant labour attaching to the full 80 per cent of our labour force. Hon. members opposite are very conversant with the evils of migrant labour. They were well dealt with in <i>Die Kerkbode</i> of October last year by Dominee A. M. Scheffler. This is what he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ample examples of degeneracy can be found in all our urban areas. People are totally cut off from their natural ties with the result that all that is good and positive in their own culture is lost. The Bantu then becomes a tragic imitator of the very worse that Western civilization offers, such as, among other things, the emergence of tsotsis who place in danger the lives of all and everyone in our Bantu areas.</block>

<p>Then, Sir, he went on to deal with immorality, homosexuality and the unhealthy state of affairs of these people being away from their homes, crowded together as they are, and pointed out that everybody who knew anything about it knew that this evil was on the increase.</p>

<p>Sir, this is the parrot-cry that comes from the other side of the House when this matter is discussed. Let me deal with it at once. Quite obviously in the reserves and amongst the Bantu population there are numbers of young men who are not yet married for whom migrant labour is a very useful outlet. Obviously also there are certain industries in which it is very difficult to spend capital on housing because they are of a temporary nature, and the hon. gentlemen know only too well that mining is one of those.</p>

<p>The hon. member talks about the Chamber of Mines. Why was it that when the new minefields were opened in the Free State and the people involved in opening those mines asked permission to have a certain percentage of their labourers permanently there with home ownership and their families with them, it was turned down by this Government? Why was it? If migrant labour on the mines is a bad thing, why extend it? I am saying that migratory labour is open to many evils and I am saying that the system which is now being embarked upon by this Government is going to lead to greater inefficiency in our labour, a lack of permanency, a lack of training, and a lack of benefits not only to the employer but the employee as well.</p>

<p>No, of course not. How can the hon. gentleman ask such idiotic questions? I have said where possible I am extremely anxious for them to enjoy family life and home ownership. I realize I cannot change South Africa overnight. I am not like one of these Ministers who think they can say &#x201C;abracadabra&#x201D; and the Bantu question is gone. I am a realist, I know what is happening <span class="col_0025-0026" refersTo="page_0030"/>in South Africa, and I can tell this hon. the Minister that one can cut migratory labour down a great deal and it will result in greater efficiency in the labour force, greater productivity, a greater rate of economic growth, and far more settled and happier conditions for everybody in this country.</p>

<p>It is against this background of failure that I think we have to look at the border industry policy and we have to find out what contribution that is making. The first thing one has to notice about the border industry policy is that the industries are still in the white areas, they are not in the Bantu areas,</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that is the intention. Quite right, and therefore the integration between Black and White economically is going on just the same as before. The only difference is it is going on at a far greater rate because they are encouraged in the border industries to use more and more Black workers and to let them do jobs which Whites are doing in other industries at lower rates of pay. The result is that the ratio in border industries is round about seven Blacks to one white. So one cannot say that border industries are doing much to separate the people. The only really successful border industries have been near the big cities, and whether the industries are developed there or at places like Vereeniging and Springs, is meaningless when you judge the number of Bantu in white areas and the separation of the races. I think the only significant advance in border industries, and that I give hon. members opposite as a present, it that it does help solve some sociological problems in that you get rid of migrant labour for border industries on the whole, you allow those people to live with their own families, a few hundred yards away, perhaps, or a mile or two away across the border in the Bantu reserve.</p>

<p>What has been achieved with this policy so far? According to the report, by 1967 there were employed in border industries in South Africa some 60,000 souls of which 47,000 were Bantu. This is only a drop in the ocean when you realize that our labour force is 2&#x00BC; million employed in the main industries of whom 1,418,000 are Bantu. Of the 1,418,000 Bantu 46,000 or 47,000 are now employed in border industries.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that; the hon. the Minister is quite right: These are the additional people for whom work has been found over the last six or seven years. But the actual figure, if you have regard to those who were there when the Government took over, who were put there by the old United Party government &#x2026; [Interjections.] I give it to him as a present. So we find that 46,000 more have been employed in this last six-year period. What has it cost per job per Bantu employed? If one adds up what has been spent by the Government and by private enterprise, it works out at roundabout R10,000 per job. No wonder the Minister of Planning says that border development is too slow.</p>

<p>Now we find that the industrialists are reluctant to undertake new projects until there is greater certainty about future development, the industrial climate and a stable domestic market. I know the Government has tried to provide even greater inducements for those engaging in border industries, and already there is a very impressive list. We have had a new list of growth points, some of which obviously are going to be developed by the expenditure of vast sums of Government money, like the Richards Bay-Empangeni complex. But nevertheless, there seems to be no prospect whatever that by 1971 border industries will give annually work to an additional 23,500 Bantu, which the I.D.C. regards as the minimum, because of the activities of the Minister of Planning and the desire to limit Bantu employment in white areas. But if employment is given to 23,500 a year, what is it going to cost to create those jobs?</p>

<p>At the present rate of expenditure it means that that development is going to cost R235 million a year. Where is that money coming from? 23,500 a year is only a drop in the ocean when one has regard to the fact that Bantu should be moved back into the reserves at the rate of approximately 400,000 per annum. One must never forget that before we can move Bantu back into the reserves, one has to create sufficient jobs for over 90,000 in natural increase in the reserves to be supported in the reserves each year. The trouble with this border industry development is that it militates against development inside the reserves, because these industries tend to be the kind that could be developed in the reserves. They militate against it, and development tends towards the nearest White growth centre outside the reserve where the industry is. It does not tend to development inside.</p>

<p>The second fact is that development of large towns on the borders of homelands of workers working in border industries leads to a lopsided and undesirable development of the reserves. Even the engineer advising the Department of Bantu Administration and Development made great play of that fact in a lecture in Pretoria.</p>

<p><span class="col_0027-0028" refersTo="page_0031"/>The third question is: Is it going to work successfully? At Cape Town there is a lecturer in regional planning, Professor Barac. He dealt with this matter in a lecture which he delivered in November of last year:</p>

<p>The establishment of new growth points should be done on a preferential basis, and only in the areas where a thorough investigation shows that they have a chance of undertaking their own economic development.</p>

<p>What is his comment, Mr. Speaker? He knew of no such investigation in the border areas. He pointed to what is happening in Britain. He showed how they had these ideas and how they failed, how finally they only moved industries to areas where there was an industrial infrastructure existing, and where there was such an existing network of transport and industry already that they had a chance of developing. He concluded his lecture by saying:</p>

<block name="quote">It seems that South Africa with her ideologically inspired border industries policy will have to learn from her own mistakes.</block>

<p>One of the matters that is worrying about this establishment of border industries is that the Government has a positive policy: But it also has a negative policy. It is discouraging the growth and extension of industries in many of the existing industrial areas where economic conditions are most favourable.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I forgot about the hon. the Minister. How do we sum the situation up? I suggest that we sum it up in this way: The border industries are developed at a great expense. They are developed by means of negative as well as positive measures. They assist in the solution of certain sociological problems, but as a means of achieving the Government&#x2019;s ideal of separation they are an utter failure. They do not separate Black from White economically, but instead bring them together faster in new areas. They do not create separate nations or states, but I think they illustrate the futility of such a concept in South Africa.</p>

<p>What other means can the Government use to promote separation and the development of the separate states? Quite obviously one method is massive development in the reserves to support a greater population and to magnetize labour from the White areas into the reserves. Do you know how much industrial development there is at the present time in the reserves, Mr. Speaker? I believe that in the Transkei 1,700 are employed in industries and that during the last six years new jobs in industry have been created for less than 1,000 Bantu in all the reserves in South Africa. If one should say that the mountain bore a mouse, I think that one would be insulting the mouse in this case. For these 945 jobs R1,100,000 has been spent on new factories. What has been spent on transport, housing, water, and other things we do not know. What is so interesting about this is that 12 years ago Tomlinson realized that the objectives which he set out were very limited, namely 10 million people in the reserves by 1990. He did not envisage the moving of 400,000 Bantu a year. Tomlinson believed that if he was to get 10 million Bantu in the reserves by about 1990, they would have to create, on an average, 20,000 new jobs in industry every year in the reserves. This means that during the last six years we should have created 120,000 new jobs in industry. We only created 945. This is the massive development in the reserves. A year ago there was a tour of those reserves by city councillors, managers of Bantu Affairs departments, and people of that kind. Practically everyone who came back and reported was disappointed at what they had seen and pointed out that those reserves would not take one-quarter of the number that will be necessary to carry out the Government&#x2019;s policy. While this delay is taking place the inhabitants of the reserves are getting poorer and poorer and not richer and richer. At the time of the Tomlinson Commission it was estimated that they were earning R25.8 per head in the reserves. To-day Dr. Adendorff says that they are earning only R22 per head in the reserves. Tomlinson estimated that the annual income per head in the reserves was R48. They got the rest from outside. It was being sent to them by people working outside. To-day, 16 years later, it is R53 per head. Have regard to the value of money, and you see that the standard of living of those people has been falling. It has not risen. This is the &#x201C;massive development&#x201D;, Sir. This is what the Nationalist Party propaganda describes as &#x201C;oreating a decent living fit for humans as soon as possible in the Bantu homelands, as the Christian principles of the apartheid policy demands&#x201D;. At this rate, Sir, it is perfectly clear that there is no hope whatever that the majority of the Bantu will ever be able to live in those homelands in decent circumstances. It is absolutely cynical for this Government to turn <span class="col_0029-0030" refersTo="page_0032"/>around and tell people that they can have their rights in those homelands when they know that they will never be able to support themselves there for as far as we can see into the future.</p>

<p>I want to say something else about this. On a previous occasion in this House I challenged the Government to disprove that if the reserves were to be developed at anything like the rate that Tomlinson envisaged, it would mean the resettlement of 400,000 families and that it would probably cost R800 million. That has never been denied, Sir. I have never been challenged on it. I want to mention an example of what has been happening. The example I want to take is the example of the Zulu nation, whose condition has recently been pretty competently examined by the agricultural editor of the <i>Mercury.</i> Here is what he found: He found that at a conservative estimate, there are 2 million Bantu in Natal who are going to have to be resettled and that for a large number of them jobs would have to be found. In the Tugela Basin alone he estimated that there was 500,000 unemployed. Sir, I visited the Tugela Basin, not so long ago with the hon. member for South Coast. I cannot describe to you what I saw there. I cannot describe to you the poverty that exists there. I cannot tell you what the soil looks like. But, Sir, I know that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development is already planning for Natal. They are planning 40 new Bantu towns in Natal to house 800,000 people. But it is not just 800.000 that have to be moved. The number is going to increase to 2 million very soon if it has not reached that figure already. This is going to require 300,000 new houses which, with the cost of resettlement, is going to mean an expenditure of approximately R200 million. But while 300,000 houses are necessary, only between 600 and 700 houses of a presentable type have been built outside the Port Natal area.</p>

<p>That is one problem. The other problem is that of these 2 million people. 1&#x00BD; million are not going to be able to make a living agriculturally in the future. They are going to have to be settled in industrial areas. So, quite apart from the cost of resettlement, what do you imagine it is going to cost to provide jobs for those 1&#x00BD; million breadwinners? I know that they will not all be breadwinners. Perhaps one in three or one in four will be breadwinners, but what is it going to cost? You see, Sir, this is the extent of the problem in Natal alone, leaving aside the Government&#x2019;s ideological aims and just looking at it as a sociological problem. You tell me, Sir, what hope has the Government of transforming these impoverished areas, each one a socio-economic problem of overwhelming magnitude on its own, into nation states that will afford acceptable outlets for the social, economic, political and other desires and ambitions of the Bantu people? Their only hope of rehabilitation is that they are part of a prosperous South Africa and that South African enterprise all over the country is offering them opportunities to work and to earn and eventually to prosper themselves.</p>

<p>The Government has been warned by many authorities of the dangers of delay and the dangers of allowing political progress to outstrip economic progress. We had a warning last year from Dr. Olivier, the Commissioner-General for Ovamboland, who warned that if the process of decreasing the numbers of Africans in the White areas proceeded at a slower rate, it might as well be abandoned. He went on to say that large-scale development of the homelands was the only possibility of making the policy a success. We had warnings from Professor Coetzee of Potchefstroom University, who warned that a slow rate of development or stagnation could lead to revolution, which could lead to other things of a less desirable nature. He made it clear that time and numbers were formidable allies in the fight against the Government. One must try to estimate what it is going to cost to develop these reserves in order to get this policy off the ground. I have repeatedly asked in this House what it will cost. I have had no cooperation from the Government so far. I know that there is a five-year plan which is being applied, and that it is expected that about R100 million per year will be spent up to the year 1971. Then I know that there are 400.000 families to be moved at a cost of R800 million. Possibly ten years could be set aside for that. That should be an additional R80 million per year. Then there is work to be found in industry for the natural increase of 39,000 in the reserves each year. What will that cost, Sir? Then there is the question of border industries. Money will have to be spent. It will be spent outside the reserves, it is true. If one totals the lot up, Sir, one reaches a figure of between R600 and R700 million annually, just to get this policy off the ground; just to reach a stage where one may find a platform from which to start.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman says that if they work on the Witwatersrand, it will not cost anything. Mr. Speaker, if you have regard to the vast numbers of unemployed, then this is over and above what would have to be spent on the Witwatersrand. If you have regard to the fact that the infra-structure for industry already exists up there and that many factories have the opportunity of merely expanding and extending, then I think the hon. gentleman begins to realize how foolish that remark of his was. You see, Sir, we are not helped by the vague statement we had from the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development last year. When we asked him what it was going to cost, what was his reply? He said: This is our policy and we are carrying it out. It does not matter what it costs. [Interjections.] Does it <span class="col_0031-0032" refersTo="page_0033"/>not, Mr. Speaker? He is going to repeat it. You know, Sir, I am beginning to think that there are two possible reasons for this reticence of the hon. the Minister. Either the fact is that he does not know, or he does know and the figure is so large that he realizes that the whole policy is impracticable. The more I look into the figures, the more I begin to think that the second is the real cause. He is afraid to tell the public of South Africa what it has cost to get this policy off the ground. That is the difficulty he is up against. I think that it is time we had a frank confession from the hon. the Prime Minister. I think he owes it to the public of South Africa. They have been told that they will have to make sacrifices. How big are those sacrifices going to be? What is the effect going to be on the economy of development of this kind and expenditure of this kind, and of a removal or change of the centre of industrial development from the White complexes to the non-White complexes? I know that the hon. the Prime Minister is in a difficult position. He has, as I have said before, three groups, each eagerly wanting to know where they stand with him. There are the sincere idealists in his party, quite prepared to make any sacrifice to carry out the policy, or almost any sacrifice. Then he has got the realists, who, after 20 years of frustration, are prepared to accept limited objectives, but want blueprints to know what the Government is going to do and what it is going to cost. Then, Sir, he has the blunt and the bluff, the true-blooded Nationalists, the people who have never believed that he intended to give the Bantustans sovereign independence, the people steeped in the pre-1948 tradition who are adamant about not spending money on the Bantu if they can possibly help it. These are the three groups the hon. gentleman faces. They are not going to have significant amounts of money spent on non-White peoples. But each of those three groups is entitled to know from the Prime Minister where he stands, and whether the Nationalist Party under this Prime Minister is still worthy of its support, because I have difficulty in seeing how all three groups can stay in one party like that. But above all, the people have a right to know who are the people of South Africa who are being called upon to make the sacrifices. They have a right to be told what is expected of them. At present it is just a case of blind man&#x2019;s buff and they do not know where they are going, and they doubt whether the Prime Minister knows where he is taking them.</p>

<p>Let me say that for our part, on this side of the House, it is really not of much importance what the Prime Minister answers. We are satisfied in our own minds that this policy has failed. We believe that every day that passes and every month that passes is going to show more and more to the public of South Africa that this policy has failed. I think the cardinal question to-day is not whether this policy can succeed or not. The cardinal question is what policy can be substituted for it. [Interjection.] Sir, I have said before in this House complete integration is as unacceptable as separate nation states are impracticable and dangerous. I have said before in this House that obviously the reserves must be developed to carry the maximum possible population and to release the pressures of their impoverished people on those areas already economically developed by the White people. Obviously the Bantu in the reserves, because of their poverty, can make very little contribution. Therefore it is going to fall on the White economy. But I believe the development of the reserve? must be achieved on a practical and realistic basis which the people of South Africa can afford, and without disrupting the existing economy. I believe that to achieve this objective the greatest single weapon which the Government could use, the weapon we would certainly use, is to employ private White capital and the economic skill and initiative of the White man, subject to proper safeguards, not only to enter the reserves, but to be used to encourage and activate the economy of the reserves. We stated our policy in that regard as early as 1954. May I read it to you, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas in the past Native labour from the reserves was progressively integrated with capital and industrial leadership outside the reserves, the need has now arisen, subject to strict safeguards, and in the case of appropriate industries, to integrate capital and industrial leadership with Native labour in the reserves.</block>

<p>Sir, there are many converts to that point of view to-day. There are intellectuals in the Nationalist Party; we have had members of SABRA; we have had church leaders; we have even had some of the Nationalist newspapers accepting that view. Does not the Government side realize that by the use of private White capital, subject to the right safeguards, they could develop those reserves at infinitely less cost to the State and the taxpayer? Do they not realize that by making use of private White capital they could develop those reserves very much more rapidly?</p>

<p>We are realistic enough at the same time to realize that no matter how the reserves develop, neither now nor in the future will it be possible for us to dispense with the Bantu labour force in our existing industrial and mining areas, on our farms and in our homes, just as we accept that it will not be possible to squeeze the entire Native population into the reserves. Even Tomlinson realized that, despite the fact that he envisaged development at a far greater tempo than this Government has ever undertaken. I want to say, Sir, that it will be our aim to establish this labour force as a stable element with, wherever possible, rights <span class="col_0033-0034" refersTo="page_0034"/>to family life and home ownership and with a real stake in maintaining a law-abiding South African society, an element, in fact, in marked contrast to the rightless, rootless mass of migrants with which this Government is encircling our industrial centres. But at the same time potential points of friction will be avoided and race harmony fostered by accepting that social and residential separation have become part of the convention and the traditions of the South African way of life.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another point, and that is that while we accept the permanence of both an urban and a rural Bantu labour force, that acceptance does not mean that we can dispense with influx control. That control remains necessary to prevent social chaos and economic injustice. The hon. gentlemen know what I mean by that. The labour force will be encouraged to make its contribution to the production of our national wealth, and to that end will be afforded training and education within the framework of our industrial democracy. We cannot compete in world markets and compete against highly trained labour forces with a labour force that is illiterate and untrained or semi-trained. But at the same time we make it clear that in no circumstances will the employment of that labour force be permitted to undermine the standards already achieved by other population groups. In this matter the Government will share the vigilance of our existing trade union movement. I am convinced that such a policy will open new vistas of achievement in the South African economy from which all sections of the population will benefit most substantially. Of course, Sir, what worries most South Africans is not the economic side but the political structure of the South Africa of the future. I want to say I share that concern, because White South Africans, outnumbered as they are by many millions of Bantu, very often at a very low state of development, a primitive state of development, have fears for the future which I believe are reasonable. I do not believe the concept of apartheid as it is now developing will ever allay those fears, because the policy is being shown to be more and more impracticable. The races in South Africa are not separated economically, politically and territorially. We can practise conventional separation, especially on the social and residential levels, and I have already indicated that that is sensible. But to think that we can live in separate states, divorced from one another, I believe is a complete impracticability. Now, as I have indicated, we cannot contemplate a completely integrated society. That would be to ignore the truth and to deny the facts and to create disorder and utter confusion in South Africa. We recognize that instead of offering a policy that will not work, and instead of seeking the doubtful security of a smaller South Africa, and eventually a defenceless South Africa, with 80 per cent of its labour force consisting of foreigners, surrounded by eight independent Black states, we want to see real security and happiness offered to all sections of the South African community.</p>

<p>We believe that we can obtain that security and have loyalty on the part of all sections of the population to one State by adopting a federal form of constitution. South Africa will remain a multi-racial state. We accept that. It will continue to contain peoples with different languages and different colours and at various stages of development. Our goal is a State in which each racial community or group will control matters intimately concerning itself to the full extent which is consistent with the stability and welfare both of the whole State and of the other constituent communities. I want to emphasize that as far as we can see ahead, the peace and the necessary progress of our people can only be achieved by maintaining the leadership and the political control of the White people in South Africa. I know I will be told by the idealists on the other side that this means there will not be equality between the various race groups in the federation that we propose. Of course they will not.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a question which the hon. the Prime Minister has put before to-day and I replied to him by saving that 300 years ago when we came to South Africa there was a big difference between the civilization of the European <span class="col_0035-0036" refersTo="page_0035"/>and the non-European. Three hundred years have passed. Have we stood still in that time? Are we at the same stage that Jan van Riebeeck was?</p>

<p>Sir, so far as I can see into the future I have faith that the White man can maintain his position in South Africa. I think that is the fundamental difference between the Prime Minister and myself. I think he has not got faith in the White man. Look at the different standards of civilization to-day between Whites and non-Whites in South Africa. Is it going to change over the next 300 years?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I prefer the word &#x201C;leadership&#x201D;; it has another connotation and the hon. the Minister knows it. Sir. I believe that the various races will still be able to satisfy the natural inclination in people to be governed by and to associate with their own kind. The picture of our federal system then emerges as follows&#x2014;I want to try to clarify it to the best of my ability for hon. members opposite: Firstly, a separate voters&#x2019; roll for each group; secondly, a communal council or councils &#x2026;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think it is necessary. [Interjections.] I do not think it is necessary for the following reasons: From the time of Union we had Coloureds on a separate roll from Whites; we had Coloureds going to different schools from Whites; we never had a population register. From 1936 until this Government abolished the Bantu Representatives in this House we had representatives of the Bantu people and a separate roll for the Bantu. I do not recall a population register being used. That is the sort of non-sensical question one gets from that side. Sir, let me start again. The picture of our federal system emerges as follows: Firstly, separate voters&#x2019; rolls for each group; secondly, a communal council or councils for each of the non-White groups; thirdly, defined representation for each group in the central Parliament and, fourthly, links between the groups in their various communal councils and the central Parliament by a system of statutory standing committees. Specifically, the position of the Bantu under this system will be (a) that he will have separate voting rights; (b) he will elect eight White representatives to the House of Assembly and six to the Senate; (c) he will enjoy a high level of self-administration in the reserves and also in the separate areas which he occupies in urban and rural South Africa; and (d) his interests will be further served by statutory standing committees linking Parliament with the authorities in the reserves and the Bantu communal councils representing those permanently outside the reserves.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, let me help the Minister of Transport. He and I have a little dialogue every year. This is the result of a resolution taken at the Central Congress of the party the year before last and discussed in this House, particularly when we discussed the question of the Coloureds going on to a separate roll and the recommendation of the Select Committee that there be a standing Select Committee to liaise with that Coloured Council. If the hon. the Minister would look at the Part Appropriation debate he will find that I dealt with it there very fully.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, having brought the hon. gentleman up to date, may I say that that will be the political structure of the federal state. But what I want to emphasize is that it will not be subject to sudden changes and abuses by chance majorities. Indeed we guarantee and will see that it is written into the Constitution that no change can be made in the parliamentary representation of the Bantu or the other non-White races or communities without the approval of the White electorate specifically obtained at a general election or a referendum.</p>

Sir, there is no chance of horse-trading of that kind under our policy. They will have to go back to the electorate and get the approval of the electorate at a general election or a referendum of the White voters of South Africa. I believe that that is the strongest guarantee of the maintenance of White leadership that we can hope to have in any Constitution.</p>

<p>Let us go a little further. It is clear that our idea of a federal state is a concrete and practical alternative to what I regard as a theoretical and utterly impractical policy advocated by the Government. I believe that the Government&#x2019;s failure is going to become more and more apparent every day and, I believe, the public are going to become more and more ready to accept a policy based on this federal concept as the failure of the Government&#x2019;s policy becomes more apparent. You see, Sir, we cannot go on as we are doing. The whole security of South Africa is being endangered and undermined by the failure of the Government&#x2019;s policy. We are now in the position that the reserves cannot absorb their own natural increase, let alone those whom the Minister is wanting to send back. We are reaching a position where labour is being restricted in certain areas and there is surplus labour in other areas and we are finding many thousands of them unemployed and not allowed to come into the areas where they would like to have additional labour but are being prevented from doing so for ideological reasons by this Government. In fact, the whole policy is crumbling around the ears of the hon. the Prime Minister. I want to say to him quite bluntly this afternoon that it is not statesmanship to continue stubbornly on a road which is sign-posted to disaster. The time has come for a re-appraisal and an admission and that admission is that there is a third road between complete integration and complete separation. Sir, the hon. gentleman points an accusing finger at me. What is the Government&#x2019;s road in respect of Coloureds and Indians&#x2014;complete integration or complete segregation?</p>

<p>You see, Sir, these hon. gentlemen opposite, who are wonderful theorists, have told us for years that there are only two roads&#x2014;complete separation or complete integration. Where are they going with the Coloureds and Indians? You see, Sir, South Africa in fact followed a middle road for 300 years. This Government was forced off that road, a road which was neither complete separation, neither complete integration. It was forced off this road by forces which Dr. Verwoerd admitted were brought into play from outside South Africa. &#x201C;When we have regard to forces which &#x2018;toesak op ons&#x2019; &#x201D;, were his words. I believe these outside pressures were instigated by and came from the propaganda put out by the Communists and by the Afro-Asian block. I think that the time has come to get away from the foreign influence road that we are on and to come back to a home-made policy, a policy related to the realities and the fundamental truths of the South African situation. And one of these truths, perhaps the most fundamental of them all, is that South Africa, all South Africa, needs White leadership. Sir, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy denies that. We on this side of the House, because of our experience and our history, are constrained to think that White leadership is necessary, and this is one of the reasons why we have no confidence in the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although I do not feel that I shall need it, I am nevertheless requesting the privilege of the hour. Year after year we have to listen to the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and read in the newspapers that this time it was his poorest speech. Well, this year I want to anticipate everybody, even your own train of thought, Mr. Speaker, by saying that the speech which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has just made was in fact his poorest speech ever. In fact, it is a speech which can only be described as primitive, because that is all it was. It is a primitive one for a person who wants to bring a mighty Government down&#x2014;a mighty Government such as this one&#x2014;and even more primitive for a trivial little Opposition that wants to take over the government of the country. It was, in fact, a primitive speech.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall do so as soon as the hon. member has woken up. [Interjections.] As far as the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, I do not want to say much about it now, since I shall be returning in the course of my speech to several of the points he made. From his poor speech it became clear to us, if we think back to their congresses, why so many aspiring leaders are now making their appearance in his Party. If it is so easy for us to spot the deterioration in the leadership of the United Party from outside, then they probably accept it far more regretfully themselves from the inside. In the process, as we know, the hon. member for Durban (Point) of course lost his own little job in Natal. In addition the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was a speech without vision. Towards the end the Leader of the Opposition did in fact try to present himself in a better light by trying to put forward something as an alternative, so as not merely to express a lack of confidence, but to present something of his own programme as well. But in reply to an interjection from this side he had to acknowledge that what he dished up for us here was merely <span class="col_0039-0040" refersTo="page_0037"/>old warmed up left-overs. I think I must now leave my general impressions of his speech at that.</p>

<p>In his speech he sounded two vague notes. The one was that the tempo of development and the application of separate development by this Government was allegedly too slow; the other, that the application of our policy had already failed. Of that his side of the House, so he said, was convinced. Well, Mr. Speaker, I expected him to sound more notes but these will probably come from the bigger guns on his side. At this juncture I want to dwell for a moment on the two notes in the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition; the so-called failure of our policy and the so-called insufficiently rapid tempo of development.</p>

<p>If one listened to the underlying motivation of his speech, then it is a tragedy that he should criticise us on this side because, as he said, we were not doing enough, or not doing what we did rapidly enough to achieve our objectives in regard to apartheid, but stated in the same breath that if we wanted to do more than we were already doing it was going to cost so much that our country would not be able to afford it. The tragic aspect of this is that he does not in actual fact want what he is asking us to proceed more rapidly towards. It is thus very difficult to follow the logic of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this connection. He quoted individuals in support of his point of view, people who want nothing to do with him. All these people are amongst the most confirmed supporters of the policy of this side of the House. In fact, if there is anything which would cause them sleepless nights, it is the possibility, even the vague possibility, that he may succeed in coming into power with his policy. In other words, he is calling upon false witnesses to support his case. In reply to an interjection from this side of the House, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated that if his policy were to be applied, the price to be paid for it would be very much lower, very much lower on the Witwatersrand and in our urban areas in general. These are of course generalizations and spurious arguments. I maintain that in actual currency it will not be cheaper. But apart from that, what really alarms us are the other things we shall have to sacrifice. There are many things we would have to sacrifice. The first of these would be the illusionary White leadership of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. That is the first thing which would have to be sacrificed. Gradually more things would have to be sacrificed, and ultimately our identity as Whites would also have to be sacrificed. That is why I want to repeat what I said last year, i.e. that it makes no difference what the application of our policy is going to cost, we are going to apply it.</p>

The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has stated that complete integration was equally unacceptable to him. But it is of no avail their preaching and telling us in empty words that complete integration is unacceptable to them. If complete integration is supposedly unacceptable to them, then they must not toy with half and quarter integration, because the partial integration with which they are toying, leads them inevitably to complete integration.</p>

<p>I am dealing with my own argument now. Hon. members opposite need not be afraid that they will not get all the answers. We shall be busy here for six months.</p>

<p>But I should like to take a closer look at the two notes in the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. As far as these matters are concerned, there are certain general principles which one must first discuss. My old friend the Minister of Planning quite rightly reminded me that I would have to instruct the Opposition in fundamental principles this afternoon. He was quite right, although I have no intention of doing so from A to Z this afternoon. Nevertheless, there are certain general principles which one must take into account when one has to discuss these two notes in the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. In addition, there is specific information on which attention must be focused in order to indicate what tendencies are displayed by the development, i.e. acceleration, improvements, etc. In all the discussion and writings we have recently had, particularly from the side of the Opposition, we have heard very little about such a fundamental approach and such a comprehensive summary. They never came forward with particulars, it was simply stated in general terms that the policy had failed and that the tempo was too slow. But with this application of our policy, with all the success which we are meeting with from year to year &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Where?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In South Africa, of course &#x2026; what we are getting from the Opposition and from their newspapers is precisely the same recipe as we are getting from the U.N. As we achieve success with the objectives we set ourselves, so they cry louder and louder that we are failing. The greater <span class="col_0041-0042" refersTo="page_0038"/>the success we achieve in the international sphere as well as with the application of our policy and those things which annoy the people at U.N., the louder they shout there that we are endangering the safety of the world here, and that we in South Africa constitute a threat to all. The Opposition does the same thing. The greater our success the louder the noise they make, and next year and the year after that the noise is going to be even louder than it is this year, because our successes are multiplying.</p>

<p>The picture we must have of our policy and the assessment of the rate of our work depends upon the reconciliation, of the balance, which must be brought about among the following five principles&#x2014;I want to call them the five realities. I am not going to elaborate very much on each one of them; in fact, I am simply going to mention them because I have already discussed them extensively. It depends upon the human ability of the Bantu nations to absorb that development. That is number one. In the second place it depends upon the natural innate desire for self-realization of each of those Bantu nations, in the same way as any nation in the world has an innate desire for self-realization. That must be taken into account. In the third place it depends upon the financial means available for that development, available from those nations themselves and available from us who are their guardians and who want to aid them. In the second place it depends upon the general consent of the white community to the continuation of that development and the Opposition ought to know that. In the fifth place it depends upon the rapid passage of time, because we do not have an eternity in which to do everything. But there is one factor which the Opposition must realize, particularly my good friends who want the policy implemented so rapidly. We need not finalize the policy in the present day and age and in our own lifetimes. They must strike a balance as far as the coherence of these five very important factors is concerned, each of which plays its own role. I say to you, Sir, that the Government is prepared, and proves this every day, to do everything in its power from day to day to allow the development to take place as rapidly as possible, but &#x201C;rapidly as possible&#x201D; depends upon the factors which I have just outlined.</p>

<p>However, we must realize that it is not only the Government which has a role to play in this matter. There is also the public, the white public as well as the Bantu public, which has a role to play in this matter. I have already said enough about that. In this connection we must remember that it is extremely important that each one of these nations in question should generate its own development, rather than that it should be done for them from the outside, while they remain mere spectators. That truth we find implicit in a very well-known expression with which we have been well acquainted in Afrikaans for many years, i.e. the words of Father Kestell, who said, &#x201C;A nation saves itself&#x201D;. We find that same concept implied in the following words which were spoken by the American Chinese&#x2014;or Chinese American&#x2014;Dr. James Yen, who wrote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And no matter how many millions m foreign aid or how many armies or outside experts are brought in, no programme will take root until a nation&#x2019;s own nationals get involved. Outsiders can help, but &#x201C;insiders&#x201D; must do the job.</block>

<p>That is the principle on which we are operating, but the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and many interested parties, do not realize this fact thoroughly enough. They want everything to be pumped in from outside, and what is more with the greatest speed and haste. I want to say this to you, Sir: We have had a gigantic task merely to gain the co-operation of the Bantu as far as production and labour are concerned, and in that regard we have already achieved a tremendously large measure of success in South Africa. If you glance at the statistics you will see that, expressed as a percentage, the number of economically active Bantu and the number of economically active Whites in South Africa are approximately the same. As a percentage there are almost as many economically active Bantu in South Africa as there are economically active Whites in South Africa. This proves that a large measure of willingness to work has already been instilled in the Bantu. But that is not all which must count. In addition to that there is also the ability to work, the ability to work perseveringly and continuously.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite and all those people who talk about tempo must realize that one can quite appropriately use the image of the motor-car here, i.e. that one also starts off in first gear, and subsequently moves into second, and then into third and finally into fourth gear. After all, one does not jump from the first to the third gear. I think that too many people in South Africa, sociologists in particular, want us to tackle and implement everything in the homelands for the sake of speed, without the Bantu playing their own part in this. We know that anything of that kind is wrong. The uniformed do not know at what tempo development in respect of Bantu matters in the homelands has already been accelerated during the past few years, what our Department has done, how our Department has been reorganized, how its work and its methods have been reorganized, how we have been fortunate over the years in obtaining increased means with which to do things, and what development has taken place. Those people are unaware of these things. They do not contact us; they are unaware of these things, and the Opposition even more so. They do what the Opposition M.P.s do who go to the Bantu areas and make a point of avoiding the Bantu officials in those areas, of refraining from contacting them because they are afraid <span class="col_0043-0044" refersTo="page_0039"/>that they will hear something favourable about what is going on there. This has happened from Limehill to Msinga, throughout, everywhere the hon. members went.</p>

<p>I am not saying that all the hon. members opposite avoid the officials. Perhaps the hon. member did visit them, and I know that there is one other hon. member opposite who did the same, but the heroes of Limehill, the Fisher&#x2019;s and the Suzman&#x2019;s, and people like that, avoided the officials. I know what I am talking about because I went there to observe and hear for myself; I even had complaints there about the movements of hon. members opposite. [Interjections.] Yes, as a matter of fact I am sorry they did not sound that note because I brought along my hymn book for that note but now I cannot sing from it.</p>

<p>Too many people think, and it seems to me the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is one of them, that in order to reduce the numbers of Bantu in the white areas is our only task, and that that is the only criterion for ascertaining whether apartheid is succeeding or not. I want what I am now saying to be thoroughly understood. I do not want people who listen to me with half an ear to distort my words afterwards. I am saying that the reduction of the numbers of Bantu in white areas is an extremely important criterion and that it is a very important task, but it is not the only criterion. And do you know what, Sir? It is not even the most important criterion. There are various criteria, and our task is for more comprehensive than just that. There are in addition other points which also have to be taken into account. For example, I want to mention the following as being undoubtedly the most important criterion. I am referring to political say which is being ensured for the Whites in white South Africa and the compensatory political say which is being made possible for the Bantu in their own country. That is the most important criterion. When that criterion was mentioned in this same House several months before the death of the former Prime Minister a clamour went up from the Opposition side as if a new truth had been announced. I repeat: The most important criterion which should always be mentioned is there should be a guarantee that the say of the white nation should remain undisturbed for all time. In fact, we do guarantee it for all time if we remain in power with our policy in white South Africa. We do not immediately guarantee a measure of self-government, a consolation prize; we guarantee full possibilities for development, depending upon their own abilities, for the Bantu nations in their own countries here in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member knows what the answer is.</p>

<p>Another task we have in this connection is to bring home to everyone in Southern Africa, white and black, and most of all to the Opposition, that the composition of the South African masses is multi-national. In respect of that concept we have made tremendous progress, and in this Session we are going to take further gigantic strides forward as far as this is concerned.</p>

<p>A further task is to determine the method in regard to how the separation between Bantu and white in South Africa should take place on a social, economic, educational political and residential level. The fourth task is of course the economic development of the homelands, in regard to which I am also going to furnish hon. members with specific data. The fifth task is that of ensuring that those Bantu who are in fact necessary in the white area and who will have work&#x2014;probably there will always be work for them&#x2014;receive good treatment while they are here.</p>

<p>Those are only a few of the fundamental objectives and criteria which I have stated to hon. members. The Opposition and its Press must realize that they are not going to pull the wool over the eyes of the public of South Africa by trying to formulate the criteria of our apartheid policy themselves and then proving that we are not succeeding in achieving them. We formulate our own objectives, and we have been doing so since the time of that report from which the hon. member quoted and obviously did not read attentively up to the present. We formulate our policy, and we, as well as the voting public outside, decide whether we have achieved enough of our objectives during the course of the five years for which they have put us in office.</p>

<p>There was the jubilant campaign of which we heard such a faint echo from the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon, i.e. in regard to the numerical aspect. A great furore was created in regard to the numerical calculation made in 1956 of what the position would be in the year 2000, in regard to how many Bantu there would be in South Africa. Not even the very best mathematicians and jugglers of figures will ever succeed in getting close to the correct numbers if they want to try to count the Bantu. They may just as well try to count the birds in the heavens. We must see to it that we do the right thing and not burn the midnight oil working out figures. We must see to it that we do the right thing every day. As far back as 1956 no less a person than Dr. Verwoerd, who discussed those figures and dealt with those matters here, emphasized in this House, and to an even greater extent subsequently, that the figures were not the most important thing. Politics was the most important thing, as I have just outlined to you. The numerical picture has in fact been held up to <span class="col_0045-0046" refersTo="page_0040"/>us in order to emphasize that our policy is so essential, because&#x2014;and this the Opposition does not understand at all, and neither do those poor newspaper columnists&#x2014;if the numerical aspect has become so unfavourable according to these new figures, then surely it is all the more reason why our policy should be implemented. With such a preponderance of numbers, as they are now holding up as an example to us on the basis of those figures, a unified community on an integration basis is surely a rash undertaking for us in South Africa. Surely that is tantamount to trying to stem the encroaching waters with a rickety broom.</p>

<p>No, Sir, I shall now reply to the hon. member. Whether that unified community rests on a race federation basis, a Basson confederation or whichever one it is, the Whites will be ploughed under far, far more quickly under their policy if the numerical aspect is supposedly so unfavourable. Under our policy this will not happen, because what remains is the guarantee for the White in his homeland which he reserves to himself alone. In point of fact the attitude of the Opposition in regard to this matter is that the numbers are in any case so overwhelming that we should not try to ensure the survival of the Whites by means of apartheid, because this will require too much time. We should rather apply integration, because in that case the end would come sooner.</p>

<p>Let us scrutinize these realities for a moment in the light of certain data. In the first place I want to make a general remark which is quite fundamental. It deals with the basis of the presence of Bantu persons in White areas. In the light of that we will also glance at examples of the success which we have already achieved in this connection. The tremendous and extremely fundamental difference between the basic principles of the two policies, a race federation <i>alias</i> confederation, and separate development is decisive here. On what basis are the Bantu admissible in White South Africa under their policy and under our policy. In this lies our salvation, i.e. the basis of the presence of the Bantu. As we have heard again here this afternoon the policy of the United Party is a little integration in the economic sphere and a little integration in the political sphere. I am not going to impute to them things they never said. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout will see to that. They were outspoken on these two topics. In the economic and the political spheres just a little integration has to be allowed. They did not want to admit that this will penetrate to the other spheres, such as the social, etc. These two important acknowledged fields of integration mean that an ever-increasing measure of equality will have to be established between White and Bantu individuals in the one geographical area and the one context, with, of course, an ever-increasing measure of friction, clashes and an ultimate swallowing up of the Whites. I know that as Opposition they do not advocate this. But their policy will inevitably lead to that. Everybody can perceive this, except those on the Opposition side, who turn a stone deaf ear. The National Party policy on the other hand states the following to be the basis of the presence of Bantu. Now the hon. member for Yeoville must listen very carefully. I am now replying to his question of a moment ago. The policy of the National Party is based on the very obvious truth to which I have just referred, i.e. that the Whites and Bantu in South Africa differ from one another so radically that they are separate nations and there is absolutely no possibility of considering any process of their becoming equal, and thus no opportunities for this should be created as is the case under their policy. For the Whites and for each Bantu nation separate development is the course. Bantu persons can be present in the White areas solely for their labour&#x2014;not for a &#x201C;stake&#x201D; or a &#x201C;share&#x201D; in the Parliament, or for anything else, as the Opposition is intimating. Bantu individuals can be present in the White areas solely for their labour and in addition&#x2014;and this we must understand very thoroughly, because we differ radically on this&#x2014;not so that they can compete on an equal basis with the Whites, or on a basis which entails potential equality, so that when they attain that equality they can integrate with the Whites into one entity. That is the basis and for that reason we must now state for the umpteenth time in this House that the basis on which we organize our labour policy for the Bantu and allow the Bantu into our White area is not a basis for economic integration. This fact must be emphasized for the umpteenth time and it is a pity that we have to repeat it time and again each year. If one were to bring in the Bantu on the basis on which the United Party wants to do so, and assimilate them into politics in the way the United Party wants to do by first allowing the Bantu to achieve only a small measure of equality with the Whites, and subsequently perhaps a little more, even if they were first to succeed with a referendum, then this is the integrationistic basis which tends towards the ultimate achievement of equality between the White individuals and the Bantu individuals in politics or in the economy. A thing like this is not possible with us. There is a wall, a roof, and one cannot get past that. We state this openly, and cannot, nor dare not, conceal it. Nor do we wish to conceal it. The Bantu cannot strive towards the top on an equal footing with the Whites in our politics, social matters, labour, economy and education in White South Africa. This is our territory, and here there are only limited opportunities of that nature for them. In their homelands there are measureless and limitless opportunities for them, and there you, Mr. Speaker, and I, as Whites are in our turn restricted. That is the morality of our policy.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, that wise orator is simply demonstrating again how he refuses to understand what he understood very well a moment ago. I should like to mention a few examples. One should take a look at specific data in respect of the other theme which is now being mooted, i.e. that we have failed completely and it is pathetic that when one wants to demonstrate data, one always draws comparisons. We are now in the pathetic position, owing to our success, that we can no longer draw comparisons with the United Party because almost a quarter of a century has elapsed since they were last in power. We must now compare our own success with our own former success. We must do so in order to see whether our success has been good enough and whether or not there has been an improvement. The first examples I want to mention are the development of the Bantu authorities in South Africa. This is something in which the Opposition took no interest whatsoever. I know that, and in a moment when I come to my next point I shall wake them all up. They take no interest whatsoever in the development of Bantu authorities, but if there is one sphere of development in the homelands in which we have achieved great success, then it is with this very development of Bantu authorities. When the National Party came into power in 1948 there was a confusion and fragmentation of tribal organization. We put the tribal system in order and restored it to its rightful place, and on that basis we continued to build in terms of our Bantu authorities structure, which is a system of tribal authorities, regional authorities and territorial authorities, as hon. members ought to know. We went even further in the Transkei where a parliamentary authority was established in place of their territorial authority. These developments are quite fundamental. In this Parliament last year we also passed an Act in respect of the Bantu nations of South West Africa in order to make possible a Bantu authorities structure for them as well, because their government structure was even more dilapidated than those in many of our own Bantu areas in South Africa had been. During the past few months we have seen how three out of all the territorial authorities in South Africa which have already been established were converted into higher forms of authority by transferring to them more important and a greater amount of work. During the next few months there will be quite a number of additional authorities which will also be activated on the new basis towards an increasing measure of self-activity, with their own administrative departments, executive councils and legislative councils which will have more functions to perform, as well as an autonomous budget system and a great deal more than that. They will also be able to undertake a measure of legislation of their own. I want to ask the Opposition whether they do not think that to tackle this re-organization work in regard to eight Bantu authorities simultaneously and to make it possible in one year, as I and my Department have had to do during the past nine months, is not a gigantic achievement. They cannot form an opinion, because they know nothing about it, nor do they take any interest. I now want, on this the first opportunity I have, to pay unqualified and the greatest tribute and convey my thanks to my two Departments for the magnificent work which our officials have done. [Interjections.] I now hear the uproarious laughter of a dismissed former official on the other side, i.e. the hon. member for North Rand. That is the type of official we do not want in the Public Service. Thank God there are almost none of them left. It was a gigantic task to establish those eight authorities in their new shape. It is preceded by intensive work. Constitutions have to be discussed with the leaders of the Bantu nations in question. One consultation after another takes place under the leadership of our commissioners-general and our many Bantu officials, and each one of them acquitted themselves of their task with great distinction. Staff structures have to be worked out, and consultations have to be held on what activities will have to be transferred to them, and systems of estimates and a system of financial administration has to be worked out for the Bantu nations, auditing systems also have to be worked out, and on all these matters negotiations have to take place with numerous Government Departments. The work we accomplished in regard to these eight authorities of which one system in Ovamboland has already gone into operation, was a task which in scone was greater and more difficult than it subsequently was to bring the Transkei to a stage of parliamentary self-government. However, we are still being told that we are doing nothing, and that our policy is failing. According to the United Party&#x2019;s concept the development of authorities plays no role in the Bantu affairs of the homelands. To us it is the number one, the fundamental, prerequisite. It is for this reason that I maintain that the success we achieved was a gigantic one. I should like to mention one example in this connection. There are five, six or seven departments&#x2014;it differs a little from one nation to another&#x2014;in the various homelands. In the three authorities alone which have already <span class="col_0049-0050" refersTo="page_0042"/>been placed on the new basis, the Department of Education alone created 366 posts for Bantu. The Bantu to fill these posts have to be found. They must be orientated and trained. Even the council members who are going to serve on these councils have to be orientated and trained, because they are now dealing with the procedure of the sittings in a council such as this. What do they know about that? They must be provided with guidance in that respect, and all this has to be done in a short space of time. I shall leave it at that. I think that is enough. Nevertheless I would just like in passing, in connection with our authorities, to call to mind something which cannot be allowed to escape the attention of this House. That is the dramatic demonstration which we witnessed a few months ago in the Transkei during the second General Election held there. You will recall, Sir, how five years previously, in 1963, at the general registration of voters for the Transkei, altogether 880,000 voters were registered, both within and outside the Transkei. They have now had five years of parliamentary government according to our apartheid policy. The apartheid policy applied to the Bantu authorities displayed at its peak in South Africa in the Transkei. And then, owing to a change in their constitution five years later, the entire electorate of the Transkei had to be re-registered.</p>

<p>You had White officials to do that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>What difference does that make? If we were able a few years ago to help the people of Lesotho to vote for their council, why should we not help our own Bantu to vote for their Parliament. We want to help them. Then all these voters in the Transkei had to be re-registered last year, and the 880,000 voters of the Transkei had increased to 907,000. They were not frustrated or disappointed and they did not state that they were disinterested, and then the voting took place. Well now, they did not even vote in all the constituencies and for that reason I am not going to mention the number of votes to you because it would not be fair. Five years ago voting took place in all the constituencies, and this time voting did not take place in all the constituencies; some were returned unopposed. But what was the overall result of the election? All those people who were prompted by the Opposition to support integration, to support &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;, to support &#x201C;multiracialism&#x201D; in the Transkei&#x2014;that party has almost disappeared like dew before the sun, and the policy of the governing party, of Kaiser Matanzima and others, triumphed and was once again returned to power, with a greater majority than even the most optimistic prediction made by pessimistic newspapers which hazarded predictions in that respect. And then, subsequently, they had nothing to say, and then they began afresh with their intrigues in order to try to cause matters to miscarry. I want to mention many other examples. I want to deal with this as rapidly as possible. In the sphere of agriculture, of what happens in the homelands, I just want to mention a few little items. This is a vast field and I cannot mention everything in detail. Fortunately there are numerous colleagues of mine on this side, fellow members of mine, who are itching to discuss this, and who will be able to supplement what I have to say effectively. But I dare not omit the topic of agriculture, and that is why I maintain that in the field of agriculture, which is one of the most difficult fields in which to make progress with the Bantu, we have made spectacular progress. Why is it difficult? If hon. members on the opposite side would study a little social anthropology and learn to know the Bantu, they would be able to supply the answer themselves. It is because there is no facet, excluding perhaps religion, in respect of which one has to modernize the Bantu where one comes up against so many formidable problems, ingrained prejudices and beliefs as one does in respect of agriculture, with the views they hold on cattle and land and their form of land tenure, etc. And yet we have made gigantic progress. There are many examples I could mention. My page is filled with figures, but I am going to omit these because I want to afford the other people on my side an opportunity. I simply want to mention a few. [Interjections.] You will get them all. Thank God, the debate is longer this time and we will be able to get everything in. Here we now have one of the advantages of stupid leadership. We have been granted a longer debate in which to put our case. It is owing to the stupid leadership of the Leader of the Opposition that we have an extra day for the debate.</p>

<p>Take one example. Take the example of the industrial crops. A great deal has been said about industries in the Transkei and this is why I am mentioning industrial crops first, such as the fibre crops there. Before 1948 there was absolutely nothing. It was only subsequent to that that we introduced it, and now you must have a look at the rate of increase. While we produced 1,700 tons of fibre in 1968, it is calculated, on the basis of what is at present growing in the lands, that we will come very close to 4,000 tons of fibre in 1970. That is a more than twofold increase, in two years, in the offing. Now the Opposition must remember, because I would like to discuss labour as well, that just that industrial crop alone, that fibre, provides work in the Transkei and in the other Bantu areas for more than 3,000 Bantu, and in the space of the next two years only we are going to increase those fibre crops.</p>

<p>Let us take another figure which is very important, a very difficult figure, that of irrigation. We know that water is a grave problem in South Africa. I am taking 1960. I am comparing it to our own period, because of what use is it comparing it with their figures? They had nothing. From nothing to one is not even an 100 per cent increase; it is an infinite percentage increase. In 1960 there were approximately 15,000 morgen under irrigation. <span class="col_0051-0052" refersTo="page_0043"/>In 1968, eight years afterwards, there was approximately 25,000 morgen under irrigation. There was almost a twofold increase in these eight years, much faster than in all the years before that, but then they say the tempo is decreasing, and then certain newspaper columnists, who have probably never seen a Bantu homeland, write that stagnation threatens to set in in our development of the homelands. Take fencing. Now you will say, &#x201C;Ugh, now the man is talking about wire&#x201D;. But if there was ever something which is terribly troublesome to the Bantu in all the homelands, it is &#x2022;this planning of the soil and the fencing of the land with wire. In the first election in the Transkei they made a platform of this. They promised never to put up wire fencing. To facilitate soil conservation we jumped from 20,900 miles of wire fencing in 1960 to 45,000 miles. It increased more than eight times during the eight years. That is a more than 100 per cent increase. Take cotton. There was no planting of cotton whatsoever prior to 1948 and up to 1960 in the Bantu areas. We made a start subsequent to that, and we have now planted as much as 9,500 morgen of cotton. The same applies to tea. This is also something which we started, and I do not even have the figures for it.</p>

There were no adequately trained Bantu persons whatsoever available for instruction work to their own people in those areas, and even to-day there are not enough; I hasten to add this. But whereas previously there was nothing, and no schools either, we have in the meantime made provision for five agricultural schools in the various Bantu areas and at one of the university colleges there is an agricultural faculty training Bantu, and already we have 432 trained Bantu who are able to undertake this kind of work amongst their people in the homelands. In addition I am mentioning to you the latest, which is a very great achievement, i.e. the planning of the Bantu areas, the planning of residential areas, of grazing areas, ploughing areas, fenced-in areas, etc. More than 50 per cent of the Bantu areas of South Africa, excluding the Transkei&#x2014;these particulars I do not have with me now&#x2014;have already been planned, and it is mainly during the past few years that we have achieved success with that planning, because we had to break down prejudices and disbelief in order to bring home that planning to those people.</p>

<p>The hon. member says the soil is still washing away. Where is there soil which is not washing away? Go and look at the White areas of Natal. Everywhere soil is being washed away, but fortunately that soil is not washing away as rapidly as the Opposition&#x2019;s followers are dwindling. I want to mention something else which is very important, in connection with the clearance of black spots in South Africa. Phenomenal improvement has taken place there, particularly during the last few years. I want to deal with this rapidly and I call upon other members upon our side to go into details in this regard later. I just want to say this. I have the figures here of black spots and small reserves which have to be cleared. If one glances at this, one sees that before 1948 literally nothing was accomplished in the Transvaal, the Cape and Natal, although it should have been undertaken since 1936. Nothing was done&#x2014;absolutely nothing. Here I marked it in red with a nought. Between 1938 and 1960, and then again between 1961 and 1968&#x2014;these are the two periods I tabulated&#x2014;we achieved phenomenal success. We improved upon our own achievements. In the second seven-year period, from 1961 to 1968, just to give an example, we cleared three-and-a-half times as many morgen of land of Bantu persons in the Cape than we succeeded in doing in the 12 years between 1948 and 1960, because during that period we had to break down prejudice. During those seven years 116,000 morgen were cleared of Bantu. During the 12 years from 1948 to 1960 we only succeeded in clearing Bantu from 33 morgen in Natal, but in the seven years from 1961 to 1968 we succeeded in clearing 9.940 morgen. We improved 300-fold on our own achievement. Up to 1948 the United Party had done absolutely nothing; it is therefore an infinite percentage improvement we effected there. The Opposition are laughing with us now, because I cannot even compare our achievements with theirs. But we had to struggle because of the obstacles they placed in our path. Labour is also a very important matter. Mention is being made here of the influx of labourers into Our industries. Let us take a look. The numbers are increasing. We said the numbers are increasing, but at what level does the ratio remain? Between 1958 and 1968 industrial statistics show that the ratio of one White to 2.1 Bantu in South Africa has generally been maintained. In other words, the ratio of White to Bantu in the industries has remained constant, despite the fact that the physical production of the factories has doubled during that period. Yet the number of additional Bantu has by no means doubled. Then they say we are achieving nothing! The bureaux system which we only introduced in 1952 dealt with 1,900,000 Bantu in 1967 and found work for them, which was a 90 per cent increase on the previous year 1966. Then they tell us we are not succeeding in the implementation of our policy. We were successful here in the Western Cape as well, and in both these periods, i.e. from 1948 to 1960, and from 1961 to 1968, Bantu manpower here in the Peninsula decreased. We will be given the figures in this connection later. In the economic

<p><span class="col_0053-0054" refersTo="page_0045"/>sector we can mention equally brilliant examples. It is only during the last few years that we have had the corporations. The Xhosa Corporation has only been operating for four years, and the Bantu Investment Corporation has only been operating properly for about eight years. And yet we have already allocated more than R8 million for the financing of Bantu persons for all kinds of matters in the Bantu homelands, and all kinds of undertakings are being established by Bantu persons, undertakings which vary from sweet factories to shops. More than 100 such undertakings have been given a start. With our help more than 200 properties of Whites in the Transkei have already been transferred to Bantu entrepreneurs. I can mention very striking figures in respect of mining as well, and nothing is more striking than the fact that between 1966 and 1968 alone the royalties we receive from mining development in the homelands by Whites on the agency basis have more than doubled from R272.000 to R550,000, and my prediction is that it is going to increase twofold again during the next year or two from R550,000 to R1 million, because Whites are coming forward on the agency basis to make mining development in the homelands possible and, what is more, we shall commence within a month or two with a new mining corporation which will be directed for us by some of our outstanding mining personalities in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, in the field of education we can mention as many vast achievements and successes but I am leaving it to other speakers. However, there is one thing I want to mention as an example and that is that the post-primary school children in the Bantu homelands increased by 180 per cent between 1959 and 1968, whereas in the White areas the increase in the same category was only 55 per cent. And then we are told that we are not developing the Bantu areas, not as far as education is concerned either! In addition we have just commenced with specific apprenticeship of their own for the Bantu in their homelands.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on border industries, about which something has been said here, I should just like to say the following: A great deal of juggling with figures is possible, and you will probably tell me that I am also juggling with figures, but take the number of Bantu persons who have been employed in the border industries and are still being employed there, and add to them the dependants and the other resultant workers who have been employed as a result of border industry development, and what do you find? There are at present&#x2014;and this is a fact which stands out very clearly&#x2014;that more than a half million Bantu persons, workers and their dependants&#x2014;are living in the Bantu homelands as a result of border industry development. More than a half million Bantu persons are at present living in the homelands&#x2014;workers and dependants&#x2014;as a result of the work of the breadwinners in the border industries. Without those border industries all those Bantu would probably have been in the white area. The clamour which we are continually hearing from the opposite side is that we are achieving no success, and that the tempo of development is too slow. The Tomlinson Report was also quoted here. I want to tell hon. members on that side that they would do well to compare the recommendations of the Tomlinson Report with our expenditure and with our work. We come off with flying colours. Literary men and bookworms such as the hon. member for Hillbrow would do well to read the Tomlinson Report again &#x2026;</p>

<p>I shall give the hon. member many examples. I shall give him 13 examples. The Tomlinson Commission categorized its recommendations into 13 sub-heads, and of those sub-heads there are only two in respect of which we have spent less during the past ten years than Tomlinson recommended should be spent over a ten-year period. Unfortunately Tomlinson&#x2019;s classification and our classification are not quite identical, but in the case of all 13 sub-heads Tomlinson recommended an expenditure of R209 million over a period of ten years, whereas we have, during the past ten years, spent R332 million within the Bantu homelands, i.e. more than 50 per cent more than Tomlinson recommended. Now I am telling the hon. member for Point: Run back to Newcastle and state to the voters there that the Whites are spending too much on the Blacks! Sir, I should have stated at the outset that I am sorry that the new member for Newcastle, Dr. Paul Viljoen, has not been elected already because he should really have replied to the speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Our youngest member should have done it; instead, I now have to do it.</p>

<p>There are other criteria as well which we can apply in this connection, and one important criterion is the opinion of the Bantu themselves. I have already referred to the opinion of the Bantu when I reminded you of the Transkei election. I want to remind you of resolutions and decisions of all our territorial authorities who support our policy. I want to remind you of speeches of leaders of the Bantu such as Chief Councillor Mangope, Chief Councillor Ushona Shiimi from Ovamboland. Kaiser Matanzima and others. Later on in the debate hon. members will still hear how they have one after the other accepted the policy of separate development. I challenge the Opposition, even in connection with the old points which the Leader of the Opposition mentioned here this afternoon, to mention the name of one acknowledged, responsible Bantu body or one acknowledged Bantu leader who accepts that policy of the Opposition and who is prepared to state that they will want to keep on living under it in South Africa for all time. Sir, our country South <span class="col_0055-0056" refersTo="page_0046"/>Africa, requires the utmost of all of us.

<p>The hon. the ex-Minister of Forestry need not worry; I am coming to him in a minute or two. I do not propose to follow the hon. the Minister who has just sat down at present; I shall do so a little later; my time is limited to a far greater extent than his was.</p>

<p>I would like to deal with this question of confidence which we are debating here. The motion expresses a lack of confidence in the Government. There is no motion before this House expressing a lack of confidence in the United Party. Hon. members on the other side would love to have a motion like that. They have a majority in this House and that is what they rely on. They do not rely upon the accuracy of their arguments nor do they rely upon any merits in those arguments; they just rely on a voting majority. Let us get down to the question of confidence. I want to start at once by saying that we have good reasons for saying that we have no confidence in the Government. Sir, let me call, if I may use court parlance, as my first witness the hon. the Prime Minister. My mind goes back to the picture of the Government benches at the end of last year&#x2019;s session. In my mind I see certain Ministers sitting there and when I look around now I ask myself, &#x201C;Where have they gone?&#x201D; Who was the man who so lacked confidence in those Ministers as to dispose of them? It could only be one man; it could only be the Prime Minister. It was not the Leader of the Opposition; it was nobody else on this side and it was nobody else on that side; it was only the hon. the Prime Minister who could say: &#x201C;I have no confidence in you; you must go and make way for a man in whom I have confidence.&#x201D; Sir, he sacked four of them. Of those Ministers he had here last year he sacked four and he transferred a couple of supernumeraries and sort of Deputy Ministers as well and put them in other seats.</p>

<p>Sir, what has the Prime Minister to say of himself? There was the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs; there was the Minister of Community Development; the Minister of the Interior; the Minister of Indian Affairs; then there was the Minister of Forestry and of Information. He is not the Minister of Forestry any more and he is not the Minister of Information any more. But he still sits here. We will have to produce a little more evidence for the Prime Minister and wish him gently on his way. But what of the Prime Minister himself? Has he been one who has been the recipient of votes of confidence all the time during the recess? I wonder whether he recollects his big entry into Natal when he said that he was going to lead the attack on the United Party in the forthcoming Provincial elections in 1970? He was going to lead the attack on the United Party; he was not going to leave it to the Leader of the Nationalist Party in my province. Oh no, he did not believe that the Leader of the Nationalist Party in my province would be capable of leading the attack on the United Party; he, the Prime Minister, was going to do it personally. But, Sir, he came with his candidate for the leadership of the Nationalist Party in Natal; he had his candidate.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>A group of Nationalist M.P.C.s had been to the Prime Minister, to his home in Pretoria, and they had Tiger Oats with him for breakfast, so I was told by one of them when I asked him what he was doing there. He replied: &#x201C;I went there to eat Tiger Oats.&#x201D; He probably lacked a little tiger. They went all the way to Pretoria and back to have a breakfast of Tiger Oats with the Prime Minister. Well, Sir, that is fair enough. The Prime Minister is not a man who is just visited by everybody on every occasion. These M.P.C.s went up there to pay their respects but they also went to ask that the Administrator <span class="col_0057-0058" refersTo="page_0047"/>of Natal, who is a political Administrator, should be given the opportunity of resigning and standing as a candidate to fill the vacancy in Newcastle and to become the Leader of the Nationalist Party in Natal. That was the position, Sir. They were told, &#x201C;No, this won&#x2019;t work; I have other work for the Administrator of Natal,&#x201D; and how right the Prime Minister was. Well, that being so, the matter had to go on to their own congress and eventually a leader was elected, by democratic process no doubt. He was not the man chosen by the Prime Minister. I repeat that: He was not the man whom the Prime Minister would have chosen. He sits in the third row on that side.</p>

You were completely inefficient; you could not do your job; you were talking big and shouting and throwing your arms about.&#x201D; The new Minister of Community Development could not do his job and that was why he was moved.

<p>Very well, I shall not do my job again this year and you will see that I will be promoted again.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is indeed many a true word spoken in jest. We have only to look at the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and those Ministers and members who cannot do their jobs but who are nevertheless promoted. We have only to look around us to see them. May I also say that I believe that the Minister of Community Development was relieved of his post because he was a thorn in the side of the Minister. There is many a man who would say that the hon. Minister of Community Development has his hand on the ankle of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and that he will pull the Minister of Bantu Administration off the ladder if he is not careful. That was being said very openly. The hon. the Minister of Community Development therefore got promotion.</p>

<p>But let me return to my argument. The democratic system was then put into operation at the National Party congress in Durban which was attended by the hon. the Prime Minister. He is coy and will not tell us who he wanted elected as leader of the Nationalist Party in Natal. A gentleman was nevertheless elected. I have looked in vain through the records in this regard since Union to find whether the provincial leader of the party in power was not put into the Cabinet when he became the leader of the party in that province. I have not yet found a case where this has not been done. I admit that I cannot say that my researches have been completely exhaustive. I have not approached any of the authorities in this regard so I may well be wrong but for the past 25 or 30 years this has certainly not happened. [Interjections.] If hon. members opposite would just be quiet for a moment the hon. the Minister of Transport might be able to tell us what the position is in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<p>Mr. Maree was leader of the party in Natal for five years before he became a Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but that has nothing to do with the matter. It is the present leader of the party in Natal who is not in the Cabinet. Is the hon. the Prime Minister going to put him into the Cabinet, and if not why not? [Interjections.] If the hon. the Prime Minister does not wish to create a completely new portfolio for an additional Cabinet Minister, we can give him some advice as to a present Minister he should sacrifice to make room for his leader in Natal. It may be a great sacrifice but it may also not be so great in the long run. May I suggest that the remaining section of that Minister might follow with advantage to where the Ministers of Forestry and Information have gone. This would then make room in the Cabinet for the leader of the National Party in Natal. I do not want to work under a Nationalist Minister in Natal. At the same time however we do feel that we are a province with a little bit of promise. After all we had the hon. the Prime Minister showing interest in us himself. He said that he would lead the attack on us and he must therefore be interested in us. Surely then we are entitled to our own Cabinet Minister, only one out of this galaxy of Cabinet Ministers in South Africa. We would be content with only one little one to represent Natal. Surely that is not asking too much. I want to appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister to give us some recognition and to give us a Cabinet Minister. Even a small one would do.</p>

<p>I should now like to come to the new Minister of Information. I have listened very carefully this afternoon to the endless stream of words which flowed from the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. I shall deal with a few of his statements presently. In passing, however, I should like to say to that hon. Minister that he has evidently taken as his motto that if the figures do not agree <span class="col_0059-0060" refersTo="page_0048"/>with his special brand of apartheid, it is so much the worse for the figures. Let us therefore turn to the Minister of Information. I want to give that hon. Minister credit for the fact that he impressed me when he spoke last year. I jotted down what he said in my notebook. In Hansard of the 23rd April, 1968 (column 3916) he quotes from what Dr. Verwoerd said in this House on the 15th September, 1958. He said that Dr. Verwoerd had said that as far as the Bantu were concerned the ideal must be total separation in every sphere. Then the present Minister of Information went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">That is the point of view that was stated very explicitly, and each of us here says the same.</block>

<p>He then went further and said:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and every piece of legislation which deals with this matter and which we pilot through Parliament, is being tested against that touchstone, namely whether or not the legislation is a step in the direction of total separation of the races &#x2026;</block>

<p>Those words came from the present Minister of Information. I want to point out that after he had made this speech, the hon. the Prime Minister put him in the Cabinet. Let us therefore see just what he said and how far he did in actual fact go. He said that this &#x201C;is the only ethical and moral force which one can take and adhere to if one wishes to approach this matter in an ethical and moral way&#x201D;. (Column 3917.) But in the same way as the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was asked certain things by way of interjection this afternoon, he was asked: &#x201C;What about the Coloureds?&#x201D;. The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development does not want to say anything about the Coloured people or the Indians because he said that he was only dealing with the Bantu. But of course the truth of the matter is that the apartheid policy of the Government as far as the Bantu are concerned has failed completely and that they do not have a policy for the Coloureds or the Indians yet. They were waiting to see whether the Bantustan policy could succeed before making provision for something of a similar nature for the Coloureds and the Indians. But the present Minister of Information saw the matter differently. When he was dealing with the question of separate development for the Bantu he was asked by Mr. C. J. S. Wainwright: &#x201C;What about the Coloureds?&#x201D; He replied:</p>

<block name="quote">To me the Coloureds present no problem. I shall deal with it fully if the hon. member so wishes.</block>

<p>Then a little later he went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">One goes back and divides the land basically among the various groups. I divide the land and give each group its own area.</block>

<p>I should just like to point out that it is the hon. Minister of Information who is speaking here but he does not call these people nations. He calls them groups. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development keeps calling them nations but the Minister of Information tells the world that they are groups. But let me return to what the hon. Minister said:</p>

<block name="quote">I divide the land and give each group its own area, and I say to each of them: In your area you develop to the maximum of your potential and at the rate of which you are capable, and until you reach the full responsibility of which you are capable. In this way each group can develop in its own area.</block>

<block name="quote">In respect of the other races, we have an identical situation on our hands, and we shall have to face up to that and we are not afraid of doing so. Once we have implemented the policy in regard to the Bantu to its full extent, we shall be left with a smaller South Africa where the Bantu will no longer have any say. But the Opposition&#x2019;s point of view is that the Coloureds and the Indians are still here.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have a very deep thought here. It is the Opposition&#x2019;s point of view that the Coloureds and the Indians are still here. He goes on:</p>

<block name="quote">Now I say the course we are adopting at present with the legislation we have before us does not rule out the possibility that when we reach that stage and we review the situation, separate homelands may also be established for the Coloureds and for the Indians. It does not rule that out. I am making it very clear that I do not rule out that possibility when we reach that stage one day.</block>

<block name="quote">Dr. G. F. Jacobs: But Dr. Verwoerd said that it was out of the question.</block>

<block name="quote">Dr. C. P. Mulder: On a previous occasion I have stated explicitly that one develops and that one keeps pace with every development as progress is being made, and when we reach that stage we shall adopt an attitude in regard to that matter.</block>

<p>Then the time was up and the gong went, and I am sure that from the bottom of his heart the hon. the Minister was pleased that his time was up because he had reached the stage where he could not waffle any longer&#x2014;he would probably have had to say something. How did the Minister start his speech? I said I omitted parts of what he said, and let me read them now. I quote from column 3918 of Hansard, volume 23&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall repeat it very clearly. I am making it very clear&#x2014;and I am not afraid of doing so&#x2014;that the Bantu should develop in his own area and that he will reach maturity there when he can do so and can accept it.</block>

<p><span class="col_0061-0062" refersTo="page_0049"/>He then went on to refer to the other races. That is what the hon. the Minister said, namely&#x2014;&#x201C;I shall repeat it very clearly. I am making it very clear, and I am not afraid of doing so &#x2026;&#x201D;, and he referred also to the other races. This is the Minister of Information. Is this the information he is spreading outside South Africa at the present time.</p>

<p>Yes, of Justice, and this is another curious metamorphosis, if I may put it that way. What was wrong with him remaining in the Department of Bantu Administration and Development? Why was he shunted to the Department of Justice? I must say I commiserate with the hon the Minister of Justice. But whatever the reason may be, let us see how he contradicts completely what the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said here a few minutes ago. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surely it goes without saying that the development of South Africa as an industrial country will result in more and more labour being required in South Africa, and as our policy of border industries succeeds more and more labour will be required in those border industries. If quite a few million more Bantu are absorbed by the border industries that does not mean that a proportionately smaller number of Whites will be employed. In proportion, as our industries expand, as our economy develops there will be room for both the White labourer and the Bantu labourer in our industries. The number of White labourers in our industries has increased, although it has perhaps decreased on a percentage basis. On a percentage basis there are at present more Bantu than Whites in the industries but this does not mean the Whites are being pushed out of these industries; their numbers are increasing, although the percentage is decreasing.</block>

<p>He said the percentage is decreasing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I talked about the ratio, there is a difference between a ratio and a percentage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>What is the difference between the ratio of Bantu to Whites and the percentage Bantu as against Whites? What is the difference? We had here the hon. the Minister asking us in the broad light of evening to accept that the ratio of Blacks to Whites is favouring the Whites, yet last year the hon. member for Heilbron said categorically that the percentage increase of the Blacks is greater than the percentage increase of the Whites. How can those two statements be reconciled? Now the Minister says a ratio is not the same as a percentage! I find it hard to quite follow the Minister. Indeed, I found it difficult just now, but this makes it even worse.</p>

<p>The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development went to great lengths just now to deal with development in the homelands. Of course there is some development taking place. The Minister says it does not matter what the costs are because he has all the money he wants for whatever purpose connected with development in the homelands. He says the sky is the limit and he is not hampered by any shortage of funds. He goes out of his way to defend his officials. But I speak for every hon. member on this side of the House when I say they have not been attacked and no one in this hon. House has a greater regard for the officials in that unfortunate department than we on this side. For complete and utter frustration and lack of direction I have yet to see a government department which is the equal of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. I am not asking about what the official inspector is told when he comes round. I say there is complete and utter frustration and lack of direction from the Minister downwards. I think he is also frustrated because in his heart of hearts he knows he is failing, he is not delivering the goods, and with every year that passes it will become more evident that he is failing. He cannot win. The odds of population are against him. He is going to lose, and he knows it. He should have left Mr. Blaar Coetzee in his department to take over his job when he had failed.</p>

<p>Why are they failing? I say it is because of lack of direction, in spite of all the money. There is lack of planning, lack of appreciation of the size of the problem. It is no good the Minister telling us here what developments are taking place in the Transkei, how many tons of metal are being won from the Transkei by a White company acting as the agent of the Bantu. What sort of nonsense is this? I am going to ask the Minister one question. I know the basis of the Transkei is the continuation of law and order, the same as it is the basis of any other country. Take away law and order and the Transkei is gone. Will the Minister withdraw Proclamation 400?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>You see, Sir, all this big talk and this big edifice is built on <span class="col_0063-0064" refersTo="page_0050"/>law and order provided by the White man. The (Minister spoke here for about 30 minutes building a great edifice. On what? On the law and order provided by the White man in the Transkei, and when we ask him whether he will let them govern themselves as far as basic law and order in their own country is concerned, he says &#x201C;no&#x201D;. This is the touchstone, this is the test: Leave them and let us see whether they can govern themselves. Can they do it? The Minister&#x2019;s answer is no, they cannot, and of course we know they cannot. We know this is but a big story, a spook story the Minister has built up.</p>

<p>But I want to go further and say this in regard to this question of planning. I am coming to the question of Limehill. The Minister seemed to ask for it, to invite it. Let me say this in regard to the question of Limehill. We on his side of the House believe that black spots must be cleaned up. We also believe it is inevitable that when large numbers of the population are removed there can be hard cases. That is almost inevitable, but they should be reduced to a minimum. Hard cases should never occur because large numbers of people are removed without adequate planning: They must be received under proper conditions in the places where they are moved to. That is basic, not only as far as Limehill is concerned but also in regard to Uitval and Vergelegen. Let me repeat that the officials who are handling these matters are doing their utmost; of that I have no doubt whatever. The Minister says he has all the money available. But though they needed that money, it has not been handed to them, it has not been made available to them. What happened in these three places was caused entirely by a lack of proper preparation before the Bantu were removed to those areas. And the position is still most unsatisfactory. I would say through you, Mr. Speaker, to the hon. the Prime Minister that the conditions in those three places would never be permitted by the Department of Public Health on any private farm or in any local authority or municipality in South Africa. The Department of Public Health would never permit the conditions which exist there now, conditions which the officials are attempting to improve. I accept that. But we are up against this situation. Not very long ago I was at Uitval with the hon. member for Pinetown and we did not go to any officials or any persons in authority at all. We went and spoke to Bantu people as we met them there and we discussed the matter. I found it interesting to find that everyone I spoke to first asked, &#x201C;Are you from the Government?&#x201D; They even went so far as to have a look at the number plates of the hon. member&#x2019;s car, which has NPN number plates. Why did they want to know if we were from the Government? I spoke to them and I believe that most of them were quite honest. They were very often reticent but quite honest. They are still in difficulties at the present time. One of the greatest difficulties is that amongst them there is a large number of adult able-bodied males who cannot get employment. If they want passes and so forth they have to go I think 25 miles to Dundee where they are dealt with by the Bantu Affairs Department. But only if they belong to the proper ethnic groups in respect of which passes are being made available can they get employment. Otherwise they have to go back to those towns again. But in the case of Uitval, whatever may be said, I want to tell hon. members this: The day before we arrived there, the one borehole which was supplying it with water, had dried up. That was the drought. I do not blame the Government for that, but I say that proper conditions should have been arranged beforehand. They should never have relied on one single borehole at a time of drought. The Government had put in another boring machine, and it was boring for all it could. But they had built a dam, and that dam had about 18 inches or two feet of water as a result of a thunderstorm a couple of days previously. That was the water for the Bantu at Uitval. It had come from the surrounding built-up area. One can guess What it was like. It was a bright yellow. It was in a shocking mess, because of what had been washed down as a result of the thunderstorm. But that was the only water that the people at Uitval had. One Native said to me: &#x2018;We are told that we must boil this water.&#x201D; I asked: &#x201C;What do you have to boil it for?&#x201D; he said: &#x201C;To get rid of the colour.&#x201D; That was all that he knew about it. This lack of planning must be attributed to that Department. It is the Minister&#x2019;s concern throughout the whole length and breadth of the Republic of South Africa. What is taking place at Uitval. Vergelegen and Limehill, is merely ore small facet of what is taking place throughout. The Bantu are being sent back to the homelands with nowhere to find employment, with nothing to do, with idle hands. They are going back in their tens of thousands. To what? Here is the big crux of the matter, the cardinal principle with everyone of us here in South Africa. The man who would work should be able to get work.</p>

<p>Yes. I am glad the Prime Minister asked that question. Let me tell him. In one case a Native I spoke to had been 15 years at a garage in Pinetown&#x2014;he recognized the NPN numberplate&#x2014;where they are manufacturing to-day these caravans. He could not go back there. He was in the wrong ethnic group. Another man had been a waiter in a hotel on the Durban front. He told us what his salary was. It was a very fine salary. Even by White standards it had been quite good. He could not go back there. He was of the wrong ethnic group. I asked whether there were any more cases like his. They said &#x201C;Yes. We believe that there are here approximately 8,000 to 9,000 souls altogether, men, women and children. We believe that there are 150 to 200 able-bodied men who are used for digging <span class="col_0065-0066" refersTo="page_0051"/>the graves, for digging latrines and making little roadways.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have never been so disappointed with the trend of a debate on the part of the Opposition as I have been this afternoon. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that there were various facets of Government activity about which criticism could in fact be expressed by the Opposition, but that as Leader of the Opposition he to-day wanted to steer the debate towards the question of the race policy pursued in South Africa. The hon. the Leader devoted his entire speech, which lasted more than an hour, to this important subject. Then the Minister of Bantu Administration followed upon him and gave a very detailed and accurate exposition of the policy of this side of the House. And what happened then? One of the most senior front-benchers of the Opposition, the hon. member for South Coast, who is their leader in that (Province, concerned himself with various trifling matters. He spoke about the subject of &#x201C;confidence&#x201D; and said that it was not a question of no confidence in the Opposition which was being discussed here, but a question of no confidence in the Government. He attacked the Prime Minister on the question of the election of a leader in Natal. The hon. member for South Coast knows that the National Party is a party founded on a federal basis. Never in the history of this party has a Prime Minister interfered in the matter of the election of a leader in a province. Much less would the present Prime Minister do so. I think that if there is someone who bases himself squarely upon the democratic manner in which our Party maintains itself, then it is the Prime Minister. In Natal the matter took its normal course according to the democratic character of the party there, and the party leaders of Natal chose the leader in whom they placed their trust at a properly constituted congress.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast spoke about these trifling matters, in respect of the question of no confidence, for a full 21 minutes. For the final six minutes the hon. member returned to this very important subject which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition mentioned. The question of the Transkei, which he raised here, was duly answered by the Minister. Another hon. member will reply to the question of Limehill. I do not want to argue about that. If at this early stage the United Party are already running away from a very important debating point such as this, then we foresee a great deal of difficulty for them in the five days ahead.</p>

<p>I want to return to the subject which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition mentioned. I want to begin by quoting from a statement made by a very distinguished statesman in South Africa, described by some as one of the greatest statesmen who ever lived. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have felt more and more that if we are to solve our Native question it is useless to try to govern Black and White in the same system, to subject them to the same institutions of government and legislation. They are different not only in colour but in minds and in political capacity, and their political institutions should be different, while always proceeding on the basis of self-government. One very important Commission had, I believe, Sir Godfrey Lagden as chairman, and as a result of that and other Commissions we have now legislation before the Parliament of the Union in which an attempt is made to put into shape these ideas I am talking of, and to create all over South Africa, wherever there are any considerable Native communities, independent self-governing institutions for them.</block>

<block name="quote">Instead of mixing up Black and White in the old haphazard way, which instead of lifting up the Black degraded the White, we are now trying to lay down a policy of keeping them apart as much as possible in our institutions. In land ownership, settlement and forms of government we are trying to keep them apart, and in that way laying down in outline a general policy which it may take a hundred years to work out, but which in the end may be the solution of our Native problem. Thus in South Africa you will have in the long run large areas cultivated by Blacks and governed by Blacks, where they will look after themselves in all their forms of living and development, while in the rest of the country you will have your White communities which will govern themselves separately according to the accepted European principles. The Natives will, of course, be free to go and work in the White areas, but as far as possible the administration of White and Black areas will be separated, and such that each will be satisfied and developed according to his own proper lines.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these words were uttered by none other than General Smuts in the Savoy Hotel in London on 22nd May, 1917, when he went over to become a member of the then War Cabinet. In these words the basis of our traditional Bantu policy in South Africa is embodied. These words could just as well have come from the lips of men such as Hertzog, Malan, Strydom, Verwoerd, or our present Prime Minister. In those days General Smuts was still one of the people who believed that this was the traditional apartheid policy of South Africa. Since that time, therefore, it has consistently been accepted as the policy, and to-day the present National Party still stands squarely, with both feet, on that road as it was then mapped out. This course was taken by all subsequent National Party Prime Ministers. The hon. member for Umlazi said in December, 1968, that there was no traditional Bantu policy in South Africa. Must we accept that the United Party wants to make the people believe that there is no such thing as a traditional <span class="col_0067-0068" refersTo="page_0052"/>Bantu policy in South Africa? The Bantu policy being implemented by this party to-day and as it is being accepted by the large majority of the White population, has been traditional since the earliest days of the history of South Africa. What is the traditional Bantu policy in South Africa? The basis of the traditional Bantu policy in South Africa is to guarantee the survival of the White man in South Africa and to ensure that White leadership will always exist in South Africa. The policy also has as its basis to see to it that proper homelands are created for the Bantu in South Africa and legislation which has been introduced has traditionally aimed at entrenching this fundamental principle. What we are doing to-day is a continuation and a further extension of that policy.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said at the close of his speech that he wanted to outline to us what the political character of United Party policy is. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a simple question, and I want him to answer it. Suppose the United Party were to come into power in South Africa; suppose that were to happen. The United Party would then be morally bound by its election manifesto to admit non-White representatives to this Parliament. In other words, eight Bantu representatives, six Coloured representatives, and two Indian representatives would sit in this House. There would therefore be a block consisting of 16 representatives of the non-White groups in South Africa in this House. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition were to come into power now, he would be bound to make this representation possible. What is more, suppose the Opposition were to come into power with a majority of 16 or 14, or even fewer, seats. This could happen in South Africa and we have already had similar results, i.e. where a Government came into power with a small majority. Would the Opposition then say to the world, to this House and to the non-Whites that, as it undertook to do, it would continue to place legislation on the Statute Book which would make it possible for that group of non-White representatives to sit in this Parliament? This group would then be the tail that wags the dog in this House. This is what we want to know from the Leader of the Opposition. If those 16 members came to sit in this House, they would be persons who would have a full say and full voting rights in regard to any legislation which may be passed in this House. Mr. Speaker, you can see what a threat this kind of legislation can contain for South Africa. These 16 non-White representatives would then be able to swing political power and opinion to one side or the other. I want to say to-day that the United Party will not proceed with that legislation. What can happen? As a result of that an eternal source of agitation might be created here. A small group of Indians, about 500,000 to 600,000 in number, would then have two representatives in this Parliament. The Coloureds of South Africa would have six representatives and the 12&#x00BD; million Bantu would have eight representatives. There would immediately be agitation on the part of the Indians for more representatives, as well as on the part of the Coloureds, and the Bantu would say: &#x201C;Why must we, who number 12&#x00BD; million, be satisfied with eight representatives as opposed to the six and two representatives of much smaller population groups?&#x201D; This situation would lead to unparalleled agitation in South Africa.</p>

<p>I also want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this: If a United Party policy such as this were implemented in South Africa, would it satisfy the liberal world and the U.N.? Last year the hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us that the United Party had on occasion changed its policy in the past owing to pressure exerted upon them from outside. Suppose now that this system of representation for the non-Whites, who are the numerically superior population groups in South Africa, is introduced. Would it satisfy the U.N. and the liberal world? Immediately pressure would again be exerted upon South Africa by the U.N. and the liberal groups, pressure which we have tried to reduce over the years, because they would see that there was a Government in power in South Africa which had already admitted that it had changed its policy and standpoint because of pressure from outside. In other words, as a result of a United Party policy such as this, we will have to endure anew all the foreign agitation and the unfavourable propaganda which we had against South Africa. Therefore we as a National Party say that we stand four-square by our apartheid policy, because it is a moral policy. But the policy of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not only illogical as far as South Africa is concerned, but it is also an emotional policy. I want to go further and say that it is also an immoral policy in respect of the non-White groups in South Africa. We say to these people that we want parallel development in South Africa. We want to do justice to them. What the National Party and the present Government are doing is to see to it that that course is followed consistently. The blame is laid upon us that everything we promised in the 1948 National Party manifesto has not yet been implemented. History can prove that since the National Party came into power in 1948, it has had to wage a bitter constitutional struggle in this House, from one session to the next. It also took many night sessions to obtain the necessary statutory powers for getting this policy, as we are implementing it to-day, on the Statute Book. Preparatory work which General Smuts said would possibly take centuries to implement, has already been done. This preparatory work has been done since 1948 and this National Party has worked wonders in this short space of time. It is only recently, actually since 1961, that we have been able to commence with many of these physical developments, and I think we may say with pride that a great deal of progress has been made. To-day the Minister began enumerating a number of these important <span class="col_0069-0070" refersTo="page_0053"/>things for us. I want to add to what he has said, just to get it on record, so that the United Party can look it up. I hope that we shall not again have to waste the time of this House by repeating these particulars. I want to deal with the expenditure from the S.A. Bantu Trust Fund. I am taking the period from 1964 and making a projection of the position as it will be with the provision which is now being made and the plans which we have up to the end of 1970. By then, on development alone, an amount of R274,011,945 will have been spent from the Bantu Trust Fund, provided that we obtain the funds for this, whereas in 1964 it was only R27,342,000. This development includes expenditure under various sub-heads, such as share capital investment in Bantu corporations, etc. These are investments in the Bantu Investment Corporation, the Xhosa Development Corporation, the Mining Development Corporation and expenditure on welfare funds, and expenditure from donations from the Bantu Beer Account. Land purchases will increase from R8.08 million in 1964 to R8.5 million in 1969-70&#x2014;a total of R52 million up to the end of 1969-70. There has also been compensation to Whites in the Transkei. The hon. member for Transkei has already spoken a great deal about this matter. I now want to give him the figures, and I think he also has the figures. From 1964-&#x2019;65 to the end of 1970 we shall have spent R10.3 million in this area on compensation to Whites whose properties, etc., have been bought up. The other important thing that we are now doing on a large scale is to activate the Bantu authorities, to give those authorities a chance, as the Minister said here, to see to it that the people themselves work and get things done. During the next year we are going to spend more than R13.5 million on this activation. So one can continue&#x2014;unfortunately my time is running short&#x2014;to show what is being done to develop these areas.</p>

<p>I just want to dwell on South-West Africa for a moment. This is a territory which also falls under us now. A total of R32.5 million will have been spent from Bantu Trust Funds, on development in that area, from 1964 to the end of 1970, if we obtain the funds. In Ovamboland&#x2019;s national authority area we shall therefore spend a grand total of R2,430,000. That is to say, in this entire complex, Ovamboland including the Caprivi Zipfel, we shall have spent an amount of more than R34.9 million on various developments by the end of 1970.</p>

<p>Sir, here I have merely endeavoured to give you a brief glimpse at the development which is in progress by mentioning these figures. These are huge amounts and I want to call upon the United Party to tell this House and the world plainly and clearly where they stand. One cannot blow hot and cold simultaneously. We want to know precisely: Does the United Party accept the development of the Bantu homelands as advocated by the National Party or not? If the United Party were to come into power, would they continue with it or not? Does the United Party accept that these homelands must eventually become completely independent homelands under their own government?</p>

<p>In other words, they accept that they must become an integrated part of South Africa as a whole. [Interjections.] If that is so, how does the race federation policy fit in, where one will have a whole agglomeration of White, Coloured and Bantu races living here in South Africa? How can you then establish a race federation? The people and this House must get clarity about these points. As I have said, one cannot blow hot and cold. We want to know these things. The National Party stands squarely behind the policy of parallel or separate development. We believe in it. We foresee, as the Minister said here, that we cannot accomplish these things in a matter of a decade or two. We agree with Gen. Smuts that it may possibly take a century or longer to do so. But we say that for the preservation of the white man in South Africa and for the preservation of white leadership here, let us do so. Let us develop these people separately. Let us be inspired with the idealism to do so. If we have that idealism, we will not waste any effort on these trifling debating points which we got from the Leader of the Opposition to-day. But if we come together in this House as people with honest and sincere intentions for the survival of the Whites in South Africa and for the maintenance of white leadership here, then we will put our heads together here to ensure that these things are done in the best possible way for all race groups in South Africa.</p>

<p>I was pleased that the hon. member ended his speech in the manner he did, and I certainly would like to follow up in that spirit, although I believe his argument is based on fundamentally the wrong premise. Although he started off by quoting Gen. Smuts, and this delighted us very much, as usual he stopped halfway, because Gen. Smuts went on in his speech and he ultimately ended up by saying this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think there can be among those who have given the subject serious attention, any doubt that in the supreme Legislature of the country with a mixed population, all classes and colours should have representation &#x2026; It is repugnant to our civilized European ideas that the weaker in a community should not be heard or should go without representation either by themselves or through European spokesmen; where their interests are concerned there can be only one sovereign body in a country and that body should represent the weaker no less than the stronger.</block>

<p>This hon. gentleman started off by saying that his party&#x2019;s policy was following the traditional race approach in South Africa, and this is a misconception that I think we should deal with right away, because propagandists from that side of the House continually try to suggest to the country and continually try to foster the belief that their approach to the race problem is the traditional one.

<p>Did Dr. Malan or Mr. Strydom have it as their policy? [Interjection.] When I read the history of South Africa I find there is only one gentleman who seriously propagated the idea of independent black states as the solution to our race problem, and that was Dr. Philip of the London Missionary Society, and you know how much trouble he caused in South Africa.</p>

<p>But perhaps I should quote the architect of this whole policy, Dr. Verwoerd. In fact, only in the fifties, speaking in the Other Place, he accused this side of the House of trying to suggest to the public that he wanted to constitute independent states, and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that I had announced the forming of an independent Native state &#x2026; a sort of Bantustan with its own leader &#x2026; That is not the policy of the party. It never has been that and no leader has ever said it and most certainly I have not.</block>

<p>That was Dr. Verwoerd. Then he went on a bit further and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. Senator wants to know whether a series of self-governing areas will be sovereign. The answer is obvious. How could small scattered states arise? We cannot mean that we intend by that to cut large slices out of South Africa and turn them into independent states.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you have this complete <i>volte face;</i> you have this complete somersault, and here we have this unusual situation that the British independent black states policy which has been consistently and vociferously condemned by that side of the House has now been made the policy of that side of the House, and then they come and tell us that that is our traditional policy. It is nothing of that kind.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made certain sneering remarks about morality, and he wanted us to define the morality of our approach. Mr. Speaker, that is a garment that not many people can wear very well. I think it is one of the weakest cards in the pack of that side of the House. What level of morality do you attain when you assign to 75 per cent of the people of the country 13 per cent of its land area: when you take for yourself 95 per cent of its productive capacity? [Interjections.] I say the keystone to morality, as I understand it, is that there should be agreement by the parties concerned. Who agreed to this division of land and of wealth? Did the Coloureds agree to their removal from District Six? Did the Indians agree to their removal from their trading sites in Rustenburg? Once you have agreement on these things then talk about morality but the worst form of immorality is where you make promises that you do not keep. Look at the history of that side. Their political road over the last 20 years is littered with broken promises.</p>

<p>Sir, nobody on that side of the House, nobody who has spoken yet, has attacked or has repudiated the basic charge made by my Leader, and that basic charge is that probably one of the most fundamental developments in South African politics at the present time is that growing realization by a large group of South Africans who traditionally support the race policies of that side, that we are being led into a kind of racial <i>cul de sac.</i> That is why they are asking for &#x201C;volkskongresse&#x201D;; that is why they want new mandates and a new race charter, and I also sense a change in their mood. They are no longer going to be satisfied with slogans; they are no longer going to be satisfied with these slick slogans which are in fact meaningless. No, Sir, they want more than that. They want us to get to the substance of the real problem, and that is what we should do in this House. Mr. Speaker, if you take this Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development and then strip it of all the ideological clap-trap, it remains there for everybody to see that two things stand out clearly: the first one is that the Government can never achieve the objectives that they themselves have set as minimum objectives for the success of this policy but, secondly, and even more important than this, when you take this policy to its logical conclusions, you see that it would be political madness to try to achieve these objectives.</p>

<p>That is what I want to deal with and I want to do it under half a dozen different headings, and the first one is the demographic factor, the question of numbers, to which my Leader has already referred. The new Deputy Minister of Justice is so sensitive on this question of numbers; he does not want us to mention numbers. My accusation is that the greatest single disservice that that side of the House has done South Africa with the introduction <span class="col_0073-0074" refersTo="page_0055"/>of its separate development policy, is that they have coupled to it the doctrine of numbers, because inherent in their whole policy is the idea that the white man is politically doomed unless you can show that at a given stage there will be parity in numbers. They have tied the white man&#x2019;s political survival to racial ratios and, Sir, when you introduce arithmetic into this issue, then ultimately we will be the losers; of that I am certain, because basic to their policy is that at the turn of the century there must be numerical parity between White and Bantu in so-called white South Africa. The most optimistic estimate for the white population at this time is 6 million. That means that there must be fewer than 6 million Bantu. What you would achieve thereby I do not know because at that stage of our development there will also be 6 million Coloureds and 2 million Indians, so we will still be outnumbered by two and a half to one, even in the white areas. But for the effectiveness of that policy this is apparently an essential. But look at the other side of the picture. Recent estimates now suggest that the Bantu population at the turn of the century will be 28 million, and anybody who knows anything about this will realize that unless something catastrophic happens, the figure is likely to be 30 million or more. I will not develop that theme. Even at 28 million it means that the reserves at the end of this century, in terms of their own policy, should accommodate 22 million people. How you could cram them in there I do not know because even the most optimistic estimates suggest that the maximum carrying capacity of the reserves, with favourable industrialization, will be only 10 million people. But you want to put two and a half times that number into the reserves. And then look at the fantastic figures that are involved, as quoted by my Leader.</p>

<p>Sir, this means that at the turn of this century in order to have 22 million Bantu in those areas, you would have to move some 15 million over the next 30 years; it comes close to half a million a year. And what are they going to do when they get there? You must find jobs for them; they cannot be taken up into agriculture because Tomlinson has indicated that the economic farm unit in the reserves is 50 morgen and at that rate they have already reached saturation point. You cannot take them up in commerce and in super structures like services because they will be too impoverished. The bulk of them will have to go into industry, and if we take the Government&#x2019;s border area system as a guide, we find that it cost us R10,000 to put one Black worker into a border area.</p>

<p>These border area industries are supposed to be labour-intensive. What is going to happen when they become capital-intensive? The border areas in any case are sited near an industrial infra-structure.</p>

<p>What is going to happen when you do it in the homelands where nothing exists? Prof. Sadie has said that to make any sort of impact, we will have to find jobs for 180,000 a year in the reserves, and that was said before these latest population projections; the figure is now well above 180,000. Sir, if we have to take them up in industry at this sort of rate that I have quoted, we come to astronomical sums of money, and that is why the Government is so reluctant to answer whenever we ask what this will cost; they get flirty, they move around it and they hedge and they never want to tell us because they know that the voters of South Africa will not approve of this policy if they have the facts and the figures before them. In the face of these figures, the Government&#x2019;s obstinacy and its reluctance to use private white capital and initiative in the development of the reserves is inexplicable. The one thing that can help them to carry out their own policy they deny: they do not want to do it, and they talk about controls. This Government is obsessed by controls. They have far more economic controls now than you have in any free enterprise system in the world. Sir, you do not need controls to get industries to the reserves; you need inducements. The hon. member for Maitland has for once in his career here made a wise remark. He asked: &#x201C;Will money go there, will industrialists go there?&#x201D; And instead of tackling this problem properly, they come with this amazing economic monstrosity, a so-called border area scheme. This is introduced with the intention of showing that there is not economic integration in South Africa. But, Sir, it proves precisely the opposite, because you are not taking your industry to any other basic resources like water or mineral deposits; you are taking it to Black labour. My hon. Leader said that this economic development in the border areas would stifle industrialization in the reserves. He is, of course, quite right. It is there that you site industries, near the borders, and you give them free access to white capital and white initiative, essential ingredients for development which you deny to the reserves themselves.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>I have said that you need inducements and not controls. These areas are going to become independent shortly and then the Turks and the Chinese and everybody else will flock in&#x2014;and here the Government is worrying about safeguards!</p>

<p>Sir, our own attitude to this issue is quite clear. We also want to develop the Bantu <span class="col_0075-0076" refersTo="page_0056"/>homelands because we see them as economic and political growth points for the Bantu, and we realize that in order to do this we must increase their carrying capacity, and the only way in which you can do that is to industrialize them, and we also know that there will be no large-scale industrialization unless you have private white capital and initiative. We will have an imaginative programme which will provide for precisely that, and in that way we will be able to stimulate development in these areas. You see, Sir, the difference is this; we do not see them as future independent areas. We see them as under-developed areas within the South African context, so it is easier for us to go to our people and say: &#x201C;We must spend some money on those areas&#x201D; because our total economy will benefit thereby. But hon. members opposite have to tell their people, &#x201C;Spend money on these areas because they are going to become independent&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But, Sir, there is a second major issue to which I want to refer, and that is this: If you carry this policy to its logical conclusion what is going to happen in the field of labour? Because, as has already been indicated, some 80 per cent of the workers in our manufacturing industry will become foreign citizens. Some 90 per cent in mining and agriculture will become foreign citizens. Now we deny them the use of unions and we say that they cannot organize such unions. But once they are foreign citizens, they can establish their own unions in their own countries and register there and operate from there. Then the white unions will be absolutely powerless because they will have no legal authority. In this way, you will find that even minor industrial disputes could become international incidents and might have to go to the United Nations. Here you would have a system of industrial relations which would be based on inter-state bargaining. It is something that has never happened in the free world before. We will have foreign countries who will have a stranglehold over our economy. They will be able to hold us up to ransom, something which no government should be permitted to do to a country. Mr. Speaker, in our case the situation will not arise, because we will see the Black workers as they always have been and as they are now, citizens of South Africa. They will all be subject to the jurisdiction of this Parliament. And on the positive side we would wish to develop them as workers making full use of their potential by training and advancing them, because we know that the white man can advance quicker if the Black man pushes him upwards.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Sneaker, there is a third consideration we must look at, and that is the strategic one. And this is one that is continually glossed over by that side of the House. But it is necessary that we should look at it. Never before in the history of the world has one sovereign state cut from itself some eight or nine or more different pieces and made them foreign entities. And the implications from a strategic point of view are vast. To begin with; to control access to our country will be made infinitely more difficult. Secondly, if these Black areas will control some of our most important strategic resources, such as water, they will straddle some of our most important communications. It will lengthen our borders by at least six or seven times, and we will still sit with what could well become potentially one of the biggest fifth columns in the world. But. Mr. Speaker, this is precisely what happens with the policy of separate development. We never knew that Korea existed until somebody said it must have separate development and that there must be a north and a south. And we certainly know about Korea now. And the same has happened in the Vietnam. The moment you split a country you leave yourself open to interference by foreigners. In our case it will not be a question of having it 5,000 miles away. It will be right inside our borders, in the heart of South Africa. The Russians for instance have deliberately forced their satellite states to site their factories in close proximity to the Russian border, because then they are so vulnerable. Here we go and we voluntarily site all our factories on the borders of countries that are going to become independent. This would make any general who has any knowledge of these things turn in his grave. In our case, with our policy, the situation will not arise, because we see South Africa from the defence point of view as one entity. We will not create a power vacuum in South Africa. And we shall not sacrifice military control over portions of it if we can possibly avoid it. It is our task to defend South Africa and therefore we are not going to exchange this long-term need for the defence of South Africa for the dubious advantages of short-term political gain.</p>

<p>But there is a fourth consideration I should like to mention, and that is the economic one. Now, the Tomlinson Report made a valid comment when it said that South Africa&#x2019;s economy was one and that we dare not split it without facing the consequences. And. Mr. Speaker, this has been shown elsewhere. Why did Russia recently have to step into Czechoslavakia with force of arm? It was not just because there was a process of liberalization but it was because they wanted to escape from the Russian economic security zone. The Russians had to force them by force of arms to stay within this network. And we will create the same situation here. Because, what is the natural reaction the moment you begin to create independent political entities? They also want to become independent economically. We ourselves are a classical example of that. And in this way you will set up within South Africa competing economic agencies. And what will happen if they begin to reach saturation point within their own areas, if they industrialize, which they will do soon? The present purchasing power of the reserves is estimated at only about R80 million per year. They will have to export. And if they export they might compete unfairly with us. In that case we will have to put up our tariffs and a protective <span class="col_0077-0078" refersTo="page_0057"/>wall. But what happens if they cannot compete fairly? This is the situation that has arisen in the history of nearly all countries. Initially in their industrialization they are not competitive. One of the stratagems they normally resort to is that they devalue their currency in order to become competitive. Will the Transkei be able to devalue its currency? It cannot, because its currency is our currency. So it might undermine it. It might weaken our currency to the extent where we might have to devalue or to the extent where we will have to go on subsidizing them by massive amounts.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, whoever devised the separate development policy had no understanding of the economic factors or deliberatey chose to ignore them. I think it is the latter, because has the hon. the Minister of Finance not said in this House that if need be he will break the laws of finance and economy in order to fit and conform to an ideological pattern? In our case, with our policy this will not arise, because we see South Africa as an economic entity We see it as one entity and we realize that there are certain areas that have underdeveloped regions and that those in the interest of total economy should be developed to the full. That we will do, because we realize too that it is far easier to maintain racial peace in an expanding than in a contracting economic society. We will safeguard and we will avoid political explosion in this country through planned and controlled economic expansion.</p>

<p>And then, Mr. Sneaker, there is a fifth factor, namely the political one. And it is when you take the political aspects of the Government&#x2019;s policy to its logical consequences that you really realize how farcical the whole thing becomes. Because, in terms of their policy all ethnic entities must now be developed to full nationhood. In some cases it consists of only about 10,000 people. I could put them all into the civic hall at Parow. They must now become fully autonomous units. They will have all the political trappings. We have heard of all the Bantu authorities and everything else. But our charge is that they will practically have no economic substance. And so we are creating here within our own area a cluster of have-not nations who will be casting envious eves upon us&#x2014;a situation ripe for the political adventurer. This is my main charge against them: In addition to all the so-called political development, what have they done? Rights of real substance have been withdrawn or rescinded and replaced by illusionary rights. That is our contention. And what is more, these illusionary rights are in some cases granted to people in the reserves&#x2014;and let us be frank about it&#x2014;who are generally speaking a backward peasantry. But this has been used as an excuse to deny all forms of political participation to the better educated, the more sophisticated groups who live in the rest of South Africa. What iota of logic is there in a policy that promises complete independence to the Damaras, but does not hold it out to the Coloureds, who with the turn of the century will number 6 million people? Unless you create a homeland for the Coloureds and unless you create a homeland for the Indians and take them to full independence, this whole policy stands revealed for what it is, a magnificent edifice but it is a hollow shell. We do not see it this way, &#x201C;Mr. Cheaper&#x201D;. [Laughter.] I regret that oversight, Mr. Speaker. I think it is what they call a <i>lapsus linguae,</i> a slip of the tongue, but it has not got any Freudian connection. In our case we would deal with different sections. We see the Bantu homelands as economic and political entities. We believe they should be developed economically and politically because we see them as constituent elements of the broader South African federation. But we also realize there are groups who will not have homelands and those groups must continue to be represented in this House. We also know there are certain crucial over-riding factors which affect the security of the whole of South Africa, matters such as its defence, its currency, its outside contacts, and those things should be decided here in this House. In this House, although all communities will have representation here, the politically more mature group, the group which in any case must foot the bill, namely the White group, should have control. We on this side say that where you have a pluralistic society such as the South African one, consisting of many diverse elements, then the only constitutional system which can begin to look like one that can embody all this and recognize the diversity which is there, yet give you stability, is the federal one. And that is the role of the White man here: he must be the guarantor of political stability. The White man must be the one who must control and see that there will in fact be peaceful and ordered political evolution. That is the task which we will not abdicate. Those gentlemen opposite have now become frightened and shy of the words &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;. But White leadership has brought South Africa to where it: is why should we now run away from it? White leadership in any case is intrinsically as sound as Black leadership and is infinitely preferable to chaos&#x2014;and what we want to avoid here at all costs is chaos. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#janson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on more than one occasion I have listened to the hon. member who has just spoken, and I must admit that at times I have done so with pleasure. But up to now in this debate I have not heard anybody saying so many contradictory things in such a short while as the hon. member has just done. I want to point out a few of these things to him.</p>

<p>The hon. member started by referring to morality: he brought morality into this. I do not want to argue with him now about the concept of morality and turn it into a game of words. After all, morality can in the first place mean that one has to be honest with the people with whom one has to work, and in the first place with one&#x2019;s own people. In this regard the hon. member asked whether it constituted <span class="col_0079-0080" refersTo="page_0058"/>morality if in South Africa such a large percentage of the population were only granted 13 per cent of the land. I am asking the hon. member and the United Party to tell the South African electorate, the Whites, that they now wish to apply morality and divide the country on a numerical basis. [Interjections.] I do not even wish to argue about the 13 per cent, which is a controversial statement in any case. The hon. member spoke of morality, and this is the argument he used for attacking the alleged lack of morality on this side of the House.</p>

<p>In the second place he spoke of &#x201C;agreement&#x201D; that had to be reached. One can only do these things which the Government is doing if one reaches agreement with the other party. Now I want to ask the hon. member: how is this &#x201C;agreement&#x201D; going to be achieved? Will it be on a vote for vote basis? Will everybody over 18 years have the vote? How does the United Party intend to reach &#x201C;agreement&#x201D; with the non-Whites of South Africa? I am including the Coloureds here, since the hon. member mentioned the Coloureds as well. Must the Indians, too, everyone of them who lives in this country and is over 18 years, decide over the future of South Africa on a vote for vote basis, everybody on an equal footing with the Whites, the people who are at present in control of this country? May I ask the hon. member what he means by &#x201C;agreement&#x201D;? Or must one party have 20 votes and the other party only one? Where is the morality in that, the morality the hon. member attacked on this side of the House?</p>

<p>In the course of his argument the hon. member tried to justify General Smuts&#x2019;s attitude, and he made the statement that Dr. Verwoerd had been first to speak of these homelands as entities. It is possible that Dr. Verwoerd had been the first person to give shape to this idea. But I want to tell the hon. member that even if perhaps I do not know the history as he does and even I have not travelled as extensively as he has, I do know that as far back as in the course of the Great Trek the principle that every nation had to have its own land was accepted. As far back as that this was accepted as a principle. If he wishes to go back as far as that, he may take a look at the agreement concluded between the Voortrekkers and the various nations, for proper boundaries ensure proper neighbourly relations amongst nations. Therefore, this is no new concept, as was pointed out by another hon. member earlier this afternoon. To grant a homeland to other people, is no new concept. Over all these years, even before the Whites entered the non-White areas, the non-White nations of South Africa accepted this concept. They fought one another; they massacred one another over the boundaries of their fatherland as they saw them. He who denies this, denies an entire history.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the hon. member suggests that this policy was really given shape in the time of Dr. Verwoerd, or that Dr. Verwoerd was the first person to talk about it, I should like to say this to him. I want to read out to him what Dr. Malan said in 1948 when he assumed the reins of government on behalf of the National Party. He mentioned three points which were to hold good as objectives of the National Party in years to come. The first was to keep together Afrikaners who belonged together. The second was to unite English- and Afrikaans-speaking people in South Africa, each with the retention of its own identity and with undivided loyalty to South Africa. That is another promise the National Party has kept over the past 21 years, despite the opposition of the party opposite, despite their opposition to the Republic and to everything that was to effect unity between Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking people in South Africa, something which Dr. Malan set as an objective in 1948. I am mentioning the third point specifically for the hon. member&#x2019;s information. Dr. Malan said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the non-White population is concerned, the Government will also look after their particular interests to the best of its ability. Apartheid is not the caricature it is so often made out to be. On the contrary, for the non-Whites it implies the development of greater independence and of their feeling of self-respect as well as the provision of more abundant opportunities for free development in accordance with their own nature and capacity. For the Whites, on the other hand, it implies a new feeling of security as a result of the protection of their own identity and future, and for both races it implies peaceful relations with each other and co-operation in their common interest. As a Government it is our firm intention to seek to attain this happy state of affairs.</block>

<p>Here one finds the germ of the things that are being done in our times. Here these things were predicted. As far back as that it was said what work was to be done in order to grant the non-Whites, in accordance with their own nature and capacity, those things for which they were ripe. Over the years all these things were done by this Government, each time with the strongest opposition from that side of the House. The creation of the homelands and the further development thereof, as is taking place under this Government, is merely the further development of the policy which as long ago as that was outlined by Dr. Malan to the people of South Africa and to the world. Those principles have been developed by the National Government for the past 21 years.</p>

<p>There is one basic difference between the National Party and the United Party, and perhaps the hon. member has not yet noticed it fully since he is as junior a member of this House as I am. This basic difference the hon. member, and I am afraid the hon the Leader of the Opposition and other hon. members opposite as well, has not noticed as yet. To the National Party there is one cardinal condition to which all other things are subordinate. When Dr. Malan spoke at the Union Buildings, <span class="col_0081-0082" refersTo="page_0059"/>he stated his third objective as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The third objective of my political endeavour has been that South Africa should be safeguarded for the White race and its future.</block>

<p>Then he used the following prophetic words. These are prophetic words, but in the assumption of its duties they also constitute a directive to a new government, to the present Government as well&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nobody who has seen the trends of recent times, has not prayed for a solution, since South Africa was rapidly heading for disaster.</block>

<p>There we have the one thing which is perhaps being forgotten in these times, the thing the United Party is trying to make South Africa believe, i.e. that nothing has been done. Let me tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition as a whole that when this Government came into power, it did not merely find bare tracts of land where building operations could be commenced. There were also slums that had to be demolished; there were ruins which had first to be razed to the ground before building operations could commence. While Dr. Malan, Advocate Strydom and Dr. Verwoerd were undertaking this task, and to-day while this task is still in progress, that side was and has consistently been trying to destroy the positive work that has been done. All of this is destructive work that they have done. This was done by the United Party. I tried to ascertain, until my time ran out, how many hours of the time of this House were utilized by that side of the House to oppose every measure, including those they are accepting to-day as sound measures. Every measure relating to a way of life peculiar to South Africa they have fought tooth and nail. Last year and the year before last, in the course of debates in this House, the hon. member for Yeoville said that separate residential areas would be respected by the United Party as well. But what opposition did we not find when Group Areas legislation was dealt with here? [Interjections.] If I am doing the hon. member an injustice, I should like to refer to his Hansard. I shall find an opportunity for doing so yet. He said that separate residential areas would be accepted by them.</p>

</speech>

<p>Yes, there may be many things which are unfair according to the hon. member, but in any case, the hon. member for Yeoville said that the Group Areas Act, as it is being implemented, would be respected by them if they were to come into power. In any case, that will never happen. The hon. member said that that legislation would remain as it is on the Statute Book.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Not the Group Areas Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#janson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>You did say that by implication. This is what the hon. the Prime Minister has elicited to-day by way of an interjection. By implication it was admitted here to-day by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that other legislation, too, was being accepted by the United Party as sound legislation.</p>

<p>There is just one more question I wish to ask the hon. member who has just sat down. In regard to border industries he said that the latter were not being established in the &#x201C;homelands&#x201D;. Incidentally, I do not know whether his objections would fall away if we were to move those industries one mile across the border. I do not know whether he would be satisfied then. Later in his speech the hon. member referred to separate entities and to these homelands as home areas. Are they home areas because the National Party made them that? Are they home areas because the National Party has announced a new policy which is changing the world? Or are they home areas because the Transkei and the Ciskei have always been there and because there are other areas where non-Whites are living, where they have already been living as separate nations for years? After all, this is history; surely, these are facts, each of them, and those who deny them are simply denying realities.</p>

<p>The hon. member admits that the work that has already been done, should be continued, that it should be continued at a faster rate, even with the introduction of White capital, as he put it. Then it amazes him that we do not want to develop those areas as an integral part of South Africa. Why then does he incorporate the verbal concept &#x201C;separate homelands&#x201D; in his vocabulary as part of their policy? One hears such a confusion of tongues from the Opposition benches that eventually one does not know what they want or do not want or what they admit or what they deny.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>General Smuts called them homelands long before you did so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#janson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to hear that one of the leading figures in the United Party also accepts homelands in our sense of the word.</p>

<p>I just want to deal briefly with two further points. I am now coming to what the hon. member said about the strategic disadvantages this development of the homelands entails for us. I want to ask the hon. member in what respect the situation would in any way be better for South Africa if the United Party&#x2019;s policy, as announced this afternoon by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, were carried through. In what respect could it in any way place South Africa in a better strategic position? The Transkei and the other Black areas where the Bantu will be living together, will still be there. If the hon. member thinks <span class="col_0083-0084" refersTo="page_0060"/>that it would make for rebellion and unrest, I may just tell him that where groups of people live together in that way and cherish the same ideals, and they still want to rebel, then they will do so, even if it is in Harlem in New York. South Africa&#x2019;s strategic position is not being prejudiced at all. On the contrary, it is being benefited. Somebody in this House once phrased it the following way: I would rather have him over there; I would rather have a lion over there than cherish a viper in my bosom. This was not a reflection on our non-White population, but as imagery it is at least an explanation of the attitude adopted by the National Party in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the people who had to be absorbed in our industries. This hon. member started by discussing moralities. Since he referred to consequences of policy, I just want to say that the full consequences of his attitude, if morality is to apply and the non-Whites are to be absorbed in the industries, will be that everybody has to be afforded the same opportunities for work as are afforded to the Whites. Surely, they are to get &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; together with all of its implications, no matter what they are. Is this the point of view held by that hon. member and his party? Must they, for the sake of morality, be afforded absolutely equal opportunities in all spheres in the White industries? If that is what the hon. member meant, and I do not doubt his morality, then I want to ask him whether he would propagate this point of view when the election is being held in Newcastle in Natal and in all the other places where by-elections are held. I want to ask that hon. member whether he would defend the premises of morality he proceeded from here this afternoon before the White electorate of South Africa.</p>

<p>Then I also want to try to give the hon. member some advice. This is, after all is said and done, advice I also want to give to a few more members on that side, although there are fortunately still a few exceptions amongst them. I want to tell them that they need not aspire to leadership or give thought to it, but that they should simply fall into line behind the leader of those people who propagated their point of view and paid and will still pay the price for it. They should fall into line behind the hon. member for Houghton. Then they would at least have the satisfaction of being able to join that hon. member in speaking of morality in a way which is also a wrong interpretation, but which can at least be carried through to logical consequences and does not become as confused as has now happened once again to the hon. member for Hillbrow.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lindsay">

<from>*Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. LINDSAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in his speech the hon. member for Witbank made a few statements which missed the point completely. He had a long discussion about the Group Areas Act. There has never been a period during which we, as the Opposition, did not say that having separate residential areas was our policy, but it is a fact that the Group Areas Act, as now being implemented by the present Government, is unjust and often places people in an invidious position. When the present Opposition comes into power the Act will be amended to a large extent. The hon. member mentioned the Transkei and its independence, and in connection with the question of control there he asked how the Opposition would implement it. This is precisely where he missed the point completely. When we extend and develop the Transkei as a part of South Africa we, as Whites, retain control over the Transkei. We have that final say, but under your policy you lose that say completely! The hon. the Minister said this afternoon that those homelands would develop to complete independence. When those homelands are completely independent you have no say over them, with this result, to take the matter a little further. Take for example the case of the border industries. Suppose there is such an industry under our policy&#x2014;what would happen if there were a strike? The hon. member for South Coast asked what would happen in the case of a strike. Under our policy we still have the say. Under your policy you have no say! There is nothing you can do about it. Suppose a workers&#x2019; union decided to go on strike to-morrow&#x2014;what could you do about it? That industry would inevitably come to a standstill. Should you want to do something about it, however, it would become an international incident. It has become even clearer, and I am sure the people see it in the same way that the Bantu policy of the Government we are dealing with here is, as has been stated, not busy failing, but has already failed. I do not think anybody has said a truer word about the policy of the National Party than the hon. member for Umhlatuzana did. According to the <i>Oosterlig</i> of November last year he put it in this way in addressing a meeting in Port Elizabeth (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of the National Party is not yet perfect and is changed according to stirrings in the outside world.</block>

<p>What, in contrast to this, have we heard here to-day in connection with pressure from the outside world? Here he says that the policy of the Nationalist Party is changed as a result of stirrings in the outside world!</p>

<p>At this stage of the debate I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<from>*Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. LINDSAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, where we are dealing with the Bantu policy of the Government, it is a pity that the fiction of it was exposed at so early a stage. Nevertheless, I want to make use of this opportunity to discuss the practical effect of the policy in a reasonably advanced homeland. I need not give the basic particulars. We all know them, but I have to repeat and stress, that the Ciskei-Transkei contains the great majority of Bantu in homelands. As in the case of the other Bantu areas, the same conditions of overpopulation prevail there. It is an underdeveloped area. The veld has been overgrazed and the lands, too, have been exhausted. The carrying capacity and the yields do not meet the needs of the population, not even to mention the increase. This is happening in spite of the Government&#x2019;s efforts, such as the miles and miles of contours and wire fences about which the hon. the Minister told us yesterday. After the work of all these years the maize crop in the Transkei to-day is only seven bags per family per annum, and in the Ciskei only three bags, as against the minimum requirement of 15 bags per family per annum. And this does not take into account something like last year&#x2019;s drought, when not one single grain of maize was produced. Now, we must bear in mind that 95 per cent of the grain harvest in those areas consists of maize. In regard of stock farming the position is not much better. The veld has been overgrazed. There is no reserve grazing, nor any question of additional fodder to meet circumstances such as those of last year. Thousands and thousands of head of stock died, and I should like to know from the hon. the Minister exactly how many, and what his estimated total is of the stock that died.</p>

<p>As a result of this state of affairs, and in addition a population increase of nearly 3 per cent and the immigration system which is being applied there by the present Government, that population naturally is a dependent one. They are dependent on the growing sector, the modern sector, and we all know that even a renewed or an expanded agricultural economy cannot absorb the excess of people there. We know that growth is not caused by an excess of people, but that an excess can only be absorbed where there is growth. And it is for this reason that we have the migration to the White area, where development is taking place. So, for example, we have, to supplement the figures my hon. Leader mentioned yesterday, the figures of the Bureau of Statistics in respect of the five sectors, namely mining, manufacturing industry, construction, transport and communication. In these five sectors there is a total of 2,234,000 employees only 529.000 of whom are Whites, while 1,414.000 are non-Whites. And the most interesting point about this is that during that period of growth, 1966 to 1968, which the hon. the Minister mentioned yesterday, the increase in White employees was 32,000, as against 144,000 non-Whites. As has been said, the Government for ideological reasons is now trying to stop this flow to the White sector. In order to try to do this they are now establishing country towns in these homeland areas. According to the hon. the Minister of Community Development, when he was still a Deputy Minister, 125 of these towns have been planned and three of them are now going up like ant hills in the Ciskei, namely Sada. Ilenge and Mngqesha, which are already over-populated.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, can you imagine what concentration of unemployed is being caused by this? What are the economic consequences of this? It means that an enormous capital amount of millions of rands is being used un-productively for housing and for the services in connection with that. Not only this, but also for the support of the people living in those villages. Where this happens within the framework of the Department of Social Welfare one can still understand it, but where people are taken out of employment to sit there unemployed, it is nothing but a disgrace. How can one reconcile the existence of these conditions with statements by hon. members on the other side? Let us look at what Grensboer <span class="col_0101-0102" refersTo="page_0069"/>says in <i>Die Oosterlig</i> of 13th December, 1968, in an article entitled &#x201C;Are we putting the cart before the horse?&#x201D; In that article he quotes the hon. the Deputy Minister of Justice, the hon. member for Heilbron. And, Sir, do you know what he said? He said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It does not make sense at this stage to withdraw and return to the homelands on a large scale Bantu who are working on a short-term basis in the white areas. Doing so can only mean that the Government will have to spend millions of rands, which could have been used towards the development of the homelands, on providing unemployed Bantu with food and clothing in their own area.</block>

<p>Let us now look at Grensboer&#x2019;s own comments on this speech. He wrote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In our over-eagerness to get rid of the superfluous Bantu in the white area we must not put the cart before the horse. There will be no question of pumping the Bantu back into the homelands as long as there are not sufficient employment opportunities for these people, otherwise, we would only be creating a new problem, one of impoverishment and starvation among the Bantu of the homelands.</block>

<p>Yet this is precisely what is happening. We have been putting forward these things all these years from this side. Since I entered this House I have mentioned them every year.</p>

<p>Let us look at the psychological effect of this state of affairs. For how long can one live on rations alone? Surely there are other needs that must be provided for. Surely it is a fact that in most people there is a desire or even an urge to work. Work and remuneration for what one does engenders self-respect, but how long will the Bantu retain their self-respect under conditions such as these? Just move around amongst them and ask them whether they are happy and how they feel about the matter. Nine out of ten will tell you that they can do nothing about it; they cannot help it. There is an old Afrikaans saying which runs: &#x201C;Give a man a fish and he will have food for only one day: teach him to fish and he will have food for the rest of his life.&#x201D; Does not our problem to-day lie precisely in the fact that it is the hungry man who falls victim to the evil we want to fight tooth and nail at the present time? The hon. the Minister said yesterday that a people saved itself: that it generated its own development. But I ask you, Sir, how can these people generate any development? If they could perhaps do it, how long would it take? There is a committee of the U.N. that found that the development of African states, would, I think, take 340 years. In my opinion that period will have to be extended to 3,000 years. I ask you, Sir, where would South Africa have been if it had had to generate its own development? Employment opportunities for the Bantu&#x2014;that is the stumbling-block of the Bantu population. Let us look at what the Bureau for Economic Research of Stellenbosch wrote in a report, issue number 59, page A.7, para. B.13, of 1st November, 1968&#x2014;please note: Not 1948! According to that report the greater production capacity in the field of manufacturing industry for the whole of the Republic is 26 per cent; lesser, 3 per cent. As regards the border area, greater&#x2014;a nought, a nought just like the Minister&#x2019;s; lesser, 16 per cent. As regards the number of employees for the border area the position is as follows: Greater, again absolutely nothing; lesser, 21 per cent. And that, Mr. Speaker, less than a year ago!</p>

<speech by="#lindsay">

<from>*Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. LINDSAY</person>:</from>

<p>The Ciskei/Transkei border area, the largest homeland in South Africa. Now let us look at the most recent report, dated 31st January, 1969. The greater production capacity for the Republic was 31 per cent; lesser, 3 per cent. For the Border it was as follows: greater, 18 per cent; lesser, 21 per cent. If we look at the number of employees, the position is as follows: Greater, 12 per cent; lesser, 36 per cent. Does this look like progress? Mr. Speaker, the extent of our problem in that border area is such that we do not only need the third Iscor there, but also the fourth and fifth plus all its ancillary industries. When hon. members on the other side boast of border areas, mention is always made of the Good Hope Textile factory at King William&#x2019;s Town. Quite rightly so, because it is undoubtedly one of the best border industries we have, if not the best. But what hon. members on the other side never mention, is that according to their policy that industry is situated on the wrong side of the border. Now, where is the exploitation of the Bantu we have to hear about every day? This is a model industry, an industry that could well be taken as an example to be followed by many others. Sir, it is high time that the Government woke up from its dream. It is no longer the time of &#x201C;Botha in Bab land&#x201D;; now it is &#x201C;Botha in Bantu land&#x201D;. One of these days it is perhaps &#x201C;Botha in foreign parts&#x201D;, because then this Government will no longer be in power. What does all this nibbling at political rights mean when these basic problems exist? Priority number one, the hon. the Minister said yesterday, is the development of authorities.</p>

<from>*Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. LINDSAY</person>:</from>

<p>Just have a look at his speech and you will see that he said so. He said that numbers did play a part, but that the development of authorities was priority number one. It is high time that the Government became less obsessed with Bantu domination in the political field. And while I am talking about this, I just want to say this, <span class="col_0103-0104" refersTo="page_0070"/>that the Government must please be careful about being so proud of the result of the recent election in the Transkei, because the party that won that election was the Transkeian National Independence Party, the party of Matanzima. And you know, Mr. Speaker, what the points of policy were that that party put before the people&#x2014;for example: they would strive for the acceleration of independence and for more land for the Transkei. Is there any point of policy that could cause greater disputes in the future than precisely that unsettled question? But let us look for a moment at this political development in the Bantu areas, where it has now, in terms of the new dispensation, been handed over to the Bantu personnel. There was a Chief Bantu Commissioner in King William&#x2019;s Town who not only looked after the Bantu in the Bantu area, but also after the Bantu in the white area, but now that they are taking over, he is becoming Chief Director only of the Bantu in the Bantu area, and his staff is being supplemented by dozens of white public servants. The Bantu are taking over now, but at least they are getting this in addition. Office blocks are being built in Zwelitsha, the Bantu town, but do you know, Sir, there are two large Bantu towns in the Ciskei, Mdantsane and Zwelitsha, but both these towns do not fall under the Bantu authority. Because they are situated in the Bantu area they do not fall under the Chief Bantu Commissioner who is now in Port Elizabeth either. In other words, they are not under any authority.</p>

<p>Sir, is this planning? Chaotic. If we cannot understand this, what hope do the Bantu have of understanding it? A great fuss is made about whether our policy will be accepted. The hon. the Minister told us yesterday of the difficulties with the Bantu, their beliefs and their superstitions, etc. I agree with him, but does he not know then that one of the beliefs of the Bantu is to be loyal to the Government in power? Sir, one can speak to any well-informed or influential Bantu, and there is not one who would not rate the policy of the United Party far above the policy of the Government. [Interjection.] Can one say anything but that there is no initiative or planning on the part of the present Government, a Government that cannot solve South Africa&#x2019;s most urgent problems, the shortage of White trained manpower and the surplus of untrained Bantu. My hon. Leader put it very clearly yesterday when he said that the Nationalist Party was divided into three groups and that the present Government did not have the confidence of any of those three groups. There is only one salvation for South Africa, and that is contained in the key word of the policy of the United Party, namely race federation, which was again put so clearly by my hon. Leader. Therefore I fully support this motion.</p>

<p>Before I come to the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town&#x2014;and I am in a hurry to come to him&#x2014;I first want to deal with the hon. member for Hillbrow, who wanted to lecture us on morality here yesterday afternoon. He was dealing with the hon. member for Benoni and took it amiss of him for allegedly not having read General Smuts&#x2019;s speech in full. The hon. member for Hillbrow then wanted to prove certain statements by quoting the late Dr. Verwoerd. I have no objection to that, if he is unable to prove his own case, but then one would at least expect him to quote Dr. Verwoerd correctly and not out of context. What I want to refer to is the following, and I want to thank the hon. member for having allowed me to read the unrevised copy of his Hansard speech. He quoted Dr. Verwoerd and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party is trying to create the impression that I had announced the forming of an independent Native state, a sort of Bantustan with its own leader. But that is not the policy of the party. It never has been that and no leader has ever said it, and most certainly I have not.</block>

<p>One sentence, one breath. Let us go back to 1st May, 1951, when Dr. Verwoerd made a speech in the Other Place when he introduced his motion of policy. Dr. Verwoerd replied to certain statements and referring to Senator Jackson, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He tried there to create the impression that I had announced the forming of an independent Native state, a sort of Bantustan, with its own leader &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is what Dr. Verwoerd said, but the hon. member then omitted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and which could make its own treaties, even with Russia. Sometimes they spoke of a state stretching from the Limpopo to the Fish River on the Indian Ocean.</block>

<p>The hon. member who quoted Dr. Verwoerd here and who wanted to give us a lecture on morality. I am just proving how the hon. member wanted to put words into the mouth of Dr. Verwoerd, or rather how he omitted certain words. Sir, I asked the hon. member by way of interjection to go on reading. Unfortunately my time is limited. There are other hon. members who would also like me to reply to them. But what did Dr. Verwoerd say in that same debate, virtually in the same breath? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am not expressing any opinion about the time it is going to take, all that I say my duty is, is to lay down the basis now for the development of that self-government.</block>

<p>At that stage Dr. Verwoerd was laying down the basis of self-government consisting of tribal <span class="col_0105-0106" refersTo="page_0071"/>authorities, regional authorities and territorial authorities, and that was why he said what he was envisaging and what he was not envisaging.

<p>It is a matter between that hon. member and his conscience whether he is still going to use the words of Dr. Verwoerd to prove the statements he made here yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now want to come to the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. This afternoon the hon. member adopted a different attitude here to the one I had expected him to adopt. Actually I had expected that he would have done what the <i>Daily Despatch</i> had told him to do, namely, to tell of all the misery which exists in Sada and in Hinge and Mngqesha, the three towns mentioned by him. It is strange that one moment he was telling us that there were only two Bantu towns in the Ciskei, namely Zwelitsha and Mdantsane, but that only a few minutes previously he was telling us of the many towns which were developing. I had expected him to carry on in that vein and I had expected him to carry on in the vein in which the United Party along with all the other liberalists carry on, as they are carrying on about Limehill. I should very much like to talk about Limehill, and I may still be allowed the time to say something about it this afternoon.</p>

<p>Yes, I have been there and I have paid visits to Sada, Ilinge and Mngqesha as well as all the other Bantu towns which these other people also like visiting so much, but I have not been there in the company of the Black Sash. I went there on my own. I did not even visit those places with a priest. When I go to those areas I go on my own and I conduct a proper investigation. I am not going to let myself be influenced there by other liberal parties, as happens to the opposite side when hon. members of the Opposition go there. Yes, I see that the hon. member for Port Natal is giving me a look. He of course, knows with which one of his political bed-follows he went there. Now, let us come back to Sada, Ilinge and Mngqesha. The hon. member wanted to give us to understand here that people were being taken from their employment, were being endorsed out and were then put in those places and given rations. Now I want to ask the hon. member whether he has been there?</p>

<p>Yet he wants to tell me here what the Bantu are saying. I know what the Bantu are saying, I speak the Xhosa language as well as he does, or even better. I also speak to them. Why do the Bantu not tell me the things they tell him? Can they tell by his face that he belongs to the United Party? I want to tell you, Sir, that we have a difficult problem at Sada, because at Sada we are settling the down and out Bantu nobody else in the world wants, people who are poor outcasts and for whom there are no other refuge. Forgive me for referring to what has happened on my own farm. My son&#x2019;s garden boy died round-about December. He was in his employ. He was a man who had a large family. He left a wife and children and some of his older daughters already have children of their own. He was the only breadwinner of that family. That woman cannot go to any municipal area now, because no municipality wants to or may build a house for her. Where is she to go? The other day I asked my son, &#x201C;Where is old Sophie&#x201D; and he replied, &#x201C;She is still here, Dad&#x201D;. I then asked him what she was living on, and he replied: &#x201C;I still pay her her wages, and I still give her her rations, but I cannot go on doing so. Something has to be done. Settle her somewhere.&#x201D; I then asked him whether he had seen the Bantu Affairs Commissioner, and he replied, &#x201C;Yes, and as soon as there is a vacancy for her at Ilinge, she may go there&#x201D;. This is the type of person we settle at Sada, Ilinge and Mngqesha. We are settling pensioners and other unsettled people there, people who squat at other places, also people who used to live along the Fish River. Yes, now the hon. member is grinning at me&#x2014;I beg your pardon Mr. Speaker, he is smiling at me. Some people along the Fish River sold their properties and they had old <span class="col_0107-0108" refersTo="page_0072"/>families who could not be placed in other employment and these are the people we are resettling.</p>

<p>I am referring to old pensioners who do not have any other accommodation. Municipalities come to us for permission to build houses and they tell us that they do not have sufficient funds, not even with the grants of the Housing Committee, to accommodate all these people. We must settle those pensioners somewhere and we are doing so. There are cases of unmarried mothers where the father later appears on the scene and says, &#x201C;These are my children. I am now prepared to take the woman&#x201D;. Thereafter those people no longer receive rations. The hon. member referred to the enormous costs being incurred. If welfare work is being done anywhere, we are doing it there. I am not ashamed of it. Proper control is being exercised. Those who draw a pension get a pension, whether it is the man or the woman, or both. There are cases of persons who cannot even do distress relief work. Those cases are investigated, and not only once per month either. Their circumstances may change. There may be one who may become fit to do distress relief work. She then receives an allowance of 20c per day. We let them dig holes for planting trees. We are going to beautify the place to the best of our ability. It is extremely dry there, as the hon. member knows. It is not an easy task. Water is not in plentiful supply.

<p>The people we employ there on distress relief work do not only plant trees but also gather stones for the crushers, so that that stone may be used in the concrete for the houses which are being built there. If the hon. member maintains that there is no employment, I want to tell him that more than 80 Bantu are employed in brick-making alone. In addition there are the Bantu employed in building houses. All other Bantu who are still capable of working are registered as work-seekers. There are not many of them, however, because they are not allowed to live there. There are other places where they can go and live. A town is being established there and the inhabitants are more or less the same kind of people. It affords accommodation to Bantu who have no other refuge. If indeed there are such Bantu there, they go to work as registered work-seekers at other places. The suspicion which the hon. member wants to sow here. i.e. that Bantu are being taken there on a large scale, Bantu who have employment, and that they receive aid there in the form of rations and pensions, is completely unfounded.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It depends which one you are interested in. Are there not Bantu of the Transkei who have also been drawn into East London? Is it our task to start industries there? Is it not the task of the Government to create conditions and when that has been done is it not the task of the industrialists themselves to carry on from there?</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town had complaints about planning. During the past drought when I drove through those areas, there were parts of the Bantu areas where planning had been completed, where the grazing was much better than that in the white areas. I admit that there were areas where the grazing was poor, because it is extremely dry in that vicinity. One must have seen it for oneself before one can have any idea of how dry it really is. If the hon. member wanted to suggest that there was no planning, however, he knows that what he would be presenting to this House would not be the true facts. Planning has been undertaken and an advanced stage has been reached with fencing off the grazing. I want to admit that crops are poor. There was no crop last year and the crop of the year before was also poor. If relief does not come soon, there will be no crop this year either. But now I want to ask what conditions are like in the white areas? What is the crop like in the white area? The hon. member told us what the yield was in the Transkei in bags per morgen, but I want to ask him where in the white area in that vicinity it is any better. There were no crops the past few years. I admit that conditions are still poor in many places, and that is why we treat the farmers&#x2019; association there as co-operations and grant them loans for obtaining the necessary traction, fertilizers and decent seed. It is of no use, however, to lend a man money to plough and fertilize his fields and to sow good seed when that does not yield a crop, and that is what has been happening for the third year running. The hon. member raised a smokescreen here simply to see whether he could not gain an advantage where there was no advantage to be gained. Those Bantu are as much employed in industries and at other places where they have looked for work as is the case as regards the rest of the country. In fact, you will find, Sir, that there still are large numbers of Bantu from the Ciskei and the Transkei in Gape Town and the Western Cape than from any other place. For the hon. member to say that there are no employment opportunities and that the people there are dying of misery and that they are being supported by the State, is simply so much nonsense.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I still have a little time at my disposal I want to say a few words about the &#x201C;Limehill Scandal&#x201D;. You know, Sir, I am not the one who coined that phrase. It is not even an original one. In point of fact it came from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> which used it as long ago as 5th December. 1968. I just want to try and point out in a few words who the guilty parties, the big ring-leaders, in this scandal are. Do you know who they are, Sir? They are occupying the front benches of the United Party in Another Place. I shall not deal with them here, I shall rather do it there. In addition to those, however, there are some who are sitting in this House. Then there is the English-language Press, certain newspapers. I do not want to group them together, because I most definitely want to exclude the <i>Natal Mercury,</i> which published an objective account about Limehill.</p>

<p>Yes, I know that since the publication of Mr. Morgan&#x2019;s objective account those hon. members no longer like to read the <i>Natal Mercury</i> as much as they did before. Sir, I was saying that some of those hon. members are sitting here. One of them is the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). He also has a word to add, but then he always has. Then there is the hon. member for Port Natal and his friends Mr. and Mrs. Grice. Mrs. Grice is the Chairwoman of the Black Sash of the &#x201C;Natal Coastal Region&#x201D;. They visited Limehill on the same day, Sir. They conducted their investigations together. Then there is Mrs. Barbara Wilkes, Chairwoman of the Cape Western Territory. Then of course there is yet another person. I shall definitely not overlook her. I see she is sitting on pins and needles in case I should fail to mention her. I am referring to the hon. member for Houghton. Then there are still a few members of the clergy, Archbishop Dennis Hurley and Father Rodney Nelson, for example, and then there are still people like Margaret Smith and Molly Reinhardt. Mr. Speaker, if there are more characters in this thriller who may qualify for the role of the villain, and if I have overlooked them, I ask them to forgive me. There are many in this House who have taken part in this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal is the man who said last year on 5th June (Hansard, Vol. 24, Col. 6603) that the people who were being removed to these places&#x2014;and in this case <span class="col_0111-0112" refersTo="page_0074"/>it is Limehill in particular that we have in mind&#x2014;were being removed under compulsion. What he was really saying at that time was that the people had been threatened with 90 days or 180 days. [Interjections.] It has to be correct because it appears in the Hansard report of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. That is what he said. I now come to Mrs. Barbara Wilkes, to whom I have referred. I should just like to read out to hon. members what this lady said in connection with the situation at &#x2026;</p>

<p>I just want to give him the information, Mr. Speaker. This is the serial. This is the thriller. This is the gossip about one single place, namely Lime-hill. The stories about Sada and Ilinge, are nearly as exaggerated. [Interjection.] I am still going to be here for the next six months.</p>

<p>On 23rd February, 1968, only a few days after the first six families had been brought to Limehill, Mrs. Barbara Wilkes wrote as follows to <i>The Cape Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The removal of 12,000 Africans from 12 African-owned or tenanted farms and eventually also from five white-owned mission stations in the Kliprivier-Dundee area of Natal to Limehill, about 20 miles away, which began on January 29th, has highlighted the policy of clearing up what are officially called &#x201C;black spots&#x201D;. The term &#x201C;black spot&#x201D;, which gives the idea of something evil which should be eradicated, is used in this context to cover farms and homes owned or traditionally occupied by Africans, which in time have become either surrounded by white-owned land or are adjacent to it. From these areas people have been and are being ruthlessly removed, deprived of their homes, cattle and the fruits of their labour and land.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, now I just want to deal with one aspect of this matter, namely Vergelegen, because time is running out. Now these are the people who are being forced from their homes. They may not take their cattle with them. They are being deprived of everything. Sir, Vergelegen is the farm which the Cunu tribe bought with the money which they received for the black spot farm they used to own, namely Boshoek. If there is talk of rights which used to exist, I want to ask hon. members opposite a question. There are a few more senior members, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for South Coast, who used to be so devoted to the 1936 Act and who had helped to place it on the Statute Book. If those places were Bantu property, places where the Bantu were to have rights for all time, why did they not declare the area in which Boshoek is situated a Bantu area in the 1936 Act? Why was that area already regarded as a black spot at that time? That area was not included in the schedule as were the other territories adjoining it. So, in carrying out this policy, we bought land in the Msinga reserve in accordance with the process of consolidation. The Cunu tribe bought some of that land.</p>

Now he will not also be able to claim that this too was a man who used to live at places where he was deprived of his home and his property.

There will be three of them at least, 25 miles from the nearest mechanic. And only now, a year later, is the third borehole being brought into use.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<p>I saw it. It is not the wrong information. It is the information that you did not get, because you say the Natives did not speak to you as they spoke to us. They do not speak to Government motor-cars. [Interjections.] In any event the main problem is the question of sanitation, the disposal of human waste, the potential source of nearly all epidemics; and there was an epidemic while we were there. If you want the names of the people in the cemetery, I will be quite prepared to supply them to the Minister. I saw 1,000 cards, all of which had been filled in by doctors&#x2014;1,000 cards of patients, and the man who gave them to me said that three-quarters of them related to children with diarrhoea. I looked at them; I did not inspect the whole lot, because that would have taken too long, but I think that was a fair estimate, that out of the 1,000 cards 750 were those of children suffering from gastro-enteritis. There was no protection from flies, which were numerous. In parts the Natives have been told to dig pit latrines, and some of the properties are in rock, which will need blasting to produce a pit latrine. I know Newcastle. I know that area because I was brought up there. The land is hard when it has not rained for months and to expect women&#x2014;because it is mostly women who are there&#x2014;to dig a 20-foot deep latrine and to protect the sides is quite unreasonable. There is no prospect of decent sanitation until the whole system is changed. There is not enough water for water-borne sewerage, but it has been decided, I am told, that a bucket system will be introduced. But it has not been started. No one is there to educate them if they do have it, and what is going to happen for the rest of this summer? Basically the whole tragedy of Limehill and its surroundings is entirely due to lack of co-operation with other Departments. In some cases they should have had the Military up there to teach them to put up tents. These unfortunate people were taken up there in summer and spent winter there and given tents. They were not told how to keep the tents in order, or how to look after the ropes, and at times the tents fell down over the families. These women had no knowledged whatever and there was nobody to instruct them as to what to do about the tents, to get them up again. You do not expect women to put up tents, nor do you expect women with babies on their backs to dig pits in the hard soil of Natal at this time of the year. The Minister and his two assistants are autonomous: they are dictators. They do not consult their colleagues. They certainly do not consult the Minister of Social Welfare and they do not consult the Minister of Health.</p>

<p>Well, we will hear from the Minister of Health. I spoke to his own officials. It is true that they have been there since. It is true too that the District Surgeon did not visit there for quite a period and the Department in Durban knew nothing about it. It is unreasonable. Sir, to expect women to bring up babies when they have been uprooted from the small gardens which they had in the areas in which they formerly resided and which provided them with supplementary food for their children. They have nothing to give them. Recently, thanks to the hon. the Minister of Health, there has been an issue of dehydrated soup and of dehydrated milk, issued <span class="col_0115-0116" refersTo="page_0077"/>at roughly a pound a month per child. Fortunately that has been done and to that extent there is some alleviation of the protein shortage. It is unfair to uproot people who have lived for years in a certain area and who have cultivated their little patches of land and in that way supplemented their husbands&#x2019; earnings and to expect children to survive under conditions such as these. As far as the question of water is concerned, let me say that while the water at present is good, without any doubt, that water was not there when they were taken there.</p>

The fact that the scandal was exposed in the end is something that is right, but this does not detract from the fact that this has been going on for years in this process of moving people from one place to another.

<p>Everybody says and we all know that the position is improving to-day. That is largely due to the actions of this side of the House. People went up there and pointed out what was happening. The improvement is largely due to the fact that there was an exposure of the large number of deaths that were taking place. Sir, this Government&#x2019;s record has been so bad, especially in respect of health, that they do not know what the average death-rate should be under these circumstances. We have no figures; the Minister&#x2019;s Department does not know what the position is and the Minister of Health cannot tell <span class="col_0117-0118" refersTo="page_0078"/>me what the normal death-rate was amongst the Bantu in the places from which they came and what he believes the death-rate should be now. There are no vital statistics. A year or two ago this House passed a law saying that Bantu deaths must be registered, but there are no registrations of any value. The Department of Health does not know what the vital statistics are in the Bantu areas. They do not register Bantu deaths. In this area recently, within the last month, the Government has instructed the chiefs to appoint an induna to record all deaths, but there has been a delay and I am not sure that this scheme has started yet. There has been a delay because although the chiefs nominated the individuals, the names must go to Pretoria before they could be instructed what to do to be appointed. The police have said that they will accept registrations, but they take no serious interest in deaths unless they believe that it is an unnatural death. There are no statistics available from which we can tell whether there is an epidemic or not until there is a scandal. One chief there said to me: &#x201C;We have always had a certain number of deaths amongst our babies, deaths from diarrhoea, and so on &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I never had the privilege nor the opportunity of visiting Limehill. I am, however, convinced that the hon. the Minister of Health will in due course give a very effective reply to the charges levelled here. Let me inform the hon. member who has just resumed his seat that we are also acquainted with the story of Naboth&#x2019;s vineyard. I also want to tell him that the white man also has a place and_ must have a place to live in South Africa. It is unfortunate that during the 300 years of the development of South Africa such an intermingling of nations has taken place that removals have to take place to-day. I agree with him that it is unfortunate that this should be the case. But it is this Government which has the courage of its convictions and which is taking it upon itself to do these things so that we may enjoy peace and quiet and orderliness in South Africa. We listened yesterday to an 80-minute speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He devoted approximately 70 minutes of his speech to giving us a resum&#x00E9; of what has been said and written by others. We do not begrudge other people the right to air their opinions. We do not begrudge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition the right to read out to us that resum&#x00E9; of what was said by other people, in a no-confidence debate such as this one. We can certainly learn from the suggestions made and opinions expressed by other people. We can learn from well-intentioned statements in so far as they are well-intentioned. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition devoted the last 10 minutes of his speech to a summary of the United Party&#x2019;s race federation plan. This was the alternative put forward by the hon. Leader as a substitute for the National Party&#x2019;s policy of separate development.</p>

<p>Separate development?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the National Party&#x2019;s policy of separate development for which we make no excuse. It is our policy with whatever problems it may entail, and it does entail many problems. But in spite of all the problems it entails, we adhere to that policy because we are convinced that it is the only policy for a country such as South Africa, a policy in terms of which each can retain his own identity. In the last ten minutes of his speech the hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us once again about the race federation scheme of his party. I shall, however, deal with that later. I said that we would learn from and adopt suggestions from what people say and write on the rate of development and the desirability of the development of Bantu homelands and the settlement or re-settlement of people in their own homelands. However, this Government cannot allow itself to be forced off course by the opinions, however well-intentioned, of other people. This Government is bound by a mandate which it has received from the electorate. The electorate gave the Government this directive to put its policy of separate development into operation in South Africa, and it must adhere to that policy. The Government adheres only to that mandate given it by the electorate. At the polls the electorate not only expressed its faith in the Government and entrusted to it the policy of separate development, but they also entrusted to it the application of this policy and the <i>modus operandi.</i> In the second part of his speech where he referred to the race federation scheme, the Leader of the Opposition did not, to my mind, succeed in convincing anyone in this House and least of all the voting public outside of any loss of confidence in the policy of separate development. By no means did he convince people that his <span class="col_0119-0120" refersTo="page_0079"/>policy of race federation was the right course for South Africa with its complicated population structure. This matter has repeatedly been discussed on an election platform. It was even discussed in the time when the United Party drew up maps to convince the electorate that the position in South Africa was going to change to such an extent that eventually there would not be a single non-White in South Africa if they came into power. This matter was settled at various elections in the past and the race federation scheme of the United Party has, to an increasing extent, been rejected at each election. This scheme has not only been rejected in South Africa, but this scheme of partnership, and that is what the race federation scheme is, has been rejected in Africa. It has not succeeded in any country in Africa. The policy of partnership in Kenya, under the &#x201C;British Colonial Office&#x201D; did not succeed.</p>

<p>Everything, because what I have just mentioned is a parallel case. Where the black man was in the majority, white leadership failed, and the price paid by the white man there was a heavy one. In Kenya it gave rise to the Mau Mau. It is a parallel policy, although it might have been phrased somewhat differently, to the policy sketched here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition yesterday and on previous occasions. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us yesterday that under that policy white leadership would be preserved for all time. Will this race federation be a democracy or a dictatorship? If we glance at world history, we see that what counts in a democracy is a majority. In a democracy numbers count.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made that interjection. Through the mouth of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his predecessors the United Party has accused the National Party of being the suppressors of the black man in South Africa. But now the Leader of the Opposition is depriving them politically of all opoortunities to develop to the maximum of their ability. They must now be suppressed for ever. But they are accusing us of bringing down the wrath of the world on South Africa through the application of our policy. We have allegedly alienated the friends we once had. But I want to ask the I eader of the Opposition a question. Does he think that by telling the world that through his policy he is only going to give a 6 per cent say to 75 per cent of the population of South Africa, he will in any way satisfy the outside world? Will that form of white leadership satisfy the world? Will he by so doing regain the friendship of the outside world? I want to ask the Leader of the Opposition whether the world is satisfied with the present form of white leadership in Rhodesia? Is the world satisfied with it and do they accept it as leadership? No, they are insisting on one thing only, and that is a black majority government in Rhodesia. That same kind of pressure will be exerted on South Africa if that policy were to be put into operation here.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not understanding it quite incorrectly. I listened to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The trouble is that that hon. member and the most of the members on that side of the House do not understand the race federation scheme of the United Party at all. All they have to do is test it on the electorate. They do not understand it. This plan was rejected. The Leader of the Opposition will not regain the friendship of the world by giving only 6 per cent representation in a federal parliament to 75 per cent of the population of South Africa. He will definitely not achieve anything by that. From time to time reference is made here to the so-called 13 per cent of the land which is being given to the Bantu, and derogatory references are sometimes made to this. It is high time we called to mind the fact that this arrangement to purchase 7&#x00BC; million morgen of land for the Bantu Trust was not made by this Government or the National Party, but this arrangement was made in 1936 when the United Party was in power. It is therefore not so immoral to give only 13 per cent to the Bantu since this accusation must then be directed at those kindred spirits of the tiny Opposition which is still sitting there.</p>

<p>Now I want to say a few things about agricultural development in the Bantu homelands. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was quite justified in stating here yesterday that he wanted to thank and congratulate the officials of his Department with the progress that had been made and the dedication with which they had set about their task. Truly, it is no easy task. I am not referring in derogatory terms to any other section when I say that I really think the agricultural section of this Department deserves special mention for everything that has been done in the field of agriculture, the more so since every effort is being made to develop the agricultural potential in the Bantu homelands to its maximum.</p>

<p>People may speak in derogatory terms about conditions which may prevail there. I do not want to dispute this as it may be true. But stricken areas also exist in white South Africa, places that are stricken from time to time. In parts of the Western Transvaal we only harvested three bags per morgen last year as a result of circumstances beyond our control. This can happen, it can happen anywhere, and the State renders assistance where it is able to do so in such circumstances. The Opposition and everybody in South Africa should <span class="col_0121-0122" refersTo="page_0080"/>take into account that we cannot merely build dams and lay out irrigation units, we cannot merely develop the soil and prepare it for agriculture. No, the farmer must also be prepared, the human material must also be developed and trained, and a great deal is being done in this connection. Allow me to quote a few figures. As far as the informal training of agronomists is concerned, 200 students were enrolled at the four agricultural colleges in 1968. Bantu agricultural extension officers are now even capable of acting on three levels of authority and may replace Whites there. We must not speak about these matters in derogatory terms, we should rather be grateful that these efforts are being made and for the positive work that is being done. We already have 15 senior Bantu regional extension officers. We have 56 Bantu district extension officers, while there are 361 local extension officers. That amounts to 432 Bantu which may take this work off the hands of the Whites in their own areas. It is necessary that the Bantu be developed and prepared in his own homeland, in his own area, to do this work himself so that he can take a personal pride himself in doing the work himself, instead of having everything done for him. He must be guided, trained and prepared to do this work.</p>

<p>Let us also take note of the following: I want to supply a few figures now. I have no liking for such a lot of statistics, but I would just like to point out what has already been done when agricultural development in the homelands is belittled or referred to in derogatory terms. I shall not quote the figures mentioned by the hon. the Minister yesterday; I should rather like to point out what the position was in 1948 and compare it with the position in March, 1968. In 1948 approximately 10,000 morgen were under irrigation, while in 1968 this figure was 24,514 morgen. I am now referring to the Bantu homelands. In 1948 approximately 4,438 miles of grass strips had been planted, while at present there are 174,689 miles. As far as sisal is concerned, I will not emphasize the round nought, but in 1948 there was not one single morgen of sisal and at present there are 6,668 morgen of sisal. In 1948 there was not one morgen of fermium while there are 4,579 morgen at present. In 1948 no sugar cane was planted, at present there are 17,902 morgen of sugar cane in the Bantu homelands. Furthermore no cotton was planted in 1948, while there are 9,571 morgen at present. That is why I say that we should not speak in derogatory terms about the development in the Bantu homelands. We should not merely scrutinize those places where sufficient development has not yet taken place under a magnifying glass. This Department has a difficult task, but they are not shirking it, they are tackling it with the funds and material which is at their disposal and I think they deserve an honourable mention for the work which they have done.</p>

<p>I am not satisfied, and it has not been sufficient, but it is not our task to finish and solve everything within one, or five or ten years. Before we could start we first had to demolish all that had been done previously, we had to begin at the beginning, and we had to prepare and train human material. I am not satisfied, far from it. I am not satisfied with white development in the agricultural field, it must also be taken much further. Surely the Party that remains put and states that it is satisfied with everything is an unhappy one. We on this side will never be satisfied as long as there are opportunities for future development. Was the hon. member satisfied with the situation in 1948 when his Party was in power, after having been in power for all those years? Was he satisfied with the total lack of development in the Bantu homelands? If I look back at his kindred spirits I find that of the past they did not provide any services.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Not of the kind I have just mentioned. I would gladly give the hon. member the opportunity to stand up and state what development took place in the Bantu homelands in 1948. Will the hon. member, when it is his turn to speak, stand up and tell us what development there was in the Bantu homelands in 1948? He will have that opportunity for his Leader is saying that he can speak and that he can then discuss that topic.</p>

<p>I want to proceed. In 1948 there were only seven auction pens in the homelands while there are at present 202 auction pens to which cattle from over-grazed areas and unsuitable cattle can be brought. I admit that there has in fact been no improvement in the cattle since those days. Now they can get rid of the undesirable cattle by sending them to the market. Since there is a limited amount of land and grazing available, we cannot allow cattle of a poor quality to be kept on that land. It would be better to develop the land to its best potential, and good quality cattle should be bred. What is the position as regards cooperative milk schemes? In 1948 there were four, while there are at present 288. In this way the Bantu are being afforded an opportunity of finding a market for their products. As far as commercial forestry is concerned, 15,600 acres were under development in 1948 and at present 142,000 acres are under development, and as far as non-commercial forestry is concerned, 1,300 morgen were under development in 1948 while 10,400 morgen are at present under development. No. I think we must be very honest with ourselves when we belittle or speak in derogatory terms about the development in the agricultural sphere in the homelands. Whether the rate is quick enough and whether the policy is succeeding, I shall leave to the judgment of the House and an electorate, especially in view of what the hon. <span class="col_0123-0124" refersTo="page_0081"/>the Minister said yesterday in reply to the accusations of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I leave it to the judgment of the House, and we shall vote on it on Friday. It is strange that the Opposition should laugh at this. After all the Leader introduced this debate with the firm conviction that he would be able to convince this House that the House had no confidence in the Government and in the implementation of its policy. He said that those other matters concerning which he had a bone to pick with the Government would be discussed on a subsequent occasion. He particularly wanted to discuss this matter of race relations and he confined himself to that.</p>

<p>The hon. member must go there and meet Jackie McGlew. He will help us to win a greater victory. He must not say that we are formulating their policy incorrectly. He must formulate it himself as he sees it&#x2014;his race federation policy.</p>

<p>I do not want to even discuss stock breeding and its subdivisions. I only want to tell you that towards the end of 1967 the number of cattle totalled more than 3,500.000 apart from sheep and goats.</p>

<p>Now I want to say the following in regard to the improvement of farming practices. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town should listen to this. The following agricultural extension services were rendered during 1967.</p>

<block name="quote">Individual farm visits&#x2014;97,486.</block>

<block name="quote">Method demonstrations&#x2014;1,089, attended by 6,570.</block>

<p>This also goes to show that the potential or future Bantu farmers are desirous of attending these demonstrations. So they are not being given in vain.</p>

<block name="quote">Result demonstrations&#x2014;889, attended by 1,560.</block>

<block name="quote">Farmers&#x2019; days organized&#x2014;733, attended by 37,236.</block>

<p>Film shows were held; colour slides were shown; and educational tours and excursions were arranged. Ten courses were offered to farmers and were attended by 334 Bantu farmers. Fifty shows were organized and were attended by 36,675 people. I think this proves that something is in fact being done about agricultural development and agricultural extension services. All these things are being done to increase the viability of the Bantu homelands in every field. I admit that when one has a look at those areas, one finds that the pasturage has been trampled underfoot to a very considerable extent. Perhaps the lands were not as well cultivated as they should have been, but these are people who have to be led by the hand and uplifted. We cannot fool about with or waste our agricultural land in South Africa, whether it is in the White or in the Bantu areas&#x2014;our agricultural land must be utilized efficiently. We should not pursue a short-term policy in regard to our agricultural land by trying to take from it as much as we can in as short a time as possible, and then leave the remnants to posterity. Our agricultural land must be used and utilized in such a way and guidance should be given in such a way that it will continue to feed the nation for generations to come. Finally, Mr. Speaker, as long as the White electorate of South Africa entrusts domestic and political matters to the National Party and this Government, entrusts to it the policy of separate development, we shall continue to apply separate development in South Africa in the light of and with the knowledge at our disposal. We will of course make mistakes. There will of course be people sitting on the outside who criticize us. It is their right and their privilege. As I said at the outset, we are eager to learn from those suggestions as long as they are well-intentioned. But it is not their task to apply and implement this policy; it is we who have to deal with the practical problems. It is our task, our privilege, our charge and our duty to execute this policy as long as the electorate in South Africa so chooses. As long as we are doing this, the National Party can assure South Africa of the following three points: We assure everybody of his own identity. It makes no difference to what population group he belongs: we give him that assurance and guarantee. He retains his own identity. There will be no intermingling. We take it upon us in the second place not to create points of friction in the implementation of the policy of separate development, but to eliminate them on every level and every sphere where it is humanly practicable. We take it upon us in the third place to create opportunities, not only for the white man but also for the black man, the brown man and the Asiatic in South Africa. The National Party can give the electorate this guarantee as long as the electorate trusts this Government and this party with its domestic internal affairs.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Wolmaransstad really <span class="col_0125-0126" refersTo="page_0082"/>put his foot into it with his statement that the previous Government had undertaken no development in the Bantu areas. The fact of the matter is that the main attack of the old purified Opposition on the United Party Government was specifically that it was doing too much for the Bantu. All that the hon. member need do now, is merely to read up the speeches of his own people to see how much the united Party really did. But I cannot devote my time to that. There are other matters which I should like to raise.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; Press have reported in anticipation how a few of my colleagues and I were going to wade into the &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D; during this debate. If hon. members read the reports about that very carefully, they will find that it was actually nothing out a nice way of saying &#x201C;Catch them!&#x201D;; of saying &#x201C;We no longer know what to do about the verkramptes. You now wade in amongst them and challenge them to indicate where they stand.&#x201D; Let me say at once that I have absolutely no intention of doing so. There is a reason why I have no intention of doing so: we are in no doubt as to where the verkramptes stand. It is not necessary to ask any questions about that. Verkramptheid is no new phenomenon on the Government side. Quite a few of us, Tomlinson men, old Sabra leaders, church leaders and academics, have long since covered this ground with the verkramptes, and, indeed, in connection with the same questions that are at present bringing the pot to the boil on the other side, namely contact with other African states, black diplomats, dynamic development of the Banu areas, and Afrikaans-English relationships. There is nothing new in the situation. All that has changed is, not the situation, but the cast. A good many neo-verligtes were arch-verkramptes at the time. Some of the same men who at that time assisted in evicting verligtes&#x2014;I am speaking of the days when I was on the Government side&#x2014;are to-day themselves verligtes and are now engaged in helping to evict the verkramptes. Verkramptheid is nothing new. Many of us have been over that ground with them and we are in no doubt as to where they stand. We have no questions to put to them. It is with the verligtes that our interest lies and it is to them that we have certain questions to put.</p>

<p>We are dealing here now for the umpteenth time with a debate about race relations. There are people outside who consider that we devote too much time in this House to the question of race relations. However, I want to say at once that I think that they are wrong, because this question of human relationships in our country is basic to every other problem that we have to contend with. Our foreign relations, our security, our prosperity, all depend upon the fact that in South Africa we must find a satisfactory political and social arrangement among the various population groups, whatever one chooses to call them, whether races, or peoples, or nations, or whatever. In passing I just want to say that there are jurists who take the view that the term &#x201C;nation&#x201D; means the totality of all he citizens in a country. There are scholars, again, who hold a different opinion. For example, I have here a booklet entitled &#x201C;Nasionalisme as Lewensbeskouing&#x201D;, written by Professor Dr. N. Diedericks, and in it he gives his definition of what a people is. He is of the opinion that a people is the totality of all the citizens in a state. According to him a nation consists of those persons who are of common descent and who have a common culture. He admits, however, that there is difference of opinion. There is no need for us to differ about the use of words; I do not think that it matters so much, as long as we make clear what we mean by the words we use. I just want to say that when I myself use the word &#x201C;nasie&#x201D; (nation)&#x2014;and I like the word; it is a good Afrikaans word&#x2014;I mean a group within our State context which is a clearly identifiable unit in respect of descent, language, traditions and living habits.</p>

<p>I think the Leader of the Opposition was quite right in using this debate for the purpose of sharply focusing attention once more upon matters as they stand after the present Government has been in power for almost 21 years. Twenty-one years is a long time. I listened yesterday to the speech by the hon. member for Witbank. He made a terrible song and dance about the years of struggle involved in first rectifying all the &#x201C;evils&#x201D; before the Government could begin with constructive matters. This is not altogether true. In my opinion the South African Party Government which South Africa had up to 1939, was the best Government it has ever had. [Interjections.] That is my considered opinion. During the five years immediately after the outbreak of the war, South Africa underwent an industrial revolution of tremendous magnitude. It was that revolution which made South Africa the strong industrial country it is today. I am very glad that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs stated it so well in a speech at the U.N. some years ago (1964). He told of the industrial revolution and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the last war South Africa, like many other participants in the war, was subjected to naval blockade and was forced to rely largely upon its own resources. The result was a boost to South African industrialization, an industrial revolution which transformed the South African scene and, <i>inter alia,</i> made it the workshop of the Allied armies in the Middle East.</block>

<p>That is true. It was the War Government which transformed South Africa and took us through the industrial revolution, and no one denies that there was some disruption during those years, especially in the cities. It was, however, not as difficult to solve the problems of the era of peace that followed as the hon. member for Witbank said it was. Most of the difficulties which the Government experienced during that time were a result of the blunt methods which <span class="col_0127-0128" refersTo="page_0083"/>it applied. Apart from this I think my colleagues on the other side will admit that 21 years is a long time for a Government to rule, and the Government cannot complain that it has not had sufficient time to do big things. Neither can the Government complain that it did not have sufficient political power at its disposal, or that it does not have it at the moment. The Government sits there with two-thirds of the seats in this country. This is quite unfair. [Interjections.] I do not want to go into that now, but it is true that this is so because we have a completely unfair system of distribution of seats. The votes of some people have twice the value of those of others. That is, however, how the situation stands, and we shall give proper attention to it at the proper time.</p>

<p>Are you against it in principle?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am most definitely against one man&#x2019;s vote counting for more than that of another among the Whites. We shall give proper attention to that at a later stage. The Government has had all the time in the world, as well as the political power, and cannot say that two-thirds of the seats are not sufficient for doing what it wants to do. If then the Government&#x2019;s policy has not been carried out, there can only be one of three reasons for this. One is that the Government is unwilling to do so and that, by implication, will mean that it has other ideas about matters, and is busy changing its policy. The second is that the Government is incompetent. However, I do not think hon. members on the other side will believe that of themselves. The third reason why the Government has not carried out its policy may be that there is something wrong with its policy or with its implementation. It goes without saying that one must first determine what a Government stands for before one can pass judgment on its failures and successes. I do not know whether we have investigated comprehensively enough what the Government stands for. I do not think one can find more articulate evidence of what a government&#x2019;s policy is than the submissions made to the International Court and the U.N. by that government itself. At the International Court the Government said in the first place that it did not really differ in principle with so-called world-opinion or with the basic aims underlying integrational thinking. The only difference was one of method. I have here the booklet published about the case under the title &#x201C;Ethiopia and Liberia versus South Africa&#x201D;. On page 129 it is clearly stated that South Africa &#x201C;dealt in the pleadings with some basic aspects of the policy of separate development as it had evolved in South Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The first point is then that &#x201C;in principle, the policy accorded with the basic concept underlying the thinking of integrated multiracial states, in that its moral outlook and idealistic objectives rested on modern concepts of human rights, dignities and freedoms, irrespective of race, colour or creed, and did not run counter to them. The real point at issue was not one of principle but of method&#x2014;the way in which these concepts should be put into practice.&#x201D; And the second point I want to mention is: &#x201C;The aim of the policy was justice for all, on a basis of potential equality and freedom. This aim not only acknowledged the just claims and moral rights of each group to advance towards self-determination, but also the need to strike an ethical balance between such claims and so prevent a recurrence of domination by some groups over others.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The third point I want to mention which illustrates the &#x201C;aim&#x201D;, just to get the policy straight, is from the speech which the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs made at the U.N. at more or less the same time (1964). He referred there to the &#x201C;development of South Africa&#x2019;s peoples, each into their full and equal nationhood&#x201D;, and then he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, it is thus that we are striving to eliminate all forms of political inequality and to move towards our goal of sovereign equality for all nations at present living within the boundaries of South Africa.</block>

<p>He spoke of the &#x201C;elimination of all forms of political inequality&#x201D;. I do not think that there is anyone on that side who will argue when we say that it was said before the International Court and the U.N. that the basic aim of the Government was to eliminate &#x201C;all forms of political inequality for all people in South Africa&#x201D;. I do not think that a policy can be more articulate than that. To me it means that basically the Government has the same exalted motives as those it ascribes to the integrationists, only its method is different. Secondly, the Government envisages justice and equality for all, irrespective of race or colour, but in such a way that the one will not dominate the other; thirdly, that all forms of political inequality will be eliminated. I am prepared to concede that Rome was not built in a day, and the Government has also made it clear, and in all fairness I want to mention it here, that it believes in an evolutionary process. But when a man proclaims a policy, it surely presupposes that he will do everything in his power to implement it during his own time, if he has the power and the time to do so. Therefore I again want to call attention to the fact that 21 years is a long time. Secondly, we are living in a world to-day in which the process of the emancipation of subordinate peoples has almost been completed. We are now among the last under the old dispensation. Here in our immediate vicinity are three peoples who were part of Southern Africa and who have already achieved their independence or emancipation through the actions of others. Just think of Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland. Neither can the Government plead that our problems are so unique that it cannot do things which were done for others. Diversity, pluralism, the problems <span class="col_0129-0130" refersTo="page_0084"/>of minorities and majorities, are a feature of more than half of the countries of the world, and, as a matter of fact, in this South-West case, South Africa itself listed 50 countries &#x201C;in which status, rights, duties and burdens were allotted by law and official practice on the basis of membership of a group, class or race&#x201D;, just as in our case. There are numerous countries with the same problems of minorities and majorities and diversity. Thirdly, I do not think that they can say with any justification that the human material which we have is inferior to the human material in other countries, or that our people are more backward. We do in fact contend that we do more for our Coloureds, Indians and Bantu, and that they are way ahead of other non-White nations in the world. We boast of the lead we have. No one can say that the Zhosa are inferior to the Basuto or to the Swazi, or that our Coloureds or Indians take second place to any other non-White people in the world. Considering all this, and the fact that the Government has ruled with plenary Dowers for 21 years, we may examine how it has carried out this policy which it has proclaimed. In the first place take the Coloureds, a Western minority group, million below the Whites in number. In this day and age they are given a debating chamber with very limited powers, which will always remain limited, and a large proportion of the members of that chamber are selected by white determination, not their own. Even the office-bearers, the most important leaders, will be appointed by white determination. On top of everything the doors of this Parliament, which is the one place where everything of importance in the life of the Coloured must be decided and determined, are closed to him, so that in everything of importance he is delivered into the hand of white determination instead of self-determination. There is not one hon. member sitting on that side who can get up here and tell us plainly how they are going to carry out the declared policy and the promise of &#x201C;elimination of all forms of political inequality&#x201D; in respect of the Coloureds, [Interjections.] The Indians are another minority, one sixth the size of the white population, and as far as quality and potential are concerned, they are second to no other people in the world. I am speaking of the non-White nations now. What is their position after 21 years? Another debating chamber, advisory in nature, with not a single member chosen by themselves, and therefore even in regard to their own humble council, delivered absolutely into the hands of white determination. 21 years after the Government came into power: and not the slightest attempt on the part of the Government to stand up and explain to us how they are going to carry out this promise of the elimination of all inequalities in respect of that population group [Interjection.] To come to the Bantu: the Government has by law designated eight Bantu groups, nine if the Ciskei is included What progress has it made after 21 years?</p>

<p>As far a I know, none of our Bantu groups is poorer material than the people in Botswana, Lesotho or Swaziland. They went and took part in the independence celebrations of those countries. They extolled them. We maintain civilized relationships with them and we sit with their leaders in the U.N., and we are very satisfied with those leaders whom they have in the U.N. But after 21 years there is not one of our own Bantu areas which is independent or emancipated; and the Government is unable to give us even an indication of how long it will take before it can show us but one resounding result, in terms of its own declared policy, in respect of the Bantu. [Interjections.] The Government has placed itself before the world in the position of a colonial master who will eliminate all forms of inequality, subordination and domination in South Africa, and it has even clearly indicated the peoples it is going to emancipate, but meaningful results are still lacking. In fact after 21 years the groups in South Africa which have developed the most, the Coloureds and the Indians, are the furthest removed from the goal, and remain most subject to colour bars on the ground of colour and colour alone. Wherever one travels in the country to-day&#x2014;and that was another point they put to the U.N., that colour was no longer the issue here; the classification concerned nationhood&#x2014;the conspicuous bases of classification is still colour and colour alone. The notices indicate &#x201C;Whites&#x201D; and &#x201C;non-Whites&#x201D;. Fortunately we now hear of an excellent development: The &#x201C;Slegs&#x201D; in front of &#x201C;Blankes&#x201D; will be removed, as will the &#x201C;only&#x201D; after &#x201C;Whites&#x201D;! [Interjections.] Recently I spoke to a guest from abroad whom the Government had invited here, about his experiences in South Africa, and he told me that from the moment he alighted at Jan Smuts&#x2014;these are the words he used&#x2014;&#x2019;he neon lights of apartheid made such an unfavourable impression upon him that he left this country in despondency. In every sector of policy the deed is miles removed from the beautiful written word, and if that is success, the Government must tell us what failure is. And he Government itself can choose its explanations. It can say that it is incompetent, unwilling or unrealistic. It cannot eliminate the political inequality of the Coloureds by the course is now adopting. It can only do so by adopting this party&#x2019;s course. It cannot remove the political inequality of the Indians by the course is now following. It can only do so by following the course of this side of the House, is far as the Bantu are concerned, paradoxie1 as it may sound, our proposals for the development of the Bantu areas are the one being that will make it easy for the Government to come close to the execution of its policy, if only the Government would adopt bem Every reasonable person in South Africa accepts the fact that we are a country of diversity a diversity of peoples or nations, suffering Bering from one another in many spheres, and that our different population groups in <span class="col_0131-0132" refersTo="page_0085"/>South Africa have never really formed a unit. Like us, the Government admits to this fact, and there we are on common ground. We and the Government are also agreed on the fact that to-day we live in a world where a man, whether he likes it or not, must take note of the adverse effect which a doctrine of permanent supremacy has on the world. We must face up to this. But we now sit with this historical problem that in spite of the fact of diversity, and in spite of the fact that all of us realize that we must seek a course along which our population groups can co-operate without one dominating another, the fact remains that a certain measure of intertwining and interdependence has developed which cannot easily be overcome. Therefore you will find few people who think seriously about this problem, who are of the opinion that in South Africa one can really pursue and make practical politics of a policy of complete totalitarian disintegration, of complete compartmentalizing of the various groups. A year or two ago the Coloureds were accepted as an integral part&#x2014;those are the words which the Government used&#x2014;of our Defence Force. What will happen to our Police Force, which consists of Whites, Coloureds, Bantu and Indians? The Bantu, as part of our Police Force, are to-day helping to defend South Africa, if the reports are correct, against terrorists on our borders. They are in that sense integrated. Our attitude is that there is room in South Africa for wide decentralization of political power, and no one on this side objects to our striving to bring about the optimum form of decentralization. But this can only be done if the heart-lands which exist for the various peoples, are developed as quickly as possible with the help of the Whites. And my advice to the Government is that it should just read once again the evidence which it placed before the International Court in connection with South-West Africa as a unit. There the Government told the world that without white capital, initiative and industry South-West could not exist and would collapse. If this is true of the whole of South West, how much truer is it not of a Bantu area which the Government must develop? I know that the Government has had certain problems. They were afraid of Hong Kongs; they were afraid of the development of new White spots in Black areas, but here within South Africa we now have three areas which have become independent. Have they become Hong Kongs? Is there an influx of white capital? No, our problem will be, as the hon. member for Hillbrow said, to get Whites to go in and to assist with development, because without that, development will never take place. Let me say this to the hon. the Minister: Unless we make the Bantu areas so attractive that the Bantu will be prepared to exchange their South African citizenship, according to Government policy, for citizenship of a smaller unit, the Bantu will not accept the policy of the Government in the long run either.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the main difference between this side and that side of the House can be summed up as follows, i.e. that the Government advocates a policy of disintegration or fragmentation, with, as its ultimate objective, a commonwealth which will be consultative and nothing more. But, Mr. Speaker, there are a number of very important questions which the Government has not yet decided and cleared up. We speak of homelands and we say that these are based on a historic division. But let me ask the hon. the Minister: What is the valid date line for that historic division? The whole history of South Africa is one of the trekking and moving around of all groups. At a certain time the Whites were still on this side of the Hex River. The great British Trek to South Africa only began after 1800. I want to ask the hon. the Minister this: Does he regard South Africa as already divided; does he regard partition as an accomplished fact? If the division has been completed, where does self-determination come in? Does this mean that the Whites determine and that the only choice remaining to the Bantu is to remain subservient to us in a subordinate position, or to take up his stand in his own small plot and to see to it that he manages with what we are prepared to give to him? Does the Government mean that we have already made the division, constitutionally, and that the Bantu has in effect lost his citizenship? Mr. Speaker, these are going to become real questions. When you come to the position where the Bantu is given the choice of taking that in exchange for South African citizenship and what it entails, then it will become a burning question, as it has already become in the case of the Transkei, where the premier, Matanzima, has already said that there are outstanding border questions. It is on those grounds. Sir, that we feel that if one looks at the situation as it is in South Africa, the time will come when the Government will realize that it will have to accept the federal course of the party on this side in respect of the Bantu as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I really find it difficult to see the point in the speech made by the hon. member who has just sat down. I do not know whether I am &#x201C;dense&#x201D; in saving that, but in doing so I am being honest. As far as I could understand him, it seemed to me as though his entire speech amounted to the fact that we on the National Party side had failed in the implementation of our policy. He mentioned the Coloureds, for instance. We on this side have placed the Coloureds on the road to self-determination in South Africa, not the United Party but this side of the House, the National Government. The National Government has placed every non-White nation in South Africa on the road to full self-determination, which is going to lead, as it was put by Dr. Verwoerd many years ago, to a loose commonwealth of nations. Let me tell the hon. <span class="col_0133-0134" refersTo="page_0086"/>member at once that there is one important reservation in connection with that loose commonwealth of nations as it may develop here on the southernmost point of Africa. I see in the newspapers that the hon. member is now talking about a confederation, and in reading between the lines, I find that he is already moving away from the United Party&#x2019;s point of view to one midway between that of the United Party and that of the National Party. But I do not wish to exploit that situation now. I merely want to make the point that there is one important reservation, i.e. that there will not be one central authority or central controlling body above that commonwealth of nations. This is a very important point to remember.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to use my time, in the first place, to ask the United Party a very pointed question. I said that we had placed the Bantu nations here on the road to self-determination. We have made scintillating progress in regard to the implementation of that political aspect of self-determination for the various Bantu nations in the Republic of South Africa. Suppose the Transkei were to be in a position to-morrow or the day after, or whenever the time is deemed ripe by the National Government, to become in effect an independent state, then I want to put this question to the United Party: If that happened and if the other Bantu homelands in the Republic of South Africa became truly independent states, like Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland, what would then be left of the United Party&#x2019;s policy? Its policy would then have collapsed like a house of cards.</p>

<p>If the Transkei had a fully independent government, and if the other homelands had fully independent governments, how can they say that eight Bantu representatives must have seats in this House? In the course of the recess I put this question to one of the United Party frontbenchers and he realized that their policy would then fall through completely. Do you know what his reply to me was? I shall not mention his name. His reply to me was honest and sincere. He said: &#x201C;I have always said that if the National Government implemented its policy in a consistent, fair and just manner, as it says it is going to do, then I can find no fault with it,&#x201D; and that is more or less what the United Party&#x2019;s policy amounts to.</p>

<p>But I want to draw attention to a second point the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made in this House yesterday. He said that if they came into power, which the nation will certainly not permit, they would, in terms of their policy, allow the Bantu who have to work in the white area of South Africa to settle here on a family basis. Those Bantu would then need houses to live in, and I want to assume that the Bantu would also own the land on which those houses are situated, since the United Party&#x2019;s attitude has always been to grant full ownership to the Bantu in white areas. This morning I ascertained that at the moment, here under National Party regime in the Republic of South Africa, there were no fewer than 1,646,777&#x2014;that was the figure as at 31st June, 1966 &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, this is the actual figure. At that date there were 1,646,777 single Bantu in the white area on a contract basis. To indicate how ridiculous the policy of the United Party is, since they are always expatiating on what it is going to cost to implement the policy of development along individual lines, I now want to point out what it is going to cost merely to start implementing their policy. If housing alone had to be provided in the white area for 1,646,777 Bantu on a family basis, and assuming that five persons constitute a family&#x2014;in other words, that housing is to be provided for 8 million Bantu&#x2014;and assuming that such housing would cost R500 per family &#x2026; [Interjections.] No, my figures are not wrong. If one multiplies 1,646,777 by five, one arrives at a total of approximately 8 million. If those Bantu had to be provided with housing at R500 per house&#x2014;and then these would merely be two or three-roomed houses; they cost a great deal more, as hon. members will know&#x2014;then it would immediately cost the country R823,388,500 to accommodate those Bantu on a family basis here in the white area. Hon. members can work out the figures for themselves. And then one would still not have provided the Bantu with any services, and one would still not have provided any hospitals for them. I have made a hurried calculation here according to which this figure would come to at least R10 million if one were to provide hospitals as well. In addition, transport facilities would have to be provided, and how much would that cost? Schools would also have to be provided for the Bantu here in the white area. And what would the land cost for settling those 8 million Bantu on a family basis here in the white area? Do you see, Sir, what kind of story they are dishing up to the nation, and then they expect the nation to take them seriously! The amount of thought they gave to their policy is less than a hare requires in order to run away from a hound, and that is why this terrible &#x201C;charge&#x201D; debate&#x2014;the great United Party &#x201C;charge&#x201D; of 1969 about which we have read such a great deal in the papers&#x2014;has developed into a running away on the part of the United Party in this House.</p>

<p>May I put a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, my time is very limited. I want to put this question to the United Party: Apart from how they are going to account to the nation if they say that they are going to settle the Bantu here on a family basis at the astronomic cost of <span class="col_0135-0136" refersTo="page_0087"/>approximately R2,000 million, merely to settle the single Bantu here on a family basis in terms of their policy, if they are honest, then they still have to explain to the nation what the position is going to be in terms of their policy of eight Bantu representatives in this House for the Bantu who are already living in the white area in the Republic of South Africa, for if these extra Bantu were to be settled here on a family basis, one would see, if one made a simple calculation which any two-year-old or three-year-old can do, that the United Party would immediately, if it implemented its policy, permit more than 10 million Bantu to settle here in the white area&#x2014;10 million Bantu as against 3&#x00BC; million Whites in the white area at present, and then I ask them this question: How are they going to satisfy the political and other growing aspirations of the Bantu of South Africa, and then what hope is there for their policy of leadership to succeed in the Republic of South Africa? Surely, that is a vain hope, Sir. Surely, there is no such thing, and that is why the nation cannot take them seriously, that is why we cannot take them seriously, and that is why the United Party contribution to this debate, the great &#x201C;charge&#x201D; of 1969, is in actual fact a note as flat as a concertina in a symphony orchestra conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham; that is what it amounts to.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I should like to use the time I have left to indicate how the policy of the National Party Government, the stated policy&#x2014;for that is the point of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and others on that side&#x2014;is in the process of being implemented systematically, intelligently, practically and realistically&#x2014;for we are not United Party supporters&#x2014;and successfully in this country. Let us just for a moment look at how even people who are not favourably disposed towards South Africa, are making the statement that the greatest miracle of the past 50 years in Africa has taken place in the Republic of South Africa. Dr. Kuschke, <i>inter alia,</i> referred to this aspect and this is what he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The miracle is not so much to be found in the exploitation of our tremendous natural resources in the Republic, but in the extent to which success has been achieved in bringing inexperienced, unsophisticated and until recently largely illiterate Bantu labour to a rapidly-developing technological and industrial revolution in the Republic.</block>

<p>That is where the miracle is to be found, Sir. We have here a country which has, as a result of the successful implementation of the policy of apartheid, peace and calm in the sphere of labour. For that we thank the white labourers and pay great tribute to them. But permit me also to thank and to pay great tribute on this occasion to the Bantu labourers who are also making a very significant contribution to the peace and calm we are enjoying in the Republic of South Africa. Let me say that the National Government appreciates this. As a Deputy Minister who is responsible for the urban Bantu, I wish to record my particular appreciation for this.</p>

<p>But. Sir, if we also consider the fact that apartheid is a process of development, that it is the greatest objective this nation has probably ever had, i.e. to guide the nations around us and under us to a level of civilization and to maturity in the spheres of politics, statecraft and others, then, surely, this is a cause which can most fruitfully occupy this nation for many, many years in building up civilizations here. I just want to say that while the Opposition is saying that this policy has failed, black man upon black man and black leader upon black leader are coming to the fore and saying that this policy is being implemented successfully. I want to read out to the House a paragraph taken from a speech made on 12th December. 1968, by Lucas Mangope, the leader of the Tswana nation in South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the end of May this year we hailed the Nationalist Party which had reigned and governed this country for 20 years. You, hon. Sir, and your colleagues did not know the way of thinking of the Tswana in relation to a matter such as that.</block>

<p>We must remember that he sneaks on behalf of his nation of thousands of Tswanas&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Tswana man on that very first day of May went about and murmured his prayer and his thanks when this Government was returned to power. This policy of separate development that is now invoked, a man like myself does not necessarily have to propagate&#x2014;it speaks for itself. I do not want to list here all the things that have been done for us, the things that have developed us, made us a bigger people, the people that we are to-day.</block>

<p>I also have here in my hand an article entitled &#x201C;Apartheid, the only recipe for South Africa&#x201D; taken from <i>Die Transvaler</i> dated 28th September, 1968. Was this said by a white man? No, Kaizer Matanzima who speaks on behalf of more than a million Xhosa people, drafted his election manifesto and in his manifesto for the second Transkeian elections on 23rd October he said that the policy of separate development was the only policy that could be implemented successfully in South Africa. Hon. members will now say that it is only leaders who speak like this. I am only going to read one letter out of the numerous letters I have received in the short while I have been working with the urban Bantu. This was written by an ordinary Bantu. I shall refrain from mentioning his name, but this Bantu wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Umlazi Township, Durban.</block>

<block name="quote">My name is &#x2026;, a Bantu, originally from Soweto, Johannesburg, but now a resident of Umlazi Bantu Dorp, Durban, through repatriation <span class="col_0137-0138" refersTo="page_0088"/>in compliance with Government policy about which I am very happy. I write to express my gratitude to our Minister and to you in particular and the Government for at no other time were we Bantu given such chances of advancing and improving ourselves in all directions as now. Before I left Soweto it did strike me that while I appreciated what the Government was doing for us, at the same time I was doing nothing about it to show my appreciation, so I decided to pack my bags for the homelands at once and I am not sorry about it for here big prospects are unfolding to us.</block>

<p>[Interjection.] If that hon. member had ever been in Umlazi, he would know that this Bantu is speaking more truthfully than that hon. member is capable of doing now. I shall read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have been here for four months already and have since approached our Bantu Investment Branch for a filling station business.</block>

<p>I am trying to explain to the House with what success the policy of separate development is being implemented. While the Bantu in South Africa are admitting this and are speaking very highly of it, the Opposition, not knowing what they are talking about, say that our policy has failed since it is allegedly not being implemented. Who is in the best position to judge&#x2014;those hon. members who know very little about it, or the Bantu who, according to those hon. members, are to be the prey of this policy.</p>

<p>I want to go further in order to show the House how this policy is in fact being implemented under the National Party regime. In the <i>Star</i> of 26th September, 1968, there was an article entitled &#x201C;Most Africans above breadline&#x201D;. The facts for this article were obtained from an inquiry undertaken in Soweto towards the end of 1968. It was found that on an average the income in Soweto was R78 per month, i.e. more than R20 per month above the breadline which is estimated at R56. We have labour peace and stability amongst the Bantu who are performing essential work in our white areas. We are also affording our industrialists that stability in order to enable them to utilize Bantu labour for the performance of essential work. Things are going well in the Republic of South Africa in respect of the Bantu in our white areas. But at the same time we say that those Bantu in our white areas who are not economically active and are not engaged in the performance of normal or good work, should be channelled back to their own homelands.</p>

<p>Since hon. members do have these facts before them now, I want to ask how much progress we have made in respect of the implementation of that aspect of our policy, i.e. the elimination of the redundant, non-economically active Bantu in our white areas. In this regard I want to mention the following figures. Approximately 900,000 Bantu have been settled elsewhere under the National Party regime over the past few years since 1959. Surely, this is no mean achievement; on the contrary, it is a tremendous achievement. Over the same period at least 216,000 have been resettled under the National Party regime in terms of the Group Areas Act in the Johannesburg area alone. Approximately 75,000 have been removed from so-called black spots. Hon. members should merely think of how much it would have cost if they had not been removed. A moment ago I pointed out how, in terms of the United Party&#x2019;s policy, it would have cost at least R2,000 million per annum to settle them in the white area. At least 220,000 have been resettled in a few white metropolitan complexes alone. Does that look like a policy that is falling through? In only five years&#x2019; time approximately 203,000 Bantu from the white urban areas have been resettled in their own respective Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>They have been resettled at various places. Mr. Speaker, do you know why the United Party is casting so much suspicion on Limehill, Stinkwater and Klipgat? It is because each of those places is a manifestation of the successful implementation of the policy of separate development. That is the only reason for their trying to cast suspicion on those places. However, their allegations cannot stand up to the test of the facts.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, my time is extremely limited. Here in my hand I have the graph of the male Bantu employed in the Port Elizabeth area. Hon. members will be able to see how the graph in respect of male Bantu employed in the Port Elizabeth area has, as a result of the implementation of the Physical Planning Act, reflected a marked downward trend since 19th January, 1968. The number of male Bantu employed there has shown a marked decrease from 41,500 to well below 40,000, and in Port Elizabeth we are not dealing with a National Party city council. Does this bear testimony to a policy which is not being implemented successfully?</p>

<p>Now I come to the Western Cape. In the past year a daily average of four Bantu families voluntarily boarded a train here in the Cape Peninsula on their way back to their Bantu homelands. Many of them were Section 10 cases. Four families and more have left the Cape Peninsula daily and gone back to their homelands.</p>

<from><span class="col_0139-0140" refersTo="page_0089"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Now I come to the position in the Northern Transvaal. According to the figures supplied by the Chief Bantu Commissioner in the Northern Transvaal approximately 20,000 Bantu per month have over the past year applied for resettlement in the Bantu homelands in the Northern Transvaal region. This is a policy which is not being implemented successfully! This comes to between 4,000 and 5,000 Bantu per week. Do hon. members know what has become our greatest problem in the Department? Our greatest problem at the moment is to stay ahead in the provision of housing in our Bantu homelands, as well as the provision of water, in order that we may in fact settle those Bantu who wish to be settled there. This is as true as the fact that I am on my feet now. That is our greatest problem in the Department.</p>

<p>Looking at the position in the Western Cape where the Government has made it its stated policy to replace annually 5 per cent of the Bantu labour here by Coloured labour, we see that the Government has had major successes. It would give me great pleasure now to tell hon. members a success story in this regard. Hon. members will recall what scorn, ridicule and derision came from that side of the House when we announced that we were annually going to replace 5 per cent of the Bantu labour in the Western Cape by Coloured labour. Here are the figures in this regard: In 1967 the Bantu population in the Cape Peninsula numbered 113,337. On 31st December. 1968, the Bantu population here numbered only 109.153. That means, therefore, 4,184 fewer Bantu in the Cape Peninsula as a result of the implementation of the National Party&#x2019;s policy. Is this a policy which is a failure, which is not being implemented successfully? But let me furnish a few other figures now. I see the hon. member opposite laughing. Let me show how successful it has in actual fact been. You will recall that we said 5 per cent. In 1967 there were no fewer than 44,567 Bantu children here in the Peninsula, and on 31/12/1968 there were only 39,320, a decrease in the number of Bantu children in the Peninsula of 5,256, or more than 11 per cent, and that was done in less than 12 months. Is this a policy that has failed?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, they did not increase; have I not told you that they have decreased? That is the very point I want to make in this regard. If it had not been for this decrease of Bantu labour, Bantu women and children in the Peninsula, then the position would have been that on the basis of the Bantu increase in population there would have been at least 11,000 more Bantu last year instead of a decrease in number of more than 4,000, and I am not even taking the children into account. If we had to accommodate each of them on a family basis, if we had to build a house here for each family, the cost last year would, conservatively calculated, have been almost R6 million in the Peninsula alone. This money has now been saved, money that would otherwise have been spent. Surely, these are simple, elementary facts.</p>

<p>Then I also want to make the following point for the benefit of hon. members who are interested in the world of business. While this marked decrease of Bantu in the Cape Peninsula had been taking place under National Party regime over a period of 12 months last year, the production of industries in the Peninsula showed a marked increase. Now I am asking any member on the opposite side to rise and tell us that this is a policy that has failed. If a policy that has failed looks like this, then show me a policy that is being implemented successfully! In South Africa we are making a gigantic success of the implementation of this policy, for the people who work with it are inspired and enthusiastic. Since this is the greatest objective this nation has ever had in its entire history, every man, woman and child who believes in this is implementing it for all the world to see. This is a miracle which is taking place in South Africa. But hon. members opposite have not noticed it yet.</p>

<p>Now I want to turn to the important aspect of the economic development of our Bantu homelands. After all, it is general knowledge that our major problem in that regard is the lack of entrepreneurs. We are not impervious to the facts. There are two matters one has to take into account, and I shall have to deal with them quickly for my time is limited. The first is that we must consider priorities in terms of their values. What is our first priority in South Africa? That is, surely, the country&#x2019;s security. We must see to our safety first, and for that purpose an annual amount of R256 million and more appears on our Estimates. Our second priority is that our economic development should be smooth and intelligent, and, as I have said here, this has been described as a miracle. I did not even mention the name of Gardiner who had pointed out before the committee in Geneva some time ago that over a period of 20 years under National Party regime Bantu wages in South Africa had increased by 500 per cent, and how our <i>per capita</i> income had increased by 1.4 per cent per annum as against that of the rest of Africa which had hardly increased by 1 per cent over a period of ten years. All of these are fruits of the National Party policy. Now I say that it is very important for our economic development to take place in a <span class="col_0141-0142" refersTo="page_0090"/>balanced and realistic manner. Our third priority is a balanced economic development of our Bantu homelands, and this is common sense, surely. Hon. members should not make the mistake of thinking that the Government has done nothing in regard to the economic development of the Bantu homelands. We have created the infra-structure there. I have the particulars here&#x2014;and I can let you have them, Sir&#x2014;and they are very significant facts. Thousands of miles of roads have been made, more than 4,000 dams have been built, and a very great deal of other work has been done. The infra-structure has been created. Now all I want to tell the hon. member opposite who is so sensible, is this. The risk we are now running, is to generalize about the whole problem of the economic development of the homelands. After all, one should undertake this in a systematic, realistic and sensible way, and that is what we are doing. What do we see in Natal? The economic development of Natal is more rapid than that of any other province in South Africa. Border industries have been created there. And what are we doing in that process? We are meeting the greatest needs of this country, and that is to create opportunities for employment for the Bantu in Natal, for the Zulus, for we want to make sure that people in South Africa will not starve. That is what we are doing. Consequently the picture in Natal looks very favourable. Let us look at Tswanaland in terms of priorities and see what is going on there. In the Tswana territory we also see that conditions look very favourable. Let us also look at some of the other homelands. I do not have the time now to deal with this aspect at length, but if we analysed the situation fully, we would see that the actual problems are to be found in two Bantu homelands in particular, i.e. the provision of employment in the Transkei and in the Pietersburg area for the northern homelands. That is what the Government is doing, because we want to create growth points there.</p>

<p>Now I wish to make the following very important point. Under the agency basis it is possible to develop these areas rapidly. Our first priority is Bantu entrepreneurs. Our second priority is the development project corporations of the National Government. Our third is that we are saying, &#x201C;Let the industrialists come, and on the agency basis we can make it so attractive for them at these selected growth points that are being undertaken in a balanced manner, that it will not be possible for them to refuse to assist with the economic development there.&#x201D; The only thing is that our industrialists do not realize this yet. We can still make it more attractive for an industrialist to go there.</p>

I want to say that under the agency basis one can make it more attractive for the industrialist than one could under the system of permitting private white capital and private white entrepreneurs, and that is what the Government is doing at present. That is why I wish to say with all the emphasis I can muster that, in cases where the desired development at growth points in our Bantu homelands is necessary, where it is forcing itself upon us, and where border development must take its rightful place, the time has arrived for white industrialists to play a steadily increasing part in order to supplement the other priorities I mentioned. This is to take place on the conditions set out by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in this House last year, conditions on which the agency basis is to operate. These people must come in order that they may assist in undertaking the development in the homelands at those growth points. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I had hoped that it would have been an easy matter to congratulate the new Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education on the first speech he made in that capacity, but I regret to say that I would be a hypocrite should I even try to do so. [Interjections.] I just want to say, in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, who has just made an interjection, yesterday took it amiss of my Leader for supposedly having used so many figures, and in view of the fact that several hon. members opposite stated that figures did not matter such a great deal, that I have never in all my born days heard so many figures as the Deputy Minister has just used. Do you know, Sir, what figures he was using? He said there were 1.637876 million single Bantu in the Republic of South Africa. He also referred to the number of houses which would have to be built for the Bantu and their families and he made estimates of millions and millions of rand. But he must be honest and say how many of them are Bantu from foreign areas. Surely the hon. the Deputy Minister is at least aware of the fact that the mines are almost exclusively kept going by Shangaans, and that the sugar industry in Natal employs almost exclusively Shangaans who come to this country on a contractual basis. Surely he knows what a large part of the Free State employs workers from Lesotho. When has this side advocated housing for Bantu working here under contract as individuals and that their families should be allowed to live with them? Can there be a worse distortion of the facts than that? Reference was made here to the astronomical amounts it would cost to build houses for these people, but the entire argument was based on false premises. I noticed that the hon. the Deputy Minister as well as many other speakers opposite, including the hon. <span class="col_0143-0144" refersTo="page_0091"/>member for Wolmaransstad earlier this afternoon, spoke continuously of separate development but no longer of the creation of sovereign, independent Bantustans. I wonder whether the Government is running away from that idea. Who resents separate development as such? This side of the House?</p>

<p>Repeatedly and from session to session we have been advocating the better development of the reserves, which are separate areas. I admit that that is subject to one condition, and that is that all those areas remain part of the Republic. We have never pleaded for additional assistance and funds for states which are to become independent, less so for Lesotho or Botswana, and this also applies as regards states which are to become independent within our own borders. As far as those parts of the country which are reserves are concerned, however, this side of the House has always advocated better and more rapid development. This is where the policy of the Government fails, as my Leader indicated so well yesterday. It must and will always fail. Nothing can help it. The fact that there will be 20 million Bantu by the turn of this century and that 12 million of them would have to be accommodated inside the Bantustans if there is to be some equality in numbers between White and Black, renders this, policy impossible, even for that enthusiastic machine-gun of a Deputy Minister. It is foolish even to suggest that 12 million people can be absorbed by the Bantustans. The hon. the Deputy Minister quoted Natal as an example of the progress of the economic development in the Bantustans. History, and not this Government, determined that the whole of Natal is a border area. They are as prosperous as they are because they have always been leaning on the white people.</p>

<p>Let us now look at the primary showcase of this Government&#x2019;s application of the policy of apartheid, and that is the Transkei. In spite of the series of figures quoted by the hon. the Minister yesterday with a view to illustrating the wonderful development in the fields of industry and agriculture, one sees nothing but deterioration when driving through that area. Not only are the grazing and the soil deteriorating, but also the people living there. They used to have stock of good quality and they used to supply a large part of the Republic&#x2019;s wool crop up to a certain stage. The drought is not the only thing which is to blame for the present state of affairs. There is the question of over-population. The area cannot even carry the population which is there at the present time, and then they still talk of returning people to that area. That hon. Deputy Minister boasted about a certain number of Bantu who had moved away from the Western Cape during 1967-&#x2019;68. Do hon. members know where they went? They went to the Ciskei. I challenge him to maintain that three-quarters of the population of Mdantsane, the place to which those people are expected to go, has employment. [Interjections.] The fact remains that this Government is trying, in spite of hopeless over-population in the existing Bantustans, to get Bantu out of the Western Cape and out of that area from Humansdorp to Aliwal North which is reserved for the Coloureds. Why we say that the Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of the establishment of independent black states cannot succeed, is the fact that they will never, as far as we can see into the future, be able to develop those states up to a stage at which such states will be able to absorb an additional 12 million people. How can any reasonable person say that the existing homelands, consisting of less than 13 per cent of the territory of the Republic, will at any stage be able to accommodate a population four times as large as the white population? Surely there is no sense in that. The Government of the Transkei still has authority as regards who may enter its territory, but what is becoming of the Ciskei? One need only drive through the Ciskei or live in that vicinity to realize what misery exists in that area.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned Mdantsane. I now want to refer to the lack of planning on the part of the Government in connection with the establishment of townships inside the Bantu areas. There are approximately 8.800 houses in Mdantsane. The target is 25.000. The official population figure is 58.000. Un-officially 70.000 people live there. When I went there to investigate, I did not go with the Black Sash; I went with the officials of the Department. They were the only people I questioned. I did not question a single Bantu. I have nothing to say about the houses there. They are good houses. I have nothing to say about the existing 32 schools. The fact of the matter is that less than one-half of them has any staff. That is how much the planning is out of pace with the population increase. They are standing there like empty shells. Some of them are now being converted into offices. When one visits those schools during school hours and finds only three of them fully occupied by pupils, one asks oneself, &#x201C;Can there be any government that can make such a blunder in its planning programme as to provide so many schools for such a small population?&#x201D; This Party has no objection to money being spent on the education of the Bantu. But we should not spend so much capital on building schools which cannot be used and which do not have sufficient staff. But I am going to give the other side of the picture. Do hon. members know how many facilities Mdantsane, with its population of 70.000, has at its disposal as regards health and social services? There is not a single public telephone. There is no hospital or a single doctor for 70.000 people. There are four clinics which are temporarily available and which employ black and white nurses. There is not a single pharmacy. There are tarred roads and lighting, If a person should be involved in an accident, however, and has to get to a telephone to call <span class="col_0145-0146" refersTo="page_0092"/>a doctor from East London City, which is the nearest place, I wonder where he would run to. There are no facilities for that mass of people to go to a cinema at night or to attend any other form of amusement. This is an example of the planning of the Government to take people here from the Western Cape and to dump them there while one-half of them does not have any work. One half of the inhabitants of Mdantsane used to be inhabitants of and were transferred from Duncan Village. The other half is made up of Bantu from the Western Cape who have been removed there. This is the place to which they are being removed.</p>

<p>Now I want to come back to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development who has been a Deputy Minister for quite some time and who ought to know better than simply climbing in and making statements which one can so easily refute. A short while ago he spoke about Mnxesha, one of the camps to which people are being removed. He said, and put this to us as a fact, that the camps existed purely for the unemployed or those previously unemployed. I challenge the hon. the Deputy Minister to repeat that statement. I shall give him facts which prove that many people there have been taken from employment and have been removed to that camp. The hon. the Deputy Minister had the privilege of speaking about himself and his own people, and I am going to do so too. I had a Bantu worker on my farm who used to work for my father as well and who had lived on the farm for anything between 40 and 50 years. He became blind and in an attempt to get him near a clinic&#x2014;there is not one on the farm, after all&#x2014;I asked the municipality for a piece of land and I built a house at my own expense in the location. I accommodated the entire family in that house and a few years later the Bantu died and the widowed mother stayed on in the house. Some of the children and grandchildren moved into the house with her. The children earned money for her and the family lived well. Five of the 11 grandchildren worked in homes in Middelburg (Cape). Shortly afterwards the Bantu widow arrived on foot from Mnxesha on my property at East London and told me, &#x201C;Sir, I am hungry. I was sitting there in a house which had been given to me as a present and I could not make ends meet. I am here with 11 children, five of whom were in employment. Now, we cannot live there and where will they get employment? King William&#x2019;s Town is 11 miles from where we were and East London 45 miles away.&#x201D; You can check on this, Sir. There is no point in trying to gloss over or conceal the fact&#x2014;the rations which those people are receiving are not sufficient. For what reason should we want to remove someone who is in employment and who is living on the boundary? He is not in the Western Cape. I want to challenge the Government to remove people from the Western Cape at the same rate as that at which they are at present depopulating Middelburg and Burgersdorp of Bantu. I do not know who is instrumental in this affair. I do not know whether there is an over-enthusiastic official at Middelburg. I was there on Saturday and I visited the homes where the servants used to work about whom I had been told by the Bantu widow who had asked me to get her back there because she could no longer bear to be where she was. There are 450 houses there which are already occupied by 3,000 people and the removal programme in respect of Middelburg alone, so I was told by the official, is 168 additional families within two months. Arising from this I ask the question what on earth is inducing us to follow such an inhuman policy, to up root the people and to place them in an area where they receive a house free of charge and have to be supported by means of rations.</p>

<p>That is not all. How does this depopulation affect our country as far as agriculture is concerned? The hon. the Deputy Minister is from an area where this is happening. As yet it has not happened in Somerset East, but it is happening in Middelburg, where I have my farm, as well as in Burgersdorp. Heaven alone knows who the person is who has selected these places for the removal of 3.000 people within a few months. I shall put this question later, because <span class="col_0147-0148" refersTo="page_0093"/>up to now I have not had the time to do so. As far as Bantu are concerned, this area is now becoming depopulated. After all, we know what a people, a group as well as a nation is like. When some leave and get houses free of charge and do not return, even those who need not go, also move away. Those who have not been told as yet to go, also move away. This area is becoming depopulated, but that is not the worst.</p>

<p>The policy seems to be succeeding.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the policy is succeeding in so far as it is over-populating one area to such an extent that it is being ruined and will subsequently become a curse on the country. The Ciskei as well as the Transkei has not been able to feed its populations for the last few years. This year they will want to get every grain of mealies they will be able to get, and the white farmers will be expected to supply that. At the same time, however, the labour of the white farmers is being drained away so that they themselves cannot do what they would like to do. Here is the rest of the story. An article entitled &#x201C;How long is Card&#x2019;s Arm?&#x201D; starts as follows, &#x201C;How does Uitenhage view its future under the impact of the Physical Planning Acts &#x2026;&#x201D; Later in the article the town clerk was asked what he thought of the situation as far as labour was concerned. The reply of the town clerk was, &#x201C;Hardly anybody seems really worried, although it is a fact that several companies which employ African labour are known to have applied for exemptions. Some have been refused, but two at least acknowledged success. One asked for and got permission to employ an extra 150 Africans, another was allowed 50 more and another 50 on a temporary basis, but the others were refused. The town clerk does not see the Act as having any effect on development. He points to the big reservoir of Coloured labour in areas like Graaff-Reinet, Somerset East, Cradock and even Kirkwood. A good percentage of these workers, he thinks, will eagerly swop their country jobs at R4.50 per week for twice as much or more in Uitenhage industry and will be suitable for absorption into manufacture&#x201D;. What I am doing is to indicate that this policy of the Government takes people and transplants them to an area where they do not belong and where they do not want to be simply because the carrot of a house and rations free of charge has been dangled in front of their eyes as a carrot is dangled in front of a donkey. If this means that the policy of separate development is succeeding, the Good Lord must protect us when this comes down on our heads. There are many thousands of people on the boundaries of the Transkei and there is not sufficient food for them all. They are constantly seeking employment, and you can ask any farmer in our country from that area, Sir, what his experience is, and he will tell you that people looking for employment knock on his door every day. Does this constitute population adjustment which is succeeding? The Bantu are being removed from the white areas and the Coloureds thereupon run to the industries on the South Coast and elsewhere and take up employment there at increased wages. What kind of planning is this? Is this Government no longer in earnest as regards agriculture and the possibility of producing? In these times in which we are living and in which the Bantu find themselves in such dire straits on account of the drought, it still suits this Government to remove people who do not bother anybody from the boundary where the employment opportunities are and to place them in camps just outside King William&#x2019;s Town. The Bantu have been living on that boundary for many generations. A short while ago the hon. the Minister spoke of the old people and the indigent who are being accommodated there because they had no other refuge. If that is something praiseworthy, it is definitely not something praiseworthy to remove people who have employment, who are happy, who have been living there for generations and who are not bothering anybody and to transfer them to another area. The hon. the Minister will probably tell me in due course who laid down the policy as regards the two places I mentioned where Bantu labour is being cut so drastically. If he fails to do so, I shall put the question to him, and I shall obtain that information. This is the position as it is at present.</p>

<p>As regards the provision of employment opportunities inside the Bantustans, I have said here that the Government&#x2019;s policy cannot succeed to such an extent that the Bantustans can absorb all the Bantu. And when we speak of that aspect, that brings us to the political aspect. A short while ago the hon. the Deputy Minister spoke of this separate development, and he said that there would never be an umbrella government over the commonwealth of states in Southern Africa. Of course not. Who said there would be one? Who is foolish enough to believe that Lesotho or Botswana or Swaziland and all the others which may subsequently be added, will have one umbrella government over them in a federation of nations? That idea has never even arisen. What the United Party says, however, is that it is proper for this country and for this white population not to run away from its responsibilities, not to have so little confidence in the leadership of the white man that they no longer want to extend that over the Bantu. It is proper for this Government and any other government in South Africa to face up to the situation and to admit that this is a multiracial country. As far as I or other people can see, we are not in a position with the means we have at our disposal to-day, to remove the other races to such an extent that we would have a majority of Whites in what we want to call a white Republic&#x2014;we are not in that position now nor shall we be in 30 years&#x2019; time or in 300 years&#x2019; time or at any stage. If we cannot do this, the entire policy of the <span class="col_0149-0150" refersTo="page_0094"/>Government fails, and then we have to look for an alternative. We say the alternative is the policy of the United Party, which mentions a race federation and not a federation of nations. And there is a real difference between separate development with representation within one state and sovereign, independent Bantustans within the territory of that state. One of these is what we support, and that is separate development with representation, which is our policy. The other is the one which we are opposing and which we shall continue to oppose as long as there are two sides in this House, and that is the development of independent Bantu states within our territory, states which do not even have boundaries. Time and again when I study the map of the Ciskei and notice all the spots indicated on that map from the bottom up to Herschel and right up against Basutoland&#x2014;I am aware of the plan to remove some of them and we agree with that &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We agree that some of the black spots should be removed, where possible. Will you remove the one situated right up against Basutoland? Will you remove Witzieshoek? [Interjection.] That is part of the Ciskei. The black spots situated there are large ones and it will not be possible now nor in the distant future to consolidate them into one territory of the Transkei.</p>

<p>At this stage it still has no boundaries, and that is the territory which the Government wants to try and convert into an independent Bantustan. There may be people who will tell me that it makes no difference whether one consolidates those spots into a spot which forms a unit, and whether one has 200 spots in Natal which have to be consolidated into the territory of the Zulus. In that ease I should still want to know how on earth one is going to administer one&#x2019;s own country after one has given independence to such a state consisting of so many spots situated all over in the area of the white population that it looks like a crazy quilt? One would then have granted those people independence and one would be faced with transport and defence and all those aspects which are national aspects and which, as far as this side of the House is concerned, will never be transferred to the Bantu at any stage, because all of them are citizens of the same country, as far as we are concerned, and they have a responsibility and a loyalty towards South Africa to help to defend it. We do not want to separate them and turn them into foreign states. But someone must get up and tell me how, if one were to grant independence to the Zulu state with its numerous spots, one would be able to administer the rest of one&#x2019;s domestic affairs? Or are they going to administer the domestic affairs in their country, which is an independent one, and to which they obviously will grant entry to those they want there?</p>

<p>How can an unconsolidated state become independent? Would any state have come into existence anywhere in Europe if it had consisted of 150 pieces of land? Surely that is an absurdity, and if it is an absurdity, if it is not possible physically or politically to establish such a state, let us for heaven&#x2019;s sake stop talking of independent Bantu states; and if we stop talking of independent Bantu states, the entire policy of the Government falls away. Let me say at once that the sooner they once again accept the policy of the United Party, a policy of a federation of races and a certain degree of representation to the races within their own areas, as much as they can possibly administer, excluding those national aspects which they may not administer, the better it would be. They may not administer their own transport or defence, because that would clash with our interests. If that is not possible, the policy of the United Party is as plain as a pikestaff. This policy is possible, like my hon. Leader said yesterday, and it is possible without sacrificing white leadership. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I want to bring the discussion back to what happened here yesterday afternoon. Shortly after the hon. member for Hillbrow had made a fiery speech in a derogatory way about Bantu homelands and was almost carried away by his vocabulary in his attempt to vilify Bantu homelands, the hon. member for Yeoville, by way of an interjection, told the hon. member for Witbank that they had accepted homelands. After these two hon. members have contradicted one another directly within the space of a few moments, I cannot help but think of the following ditty&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n San is &#x2019;n ding wat spring, wat spring;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Sap is &#x2019;n wonderlike ding.</block>

<block name="quote">Hy rol in die sand en eet &#x2019;n koerant;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Sap is &#x2019;n wonderlike ding.</block>

<p>In spite of all their eloquence the hon. members find it difficult to say anything to prove that Bantu homelands have failed. I say to you now that of all the things with which the National Party has governed so successfully for 21 years, the latter will become the outstanding and major milestone in the history of South Africa, one which is calculated to create a pattern which will ultimately serve as a model to the world, because the racial problem is becoming a world problem. In this respect I think we arrive at the following position. The United Party, after possibly having recovered their second wind&#x2014;if they have such a thing&#x2014;and after they have been told by their political father-confessor, the editor of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> that the people have repeatedly passed judgment to the effect that Bantu homelands was what the public of South Africa wanted, knows to-day that they <span class="col_0151-0152" refersTo="page_0095"/>will have to find themselves a new garb which they will have to don for the next election, and, sitting there, that party is a bankrupt party, even financially. Their former financial sponsor has now told them: &#x201C;You are asking for more money; you are facing another election again. But I want to see results, and you know that I, Hoggenheimer, do not want separate development and it is no use your coming to me for assistance if you have not proved that you have succeeded in thwarting separate development as far as possible.&#x201D; Because, in spite of all these cries that separate development is a failure. I say that not only has it succeeded in South Africa to the extent where the public has repeatedly given it more and more support, but that even the world has begun to listen and become convinced that one is dealing here with a pattern which will ultimately serve as a model also for those countries and those statesmen with similar problems and with no knowledge how to solve them. Apparently the United Party has quite forgotten the lessons it has learned in the past. Looking at their numbers, Sir, I hope you will allow me to draw yet another comparison. When one considers the history of the United Party during the past 21 years, one can find nothing better than that piece of literary work by Leonard Fleming, &#x201C;A Fool on the Veld.&#x201D; to reflect their history. On page 80 you will find the diary of an old ewe. Every year this old ewe killed her lamb by laying down on him after having been tied up, because she used to refuse all her lambs. She died ultimately after having eaten poison and bloated. I recommend this to members on both sides and particularly to the Leader of the Opposition, because he is pre-eminently a farmer: let him read that chapter particularly well, because then he will see what the history of the United Party has been during the past 21 years. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition is in an amiable mood to-day; he is in that mood most of the time. For that reason I now want to talk to him about his motion, about those constitutional guarantees of which he spoke yesterday and which he wants to lay down in his constitution. And in that respect he is supported by some of the speakers on his side&#x2014;I almost want to say by the crackpots (&#x201C;malkoppe&#x201D;). They say they will guarantee the constitution. If the Leader of the Opposition guarantees that the white man will have supremacy there, or the &#x201C;leadership&#x201D; of which they speak, then I ask him: &#x201C;What do you want to guarantee it with?&#x201D; When putting this question, I want to remind him of the speech he made in the previous no-confidence debate on 22nd January, 1963 (Hansard col. 33). I want to quote what the hon. Leader of the Opposition said in that speech and to-day I want him to make his statements sound plausible as far as his guarantee is concerned. On that occasion he also spoke, as he did here to-day, of eight Bantu representatives in the House of Assembly and of six representatives in the Senate.</p>

<p>But then he said: It does not end there. I am now going to quote his own words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But I believe you will only achieve that sense of function in South Africa if all our people have not only representation in the Parliament which controls their destinies, but also some participation in the day-to-day administrative processes of the State.</block>

<p>In other words, not only here, but also in the day-to-day administrative processes of the State, in other words, the officialdom.</p>

<p>Wait a minute. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows what point I want to make and he is laughing quite amiably. Let him keep up that amiability. We know what the proportion between the races in South Africa is as far as numbers are concerned. What is the position going to be on the basis of a race federation, which is the policy of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition? Three-quarters of the staff in the offices, on the bench, in the police force and in the defence force will consist of Bantu, provided you are honest and provided the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not throwing dust in somebody&#x2019;s eyes. According to the pattern held up by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition here, namely a race federation, three-quarters of the staff in all those spheres of national life should consist of Bantu. But here comes his guarantee. A referendum will then be held. Here you will have eight members of Parliament who will say that they want the Bantu to have greater representation here. The Leader of the Opposition says: &#x201C;Oh no, we are going to have a referendum.&#x201D; Judging from what he says now, he is going to let the Whites vote about this matter. But will the Blacks be satisfied? Will the Blacks, who constitute three-quarters of the police, the bench, etc., be satisfied when only Whites are going to vote in that referendum as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said here yesterday? It is obvious that they will revolt against this. They will obviously revolt against this; that they will do all sorts of things and possibly resort to unlawful activities. I now come to the question I want to put to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and I hope he will <span class="col_0153-0154" refersTo="page_0096"/>retain his amiability. He must now tell me how he is going to guarantee his constitution when three-quarters of his police is black, when three-quarters of his soldiers is black and when three-quarters of his bench is black. He must not shake his head now. Was he not honest when he spoke of their participation in the day-to-day administrative functions of the State? I regard him to be an honest man.</p>

<p>No, that lovely smile of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not going to help him now; we are not attending a children&#x2019;s party now. Let us go into the crux of this matter once and for all. We simply cannot run away in a whisk from this issue all the time. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must not think that he can keep on jumping and always jump away from it. Should we not take it then that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition thinks that the people should decide about these matters? Was he not being sincere yesterday? Was he not being sincere on the 22nd January, 1963, when he told everybody in South Africa and the whole world that they should also be able to participate in the day-to-day processes of the State? These are the matters about which we should get some clarity from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. You see, Sir, I myself am also fond of laughing. I am probably one of the most amiable people in the world, but one should not laugh about matters of this nature. We are dealing here with matters one has to investigate in depth and determine what the Leader of the Opposition means when he comes forward with this motion of his. Was the hon. the Leader of the Opposition being sincere that day when he said that the Bantu should have a share in the day-to-day administrative functions of the State? He should explain to us how he is going to guarantee his constitution. Mr. Speaker, is it surprising therefore that the United Party has to experience that terrible disappointment of seeing its numbers in this House dwindling every time the people pass judgment? After all, one would have expected the party opposite to have made some progress during all the years this party has been in power. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition expect the public of South Africa to take him seriously and to trust him? Does he expect the public to trust him when he acts in this way? No, I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should adopt a responsible attitude now even though he does not have a responsible policy. After all, he should at least say something he can justify in the eyes of the people. He should at least be able to tell the public: &#x201C;Look, I was sincere with them that day when I said that the Bantu should also participate in the day-to-day administrative functions of the country.&#x201D; One cannot be dishonest with both of them; one has to be honest with somebody. One cannot tell the Whites one story and the black man another story and then expect people to have confidence in one. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition should tell us in his reply by what means he wants to uphold those guarantees of his. By what means does he want to guarantee that constitution in terms of which, according to him, the white man will always have the say? Is what he is now advocating not the very thing with which his party besmirched us in U.N. 20 years ago? Did they not say at that time that the Nats in South Africa stood for eternal supremacy? Sir, we have never turned a somersault in that respect. The late General Hertzog, Dr. Malan, Mr. Strijdom, Dr. Verwoerd and our present Prime Minister and leader have constantly been telling you what our aim is, namely separation. The more separation, the less discrimination. The Leader of the Opposition wants to entrench racial discrimination in his constitution for ever; that is what he wants to do. In other words, he now accepts as the policy of his party those things of which he accused us at U.N. It would not be surprising therefore if South Africa&#x2019;s name would then stink in the outside world. General Hertzog taught us that it was impossible to keep any nation in the world in a position of subordination for ever. We are not prepared to keep the Bantu in a position of subordination for ever. To-day the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, by way of interjection, went so far as to imply that something like a minority government existed in South Africa. Let us get away from that untruth once and for all. There is no such thing as a minority government in South Africa. In this white area of South Africa the white man is governing and in all the different Bantu states which exist in South Africa to-day, the Bantu enjoy the same political rights that I enjoy here.</p>

<p>Sir, those gentlemen are doing a great deal of harm in the rest of the world by spreading that story, but to quote yet another saying: &#x201C;Even though a lie may spread like wildfire, the truth will catch up with it.&#x201D; The truth is fast catching up with that lie, which is continually being spread by the United Party in the outside world, namely that in this country you have a minority government which is lording it over the majority group. Sir, separate development will reveal itself and it is revealing itself as a very special pattern which will be accepted in the rest of the world. The policy of separate development is being supported by both Whites and Blacks to-day. It is not only a view that is being held by the white voters of South Africa; it is a policy which is gaining more and more support among the Bantu peoples of South Africa every year. It started in the Transkei; the Zulu, the Swazis, the Tswanas and all the Bantu in South Africa have come to realize that under the policy of separate development, they have an opportunity such as they will never have under the mixed Parliament proposed by the United Party. Here they have at least an opportunity of making such progress according to their skill and ability and of reaching the same stage of development as any white voter in the world can. But this concept of eternal subordination only serves to give South Africa a bad name again in the eyes of the world. In the early history of this party which is now in power, it was predicted that this country would find itself in a terrible revolution in a few years&#x2019; time. What is the situation to-day? After 21 years we have not only had numerous successes, a long series of solutions to problems such as the Republican issue, the population register and the question of citizenship&#x2026;.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there was an awful lot of problems. Industrial development in South Africa was such that the financial world was able to say, as was said by the chairman of the International Bank, that South Africa was the best of the lot. &#x201C;The best of the lot&#x201D;, were the words used. It is here where South Africa&#x2019;s credit is at its very best. It is a well-known fact that South Africa&#x2019;s creditworthiness is the best in the world to-day. How could the hon. the Leader of the Opposition say what he said in the light of the state of affairs which prevails in Europe and America, a state of affairs with its problems, race disturbances, race problems and bloodshed? Here in South Africa one finds a model of peace and quiet and of progress. How can the Leader of the Opposition come to this House with a motion of no confidence?</p>

<p>I am now going to deal with the hon. member who preceded me. The hon. member held up a picture of the conditions prevailing in the Transkei. I on my part, now contend that the standard of living and conditions in the Transkei and, in fact, in every Bantu homeland in South Africa, are at present higher and better than ever before. It compares favourably with the best in the world. Only this afternoon we read in the newspaper that, as far as America was concerned, America which is regarded as the most progressive country in the world&#x2014;and nobody will probably deny that&#x2014;the retired President had said that there were 35 million people in the United States living below the breadline. I now say this to the hon. member who spoke before me and who moaned about the so-called bad conditions prevailing in the Transkei. Let him compare the Transkei with the United States, which is the most progressive country in the world. In that country 35 million people are living below the breadline, and the hon. member is moaning here about the conditions in the Transkei where he cannot mention one person living below the breadline. How can the hon. the Leader of the Opposition get himself to say that he has no confidence in the Government in spite of all these things which are happening to-day and in spite of the conditions that are prevailing in the world and in South Africa? What does he want then? Does he not want peace and quiet? Does he not want full employment? Does he not want racial peace in this country? All these things are being maintained at the fastest tempo today, faster than it has been maintained ever before in the history of South Africa. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition not want it that way? What does he want then? What, in his opinion, is the ideal state of affairs when he compares South Africa to-day with any other part of the world? What does he want? Can he show me any other country where an equally ideal state of affairs prevails and say that that is the way a country should be governed? No, Sir. Of the country which has the best and most progressive policy and the most stable industrial set-up one can find in the whole world under a National Party Government over a period of 21 years, the Leader of the Opposition says that, in spite of all these things, he has no confidence in the Government. I really feel sorry for the Leader of the Opposition. It seems to me the hon. <span class="col_0157-0158" refersTo="page_0098"/>gentleman is sometimes forced into a position which is not a pleasant one for him. In that respect I wonder whether you will accept my moving an amendment&#x2014;that this House expresses its sincere sympathy with the Leader of the Opposition and the tragic role he is playing and is trying to play in the political history of South Africa. I wonder whether you would possibly obtain permission from the Whips for me to move such an amendment. He pretends to be deaf now. It seems to me the Chief Whip on the Government side is afraid now that this motion will be accepted generally by every member of the House. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition may add something else to his motion, namely that the Government and South Africa may be specially congratulated on the fact that they have a Government such as this one which, in spite of all the world problems and the opportunities which presented themselves to encounter difficulties, is nevertheless governing South Africa in such a way that we are a prosperous and peaceful country to-day, that we enjoy racial peace and that our Bantu people, who were suppressed at one time, are at present seeing the light under the guidance of the National Party.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down, has as usual, not failed to disappoint us when he brought in his shadow, Hoggenheimer. One thing that interests me is that, since I have been in this House, I have seen that hon. member move along from one bench to the other. He now occupies a place in the corner and I am sure that if he makes speeches like this in the future, he will soon join me on the back bench. The hon. member quoted a figure of 35 million people in the United States as living below the breadline. If he thinks that South Africa can hold its head up with pride, might I remind him that a recent survey showed that 9 out of every 10 children living in the Kwa Mashu township of Durban were living below the poverty datum line. This survey, for the information of the hon. members on the other side of the House, was conducted by the C.S.I.R. Nearly four-fifths of the households of Kwa Mashu could be regarded as living in poverty. That I believe is sufficient reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s half-hour speech. So often since this debate started, one is left with the impression that members on that side of the House do not live in South Africa at all. They seem to be talking about a place that just does not exist.</p>

<p>I want to return to a few of my friends on the other side of the House, in particular the hon. Deputy Minister who unfortunately is not here at the moment. He criticized me for visiting Limehill with certain people. I want to tell that hon. Minister and the Government side that I will visit whom I like, when I like, where I like, south of the Limpopo and that I will choose my friends when I do so. I also want to tell the hon. members on that side of the House and that hon. Deputy Minister that I retract not a single word I said about Limehill, last year or during the recess or what I am going to say now. A question mark lies over Limehill and a question mark lies over the head of every South African in regard thereto. I want to deal with one or two aspects as well as with Limehill. We have heard so much of the moral justification of the Government&#x2019;s policy. I want to bring one or two points to the notice of this House that makes one wonder just where this moral justification lies. Last year I asked this House to appoint a special committee to investigate the matter of population removals, but this request was turned down by the then Minister of Community Development. The point I made was that if a proper investigation was done then much of the hardships attached to removals would be obviated. We know every race group in South Africa has been affected by removals, but the Whites least of all. I think probably the reason for that is the Whites have the greatest voice and the Government therefore does not have the courage to move them about willy-nilly as it does the other groups. I wish to emphasize that no one objects to removals done for the sake of good housing elsewhere, schooling, and the clearing up of slums. Nobody objected to the removal from Cato Manor.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>For the information of the Minister I wish to say loud and clear that nobody on this side of the House, and nobody outside has ever objected to the removal of people if the removal was to the benefit of the people concerned. When removals take place for the benefit of the people concerned, for instance for better housing, school facilities, health, and so on, then those removals are agreed to, but when removals are forced upon any group of people for political reasons only then all human decency goes by the board and to those removals we on this side object most strenuously. Removals that take place for political reason only&#x2014;and I emphasize for political reasons only&#x2014;beome nothing else but inhuman experiments with people. When such removals, as the one at Limehill, take place, then I submit that every South African must bow his head in shame. The Nationalist Party has delusions of grandeur, but in fact it has nothing but the trappings of heartlessness when this sort of thing occurs. If we want to claim to be a civilized. Christian, Western country, then I ask the Government why it does not appoint the commission I asked for last year? This commission need only establish whether a proposed removal is justified in the first place, under various headings: then it must establish whether the area to which the people will be moved is satisfactory: and then it must determine whether there is sufficient housing, water, and all the other things necessary. This will be nothing new on the part of a government <span class="col_0159-0160" refersTo="page_0099"/>because this was done overseas during the war years when people were moved out of London for their own safety, and nobody thought anything of that. Has the Government ever investigated the consequences of removals on family life? We so often hear the word &#x201C;tradition&#x201D; in this House; we hear this or that is the traditional policy of South Africa, and so on. But has the Government cared one iota for the traditional family life of the Bantu and of the Indian? No, it has not done so, and I submit this commission would serve a very valuable purpose and at least enable South Africans&#x2014;if hon. members on that side of the House are not affected by this, we on this side are&#x2014;to hold their heads up with some sort of pride. I believe Christianity demands that such a commission be appointed; I believe the people of South Africa are entitled to one. If such a commission had existed, would we have had the case of Rustenburg which occurred recently, when the hon. Minister sitting over there made one of his usual <i>faux pas</i>? Would we have had Riverside, District Six? We certainly would also not have had Limehill. Already a thousand group areas have been declared by this Government and something like 700,000 people have been moved forcibly by this Government; yet in not a single case was a full investigation held into the circumstances and the consequences of the removals. The shifting of 700,000 people is no light matter. Some may have had to be moved, but I believe no proper investigation was held on the lines suggested. [Interjections.] When one hears hon. members opposite making so much noise, when they are so critical of what has happened at Limehill, I believe they are entitled to do so because I suggest their consciences must be worrying them. Last year we had the dreadful experience of having to listen to the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development referring to certain priests &#x201C;in long dresses&#x201D;. It was an insulting remark concerning a religious body which was doing what the Government should have done in the first place. The whole country was ashamed because of the insulting remark he had made about these priests. We had the hon. member for Umhlatuzana talking about serious illness at Limehill as being &#x201C;apricot sickness&#x201D;. The hon. member for Klipriver displayed a heart of stone when he brushed aside the complaints about the illnesses as &#x201C;being natural for that area&#x201D;. This hon. member also said he had found 60 graves in the area but that some of the people had died at the age of 80 and 90 years. This was in a population of 1,000 people. I did not count the graves at Limehill. I looked at the official pages containing particulars of the deaths, and of the 20 names recorded ten were of children under the age of four years, most of whom had died of some stomach complaint.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member think that is normal for an area the size of Limehill? If he does, then Heaven help us! The hon. member also said the area had a clinic and nurses. I should like to know what is wrong with his arithmetic because it only has one nurse and it has not had her all the time. The hon. member also said a bus service was provided at Limehill and residents could use this to get to the other centres if they did not wish to avail themselves of the medical and clinical services provided for them at Limehill. Has that hon. member ever had to travel for 20 miles in a bus while he was ill, because that is the distance one has to travel to get clinical treatment elsewhere, and has he ever had occasion to wait for a bus when seriously ill? This callousness of the Government side should cease. They must face the facts of Limehill and the other Limehills of South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, I will do so right this very minute. We have had criticism from the Minister who talked about the Catholic church being involved. But a joint committee of five religious denominations continued to protest against the hastiness of the move. This was before the move took place. The Government was warned that if it went ahead then disease could break out. So I say the people sitting opposite must be blamed for the disease which did break out at Limehill. We were told by the Deputy Minister sitting there what a wonderful place Limehill was. That is what he told us in a speech last year. He said before any Bantu were removed to compensatory land or to a Bantu township in a Bantu area, sufficient water for human as well as animal consumption was made available at the new site at the cost of the S.A. Bantu Trust. I have one question to ask the Deputy Minister. If sufficient water is made available, why then are the people still using water carts? He went on to say every family was supplied with a tent or prefabricated house free. Well, there were no prefabricated houses at Limehill, none whatsoever. He also said the Trust even supplied new material for the new homes on the new site. Yes, it did, but the people had to pay for it, and they paid with money which they would probably have spent on food.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member who is so touchy about this matter, why people are still living in the Lime-hill complex in tents, not new arrivals but people who arrived nearly a year ago who cannot afford to build a house?</p>

<p>We have heard about the clinic at Limehill; we have heard there is sanitation; we have also heard that the people moved voluntarily to Limehill. If they moved voluntarily, then I ask the Deputy Minister the same question I asked him last year: Why were six affidavits put in opposing the removal? If they moved voluntarily to Limehill, how is it that the Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioner in Natal said he wished to make it clear that the move was voluntary and not compulsory, and that if the Africans did not wish to get on the lorry they did not have to, but the squatters would, however, eventually find themselves open to prosecution if they did not move? Is this voluntary? Limehill was such a wonderful place a year ago that in answer to a question in this House the hon. Minister of Community Development said no sanitary provisions were made before the first people were moved in and no clinic was available or was yet available. This was on the 12th February of last year. But we hear from the Deputy Minister that everything was right when they moved to Limehill.</p>

<p>I want to make it quite clear that the Government are responsible for what happened. They were warned in this House and by people outside this House, yet they proceeded to move the people to Limehill before anything was ready for them. Removals in other areas are taking place in the same way. The same thing happened at Mondhlo. At Osizweni, four years after the people were moved in, water was still being brought in by trucks, although the Government had said there would be plenty of water for them. Of course, the whole basis of Limehill is so much eyewash. The question is this: Why were they moved there in the first place? What was the object? What industries are there; where will the people work who now live in Limehill? They are now 20 miles further from where they worked before and a person living at Limehill pays 20c busfare a day out of a salary of R3 per week. The hon. the Deputy Minister read us a letter from a Bantu from Limehill, in the same way the Deputy Minister sitting alongside him read one here this afternoon, praising the Government for what it has done. What the Deputy Minister did not say was that the letter came from a person who had been given a trading concession, while the letter that Deputy Minister read was from a person who had a filling station.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Government this. If Limehill is such a wonderful example of separate development, why don&#x2019;t they let everybody see it? What are they hiding? Why does the security police harass the people who are working there and doing some good at Limehill?</p>

Why was the recording of the father who was interviewed by the S.A.B.C. never broadcasted? Why did we never hear it? I repeat that if the Government is so proud of Limehill why does it not open it up? Then we can all have a look at it. No, the Government will give permits to Nationalist Party organizers to accompany the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. Those are the sort of people who can go to Limehill because they have all been brainwashed anyway.</p>

<p>I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what these people are to do when they leave their shop counters. Is the Government going to give them employment? Is the hon. the Minister of Transport going to open his doors and offer Indians employment on the Railways? No, they must stop being shopkeepers but that Government prevents them from being anything else. Who is moving the Indians out of Rustenberg? If only we had a commission that could investigate these questions, that hon. Minister would be put in his place and movements such as this would not be allowed to take place. That hon. Minister said in a speech last year that the 3&#x00BC; million Bantu in South Africa were going to be replaced. He was going to replace these people with white workers and I still want to know where he is going to get them from.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to say that a <span class="col_0163-0164" refersTo="page_0101"/>commission such as that for which I asked would be valuable in that it would restore to the ordinary man in the street the confidence that the title deeds he holds for his property is still of some value. In the Dundee area we had the instance of Natives being moved from their farms to Limehill. Before they had even shaken the dust from their heels the miners had moved in and started drilling for some precious metal. The indignities that are heaped upon the non-White people of South Africa would at least be lessened if we had such a commission. I want to ask the Government to consider this very seriously.</p>

I do not think that the hon. member for Klipriver did so, because he was still very busy trying to win his nomination as leader of his party and that took 5 hours. We nominated and unanimously elected our leader in about 5 seconds. I should like to ask the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and hon. members on that side of the House who are so much in favour of this idea of white by night, how many Bantu servants they brought with them to Cape Town this session. Why do they not employ local labour as they preach time and again? I know that they did not employ local labour because I know that at least half a dozen of my personal acquaintances on that side of the House brought their non-White servants with them. By doing that they deafeated the very policy that they preach here day by day. [Interjections.]</p>

At that time when we, the present Government, proceeded to remove the Natives from those squatters&#x2019; camps, in which the most dreadful conditions prevailed, to better places, we heard exactly the same speeches in this House and exactly the same cries went up from the priests. They were the people who tried to stop this Government. This Government has a clear conscience as far as that matter is concerned. This Government is not ashamed of what it is doing to move the non-Whites to better conditions. That hon. member is the last person who can reproach the Government in this House with not treating the Natives in the Republic of South Africa fairly! This is the very Government which displayed fairness by moving the Natives to better conditions.
