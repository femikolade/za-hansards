<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>We appreciated the Annual Report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. I found it informative and well prepared and it certainly reveals a great deal about what is happening in the Department. I want first of all to deal with the problem of rabies. The Government of course is doing much for rabies, but is it doing enough&#x003F; It can hardly do nothing at all. The report shows that there has been a slight decrease in the incidence, but remarks truthfully that there is not necessarily a real diminution in the incidence of rabies, nor does it show any real control. We find that there has been a 50 per cent increase in the incidence of rabies in the Orange Free State. This is a serious matter. We find also that cats, not for the first time, are being attacked by rabies, and I think it is a serious matter that cats should be so attacked. The point is whether special rabies vaccine is being manufactured for the cats as they do at the Pasteur Institute&#x003F; In fact, I know that the Pasteur Institute claims that it is necessary to prepare special rabies vaccine for cats. Our experience may be different. I would like to know. I notice a fall in the incidence among dogs since the 1966 report, but there is very small change in regard to the incidence among cattle. This is very dangerous because farmers get their arms infected and contract rabies in that manner. I presume the Department has warned farmers about dealing with cattle which they cannot really diagnose. I am also concerned about the storage of vaccine and the diagnosis of this disease. All cases must be referred to Pretoria for diagnosis. Admittedly they give a diagnosis within a very short time, but the time lost in the transport could possibly be fatal to a human who has been bitten. I am also concerned about the storage of this vaccine. All of it has to be manufactured in Pretoria. What reserves are there and what precautions have been taken should anything <span class="col_5175-5176" refersTo="page_1075"/>happen to the single place where it is manufactured&#x003F; I remember the early outbreak of rabies in Zululand. I saw the chief of the Department of Veterinary Services and he told me then that he was waiting for some freezedrying machines which had been ordered by him personally from France some three or four months earlier and which he had not yet received, so that there was a further delay of some three months before the Department was able to supply sufficient vaccine to make a real attempt at immunizing dogs in the coastal towns of Natal, and Zululand. So the whole position is precarious unless precautions are taken. I have an unhappy feeling that because of the concentration of all services in Pretoria there is a grave danger that we may run short of many vaccines should a fire break out or some act of sabotage be successful. I hope it does not mean that all the cattle vaccines are stored there.</p>

<p>The position with regard to tuberculosis is changing and one thing that stands out is that a very small proportion of the cattle population has been T.B. tested. I think it is 18.3 per cent of the cattle population, which is small. If you read between the lines, it is an instance of the shortage of veterinary officers. I find four occasions where the report refers to the shortage of veterinarians. This is a serious matter, especially in regard to the question of tuberculin testing and other specialized services.</p>

<p>Returning for a moment to the question of rabies, it is mentioned that here again difficulties are being encountered in the destruction of the small animals like meercats, and this again is attributed to the shortage of staff. In regard to tuberculosis, it is interesting, and possibly it is a matter that may require investigation, that for the first time an impala ram was discovered suffering from tuberculosis. It is difficult to see how the animal acquired it. The pig losses are serious, and cause a great deal of financial loss to farmers. This is largely due I understand, to the appearance in pigs of a certain myco-bacterium, which is almost indistinguishable from the avian tubercle bacillus. This has also appeared in humans, although the percentage is very low, so far as we can tell in humans; it is about 2 per cent of cases. In at least one other country it is said to be as common as 60 per cent. Now this new myco-bacterium has been found, according to the report of the Department on feed and on bedding which have had no contact with pigs. This is a very serious matter and I would like to know what the Department proposes to do to deal with this problem.</p>

<p>Another point is that the Department states that they are now using I.N.H., which has been used for many years very satisfactorily on humans, and a new antibiotic, called &#x201C;Rifampicin&#x201D;, a semi-synethic drug, and by that means they can cure tuberculosis in cattle. Now the word &#x201C;cure&#x201D; is like the word &#x201C;never&#x201D;. It is one of those words which should rarely be used in the consideration of a disease and in humans we should not use the word &#x201C;cure&#x201D; in relation to tuberculosis. We speak of the disease having been arrested. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Right at the beginning I want to express my gratitude to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services for the wonderful task they have performed under the most difficult of circumstances. As a result of the limited time at my disposal I can refer only briefly to this tremendous problem so that you may, at least, realize with what degree of gratitude we have noted the actions of this Department. The catchment area of the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam lies to the east, spread over 16 magisterial districts. If we remember that 20 per cent of the available water supply is allowed to flow into the Orange River Basin, where we have a run-off of no less than 70 morgen feet per square mile, you will realize what the extent of the water supply in that area is. The total area of this region is 25,000 square miles: 14,000 square miles are situated within the boundaries of the Republic and 11,000 square miles within the boundaries of our neighbouring state, Lesotho. We must picture for ourselves what the area there looks like. To the west it is level country, with a height of about 4,000 feet above sea level. As the area stretches eastward we encounter more undulating, eventually mountainous, areas, with a height of between 9,000 and 10,000 feet above sea level. I could sketch the position for you scientifically in respect of the geology and the ground formations, but because of the lack of time I cannot do so now. However, I may just say that this is a region which is geologically, and in respect of its soil, tremendously subject to erosion. As far as the topography, geology and nature of the soil is concerned, there has never been any danger. The Creator made it so. and creation is perfect, as we know. But in the course of time conditions developed which created tremendous problems in that area. At the time of its creation, and when the Creator alone prevailed there, the whole area was covered by a dense layer of grass. The north was slightly different from the south, but the ridges and plains were covered by grass. That is how we knew it. But what do we find today&#x003F; To-day we find that a mere 22 per cent of the area can still be regarded as grassland &#x2014;55 per cent is already a mixed area of grass and scrub veld. 90.7 per cent of the northernmost part is grassland&#x2014;in the vicinity of Bethlehem and Kestell. But it distresses me to say that there are areas where 62.3 per cent is already pure scrub veld. An authority in this field recently said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The development of this veld type constitutes the most spectacular of all the changes in the vegetation of South Africa. The conversion of 20,000 square miles of grass veld into eroded Karoo can only be regarded as a national disaster.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#pansegrouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>I am serious about this matter and the hon. member must please not disturb me. In addition to this destruction of our grasslands we have come to the point where large areas are, not merely pure scrub veld areas, but in some cases totally denuded areas. I could mention figures, but I merely want to say that in the mountainous parts there are certain districts where 34.7 per cent of the area has already been totally denuded. Bring this in line with the fact that this region is situated in an area with a relatively high rainfall&#x2014;15 inches in the west to 45 inches in the east. We who know the Highveld and its summer rains, who know the characteristic downpours, have a very good idea of what precisely is going on there. We know that 65 per cent of the silt carried by the Orange River comes from the Republic of South Africa. We are already at the stage where 320,000 morgen within the catchment area are on the brink of total collapse, while 1&#x00BD; million morgen can be labelled as &#x201C;poor to very poor&#x201D;. We are at times inclined to point a finger at the Government, or at the Minister concerned, in respect of these problems. But we ourselves are also responsible as contributory factors. For example, we are overoptimistic about the carrying capacity of the area. A survey indicates that there are 22 large stock units per 100 morgen while we know that the carrying capacity is a mere 12.1 large stock units per 100 morgen. We thus have a tremendous problem here, and this is where I come to the Minister, his predecessors and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Thank goodness they noticed the position in time and are already taking positive steps. I want to express my gratitude for the establishment of a Division of Catchment Area Protection, at present stationed at Aliwal North. Except for the problems I have already mentioned, this branch of the Department is still up against many other problems. Only 23 of the 41 posts in the Upper Orange are manned, 31 per cent of the farms are inhabited by non-owners and 20.5 per cent of the units are uneconomic units. In addition, 47.2 per cent of farmers there have not yet had any contact with an extension officer. However, this position is changing. The average age of the farmers there is high while the level of agricultural training is relatively low. Only 15.1 per cent of the farmers are concerned and are taking an active interest in the care of the soil. The problem is simply overwhelming. Therefore I want to pay tribute to-day to what I want to call the combat general of that area, Dr. Pienaar, the head of the Division for Catchment Area Protection. In conclusion, I merely want to quote what he said when it was pointed out to him that the problem was overwhelming. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The problem is overwhelming, but allow me to say with feminine logic: &#x201C;So what!&#x201D; I nevertheless believe in the amazing powers of recovery of our country, I believe in the excellence of our extension service, I believe in the persuadability of our farmers and therefore I also believe in the possibility of stabilizing the Upper Orange. That is why I accepted this post as head of this Division which set me my task of stabilizing the area, firstly for the sake of production potential of the area and, secondly, for the sake of keeping our soil where it is at present.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield has delivered a most moving address about the catchment area of the Orange River which, in the words of the chief of that region, may yet be snatched back from a national disaster. But it has unfortunately been allowed to develop to a point where emergency measures were necessary in order to save the area. I am sure that it is only the planning of the Orange River which originally brought to the attention of South Africa, of the Department and of the people concerned the tremendous seriousness of the problem.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the position of the extension officer and with soil conservation. It is almost impossible to-day to catch up with the problem of soil conservation in the country. The Minister and his Department to-day are mobilizing forces to cope with the special problem mentioned by the hon. member for Smithfield, but throughout South Africa the number of extension officers are so far under the quota that the farming community is falling behind in areas where we cannot afford to lose the struggle. To me this is so serious that if it is necessary for the Department to reorganize its entire structure to cope with the problem, we should do that. The Minister some time ago made a statement in which he laid down five conditions necessary for the maintenance of a &#x201C;bestendige landboubedryf&#x201D;. The first one was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Om die beste moontlike beskerming aan die land se natuurlike hulpbronne, sy grond, veld en water te verleen, om daarduer hulle behoorlike optimale benutting en ontwikkeling te verseker.</block>

<p>In our area in Natal there is a high rainfall and good farmers, farmers vitally concerned about the problem of soil conservation. However, without the services of an extension officer, the direction and drive in order to get soil conservation under control is lacking. But the farmers themselves are still concerned about it, each within their own particular area. I have said for a long time, and I am convinced that it is right, that planning for soil conservation has to be done on a regional basis. Even a district may be too small to cope with the extent of the problem we are facing. I have said that our people there are intensely concerned about the question of soil conservation&#x2014;to <span class="col_5179-5180" refersTo="page_1077"/>the extent that one of our farmers&#x2019; associations approached the Department and achieved what they thought was an understanding that an extension officer would be sent to their district. They even went so far as to build a house for him but unfortunately the post was not filled. So concerned were they that they went so far as to provide accommodation for him in the hope that he would be there permanently. This is one of the richest farming districts in the whole of South Africa. In another area an entire building was built so that offices could be leased to the Department as permanent accommodation for the officials. They even went so far as to supplement the income of an extension officer. I do not know whether this was legal, but it was done nevertheless. But this man left the service of the Department to go to a commercial organization for three times the salary paid to him by the Department. In the face of these circumstances, how can the Department win&#x003F; How can soil conservation win&#x003F; If it is necessary to decentralize the functions of the Department, it should be done. If it is necessary to raise the grading of the extension officer and allocate to him other powers and more staff to enable him to take the lead he has got to take, that should be done, if it is necessary to maintain their interest. The Minister has to think of some plan or other which will allow of these people being paid, not the same they can get in private industry, but at least a reasonable salary, reasonable in comparison with what private industry will pay to a person who is a university trained graduate.</p>

<p>Some hon. members have complained that private firms lure these people away. They are not lost to agriculture. In our area the closest possible co-operation takes place between the representatives of various companies and the extension officer. The extension officer is only too grateful to get the help, assistance and advice given to the farmers in the area by the technical representatives of these companies. He cannot do it himself and it is not only a question of the preserving and protection of the soil but the crops that should be planted, the fertilizer programmes and all the technical details which leads to the efficiency in farming. When you are efficient in farming you have the chance of making a profit on your yearly operation. When you are making a profit on your yearly operation you are then in a position to take measures to protect your soil. But when you are losing money on your farm every year it is impossible to take adequate steps to protect the soil. I believe the Department, if necessary, have to look to some regrading and reconstruction of the posts in the Department in order to increase the importance of the extension officers, in the regions in which they serve.</p>

<p>I now want to raise another matter with the hon. the Minister, namely that of the Cedara Agricultural College. Two years ago, I think, there was a change in the course at this college. Formerly it was a two-year course, but it was changed to a one-year course in the belief that this college would turn out more students because their periods of study at the college will be shorter. I have been informed that it has now been decided to go back to the two-year course. I want to support this change, because the two-year course gives them a far greater opportunity of getting a solid grounding. In the case of the one-year course, all the distractions there are at an agricultural college such as its proximity to Pietermaritzburg and sporting events, make it very difficult for them to concentrate on their studies. I believe the two-year course gives them a far better opportunity and they will emerge from the college with a far sounder grasp of what is so vitally necessary to us, and they will be people who are thoroughly versed in the techniques and the theories of agriculture. One of the problems we have with some of the extension officers is that they come to us new from universities and that we have to teach them some of the things they cannot do. They know the theory, but when it has to be applied in practice in a particular district where every farm varies in its reaction to the application of fertilizers, etc., we find that there is always an interaction between the extension officer and the local farming community. It seems to me that when we have been able to achieve an accord and when the man has been able to gain the respect of the farming community, he is then lured away by some other organization.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Mooi River will pardon me if I do not follow up his arguments. However, I want to pay him the compliment of being one of the few members of the hon. Opposition who in this debate at least tried to make a constructive contribution to the benefit of agriculture in this country.</p>

<p>With reference to the extraordinary views held by the Opposition in regard to land prices I just want to read a quotation to them from what Dr. Marais, the Chairman of the Marais Commission on Agriculture, had to say about this particular subject. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another thing which can almost be regarded as an evil is the well-known land hunger of the Afrikaner. It causes people to think too much with the heart and not with the head. Many farmers pay prices on which they just cannot get a proper return, not even in the present general economic situation, which is a favourable one.</block>

<p>Dr. Marais warns strongly, and quite rightly too, against the phenomenon of less moneyed farmers following the bad example of the moneyed farmer and buying farms with expensive borrowed money at prices which according to all calculations simply cannot be justified. Is this not precisely the attitude adopted by the hon. the Minister in regard to this matter&#x003F; In this debate as well as in previous <span class="col_5181-5182" refersTo="page_1078"/>debates mention was made of the conference which was attended by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet and myself at Graaff-Reinet a few weeks ago. I want to advise the Opposition to take note of what happened at that conference. They must take note of the dignity with which the farmers conducted themselves at that conference. These were people who were in the deepest of misery, but their dignity and conduct certainly set an example to this Opposition. Those people did not beg, nor did they make accusations left, right and centre. They stated their problem, but in a dignified way. The prevailing spirit at that conference was that the farmers should be helped to help themselves. That was the impression with which one left there. That is what the farmers of South Africa expect and also get from this Government, namely assistance to help themselves.</p>

<p>The wool farmers of South Africa, and more specifically those of the Karoo and the Eastern Cape, have very specific problems to deal with. Apart from the fact that they have to contend with droughts, which are increasing in frequency and in intensity, they also have to deal with caterpillar plagues, soil erosion, etc. There is also a further factor which hampers the wool farmer in practising his industry. The product which he produces is not subject to price determination. It has to compete on a free world market. The prices rise and drop, and prices have unfortunately shown a downward trend lately. Moreover, it is a fact that the production costs of the wool producer remain the same or, if anything, show a rising tendency. A drop in the price of his product therefore hits the farmer much harder than is the case in other sectors of our agriculture. It is also a fact that the wool farmers cannot readily change over to another industry. They cannot cultivate maize or wheat, because the soil and the climate do not lend themselves to it. In other words, they simply have to continue with the product which they produce, irrespective of what the conditions are, and irrespective of what the prices are. The wool farmer is indeed fighting with his back to the wall to-day. He is not only faced with this declining market and increasing production costs, heavy mortgages, high rates of interest, etc., but he is also fighting for the continued existence of his industry. On the world market he now has to compete with artificial fibres in particular. I realize that artificial fibres can never take the place of wool, and that wool will always remain a quality article. It will always hold its own in the textile industry too. I also know that the Wool Board is still making propaganda and conducting research to find more uses for wool, that the question of the increased mixing of wool with synthetic fibres is being investigated, etc. We must, however, consider which way wool is going. As I have said, there will always be room for wool as a quality article and there will always be room for better quality wool. But when we look at what is happening in the textile industry, we are filled with anxiety about the future of this product.</p>

<p>In the report of the Wool Board for 1967- &#x2019;68 the following is stated in this connection:</p>

<block name="quote">It is estimate that the world&#x2019;s production capacity of synthetic fibres will be 7.7 million pounds in 1968, an increase of 22 per cent over 1967. To counter smaller demand in 1967, manufacturers of synthetic fibres drastically reduced prices. The scope of this was reflected by the fact that, with 1960 as a basis, the prices of nylon and polyester dropped about 55 per cent, while the price of wool rose by about 5 per cent. In spite of the strong growth of synthetic fibres cotton still held the biggest share of the fibre market in 1967, i.e. 56 per cent as against 35 per cent and 9 per cent for synthetic fibres and wool respectively. Twenty years ago cotton&#x2019;s share was 71 per cent. In the last three years the proportionate decline of cotton became absolute.</block>

<p>I want to mention the fact once again that wool is fighting the encroachment of artificial fibres with its back against the wall. We must take note of this phenomenon because we have to organize our planning for the wool farmer accordingly. As a result of the threats which I have just mentioned and which we as wool farmers want to counter, our greatest problem&#x2014;and this problem will increase progressively&#x2014;is the financing of the industry, especially on a long-term basis. High rates of interest, which cause the production costs of the wool farmer to shoot up, are not accompanied by an increase in his product. Unfortunately the very reverse is true. I therefore plead once more, as in the past, that attention should be given to a financing institution specifically for the wool farmer, namely a single-channel mortgage burden institution, so that the wool farmer can get his long-term credit through one channel only. The State should have the greatest share in and must also initiate this scheme. In view of the situation on the wool market it goes without saying that the interest payable on these mortgages will definitely have to be subsidized. I myself foresee that the system of credit provision through a single channel will have to be so flexible that rates of interest will have to be adjusted according to the state of the wool market from year to year. The wool farmer has always been able to stand on his own feet in the past and only approached the State for assistance to his industry by way of exception. But when we have to deal with a threat such as the wool farmer is in fact faced with at this stage, it is a fair request that the State should make a contribution in this way. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate the hon. member for Cradock on the responsible contribution he has made to this debate. I do believe he has <span class="col_5183-5184" refersTo="page_1079"/>hit the nail on the head when he suggested that there should toe one channel financing. He specifically raised the question of the wool farmer who has specific problems which apply to the industry and also to the particular area where sheep are farmed. We on this side of the House are accused of being irresponsible towards agriculture and that we are just interested in making political propaganda out of this most important subject. I wish to refute this suggestion entirely. We are earnestly concerned about the well-being of agriculture and our efforts here are entirely directed at restoring agriculture to its former important place in the economy of South Africa. We object to the suggestion that we are playing politics and I welcome a speech such as the one toy the hon. member for Cradock, because I think he is making a case for the farmers in his constituency. I was a little disappointed in the speech made by the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet. He rather gave me the impression that there were no problems and that things were going fairly well. He did not cite the specific problems which are confronting the people in his constituency with whom I am so very well acquainted. I do not want to auote from the speech which the hon. member made yesterday, I rather want to quote from another speech which he made before he became a member of Parliament. Then he said what I would have expected him to say here in this hon. House. I have a cutting from the <i>Landbouweekblad</i> of the 10th October, 1967. It is a report of a national wool-growers&#x2019; congress. There were various speakers at the congress. Amongst others, Mr. S. A. S. Hayward is also quoted. It says:</p>

<block name="quote">Mnr. Sarei Hayward het ges&#x00EA; dat drie tot vier persent van die jong boere besig is om hulle piase te verlaat; bulle het uitgeboer by gebrek aan kapitaal. As die toestand moet voortduur, stuur dit op &#x2019;n ramp af. Die man wat homself nog kan help, moet onmoontlike rentekoerse betaal en hy gaan geleidelik agteruit. Geen hulp is beskikbaar voor dit te laat is nie. Diegene wat wel gehelp word, kry so min dat dit hulle nie op hulle bene gehelp kan word nie.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Sarel Hayward. This is a speech which I honed the hon. member would have made yesterday. However, he chose quite a different line. I want to say that in respect of what he said yesterday, I agree that the South Africa Woo! and Textile Research Institution in Port Elizabeth is a great institution and it deserves all the support the Government can give it. I trust that as the years go on. the Government will see fit even to assist this institution to a greater measure than it is doing now, because I see in this institution a way of solving some of the problems of the South African wool farmers.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to a matter which I briefly raised yesterday. I said that it was important that the Department of Agriculture should acquire farms in the various farming areas of South Africa where they could in fact demonstrate to the farmers the various systems which have been recommended by the research institutions. They should apply these systems in practice for the farmers to see the result under practical conditions. I believe that this is a matter to which the hon. the Minister of Agriculture should give serious attention. I only want to quote one or two examples to show how difficult it is for a farmer to know in fact what to do. The following is an extract from a speech made toy Dr. S. J. du Plessis:</p>

<block name="quote">Experience has shown that the best planning based on all available knowledge of experts is doomed to failure if its application in practice is left in the hands of poor managers. Many instances are known where an individual has taken over and transformed a farming unit into a roaring success on which his predecessor had failed to make a living.</block>

<p>My contention is that if we can demonstrate on farms in a practical way that a success can be made by using the most modern methods, we are far more likely to induce the farmers to do it when they see the methods being applied in practice. There are so many different kinds of schemes which are recommended to farmers that they are not quite sure where they stand. I also want to quote from another speech made by Professor A. J. Pienaar. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">In &#x2019;n lae reenvalstreek soos di&#x00E9; noord van die Soutpansberg is dit nodig dat bepaalde veldbeheerstelsels na re&#x00EB;n gevolg word, en in tye van droogte weer &#x2019;n ander stelsel.</block>

<p>So, the farmer is getting all kinds of advice and he does not know which advice is the best to follow for his particular area. I think we should demonstrate on a farm which is sponsored by the Government in his particular area. In that way the farmers will be assisted in applying these very methods which the officials are recommending. Here is another system. Mr. Claassens said:</p>

<block name="quote">The writing is on the wall that in the future conservation methods will be enforced. In the area of the North-western Agricultural Union this boils down to spare veld farming.</block>

<p>Here we have another system. Nothing is carried out for the farmer to see which in practice is the best method to follow. Then we have the system of N.S.G., in other words, non-selective grazing. This system was developed by a farmer in his private capacity. I do not say that this system is right in all its aspects: I think there is still much to be investigated. These experiments however created more interest than any other experimerits <span class="col_5185-5186" refersTo="page_1080"/>in veld conservation, because it was done by a practical farmer under practical circumstances. I attended a congress at the Grootfontein College of Agriculture. I have known Grootfontein since 1934, and this congress had the biggest attendance of farmers I have ever seen at Grootfontein. This congress had such a big attendance, because they were dealing with experiments which were done by a farmer under practical conditions. In fact, it was such a big attendance that it almost reminded me of a United Party political meeting.</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>At this conference they were dealing with non-selective grazing. Then there is another system, and this system is the short-graze-long-rest system. In the latest edition of <i>Die Landbouweekblad</i> there are two articles; the one article is about a farmer of Grahamstown who has had great success with the system of intensive grazing which was advocated by Mr. Acocks. The other article is about a Karoo farmer who has rejected it entirely, because it does not work in his area. Therefore, we are justified in saying that the farmers are at sixes and sevens because they do not know what system they should follow. It is for this reason that I request the hon. the Minister to try to carry out the suggestion I have made. I think that all the research and all the information which have been given to us by our very efficient research stations and agricultural colleges will get across to the farmers more easily if they in fact see it being carried out in practice under the circumstances in which they themselves have to farm.</p>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am standing up because I am opposed to a few of the utterances which have come from that side of the House. I do not want to occupy myself with what the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, said, except that I merely want to correct one aspect which he raised. The hon. member said that they were returning agriculture to the important place it occupied in the economy of the country. However, I maintain that agriculture today plays a greater role in our economy than it has ever played before. It is playing a greater role than before because our production is so much greater. That hon. member was thinking of the distant past, when agriculture was the most important economic factor in South Africa. He was thinking of the time when all the Afrikaners were concentrated in the country districts and were languishing there because there were no avenues open to us and none were being opened for us. I am in revolt because the United Party, through the mouths of quite a few members, <i>inter alia,</i> the member for South Coast, said that the National Party had adopted the United Party&#x2019;s agricultural policy. This is surely not true!</p>

<p>What is the United Party contemplating&#x003F; Are they contemplating a new coalition&#x003F; If we had taken over their policy we would surely not have had over-production in agriculture today; we would be experiencing the famine which we experienced under their rule. We did not adopt their policy. If they are contemplating a coalition they will not get it, because there is too great a gulf between the United Party and the National Party. It is a gulf which cannot be bridged. But this is not the only sphere where they are wanting to snuggle under our wing. On numerous occasions the United Party has come forward with the story that we are adopting their policy. Sir, we shall once more fight this matter out at the polls, and I want to assure them already that they are going to get a bigger hiding than they did in the last election. Sir. I am in revolt against the United Party&#x2019;s claim that the farmers are so poor. This is surely not true; it is surely a generalization. There are, of course, farmers who are experiencing difficulties, and there are other factors responsible for that. Take the Western Province for example; take my own constituency. Surely it is not correct to say that the farmers are poor; it is a generalization. There are farmers who are experiencing difficulties but I do not at this stage want to go into the factors responsible for that because this has already been done adequately. It is a question of land prices and other factors which have already been discussed adequately here. I now want to prove my statement: It is the farming population which has supported the Mission Church throughout the years and is still doing so today. In the newspapers this morning we saw a list of names of people from whom a Coloured falsely collected money to send people across to the Olympic Games. Large amounts were contributed and the people concerned were all farmers. Among others there was the name of one of the United Party&#x2019;s farming leaders.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>It is not only in the farming community that people are experiencing difficulties and falling by the wayside. How many people do not fall by the wayside in commerce&#x003F; People surely fall by the wayside there as well. There are many people who function uneconomically in commerce and then they fall by the wayside. There are people who function uneconomically in industry and then they fall by the wayside. This happens in all sectors of the economy; it is an economic trend.</p>

<p>Sir, the United Party comes along here with this story about the depopulation of the country districts and then this is coupled to agriculture. I have grown tired of that a long time ago. The depopulation of the country districts is a trend throughout the world. We have had this trend in Western Europe; there was an <span class="col_5187-5188" refersTo="page_1081"/>industrial revolution in Western Europe. We have also had that trend here in South Africa. All the Afrikaners originally lived in the country districts. We were only committed to agriculture. The population grew, but the Afrikaner remained in the country districts. At the beginning of this century, with the advent of Union, the country districts still had the most constituencies by far. But the question is, did the Afrikaner function economically in the country districts&#x003F; He did not.</p>

<p>Sir, we were there because there were no other avenues open to us; there was no other refuge for us, and more than half the Afrikaners became poor Whites as a result of the fact that they stayed in the country districts. We eventually found ourselves with a poor White question. Who was responsible for that&#x003F; It was the old United Party which was responsible for it. There were no other avenues open to the Afrikaner; we simply had to languish there; our sons and our daughters had to languish there because there were no industries in South Africa. Agriculture was actually the only industry in South Africa at that time. The other stuff was all imported. We did not have the right to do anything for ourselves; our raw materials were all exported under the United Party Government. The poor White question was only solved after the first National Party Government came into power and established industrial protection for South Africa. Sir, it is true that the country districts became depopulated. Those share croppers, foremen and tenant farmers, and others who were languishing there, migrated to the cities. Nearly a whole generation of Afrikaners sat beside small raw brick houses and galvanized iron hovels. In winter they moved their chairs to follow the sun, and in summer to follow the shade. There were no avenues open to us; we had to languish there. It was the National Government which gave us our opportunities. Notwithstanding the fact that the number of farmers have decreased, more and more is produced because there is greater efficiency.</p>

<p>Sir, this same United Party, this Opposition, complains every day about a manpower shortage; that is their great complaint. And what are they pleading for in this agricultural debate&#x003F; They are pleading for the Government to retain uneconomical people in the country districts. We see things differently and therefore we are encouraging border industries. That is why the Government has announced that it wants to decentralize industries. Other growth points must be created. It has been proved that the growth points cannot be created in agriculture. Growth points must be created in the field of industry, and by the announcement which the Government has already made about its intention to decentralize industries, we shall repopulate the country districts.</p>

The hon. member for Malmesbury is one of the political experts on that side, and when his political party is in a little difficulty he gets up and draws a red herring across the floor of the House. Then he wants us to follow that scent. The hon. member was here trying to fish on dry land and this side of the House is not going to follow his example. What did the hon. member say&#x003F; He said that the United Party wanted people to be uneconomically active in agriculture once more. He mentioned, as an example, the people who were at that time languishing in the sun; he told us of their difficulties and he referred to the poor White question. Who was responsible for the poor White question in South Africa&#x003F; That hon. member knows well enough, if he knows his political history, that there was a change of Government in 1924. He knows that the same political party was still in power in 1928. And when did the poor White question actually arise&#x003F; Was it not in the late 20s and the early 30s&#x003F; I still remember the days when farmers and surplus Whites had to be used to work on roads at 3s. 6d. a day. I remember the days when those people were used to build dams on farms at 25 and 30 cents a day.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, I did not know that the hon. member was getting up on a point of order; I thought that <span class="col_5189-5190" refersTo="page_1082"/>he wanted to ask me a question. Sir, in the years, when the hon. member for Malmesbury&#x2019;s Party was in power, that situation prevailed in this country, and if it had not been for the actions of the United Party Government in the years 1933 and 1934, that situation would have continued. The hon. member has boasted that the Nationalist Government was responsible for industrial development. Sir, the greatest advance to industrial development in South Africa, and at the same time to agriculture, was specifically made during the war years. It was after 1933-&#x2019;34 that we solved the poor White question in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that this White Paper about agricultural policy was drawn up by us at that time. He is right. The chairman of that commission was no less a man than Dr. H. J. van Eck. Another person who served on the original commission was Mr. Carinus, and the late Mr. Wolfie Swart also served on it. The hon. member said that the United Party has not adhered to this policy. This White Paper was issued in 1946 and in 1946 we had the Soil Conservation Act, and in 1938 the United Party ceased to rule. But now I want to put this question to the hon. the Minister: If the recommendations contained in this White Paper were not implemented by the United Party Government, why did his Government not implement them after 1948&#x003F; Listen, for example, to what is contained in this White Paper about farm credit&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has considered the proposal of the Reconstruction Committee of the Department of Agriculture that a state institution be established with the sole right to hold mortgages over farm land and to take over existing mortgages. A chattel mortgage system was also recommended. The Government feels that these subjects have not been sufficiently studied. It will, therefore, act on the recommendation of the joint committee &#x2026; i.e., that an expert inquiry be instituted.</block>

<p>But why do you then ask me such a question&#x003F; [Interjections.] <span class="col_5191-5192" refersTo="page_1083"/>I want to come back to the matter I was busy with yesterday. I said that there were considerable delays in connection with the execution of plans for farm works. The Deputy Minister then replied that farmers should continue on their own. But he does not know what he is talking about. The moment one&#x2019;s farm is planned and certain works have been measured up and indicated, one cannot begin with those works, especially the concrete and soil works, unless one has officials to survey them. One is not allowed to do it on one&#x2019;s own. One can do it on one&#x2019;s own if one wants to, but then one is not entitled to any benefits under the scheme. But the Deputy Minister wants us to carry on without the approval of the Department, without having the extension officers to do it. The Deputy Minister wants us to congratulate them on the wonderful progress which has been made, and he has said that we have had nothing good to say about the Department. But that is surely untrue. Our argument is this. If one looks at the report one sees that there are hopelessly too few extension officers and they are already overloaded with work to-day; the Government is loading this small number of officials with even more work. What the Government is doing is to exploit the loyalty of these extension officers, as few of them as there are. All that the United Party wants is for that burden on their shoulders to be lessened.

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Frequent mention was made here of the depopulation of the country districts and the migration to the cities, but on looking at the gloomy picture which the Opposition painted about farming, I cannot understand the fact that the <i>Landbouweekblad</i> and the <i>Farmer&#x2019;s Weekly</i> register their best sales in the towns and cities. There are few city dwellers who do not dream of their own farms and their own pieces of ground. The Opposition will never kill that love and I think it would be very interesting to determine how many city and town dwellers still farm economically in their spare time. The city and town dwellers have a fundamental interest in agriculture because we are of the soil. We are also interested in this subject because it is from that source that the products come which the city and town dwellers consume. Towns have always developed around the market squares. In the good old days this was the centre of the town. In time cities developed. The market was still the centre-point. However, modern urban planning has entailed the decentralization of certain commercial sectors. Thus chain stores, suburban stores, suburban service points, etc., came into being. But it is strange that markets, where the farmer&#x2019;s unprocessed product is offered, were not decentralized. What has been the result&#x003F; The urban housewife does not like travelling by car to the city; she does not like the heavy traffic; she does not like the time such an outing takes and so on. She therefore does not go to market. She buys that product from soneone else, hence the existence of the vegetable dealer on the corner. He packages his product very attractively, but the product is not always fresh and, what is more, he must also show a profit. The result is that the housewife buys less and pays more. If she had bought at the market she would have been able to get more for the same amount of money. This causes, <i>inter alia,</i> the so-called over-production, but it is also clear that in that way much less is consumed. I am specifically mentioning vegetables and fruit and other dairy products which can, in fact, be offered on the open market. Therefore I want to ask the hon. the Minister to make a request to organized agriculture that it should investigate the desirability of decentralizing our markets so that we can make the fresh product directly available to the housewife, thereby insuring that we do not have that double profit-taking which actually benefits the vegetable dealer. I have nothing against him, but I am pleading for greater and improved contact between the consumer and the producer.</p>

<p>Then I also request the Minister&#x2019;s attention for the good work which the Technical College in Bloemfontein is doing. I know about that and I am therefore mentioning that school. I think that the Ficksburg Technical College has handed over some of its work to the Bloemfontein Technical College and one of these sections was the engineering section. After matriculating young farmers are taught there to repair diesel as well as paraffin tractors, to do electrical wiring, welding and soldering and anything which the practical farmer needs on the farm. It is a three-month <span class="col_5193-5194" refersTo="page_1084"/>course. We have already had evidence of one single farmer in. a Free State district saving R2,000 in the past season on repair costs because his son had taken that course. It is noteworthy, and the city dweller is also interested in this, because lower industrial costs mean lower production prices for him. Consequently I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that nowhere in the Estimates do I see any amount allocated to that department of the Bloemfontein Technical College. Since that department is doing such good work I want to ask the Minister whether something cannot be done about this and whether he cannot discuss, with the Minister of National Education, the possibility of having an amount voted specifically for this.</p>

<p>In conclusion I draw attention to the fact that little or no propaganda is being made about it and I ask for this matter to be propagated much more widely among our young farmers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I should Like to continue with my argument to the effect that the situation has been reached Where extension officers are being exploited. Their loyalty is being exploited because they are being overburdened with work, and because the State and the Government are not doing enough to get more posts filled. The hon. members opposite can forget all about making any progress in respect of soil conservation unless they have these people. If one glances through the report it is very clear that there are still scores of magisterial districts where there are no information offices. One of the most important reasons why progress is not being made in respect of soil conservation is that the financial position of farmers is what it is to-day, and the second is because we do not have enough officials to cope with the technical side of the matter. I told the Minister yesterday what my personal experience had been, i.e. that 18 months had elapsed since the extension officer had been asked to come and measure the farm works, and he had not been there yet. I do not blame him. It is because his task is so demanding, and such a fantastic amount of work is thrown onto his shoulders. But if we look at this map on which all the regional and information offices are marked, I want to tell the hon. the Minister to-day that this situation cannot continue in this way. He shall have to sketch the ideal position the Government would like to achieve to us, what they are envisaging. Are they setting themselves a goal in respect of soil conservation and the opening of more information offices&#x003F; As far as this side of the House is concerned, we maintain that the ideal position ought to be to have at least one information office for every magisterial district in South Africa. Then one will be able to cover all the areas properly. Then one&#x2019;s people will really be able to derive advantage from the extension officers. We must do what is being done in Rhodesia to-day where there is one extension officer for 40 or 50 farmers, whereas the position in South Africa is that there is one officer for approximately 750 farmers. Is that an ideal situation&#x003F; Are hon. members opposite satisfied with that&#x003F; What are their goals. Where are they going to, and what is their programme for the opening of new information offices&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to raise a second matter with the Minister, and that is the question of the eradication of the Karoo caterpillar. After these wonderful rains we have had, we also find that large tracts of the interior, particularly the Karoo, are now infested with Karoo caterpillars and they have already caused considerable damage, almost more damage than was caused by the drought. We know that research is being undertaken, but I think the Minister ought to take us in his confidence and say how far that research has progressed, and what hope there is for the people in those areas of eradicating this plague, how it can be eradicated, and what it will cost. For it seems to me that the costs for the State as well as for the individual farmer will be tremendously high before it is completely eradicated. But if we could eradicate the locust plague, if we could incur tremendous costs in that regard, then I do not see why it should be impossible to do the same in this case, provided there is a realistic plan, to eradicate the Karoo caterpillar as well. Of what avail is it to have veld reclamation schemes, we have good rains and people save their veld and then we have this plague that destroys everything in its path. And what is more, after the locust has been over the veld there is at least a chance of recovery, perhaps soon. There is at least a chance that your livestock will remain alive. But where this caterpillar has passed it leaves behind a substance which makes it impossible for cattle to graze on that veld again, on the little vegetation that may be left. This plague is one of the most serious with which large parts of the interior of South Africa are faced with to-day. I read recently in a newspaper that a conference on this matter was held at the regional office of Victoria West. There it was stated that more than 2 million morgen of these parts were already infested with Karoo caterpillar. We should like to know from the Minister what progress has been made with research in regard to the plague, and what we can expect in future as far as the combating of this plague is concerned.</p>

<p>The last question I want to touch upon is that of State veterinary surgeons. The position of general veterinary surgeons had already been touched upon. Glancing at the report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services we will see that large parts of the interior of our country are inadequately covered by State veterinary surgeons. It is calculated that there is a shortage of almost 250 veterinary surgeons in this country. I do not think it is necessary for me to emphasize the loss of livestock which we suffer annually as a result of the shortage of veterinary surgeons. I can only say that in the year 1959-&#x2019;60 we lost 364,000 head of cattle and 1,283.000 sheep and goats as a result of diseases. I am not even <span class="col_5195-5196" refersTo="page_1085"/>including in this the number of pigs, horses and poultry which were lost.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that is the only year for which I have particulars with me. In any case, it is calculated that the loss suffered by the farmers this year, conservatively calculated, amounts to approximately R20 million. That is why I cannot lay enough stress on the importance of having more State veterinary surgeons. Of course they are not prepared to come to inland centres, not even the private veterinary surgeons. They find it better to work in the cities and the surrounding areas&#x2014;to doctor cats and dogs, as an hon. member remarked here. I want to know from the Minister what he intends doing to cope with this problem.</p>

<p>On a previous occasion we have suggested to the hon. Minister that private veterinary surgeons be encouraged to come to the platteland on more or less the same basis as the one on which district surgeons operate. That is to say, over and above his private practice he must also make his services available to the State. Were we to do that we might perhaps influence these people to come to the platteland. The situation prevailing to-day is a tremendous source of concern for the cattle farmer, a source of difficulty. If a disease should break out among their expensive horses, rams or cattle, the animal might perhaps be dead by the time they can get to a veterinary surgeon, because in nine out of ten cases there is no veterinary surgeon in their magisterial district, and they therefore have to send for a man 80 miles away. By the time he arrives, the animal could perhaps be dead. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the United Party is trying to prove in this debate that they are the only people who really take the farmers&#x2019; part in this House and who have the farmers&#x2019; interests at heart. That is what they are trying to do. They are trying to prove that they are the only people who are now putting forward pleas in the interests of agriculture. I want to say to those hon. members, and particularly to the hon. member for Newton Park, that if they want to prove that they are acting in the interests of the rural areas, they are making a big mistake. If the farming population and the agricultural industry were to be dependent upon the pleas of the United Party they would find themselves in for more straitened circumstances than those they are in to-day. The only difference between the United Party and the National Party is that the United Party seeks publicity. The United Party makes use of this House to try to prove outside that they are acting in the interests of the farmers, whereas the National Party uses his House in a different way. The National Party uses it to try to run agriculture in South Africa in a more effective way. In the second instance, our accusation is that the United Party acts irresponsibly. The United Party is trying, in this House, to prove to agriculture that if they should come into power they will be able to do certain things. They were unable to do these things when they were in power, and they will be as unable to do so in future as a responsible government if they should ever come into power again. They will not be able to implement these things then either. This is our accusation against the United Party at this stage, i.e. that they are acting irresponsibly.</p>

<p>Let us look at a few aspects of their policy. Their point of departure is that agriculture in South Africa is in such a situation that there are farmers who are suffering hardships, but nobody has ever denied this. But how do they want to save the situation&#x003F; They want to save the situation by means of subsidies. They have stated over and over again that agriculture must be subsidized, but we all know that agriculture is already being subsidized to a great extent. In other words, they want to go much further. They want to use the taxpayers&#x2019; money to a larger extent to subsidize agriculture in South Africa. How far does the United Party want to go in respect of subsidization of agriculture in order to achieve that object&#x003F; They know that they did not do so in the past, nor will they be able to do so in future if they should ever come into power, for at the same time the United Party is pleading for a reduction in taxation. In the policy which they have drawn up, they propose that transfer duties, estate duties and many other forms of taxation be abolished. The following proof of their irresponsibility has to do with the consumers. To what extent will the consumers in South Africa be prepared to pay continually increasing prices in order to achieve the ideal the United Party has laid down in their policy, i.e. that every producer must receive payment on a cost-plus basis. This means that every farmer must be given the guarantee of a cost-plus price as far as his products are concerned. The United Party does not realize that this is a policy which cannot be implemented. It is irresponsible of them ever to have drawn up such a policy, because they will never be able to implement it. According to the policy which they have drawn up, they will guarantee every farmer cost-plus prices. I want to make it clear that any party which draws up such a policy is irresponsible, because it is a policy which cannot be implemented. We therefore expect the United Party to draw up a policy one day which they can implement if they should ever come into power. They want to reduce taxes and they want to reduce consumption as well, since they will be causing the prices to soar, and then they still want to pay higher subsidies to the farmers. In this</p>

 <p><span class="col_5197-5198" refersTo="page_1087"/>In this way they want to build up agriculture in future. It will be a sway-backed agricultural policy!</p>

<p>I come now to what two hon. members on the opposite side said yesterday in regard to agriculture. The hon. member for Gardens spoke about the shortage of labour in agriculture. He pointed out that there was a great shortage of labour. Immediately afterwards the hon. member for Newton Park accused the Government, saying that the platteland was becoming blacker. How does one reconcile those two statements&#x003F; The one member accused the Government of causing an influx of blacks into the platteland and the other hon. member stated that there was not enough labour on the platteland. Does the hon. member advocate migratory labour&#x003F; Does he approve of migratory labour&#x003F;</p>

<p>I come now to the question of soil conservation. A moment ago the hon. member for Newton Park said a few irresponsible things, which were quite incorrect. Let us look at industrial development in the country, because this came into existence at a later stage perhaps. However, I do not want to blame him for that. The hon. member stated that the first step in regard to industrial development in South Africa was taken in the thirties, but he is wrong. Does the hon. member not know that in 1926 and 1927 the National Party had the greatest difficulty with the United Party in regard to the establishment of a steel factory in South Africa&#x003F; The United Party opposed these steps to such an extent that a Joint Sitting of these two Houses had to take place in order to get the legislation on to the Statute Book. They opposed it because it would have hampered Mother England&#x2019;s industrial development. That was the beginning of industrial development of South Africa. The industrial development of the country had its origin in the years between 1924 and 1933. The key to the industrial development of the country was the production of steel in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this ground has by now been trampled and overgrazed to such an extent that it will need a good season to recover. I shall transfer the debate to South-West Africa where a very strictly selective policy is being applied in respect of agricultural production. There we eliminate everything which does not produce, and our livestock is already at a reasonably high level of production. We are so selective in South-West Africa that there is no longer an Opposition. I want to suggest that if this Opposition is not more fruitful or cannot produce more in an agricultural debate they will eliminate themselves by means of selection. I want to return to South-West Africa and since the Vote falls under the present Minister for the first time I think that this is the appropriate occasion for paying tribute to those who have dealt with agriculture in South-West Africa in the past. I am thinking of the Executive Committee, the Director of Veterinary Services, the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, and the Assistant Director of Agriculture, with their staff, who placed and maintained agriculture in South-West Africa on a very sound basis. They did so under difficult climatic and other conditions. I want to pay tribute to these people, and with the new dispensation which they now have to-day under this present Minister and Deputy Minister, with his directors and staff, I want to give them the assurance that they are not inheriting a bad legacy. On the contrary, I think they are inheriting a rich estate. We in South-West Africa accept them, and we want to express the hope that they will develop further in the field of agriculture. We welcome them there. With this readjustment which is now taking place in South-West Africa, agriculture is going to play a very major role in regard to how this re-adjustment is going to be accepted by the people in South-West Africa, since South-West Africa is for the most part an agricultural country. We are dependent upon agriculture, and that is why the application of the agricultural policy is going to play a very important role in South-West Africa. To comply with the condition that it be done with the least possible disruption, it will be essential that the Minister, his Deputy Minister, and all Departments keep themselves abreast of developments. We want to thank them for already having availed themselves of the opportunity of keeping abreast of developments, and I want to address a special request to the effect that heads of departments, with their senior officials, should undertake a tour through South-West Africa. I know that some of them have already been there, but the tour must not only be undertaken to Windhoek where the offices are situated, but must be undertaken intensively through the entire South-West Africa. They will then be conversant with matters, so that the agricultural policy in respect of South-West Africa can be applied effectively.</p>

<p>The average farmer in South-West Africa to-day finds himself in a reasonably sound economic position. Some have already recovered from the recent droughts, while others are in the process of recovery. I want to ascribe this fact chiefly to three factors. The one is that agricultural land in South-West Africa has not yet been sub-divided to such an extent that it no longer comprises economic units. The greatest percentage of the units in South-West Africa are still economic. The second aspect is that agricultural financing is undertaken on a much sounder premise, i.e. <span class="col_5199-5200" refersTo="page_1088"/>that agricultural financing does not take place above the production potential of those units. Thirdly, the human material one finds there does not merely rely on the Government in respect of rehabilitation, because those farmers are prepared, on their part, to rehabilitate themselves and to make their own contributions. I think these factors are the three main reasons why agriculture in South-West Africa is on a sound basis. Since the hon. the Minister is now going to apply the agricultural policy I want to address the request to him that he will not allow units of land to be sub-divided into uneconomic units, and that agricultural financing will be done on this same sound premise, i.e. on an economic basis, and that this will be directed in respect of farming practices in the various parts of the country. I want to address a special request in respect of the South Western part of South-West Africa, since the farmers there have to cope with special circumstances. The rainfall there is very low, while the farms are very large. I want to request that in this area, which has a surface area as large as that of the Orange Free State, an investigation should be instituted because here the people have to deal with extreme climatic conditions, and there are parts which receive an average rainfall of two inches per year. We want to make a special request to the effect that special attention should be given to that part of South-West Africa so that the future agricultural policy, and the application thereof, as well as the financing and the provision of credit, can all be undertaken on a sound basis.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by saying that all kinds of subjects were of course touched upon by hon. members and brought to my attention, I shall try to deal with a few of them, but hon. members will understand that I will be unable to deal with all their representations now. Therefore I undertake to assure hon. members, who directed representations in a certain direction here which I cannot deal with now, that these matters will in fact receive attention, and that the Department will write to them in order to state its point of view. There are nevertheless a few matters to which I should like to refer.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kroonstad referred to the position of the Deeds Offices. Of course the work of the Deeds Offices has increased tremendously during the past few years. The hon. member referred to that aspect and another member also spoke about it. I am in complete agreement with the hon. member that the fact that these persons are regarded as administrative officers whereas they are in reality professional technical people, creates a problem in regard to their promotion. I also agree with the hon. member that since these people&#x2019;s work, i.e. the registration of deeds, has shifted from the platteland to the larger cities, the question may in fact be asked as to whether the Deeds Offices should still fall under the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. I just want to inform the hon. member that I have already held discussions with the Minister of Justice in order to appoint an inter-departmental committee to go into the question of what Department the Deeds Offices should fall under in future. I do not want to say anything further about this matter, but it is my personal opinion that this office could be better incorporated with the Department of Justice. There may, however, be difficulties, and this committee will go into the matter thoroughly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) spoke about the Surveyor-General's Office, and the difficulties which are being experienced there in having matters dealt with expeditiously, with the consequential financial problems this creates. The Department of course is faced with the problem of a shortage of surveyors. The work is being done as well as possible and a great deal of overtime is being worked. This is unfortunately the position. We are at the moment giving attention to the possibility of an improvement in the salaries of the officials. In the case where he spoke about the question of the increase of tariffs for surveyors, this will of course cause the surveyors to be attracted to the larger cities where there is more work. An increase in the tariffs of surveyors on the platteland would not serve to solve the problem the hon. member sees either. I am not saying that for this reason attention should not be given to the matter. That is not the argument I am trying to put forward. It has been my experience that with the laying out of new townships, surveyors in the cities receive so much work that they would prefer to work there than to work in the platteland, even if the tariffs were identical.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River spoke about the training at our agricultural colleges. The training at agricultural colleges consists of one year or two year courses. If one makes a breakdown of the students attending those colleges, one finds that many of the students undergoing their training there do not return to agriculture. The percentage of them who are participating actively in agriculture is small. It was therefore decided at the time that the two year course should be shortened to one year because a large technical staff was of course required to give classes at the colleges. We were of the opinion that more students could in this way be trained in order to participate actively in farming. This of course entails that the person who wants to specialize does not receive such a good training, and in this connection I agree with the hon. member. Recently many agricultural schools have been established throughout the country, and many children are attending these schools. On a comparative basis the matriculation training at an agricultural school is almost of the same standard as the training which can be given at an agricultural college. In other words this one year course at an agricultural college does not mean much to a person who wrote his <span class="col_5201-5202" refersTo="page_1089"/>matriculation examination in an agricultural school. These courses are closely linked to one another, with the result that one asks oneself the question whether the function which the agricultural colleges have fulfilled in the past is still what will be expected of them in the future. If one could reach an agreement with the provinces to the effect that agricultural schools be established in the platteland areas in particular, where there is a need, one could perhaps begin thinking of a more specialized training at agricultural colleges which are in any case not being put to full use to-day being provided by means of short courses. This course can for example be three or four months long, and will be specialized courses, as for example in viticulture or the dairy industry. The officials who have to give classes at the college to-day and who are also in the employ of the Department, can then be placed on a specialized basis. Persons who really farm, will then have the opportunity of undergoing a short, specialized course in his specific direction. The question is whether it is still necessary to have farmers undergo a general course at these colleges. I have already referred this entire matter to a select committee that will go into all the aspects of the matter. It will be ascertained whether the Department cannot make better use of its own people for these purposes. The colleges can then be used to train persons who participate actively in farming and who are interested in it on a specialized basis. This will of course, cause a further deficiency, i.e. that there may perhaps be persons who are interested in a technical training in agriculture. Since we today have agricultural faculties at the various universities, where there are not always enough students, and since a farmer is not always interested in acquiring an agricultural degree, but wants reasonably good training, one asks oneself whether it is not time one reconsidered the training at these faculties. In fact a course, as in previous years can be introduced at universities which takes the place of a diploma course at a college. The students will then have an opportunity of undergoing specialized training, and will also share in the status of the university. These are all matters which we are dealing with at the moment, and which we are going into. I just want to inform the hon. member that this is the present situation.</p>

<p>No. it was decided that this year&#x2019;s course will only last for one year.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) spoke about the question of rabies, measures to counteract it, etc. I just want to inform the hon. member that since a new vaccine preparation building is being established at Onderstepoort we can of course make available much larger quantities of vaccine. Better storage facilities have also been established. Therefore it will be easier in future to make these vaccines available. The Department has in its turn made good progress with the eradication of meercats. The hon. member pointed out that there were other animals as well which could carry rabies. Among domestic animals the combating of rabies is of course much easier than among wild animals. I just want to inform the hon. member that during the past year alone meercats have been eradicated on 131,000 morgen of land. This is of course, a process which is being continued. The hon. member also referred to typhus among cattle, and the danger this constitutes. The Department has for a long time been aware of the dangers constituted by cattle typhus, not only for the animal itself, but also for our people. Provision is being made in the Estimates this afternoon for an amount, so that a start can be made with eradication of this disease among our cattle herds. If we were to glance at the Estimates we would note that R300,000 has already been appropriated for this purpose. The money will in the first instance be applied for the examination of these animals, the marking of animals which have been investigated, and compensation for animals which had to be killed, at rates as prescribed in the regulations of the Animal Diseases and Parasites Act. Use of private veterinary surgeons will be made in this campaign. I want to express the hope that the private veterinary surgeons will co-operate whole-heartedly with the Department to make it possible to combat this disease among the cattle successfully. This scheme will undoubtedly cost the country many millions of rand. At the present cost it is now calculated that this attempt to combat typhus among cattle will ultimately cost the Government R30 million. As I have said we have already made a start with this, and the money has already been appropriated. The intention is that this attempt should be proceeded with, and that we, with the powers which the Act in question grant us, will attempt to eradicate this disease among our cattle completely.</p>

<p>I just want to refer briefly to the rooibos tea industry, which was also mentioned by one of the hon. members. The hon. member for Piketberg referred to the money which the Government was making available for research into that industry. I just want to point out to him that research is already being undertaken at Stellenbosch and Elsenburg in that direction. The control board will of course also make money available for publicity. My department has also granted assistance to the rooibosoh tea industry, since they find themselves in a very difficult position.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer spoke about the possibility of the Government buying up farms so that demonstrations can be held for farmers as to how farming is being carried on in the various areas. The hon. member will of course realize that as a result of the numerous different farming methods which are being applied in the various parts of our country, this is a hopeless task. If the Government had to <span class="col_5203-5204" refersTo="page_1090"/>have farms, and managers of those farms, and had to duplicate so many times in order to meet all those requirements, i.e. of demonstrating to every farmer in every district what was being done there, it would be a hopeless task. We would need a plethora of officials to man the farms and exercise farming. There would have to be many scientists who could take those farms under their management and control. The hon. member is of course aware that there are such experimental farms which are being controlled and manned in this way, and at these experimental farms a pattern of farming is being followed which does not necessarily have anything to do with research, but which demonstrates particular farming methods to the people of that region. I just want to mention to hon. member that there are some of these farms in various parts of the country. On these farms they are farming on an economic basis.</p>

<p>However, my experience with these farms has been that when a farmer&#x2019;s day is arranged, when the farmers in the vicinity are asked to attend demonstrations of farming methods, only 10 per cent of the farmers normally turn up. This 10 per cent perhaps consists of those farmers who already know what they have to do under their circumstances. In other words, our major problem is to convey the information to the farmers. Then there are of course the demonstration farms which are laid out in co-operation with the farmers. On these farms demonstrations are given of what can be done in that specific region. There are several of these demonstration farms, and they are to-day good examples of very well conserved farms in their specific regions. In a district which is not very far from my farm there is such a demonstration farm and this farm is producing excellent results. However, if you drive through this district to-day you will be surprised to find that there is not one single farmer in the neighbourhood who is applying those methods on his own farm. One must ask oneself why this should be the case, for surely they see what is being done on the experimental farm. In spite of the fact that these farms have been established for the benefit of the farmers of that region they are still hesitant to apply the methods which are being demonstrated there.</p>

<p>In addition, many problems and criticism in respect of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the other Departments&#x2019; staff shortage were raised. The basic problem to-day is that vacancies arise not only because local concerns are able to offer these people higher salaries, but also because people are not available. Apart from the problems we have to cope with, I want to express my appreciation to-day towards our present officials, because they are still, under these difficult circumstances, acquitting themselves so well of their task. I think that hon. members will agree with me in this regard. The Minister of Finance announced that an improvement in salary scales, particularly in those of the technical staff, was once again being investigated, apart from the increase they have received this year. The increase in salary scales can perhaps bring relief, and particularly in this respect that people may perhaps remain longer in the employ of the Department. The fact remains, however, that there is a tremendous demand for trained scientists and extension officers in South Africa. I want to warn our agricultural concerns to-day that they must not think that if they succeed in enticing people away from the Department with increased salaries, they are creating more manpower. It has, for example, been our experience that agricultural concerns, even agricultural co-operatives, create their own section for the improvement of seed, and then entice our officers away from the Department because they adopt the attitude that the Department does not have the staff to fulfil this function efficiently.</p>

<p>That may be the case, but if two agricultural concerns each take two officers of the available five, then there is only one officer remaining in the Department. The fact remains that the Department and the universities are the only sources of training for scientists, research workers and extension officers. If this staff is enticed away from the Department&#x2019;s employ temporarily, it may, temporarily, be to the benefit of the bodies concerned. But if the source of training becomes depleted in this way, then it must ultimately prejudice the entire industry, and then there will in future be no people who can be enticed away from the Department. That is why it is essential that the Department should have a nucleus of people who can undertake this training for the future, because any trained scientist must keep one foot in basic research here at the source, even if he were to go in a different direction, and if the basic source no longer exists, then one cannot train people either.</p>

<p>I want to say to our agriculturists in the various branches of the industry, whether it be the control boards or the co-operatives, that the Department does not adopt the attitude that its people may not be taken away from it. The Department will always be the source from which these trained people are made available, but if the Department cannot retain its nucleus then it is of no avail deriving temporary advantage by taking a man away from the Department and in so doing destroying the source of training. Sir, we are all fully aware of this problem. The hon. member for Newton Park asked what the Minister&#x2019;s standpoint was.</p>

<p>What is your ideal; what are you aiming at&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. Sir. the ideal set is a very high one. The ideal is such a high one that more than 40 per cent of all the funds which are being made available by the Government for scientific research is <span class="col_5205-5206" refersTo="page_1091"/>being made available to the Department of Agriculture. The ideal is a high one, therefore, but one must have trained people to do that work; they must undergo a prolonged period of training. There are certain directions in which not very much interest is being evinced, but it is nevertheless essential that people be trained in those directions. That training is tremendously expensive; that is, if you can find someone who is interested in studying in that direction. Take the poultry industry for example. Various courses in this direction are being offered at various universities. If one takes into account the number of students one attracts, and the salaries of the professors and lecturers, then it costs R46,000 to train one expert in the field of poultry. The reason for this is that there are too few people who take an interest in that direction, but the course must be offered at the university, and for that one needs lecturers. That shows you, Mr. Chairman, with what problems we have to cope in order to get these people trained. The facilities for training are there, but the people are not available for training in that direction.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to point out to the hon. the Minister that I referred to the establishment of more offices and the appointment of more extension officers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. I am merely mentioning, in the first instance, what the ideal of training is. It will avail us nothing to open additional offices if we do not have the training facilities to train the people who have to staff those offices. I have just told the hon. member what the problem is at the universities in regard to the training of those people. There are not sufficient people who are prepared to take up all the bursaries which we are making available, and there are many bursaries which are being made available by various bodies. That is the problem we have to cope with, it is not that the will or the ideal is not there. Our ideal is to have an extension officer in his office, not in every magisterial district, as the hon. member suggested, but in every region where he is necessary. I am not talking about an experimental farm now; I am talking about an extension office with its extension officer. That would be the ideal position, if one had enough people to appoint there. Since we did not have qualified, graduated people, we made use in many cases of technical staff who were being trained by our extension officers, to staff those offices and to render these services to the best of their ability. Many of them are men of outstanding ability who are doing excellent work. But the ideal position, if we could get the people, would of course be to fill all the posts on our establishment. I do not differ with the ideal position as stated by the hon. member for Newton Park. It is quite wrong to create the impression that we cherish no ideals in regard to this matter, because the fact remains that provision is being made for the posts, but the problem is that we do not have the necessary manpower. Within the limitations of our manpower position we are trying to serve the farmers to the best of our ability. But the hon member must remember that additional claims are always being made on the Department for an increasing number of services. The hon. member for Smithfield referred to a new section which had to be established for soil conservation in the Orange River area for example, and the hon. member for Mooi River spoke about the Tugela Basin for which a new section might also have to be established later on. Of course, one needs manpower in order to do this work. Hon. members have already pointed out that there if a good deal of work in arrears which has to be done under the Soil Conservation Act. It is not always the fault of the Department only that approved works have not yet been carried out. Very often it is also the fault of the farmer who, for economic or other reasons has not carried out those works. This is one of the reasons why we are now introducing a completely simple system, under the Soil Conservation Act, in order to make it easier for the farmer, where such works have to be completed, to obtain his subsidy. The Soil Conservation Act is also being amended. I do not want to discuss that now; I just want to mention the fact. As the situation was in the past, the farmer had to obtain prior approval for the works he was going to effect, and once he had effected them, the works had to be inspected and approved, whether the farmer put up a wire fence or built a dam or whatever it was he did. We have now introduced a completely simplified system. If it is indicated on the farmer&#x2019;s farm plan that he can put up a fence he need not obtain specific approval to do so. He can simply proceed with the work and then indicate, by way of a sworn statement, where he has put up the fence, whereupon he can apply for his subsidy without any prior inspection. This will of course mean that we will have to impose certain minimum requirements to which a wire fence will have to comply, and then we will have to do away with the maximum requirements. Because we are doing away with the maximum subsidization we have now decreased the amount of the subsidy to 55 per cent. Sir, I do not on this occasion want to explain the entire scheme to you. I am merely mentioning that the system will become much simplified, and when we introduce the new legislation it is possible that we will also simplify many of the other methods. Quite possibly we will still reach a stage where we maintain that if a person has completed certain works in terms of his farm plan, even though they are mechanical works, and he has had this done by a reliable engineering firm, and he makes a statement to that effect, we may possibly pay him out without a reinspection. This will help to make many of our extension officers available for other purposes, for approximately 70 per cent of their time is now <span class="col_5207-5208" refersTo="page_1092"/>being taken up by soil conservation inspections, etc.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked what ideal we were cherishing. I want to indicate that in these Estimates as well there are quite a number of new services which the Department are now doing for the first time. One of these has been mentioned, namely the expansion of the measures to combat tuberculosis in cattle, and the simplification of the subsidization, and the increase thereof. It will cost us R250,000 more than it cost under the old system. Provision is also being made now in the Estimates for research in regard to irrigation. Hon. members will realize that water is one of the most important factors in South Africa and that it will very possibly determine what our economic and agricultural growth will be, and how far this will be able to expand. Under our schemes tremendous problems have arisen, particularly in regard to the flooding of land by applying the incorrect methods of irrigation, and the over-utilization of water on lands, as well as the problem of salinization. It is quite essential that we should know, with our restricted quantity of water available in South Africa, that water is being utilized in the best way possible on irrigation lands. We can no longer allow, as in the past, every man to have a certain amount of water made available to him because he has a certain quantity of land. He pays for the water and uses as much of it as he can, without taking into account what effect that irrigation may have on his land. But in the second place it is also necessary that we should have a good deal more research into spray irrigation in order to ascertain whether it is more or less economic than other forms of irrigation. At our irrigation schemes we must have more certainty in regard to what forms of irrigation should be applied. That is why we have established this Institute, for which R20,000 has been appropriated in the Estimates this year. In addition certain weeds have been declared this year, and R94,000 has been set aside in the Estimates for the eradication of Satan&#x2019;s bush. There are perhaps a great many other matters which hon. members brought to my attention and which I should prefer to reply to subsequently by way of a letter from the Department.</p>

<p>I just want to return to a few arguments raised by hon. members opposite. The impression one gained from hon. members opposite, their accusations and the questions they put, was that they were accusing this side of the House of having said that there was nothing wrong with agriculture; that hon. members here had stated that things were going well with agriculture, and could not be improved upon. But any man who states that he is satisfied with the conditions in an industry, particularly the agricultural industry, must be ignorant. I do not think any farmer, on his farm, even if he is making enough money, is ever satisfied with the position he finds himself in. Every man must strive for improvement. With our major problems in South Africa, where agricultural land is becoming less, and where there are droughts, and with the large number of people we will have to feed in the years ahead, it would be childish to say that there was no room for improvement in the agricultural industry, and in that improvement the State is playing a certain part, but the State cannot do this on its own. The farmers must also realize that they will have to be prepared to contribute their share and to apply the information the Department supplies them with. It is they who own the land, and not the State, and they must do something for the maintenance and improvement of the soil. That is why it is not merely our task as Government members, but it is the task of us all as Members of Parliament not merely to plead for the farmers when they address requests to the Government. They can address their requests themselves to their strong organizations and it is not even necessary for a Member of Parliament to do so for them. But we as Members of Parliament have an important educational task to perform, i.e. to get the farmers to take an interest in this function and task which the State is trying to exercise and perform. If one considers what information is available to the farmers, and the enthusiasm of our officials, one asks oneself why it is that the farmers avail themselves so sparingly of it of their own accord. I have had deputations from farmers who have stated that they wanted research in connection with certain things, and they wanted information, for example, on the feeding of sheep and what drugs to use for certain diseases. I then informed them that I was also a sheep farmer and what they were asking me I had available every day, but that I did not wait for the extension officer to come to me to tell me that I should do this, that or the other. After all, I know from what bodies I can get that information and instruction. If we adopt the attitude that we in South Africa must have so many extension officers that they should, as it were, go to show each group of farmers on the farm how to farm, we would be making a grave error. That is why we have made a start with these study groups. If the farmer belongs to a study group there are enough officials to give them instruction, and then they have the opportunity of co-operating with those people and they will be able to determine what is economic in their farming. I really want to make an appeal to our farmers in this Parliament to-day to make more use of the existing facilities and not simply to go on asking for more officials, who cost the State a great deal of money, but to make more efficient use of those officials by going to them themselves and not always expecting the officials to visit them in their homes and tell them, over a cup of tea, how to farm.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the privilege of the half-hour&#x003F; This afternoon I do not intend to deal in any detail with broader strategy or matters, for instance, such as the vacuum in the Indian ocean, which we have already debated in this Session in other contexts. Nor do I intend to deal in any detail with the broader policy approach of this side of the House towards Defence. That policy is well-known. We are agreed on both sides of the House in regard to the objectives of our defence strategy; we are agreed in regard to the importance of defence to the country; and we are agreed in the building up of a strong, effective and efficient force to protect us from whatever threats may be made against South Africa. Therefore, this year I intend to deal more with details of training and administration which affect the hon. the Minister and his department. But before doing so, there are one or two general matters which i would like to raise.</p>

<p>The first is to welcome the White Paper which was tabled in the House last week end the information contained therein. We have pleaded on many occasions for more information to be disclosed on defence matters. This White Paper does two things. It indicates to the people of South Africa the high cost of security, and it indicates the determination of our country as a whole to be prepared for any dangers which might threaten us. We would perhaps have liked more details. We believe that more information could and should be made available, particularly in regard to the rather skimmed over aspects of what we are producing and making for ourselves. We realize that the Armaments Board and Armcor cannot disclose in full all their activities or negotiations, particularly their overseas agreements, but I feel that a great deal more could be told to South Africa on what we are doing. For instance, there has been very little said about the take-over of the Atlas company by the Armaments Corporation. I should like to ask for some more information in regard to this deal. There have been other companies which have been run by the Government, such as K.O.P., which was sold when it was profitable. Here is a company making aircraft under very favourable conditions of agreement with the Government, and it is now being taken over by the Government. What is the principle applied&#x003F; When a company run by the Government makes money is it sold, and when there is some doubt as to profitability, is it taken over&#x003F; I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to give us more information about the background, and particularly about the financial implications of the take-over of this company. I should like to ask him to what extent these aircraft are being manufactured, and to what extent they are merely being assembled. To what extent are the component parts imported&#x003F; It would be interesting to know, too, whether those components are imported directly from the suppliers or whether they are bought through other companies in South Africa. I would be interested to know what changes have been made since the take-over of the Atlas Company, for instance, changes in personnel, management, directorship, etc., because here we are voting vast sums of money. From the White Paper we see that aircraft alone accounted for R254.6 million out of the R660 million spent since 1960. It is a very large slice. We recognize that this is a very important and expensive item. Therefore I believe that we are entitled to ask for more details in regard to a deal of the magnitude of this one concerned with the assembly, and later, the building of aircraft. In fact, we have very little information, either in the White Paper or from other sources, on the progress of our own manufacture and the progress which has been made in becoming independent in regard to military supplies.</p>

<p>Another aspect which appears both from the White Paper and from the Budget, is the fact that we are spending something like two-thirds of the Budget this year on materials and equipment, and approximately one-third on manpower. That is roughly how it is made up. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether we are not perhaps spending, not necessarily unnecessary money, but money which in some instances could be diverted to strengthening the manpower position of our Defence Force. Is that ratio of tow to one vital&#x003F; Is it unavoidable&#x003F; If we have aeroplanes, for instance, fighters, highly specialized planes, and we do not have the pilots to fly them, those aeroplanes are not going to be of very much use to us. If we have specialized ships, submarines, etc., without the crews to sail them, they are not going to serve the purpose for which we are voting money in this Parliament. The White Paper itself&#x2014;and everyone knows it&#x2014;refers to the problem of staff. I am going to deal with that a little later under administration, but the White Paper refers to the rapid turnover of staff. Perhaps I should deal with it now. The position is that we have lost in officers alone over the last three years 385 in all arms of the service. In the Army we have lost through resignation alone 185, and from the Air Force 155. Unfortunately, most of those losses are occurring in the lower ranks, the younger people, upon whom the future of our force depends. These are the young men on whom a great deal of time and money is spent in training and from whom ultimately will have to come the leaders in 15 and 20 years time. If one looks at the reasons&#x2014;I do not want to deal with them in detail as I do not have time&#x2014;for persons in the leadership group leaving the forces, one finds that voluntary premature retirement and resignation are the two overwhelming factors. They are the two main reasons for people <span class="col_5211-5212" refersTo="page_1094"/>leaving the forces. I know that there have been changes in the resignation procedure and the commitment. But we are deeply concerned that we may, perhaps, be spending these vast sums of money on equipment and neglecting the men who are to use that equipment.</p>

<p>The White Paper refers, for instance, to housing. I welcome particularly the announcement of the decision to increase housing from 60 per cent to 100 per cent. I think that is an excellent step forward. It is one of the important factors in keeping our men in the forces. But if one looks at the Budget, and especially at the Loan Votes, one finds that there are, in fact, only two new projects introduced this year with regard to housing. These are two large flat projects. But in all the pages of other projects there are nominal votes of R50. There is a total of R4.7 million on the Budget this year for housing. But if we are going to achieve this ideal of 100 per cent housing, this has to be given a great deal more priority. Where we are prepared to spend R271 million this year, I feel that a greater amount than less than R5 million could have been devoted to that purpose. If the P.W.D. cannot build the houses, they should be built by contract; then they should be put out on contract, so that we can get them at a faster rate. We have the money; we are spending R270 million. Let us see to the urgent requirements of the men who are going to run our machinery. So, we welcome the policy decision. But, like so many decisions which are often taken, they are policy decisions which are going to be implemented over the years. This is one aspect of many aspects, with which other members on this side of the House will deal, which should, I believe, be tackled as a matter of urgent priority.</p>

<p>If there is another criticism of the White Paper, I would say that we should not try to slide over our difficulties. We still have many difficulties. Reading the White Paper, one tends to gain the impression that there are no serious problems really&#x2014;that&#x2014;they are only minor problems. There is a glib sliding over of the difficulties to which I believe we as a country should be facing. Some of those will be raised during this debate. I shall not deal with them specifically in relation to the White Paper, but in relation to the various points under which they arise.</p>

<p>Another matter which I wish to raise, in all humility, is a small point. But here we have a White Paper which is going to be distributed and will be read with interest, not only by our people in South Africa, but throughout the world. I feel that a little bit more attention could have been given to the translation of that White Paper into English. If one goes through it, one finds minor points throughout the White Paper idiomatic expressions, which are not common English usage, but have been translated literally. They spoil, I believe, what could otherwise have been a valuable impact on English-speaking nations that read this White Paper. There are no major glaring mistakes, but it is just a question of idiomatic usage.</p>

<p>I could mention that there are many instructions sent out which are not translated and which also, I believe, are wrong. Some call-up papers to English-speaking boys are entirely in one language, namely Afrikaans. I am merely appealing for a proper and full regard to be had to the equality of the two languages of South Africa. [Interjections.] If the verkramptes want to make a noise about it, let them make it. I stick by the Constitution of South Africa and the equality of our two languages. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to move on to a more pleasant matter. That is to express appreciation from this side of the House to the hon. the Minister and to the Service Chiefs for the close contact which they maintain with the defence groups of this House. Speaking on behalf of the Opposition, I appreciate very much indeed the manner in which I, as chairman, the secretary of the group and where it is practicable larger groups from the defence group, are brought into the picture on matters of interest and importance in our Defence. Not only is there close co-operation and discussion with the hon. the Minister, but also with the Service Chiefs of the different arms. I quote as an example, Sibasa, where we were invited to view these very important and I believe, for South Africa, very successful manoeuvres in the field. I believe there were many lessons to be learnt. I am not going to deal with them now. However, there were lessons to be learnt in regard to mobility, particularly to communications and above all, in regard to the fine co-operation received from the local Bantu people in the area. These are lessons which are vital to our future, particularly in the light of the threats that face South Africa. There was a missile launching regarding which I would like to express our congratulations as an Opposition. We congratulate all those concerned in having developed and launched successfully South Africa&#x2019;s first missile. I think this is a great effort. It reminded me that 11 years ago, in 1958, this matter was discussed in this House. At that time my colleague, then the member for Sunnyside, now an hon. Senator, raised the matter. He was told that he was absolutely dreaming and living in another world to talk of South Africa requiring guided missiles. I should like to congratulate all those who have been responsible for such a change in the thinking and the capabilities of South Africa in the intervening years. I think it is important that South Africa should know about this co-operation; that South Africa should know that in this field there is this cooperation between Government and Opposition. It is that sort of co-operation which helps to engender confidence amongst the people as a whole and, to create the spirit of a national approach from all our people towards the problems of defence. If we fight on some things, if I raise matters which upset hon. members, as I did just now, that is part of our task as an Opposition.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to another matter and I think that too will make hon. members cross. Last year the hon. the Minister attacked me on an issue I raised regarding certain motivation lectures at a military camp. He was supported in the Press. I do not begrudge him his moment of joy in embarrassing me. What I do want to say is that now, a year later, I can complete the chapter. I want to say that as a result of raising that matter, my objective was achieved. Firstly, I received confirmation from all over the country, from Zululand, from the South Coast, from the Transvaal, from East Griqualand and elsewhere, of the facts which I raised in this House. This was a political issue. I was charged by the hon. the Minister with not having gone to the O.C. of the camp and raising the matter there. I do not raise political issues with members of the Defence Force. My object was to stop what was going on. I received confirmation from a number of sources that those lecturers were immediately stopped. I want to quote one report. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">My son spent last week-end with us and says that after the report in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> the tone of the motivation lectures has changed. They now discuss the items they should have been discussing all along, i.e. current affairs and world events. The commandant and officers always pop into the lecture rooms for a while.</block>

<p>In other words, by raising the matter in this House, my objective was achieved, the evil was stopped, and I submit that I was entitled to do so. If the hon. the Minister had some fun out of it, all the better for him. He does not often get that opportunity in other fields of his responsibilities in these times in which we are living. I want to say that on many occasions I have been to the hon. the Minister or to Service Chiefs with problems. I would like to pay attribute to the immediate and the very effective action which has been taken in every case which I have raised. Problems are dealt with and investigated immediately. The problem is, of course, that my information is always given under a promise of secrecy and <span class="col_5215-5216" refersTo="page_1096"/>I am not prepared 3to break a promise of secrecy. These are young chaps who are naturally terrified if they are questioned. It has subsequently come to me that in some of the cases the very people who made the reports were questioned in the investigation. They pretended to know nothing about it, because they were afraid of being implicated. That is human nature; they are youngsters, they are scared. The fact is that I believe it is our duty to raise these matters when they come to us. If one cannot always get to the root of the problem, because of this fear, then it is unfortunate. I have on occasions been able to disclose the names. I had one case where I saw, subsequently, the sworn declaration by this lad completely denying that something had happened, while before and after he had signed the declaration, he and others assured me that it had in fact happened. One cannot force a man. Usually the information comes from the parents. It is just one of those problems. Therefore I say to the hon. the Minister that it is regrettable. I am sorry that it should happen, that issues are raised, complaints are made and they cannot be substantiated. As long as there is the present attitude of the heads towards following these matters up, then I believe it is our duty to bring them forward so that where wrong is being done, it can be put right.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with training. We are now in the second year of the new training scheme. It is a new scheme which was designed to overcome various problems. One of these problems was the alleged waste of time, particularly during the last three months of a trainee&#x2019;s time. The new scheme was going to provide additional C.F. instructors and eliminate that problem.</p>

<p>I want to say that the problem has not been eliminated and that from all sources we are getting the recurrent complaint that the first three months are fine, the second three months are often interesting but that the third three months&#x2019; training are in many cases a complete waste of time. These reports are so wide-spread that they simply cannot be ignored. The same applies to the Commando&#x2019;s, but other members will deal with that. I want to ask whether the time has not come that we should have another look at some of the problems which arise. The new idea of a camp every three years, spread over a period of ten years, is having unfortunate results. The one result is a loss of contact between the leadership and the manpower of the regiments, which has an effect on the regimental spirit. When officers and N.C.O.&#x2019;s only have a camp every three years they lose contact with their men. Many are transferred and there is a heavy wastage.</p>

<p>I feel that something has to be done about these two problems of the loss of contact and of the lack of spirit and particularly the wastage of time in the last three months. We must not wait too long until we get resentment or reaction against the training system. I feel that there are three things which could be done. Firstly, to eliminate the frustration of men kicking their heels during the last three months of training. Instead there should be more of the excellent field exercises and field work which, I would like to say, has improved tremendously in quantity and quality. The time spent in the field is the best part of training as regards teaching to the men the problems which they will have to face in war, on the ground and under the circumstances in which they are likely to be met. I think we must look at the period of service with the object of trying to telescope it. Thirdly, I want to repeat my appeal to the hon. the Minister to pay Citizens Force servicemen Permanent Force rates of pay for the subsequent camps which follow the first nine months. I am not arguing on the first nine months&#x2019; camp, but for the subsequent 26-day and 12-day camps I believe we should pay them the Permanent Force scales of pay. I believe that in addition employers could do a great deal more to make up the difference. We shall be having men, married and with responsibilities, men of 28 years of age with a wife and children, a flat or home and a car. They cannot afford this month during which they are only paid 50 cents a day. I should like to appeal to employers that after the Minister has taken the first step of paying them Permanent Force rates, they should make up the difference. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate the hon. member for Durban (Point) on one of the most positive speeches he has ever made in this House. It reminds me of the proverb, &#x201C;Hope springs eternal in the human breast.&#x201D; I wondered what had happened to the hon. member. Had the hon. the Minister perhaps emasculated him politically so that he was able to make a constructive contribution to this discussion&#x003F; However, I want to congratulate the hon. member on that speech, for it is the task and the duty of the Opposition to play its role as it did this afternoon, with the exception of one or two incidents. However, I do not know whether I can congratulate the hon. member on his new role as language purist, because I am afraid that if we were to go into that topic, we would find that the hon. member for Durban (Point) was more at fault in that respect than he alleged the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s White Paper was. Then I could perhaps refer to other aspects which, for the sake of convenience, I do not wish to mention here. However, the hon. member for Potchefstroom referred to this and said that he wondered what that hon. member had done in respect of this matter in his time when he himself held a military post. The hon. member tried to justify himself in regard to the matter he raised here last year. He made certain statements last year in regard to alleged political indoctrination at a training camp. The hon. member has now tried to justify himself, but I do not think he succeeded in doing so.</p>

<p><span class="col_5217-5218" refersTo="page_1097"/>I think the hon. member has learnt a lesson, and that is why he was quite tame to-day.</p>

<p>Now that hon. member says, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be silly,&#x201D; but has he seen the comment on his speech in a newspaper which normally supports his party&#x003F; That newspaper, i.e. the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 2nd June, 1968, said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Vause Raw, M.P., read a letter in Parliament this week. It was from a young Defence Force trainee who complained of &#x201C;violently anti-English&#x201D; motivation lectures given to trainees.</block>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Defence, in reply, asked Mr. Raw whether he had checked the letter against the facts.</block>

<block name="quote">Apparently Mr. Raw had not; and the Minister, quite correctly in my view, was able to claim that he had no proper charge to answer.</block>

<block name="quote">Why did Mr. Raw not check the letter against the facts&#x003F; Surely the abuse complained of was sufficiently serious to warrant a thorough investigation; and in any event, what weight can one attach to a letter from an unnamed person whose claim to fame is that he is (according to Mr. Vause Raw) &#x201C;neither a liberal nor a crank&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Even the Press which supported him, reprimanded him in this respect. I just want to point out to the hon. member that his defence &#x2014;i.e. that he does not, as he says, raise political matters with military commanders and persons&#x2014;does not hold water, because he does not raise it there for the very reason that he wants to make political capital out of it here. He sought out this very place in order to make political capital out of it. With these few words I believe that the hon. member has now advanced to greater maturity, and that he will now keep to the fine tone he adopted here to-day. Consequently I wish to support the hon. member in the congratulations he extended to the hon. the Minister on the White Paper. There is in fact certain information which is not contained in this White Paper, but in my opinion this information cannot be proclaimed from the rooftops, and I am sure that he will be able to obtain this information from the Minister in person.</p>

<p>I should also like to say here that this White Paper is to us as South Africans a source of faith and courage for the future in so far as it concerns the security of our country. I say this, because to-day it is not only possible for us, on all sides of this House and in the country as well, to discuss the defence of our country, which is dear to us, but our common source of pride is also evident from this White Paper. This White Paper testifies to the vigorous manner in which our Defence Force is being built up in recent times. It testifies to devotedness from the ministerial level down to every member of the Defence Force; in other words, those who are in the Permanent Force as well as those serving in a temporary capacity in the Citizen Force and the Commandos. It testifies to the dedication and the determination to ensure the security of our country.</p>

<p>I want to mention very briefly a few points which are apparent from this White Paper. I want to deal first with the progress we have made over the past year. In the first place, I am thinking of the establishment of Armcor. I believe that as far as our defence is concerned, the establishment of this Armament Corporation will prove to be of as much importance as, or perhaps of even greater importance than the establishment of Iscor was on the relevant occasion to our steel industry and our industrial development in general. This corporation affords us the assurance that we shall to a large extent become independent of those countries which do not want to admit our role in the defence of the Western world and which, under pressure, have failed to provide us with the necessary weapons. As a single and a small token of our pride in that Armaments Corporation, I want to mention the fact that in this week we were shown the first South African manufactured sports rifle, which is also an adaptation made by that factory, a rifle which is still in the experimental stage but which in my opinion will in years to come become the pride of South Africa. We are a nation which is fond of going in for rifle shooting. This rifle will to my mind become a symbol of the achievements of our Armaments Corporation. I also want to mention that in the past year we have had the take-over by Armcor of the Atlas Aircraft Corporation, to which the hon. member for Durban (Point) referred, a take-over which gives us the assurance that in respect of aircraft spare parts and eventually the provision of aircraft, we are going to become independent of overseas countries. In addition I want to mention the opening of a rocket-launching range of our own in Natal. I do not think there can be a single South African who does not feel proud of and grateful for the achievements of our scientists in developing that weapon and the fact that we have reached the stage where we can also be self-sufficient as far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to the launching, earlier this year, of the first submarine which will be added to our Navy. In conjunction with that I want to refer to the commencement of work on the project Advocate which will include new navy headquarters and an international radio communication system, which will, after that of America, be the greatest in the world. I want to refer to the purchases that have been announced of a whole series of new aircraft for our Air Force; I want to refer to the success of our Navy&#x2019;s visit to Australia following on a visit to the Argentine in the previous year, and the favourable comment received from those countries. I want to refer to the contact there has been in the past year between <span class="col_5219-5220" refersTo="page_1098"/>the Defence Chiefs of friendly countries and us in South Africa. One calls to mind the visit of General Rebelo, the Portuguese Minister of Defence, the visit this week of the Argentine Naval Chief of Staff, Admiral Gnavi, and also the visit of the hon. the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of our Defence Force to Portugal earlier this year. A picture of friendly co-operation between the S.A Defence Force and the defence forces of favourably disposed countries emerges from these visits, a picture which is in direct contrast with the stories we heard a few years ago to the effect that South Africa was now isolated and without friends and that, as regards defence, she could not rely on assistance from anybody.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is not my intention to reply now to all the points raised by the hon. member for Durban (Point); I shall do so on a later occasion. My actual purpose in rising is to make certain communications to the House which I think are necessary to make the discussion go smoothly. However, I just want to refer in passing to one or two points raised by the hon. member for Durban (Point). I am doing this at an early stage because I am afraid that wrong impressions might be created outside in the country. I want to begin by thanking the hon. member for the spirit in which he introduced the debate. I also want to thank him for the fact that he stated very clearly and firmly that this House was agreed on the broad principles of defence policy. I think this can only be to our benefit in the world, it can only benefit us in our relationships with friends, and it can only benefit us in our relationships with those who do not want to be our friends, and I thank him for that. I also thank him for the fact that he made it very clear that there were no drastic differences between us in regard to broad planning and broad policy. But the hon. member makes one mistake: instead of keeping to that level, he always comes along with one pr two waspish little things that have nothing to do with sound criticism. I told the hon. member last year that I welcomed criticism, but then it must be criticism which is based on facts. The hon. member again proved here to-day that his statements are not founded on established facts. The hon. member has received a number of little letters in which boys wrote to their parents that this, that and the other had allegedly happened. These are not the kind of facts one should bring before this House. Hearsay gives rise to many lies. What did I tell the hon. member last year when he raised that point about lectures&#x003F; I told him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member brought that letter to this House to come and read it out here, without having previously discussed the contents thereof either with me, or with the Commandant-General, or with the commander concerned in order to make sure whether the facts contained in that letter were correct. Oh no! After all, this was a marvellous letter with which the hon. member could make propaganda here.</block>

<p>I did not say that the hon. member should go to the commanding officer in the first place. I said he could discuss it with me or with the Commandant-General. Now the hon. member again read a letter to us in which it is said that as a result of articles that had appeared in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> a change had been introduced. I want to tell the hon. member this afternoon that neither I nor the Defence Force will allow ourselves to be ruled by the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Let him understand this clearly.</p>

The hon. member brought forward a case this year in which he, without wanting to mention names, charged one of our young officers with us of having acted sadistically towards a trainee.

I therefore say to the hon. member and to any other member that the Defence Force is not a football that one can kick around as one likes; it is a sensitive instrument and therefore, when hon. members lodge complaints, they should not do so on the strength of gossip that finds its way to them; they must raise such matters on the strength of facts which they possess. This latest thing the hon. member brought up is an insulting allegation against a young officer who has been cleared of all blame.

<p>I repeat that I want to thank the hon. member for the fine spirit in which he began his speech, but he must not spoil his case with this kind of thing. Neither must he believe everything that a few trainees come and tell him, because a trainee who is a man&#x2014;and most of them are&#x2014;has no complaints against the Defence Force.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the question of the discrepancy, as he called it, between what is spent on the staff and what is spent on equipment. I shall reply to the other points on another occasion, because this may also create a wrong impression. But I just want to say this to the hon. member: I have here a list of price increases that must be taken into account when the White Paper is judged. The price of the R.1 rifle increased by 104.2 per cent from 1960 to 1968; the price of the 8 mm. mortar increased by 105 per cent; the price of the armoured car &#x201C;VA 60 complete&#x201D; increased by 45 per cent; the price of the Mirage aeroplane increased by 52.6 per cent in one year&#x2019;s time, between 1964 and 1965; the price of the Land Rover increased by 29.3 per cent; and the price of 25 pounder ammunition increased by 435 per cent; and I can mention many other examples. When dealing with a Defence Budget, one must take into account the fact that it just so happens that in the case of these sophisticated armaments one has the problem that price increases are taking place throughout the world. This complicates the problem of achieving a balanced defence pattern.</p>

<p>I said that the other points mentioned by the hon. member I would deal with at a later stage. I do not want to send the debate in a different direction now. I should like to make use of this opportunity to make three announcements.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In the first place I want to make a statement on a new weapons system that South Africa has been able to acquire.</p>

<p>In conformity with the Government&#x2019;s policy of aiming at the greatest degree of self-sufficiency in the field of weapons manufacture, it was decided some years ago to make an early start on our own development and manufacture of guided weapons.</p>

<p>With this aim in view it was decided to embark on a project which would serve the triple purpose of training a nucleus of South African engineers and scientists in the mechanical, electronic and chemical aspects of guided weapons, of developing and manufacturing a useful weapon for the South African Defence Force, and of establishing the necessary industrial manufacturing know-how and capacity. Systems for defence against air attack have achieved notable success in the medium and high altitude brackets, i.e. up to the 10.000 ft. and 60,000 ft. levels, but, until recently, the very low altitudes had been poorly catered for, mainly because of technological problems associated with developing an effective guided weapon defence system against low-level attacks.</p>

<p>As this appeared to be an attractive field in which to launch our own guided weapons development project, the S.A. Defence Force in conjunction with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research drew up specifications for research into and development of a mobile ground to air guided weapon system for defence against low-level air attacks. It was decided that the weapon-system had to comply with the following broad requirements: (a) to have an all-weather capability; (b) to provide defence against attack by supersonic aircraft at tree-top level; (c) to be mobile with a crosscountry capability comparable to that of the average military vehicle, and to be air transportable. (d) to be capable of going into action within five minutes on the march, with a reaction time of a few seconds; (e) to be capable of integration into other air defence systems, both conventional and sophisticated; (f) to have its own tactical and fire guidance radar and computer capability; (g) to be capable of defending static points as well as tactical formations on the move.</p>

<p>These specifications were accepted by the Government.</p>

<p>We have been fortunate in obtaining the services of a reputable overseas French electronics firm, as well as a number of subcontractors, for assistance in the training, research, and development tasks involved in this venture. The project was also officially approved and partly financed by the French Government and as such has proved to be a happy example of fruitful international co-operation.</p>

<p>Preliminary firing tests have proved a great success and we have reason to believe that the system will comply fully with the stringent specifications set at the start. Once in operation, we believe that the Republic of South Africa will have at its disposal the most advanced and effective Weapon of its kind in existence for the purpose of fulfilling the most <span class="col_5223-5224" refersTo="page_1100"/>difficult task of defence against fast low-level air attacks. The system is mounted on a number of electrically driven wheeled vehicles which are in themselves a novel departure from normal military vehicles. The whole system is air transportable.</p>

<p>Developments are now nearing the production stage, and the Armaments Board is already engaged in the task of setting up in South Africa the necessary production facilities. Endeavours are being made to recoup a portion of the research and development expenditure by sales to other countries. The interest shown is very encouraging.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our engineers and scientists have completed their training overseas and returned to South Africa. Immediately after their return a second project for the development of an air-to-air projectile was approved, as a purely South African venture. This weapon too embodies some unique characteristics and was recently successfully tested on our own missile testing range at St. Lucia Lake, where hon. members were present. It is now also nearing the production stage.</p>

<p>That our approach to the problem of the manufacture of guided missiles has been sound is proved by the fact that the Armaments Board has made considerable progress towards the establishment of an industrial capacity for the manufacture of highly sophisticated weapons systems in South Africa. Our scientists and engineers have acquired sufficient knowledge and experience in a number of related technological aspects to enable us to proceed with further independent research, testing and development, for which the missile test range at St. Lucia Lake is an invaluable asset.</p>

<p>I thought it was only right to inform the House of the progress made in this regard.</p>

<p>*Then I should like to make a second announcement with reference to the manpower position that was referred to here: I can now inform hon. members that as part of the endeavour to alleviate the shortage in the private ranks of the Permanent Force, an inquiry was recently instituted by my Department in close collaboration with experts of the office of the Public Service Commission into the possible improvement in the salary structure of private ranks. Certain proposals arising from this inquiry have recently been approved. The most important improvements can briefly be summarized as follows.</p>

<p>The following improved salary scales are to be introduced for non-artisans, operatives and artisans&#x2014;</p>

<p>The existing salary scales of technicians remain unchanged for the time being until an inter-departmental evaluation of the posts concerned has been completed. The present minimum salary of R1,020 for matriculants is increased to R1,200 per annum. An instructor&#x2019;s allowance of R120 per annum is payable to all private instructors in order to compensate them for their training responsibilities and long and irregular hours of service. This represents a substantial improvement in that all privates, irrespective of their trade classification, now have the prospect of being able to advance to R4,200 per annum, and we trust that these improvements will contribute to our obtaining the services of trained privates for the Permanent Force. Particulars of the salary adjustments to the new scale will be released within the Department by the Chief of Personnel as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>I now come to the increase in the flying allowances. In order to ensure that suitable volunteers will be available in sufficient numbers for flight training to meet the needs of the S.A. Air Force in respect of pilots and navigators every year, and at the same time to retain the services of trained pilots and navigators for the Air Force by means of attractive conditions of service, an increase in the special allowance payable to pilots and navigators has been recommended by the Public Service Commission and approved by Treasury with effect from 1st April, 1969. Whereas this allowance has up to the present been R300, R600 and R450 per annum for pupil pilots and navigators, second lieutenant to major, and commandant and higher, respectively, it will be as follows with effect from 1st April, 1969&#x2014;</p>

<p>The flying allowance of aircrew (other ranks) is still under consideration and will be announced shortly.</p>

<p>Up to now a staff qualification allowance has been payable to officers of the Permanent <span class="col_5225-5226" refersTo="page_1101"/>Force up to and including the rank of commandant who have completed an approved staff service course. This allowance fell away at promotion to the rank of colonel, but will now be continuous to the rank of general. The allowance amounts to R270 for officers with the rank of colonel and higher and will be payable with effect from 1st April, 1969.</p>

<p>I think as a result of this we have taken a step forward which will be of considerable assistance as regards our manpower position, and which will not only do this, but will also meet with great satisfaction in the Defence Force. I regard this as a major step forward.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me about the question of Atlas. In respect of Atlas we have already made a statement through Armcor. I could not furnish any information earlier because one cannot furnish information while one is busy with negotiations, and protracted negotiations took place between Atlas and Armcor under the leadership of the chairman of Armcor, Professor Samuels. I want to make use of this opportunity to-day to thank him for the contribution made by him and the able manner in which he made it.</p>

<p>The objects and the general powers of the corporation are very clearly stated in section 3 of the Act, i.e. to provide the armaments requirements of the Republic in as efficient and economic a way as possible. And in section 3 (a) reference is made to the take-over of undertakings of the Armaments Board for the manufacture of armaments. Now the hon. member asked me what the reasons for the take-over were. The reasons for the take-over of the shareholding in Atlas were briefly that the Air Force has until now been the only consumer, and will always remain the largest consumer. In the second place, the motive of Armcor is not profit, and as a result of the take-over the profit is now being saved for the State. In other words, because the profit motive has now disappeared, it must necessarily have an effect on the cost. In the third place, Atlas has facilities which can be utilized very effectively for the manufacture of other highly strategic armaments, for example, rockets. Otherwise this would have meant a duplication of certain facilities. This further proposed manufacture is of such a nature that it is necessary for it to be under the full control of the State.</p>

<p>In this connection I also want to tell hon. members that I have great appreciation for the people who established Atlas years ago at a time when South Africa could virtually get no assistance outside its borders to maintain a proper Defence Force. I want to express my appreciation for the people who under the leadership of a man like Dr. Tienie Louw took those steps. The establishment of our own aircraft industry was undoubtedly a very important breakthrough for South Africa, and its importance cannot easily be overrated. I think that only in the years to come, in 10 or 15 years&#x2019; time, will we really enjoy the fruits of what has been established at Atlas. We should not have the least doubt about the fact that there are difficulties involved and that teething troubles are being experienced. The hon. member said here that we were glossing over our difficulties in the White Paper, but that is not correct. We admit in the White Paper that we have difficulties and I want to admit it too. But difficulties are there to be overcome. That is why they come in one&#x2019;s way and I believe that we have the managerial ability to cope with those difficulties.</p>

<p>Except for the major and important task of keeping the aircraft of the S.A. Air Force in the air, great progress has been made with our own manufacture since the establishment of Atlas. With the know-how that has already been acquired, South Africa will in the foreseeable future&#x2014;I cannot say how soon&#x2014;be capable of undertaking virtually the complete manufacture. If the Armaments Development and Manufacturing Corporation had already existed at the time when serious thought had to be given to establishing an aircraft industry of our own, it would undoubtedly not have been done in that way. You yourself know that we received a series of reports which were made known and were also discussed with members from time to time, namely the Verster Commission reports, from which it appeared that it would be best if eventually in South Africa not only the present set-up of armaments manufacture were established, but also the system of procurement of armaments, cost control and quality control, which we have under our present dispensation. In other words, if Armco had existed earlier on, Atlas would most probably have been established as a subsidiary thereof. As a result of the negotiations which took place over the past few months, it was agreed that Armcor would take over the entire shareholding of 14&#x00BD; million shares of R1 each at par. I should like to stress that although Atlas showed an accumulated profit, the shares were taken over without any premium.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That may be, but the State is just as dependent on Atlas&#x2019;s factory to keep its Air Force in the air. As you probably know, the new board of directors of Atlas has been announced, and has had a meeting since. Mr. V. R. Verster is the chairman. He is the person who carried out all these investigations during the past few years in respect of the Defence Force and in respect of armaments. Furthermore, the board of directors consists of the following members: Dr. S. Kuschke of the I.D.C. Mr. J. E. K. Tucker of Vekor, Mr. Tony Trollip, on account of his knowledge of the Companies Act, Mr. L. W. Dekker, accountant and auditor, Dr. W. de Villiers, a very well-known engineer, Mr. C. F. Hafele, an engineer and general manager of Armcor, and Mr. F. S. Malan, <span class="col_5227-5228" refersTo="page_1102"/>an engineer, who will continue as Managing Director. The possibility of appointing another two or three able and experienced persons to the board of directors is being considered. I am going into this matter in consultation with Armcor. I have already appointed a representative committee which has to investigate and report upon certain matters. This committee consists of representatives of the Armaments Board, of Armcor itself, of Atlas and of the Air Force. This committee must as soon as possible investigate possibilities of entrusting Atlas with an even bigger load in respect of various strategic requirements. As soon as the recommendations have been considered and accepted, the implementation thereof will be proceeded with immediately in order to ensure that Atlas will be able to operate in the most economic way. Under the leadership of the chairman of Armcor negotiations are at present taking place between Armcor and certain undertakings which I cannot mention today, which are manufacturing strategic items for the South African Defence Force, with a view to possible participation by Armcor, as stated in the object of the Act by which Armcor was established. As these negotiations have not yet been finalized, particulars can, for understandable reasons, not be furnished to the House at this stage. We are implementing an Act that was passed by this Parliament. It was supported by both sides of the House, and is aimed at placing South Africa, by means of its Armaments Board and by means of Armcor, on a road which must lead to the greatest measure of self-sufficiency. This is what we have tried to achieve in this connection.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not going to delay the House more than two or three minutes. I had no intention of coming into this debate, until the hon. the Minister spoke just now. I heard what he had to say to my colleague, the hon. member for Durban (Point), in regard to complaints which are brought to him and his department and which, on investigation, are found to have no substance or no evidence to support them. Because I seem to recognize certain circumstances which were described by the Minister. I asked the hon. member whether the case referred to was in fact one which I had brought to his notice. He assured me that it was. Under the circumstances I think it is only fair, and I am sure that the Minister will agree with me that I should indicate that this case was brought to the notice of the hon. member for Durban (Point) by me. The hon. member is therefore not in a position to disclose the name of the complainant in this matter. I withheld that name, and I explained to the hon. member at the time that I was not prepared to disclose the name. I may say that I made all the investigations I could possibly make amongst the young men concerned. I am more than satisfied with the inquiry which took place. That there was no evidence to support this complaint is a matter of the very greatest concern to me. All the details regarding the people concerned in this inquiry, the senior members of staff in the Defence Force who took part in the inquiry, the manner in which it was conducted, etc., were explained to me. I have no complaints. In fact, I have nothing but the highest praise for the manner in which the inquiry was carried out. My one regret is that all that should have taken place, because the young men concerned, for their own reasons, which I am not going to go into, decided that they were going to say nothing whatever which was going to incriminate the person against whom the complaints had been made in the first place. I can merely assure the hon. the Minister that this had nothing whatever to do with the hon. member for Durban (Point).</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) is the chairman of our defence group and therefore, in conformity with ordinary practice, I referred the case to him. I am, however, not free to disclose the names of the complainants in this matter. There was not only one complainant. There the matter unfortunately rests, but I want to see the Minister about another matter altogether. This is not a made-up case. This is a matter of fact. I intend to see the Minister. I shall put certain points before him, and he may tell me that they are wrong. Nevertheless, I want to have the right to approach the Minister and to say to him: This is information that has come to me, partly from the public and partly from another source altogether. I want to ask him what the position in regard to these points is. I want the hon. the Minister to realize that he must leave the door open for even anonymous complaints which are groundless if he wants to be sure of receiving the complaints which have substance. He may get frivolous complaints from time to time, and so may his staff, but if he is going to close the door to complaints which may finally prove to be fruitless or groundless, he will also close the door to those people who have substance in their complaints. There are from time to time very good reasons why peonie will not dislcose their identity in regard to matters of this nature. I should, however. like the Minister to accept the fact that he has to accept our <i>bona fides</i> in the matter. My colleague and I are senior members of this Parliament. We are front benchers, and we are not going to approach him with complaints which we have investigated and found to be frivolous. When we have satisfied ourselves to the best of our ability that there appears to be substance in a complaint, we must ask for the privilege of having the Minister&#x2019;s door open to us. He must accept our <i>bona fides</i> in this regard. If the Minister, after investigating our complaints, finds them to be groundless, he must not stand up in Parliament and charge us with having brought a <span class="col_5229-5230" refersTo="page_1103"/>frivolous complaint to him. What will he close the door to&#x003F; I think that that will not be the right approach. We are willing to help the Minister, and my colleague has said so. We are just as keenly interested in the well-being of the Defence Force of South Africa as anybody on that side of the House is. Here, as my hon. friend has said, we stand together as one Parliament, and we are unanimous in our decision to support our Defence Force. I know that complaints will come. I have been in the Army, and I know exactly how the machine works. Nobody can tell me about how the machine works. I have been a rookie, and I have been much higher up in the scale. I have taken the knocks there from the time I started until I got out. I therefore know exactly how the machine works. I appeal to the Minister: Do not close your door to complaints which come to you if they come from responsible persons. That is the test. If the complaint comes from a responsible person, I should like the Minister to open his door. I am going to ask him to open it to me in the course of the next few days, when he has this Vote behind him. This relates to a matter which I do not wish to raise across the floor of the House.</p>

As far as I am concerned, I must tender my apologies and regret for the need for that inquiry, and for the fact that it was fruitless. I should like to thank the Minister and his staff for the manner in which the inquiry was carried out.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall most definitely accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the hon. member for South Coast in this case but it was clear to everyone that the hon. professor for Durban (Point) was again going to come up against the Minister at some time or other. It happened last year when he started with the United Party story of the meeting at Voortrekkerhoogte. Last year the same thing happened with regard to the piece of gossip to which reference was made here and which was used by the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Now another senior member, the hon. member for South Coast, has been placed in an embarrassing position in that he has had to help the hon. member from his predicament this afternoon. I hope the hon. member for Durban (Point) has learned his lesson this afternoon so that he will no longer come to this House with matters of that kind but will make use of the right channels. I cannot see why he should always be experiencing problems. All of us who are members of this House, receive complaints about the Defence Force, but we know what the right channels are. We then go through the right channels. But the hon. member comes to this House with his letters and raises matters here for the first time. As a result the kind of situation which embarrassed him this afternoon arises. [Interjections.] If I should have the opportunity to do so at a later stage, I should like to come back to the lesson in Afrikaans which the hon. member gave here this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer to the announcement made here this afternoon by the hon. the Minister, especially the announcement concerning our <span class="col_5231-5232" refersTo="page_1104"/>armaments and extensions in the field of armaments, i.e. the particularly important announcement with regard to the missile which has been developed further.</p>

<p>I should like to refer in brief to the opening paragraph of the White Paper, which to me cannot be more appropriate, i.e. the following statement by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For those who want to listen I want to say that South Africa is not building a Defence Force to attack anybody. It is aimed only at safeguarding and protecting that which is lawfully ours. We threatened nobody but are very much aware of being threatened. We wish to attack no one but we will also not suffer being attacked and occupied with impunity.</block>

<p>Earlier in the week it was said here that somebody had a screw loose, but one thing is sure, if anybody should try to trouble us in future, he would have more than a screw loose, because he would be struck by a strong arm which our Defence Force is developing.</p>

<p>Another aspect to which I should like to refer as well, is the salary increases announced by the Minister. The Defence Force staff forms the corps of instructors. They are the people who concentrate the entire fireworks of the Defence Force on them. They are the men who undertake training year after year, some of them for a lifetime. Whereas the ordinary young men liable to military service have to put up, for a period of one year, with the measure of inconvenience which arises from their training, members of the Permanent Force staff do so year after year. They are the people who work long hours of overtime, day after day and year after year, who sacrifice week-ends and who are informed at short notice that they cannot be given leave for certain occasions because something else has to be done urgently. They are the people who give the trainees their field training and who share the uncomfortable and inconvenient circumstances in the field with the trainees. They are the people who have to compensate the wear and tear of clothing and uniforms partially from their own pockets. The large increases announced by the hon. the Minister will most definitely be received with a great deal of gratitude and a great deal of enthusiasm by the members of the Defence Force who are affected by those increases. It is interesting to note that a Warrant Officer Class I will now receive a bigger salary than an M.P. Perhaps there will again be improvements in this direction as well in the future.</p>

<p>I should also like to make particular reference to the White Paper which was published. The difficulty with which the hon. the Minister is confronting us in this debate is that such a fine and detailed White Paper has been published, one which contains so many particulars and which is so full of dynamic and positive planning, that it is completely impossible for one to do justice to that White Paper and to comment properly on it within ten minutes. When one consults this White Paper and moves about a little amongst the Defence Force men, one thing strikes one and that is that the morale in our Defence Force has never been as high as it is at present.</p>

Hon. members opposite would like to speak on Defence matters. If only they want to take the trouble to move about a little amongst these people! They need only go to the commandos if they want to do so. They will learn from the commandos that people who did service before and ceased to be members of the Force, are streaming back to the commandos to do voluntary service. These people are not supporters of the United Party who left the Force because they were upset with the hon. Mr. Erasmus.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your assistance. It is very plain to see how sensitive hon. members opposite are when one starts pulling their ears. As regards the morale of the Defence Force, I want to say in conclusion that the morale of any Defence Force is as high as that of its Minister and its Supreme Command. It is due to this vital Minister, Commandant-General and Supreme Command we have to-day that our Defence Force is in this condition to-day. That is why it is possible to publish a White Paper informing us of what is being done by these people, and of the scale on which that is being done.</p>

<p><span class="col_5233-5234" refersTo="page_1105"/>Another important factor which hon. members of the Opposition obviously overlook when they so eagerly sit and pass remarks, is that the stronger the Defence Force of a country is and the more a country is capable of defending itself, the stronger a guarantee that is for a sound economy in that country. This we must never overlook. Since we are spending these large amounts of money, that is one of the strongest factors in support of the economy of our country. Surely it is very essential for us to note the kind of planning which flows from the White Paper. Let us examine the increases. The increase in the Permanent Force alone was an increase of 65 per cent over the past few years. The numbers of the Citizen Force increased virtually six-fold and those of the commandos by approximately 18 per cent. As regards the increase in expenditure, expenditure on the Department of Defence constituted 0.9 per cent of the gross national expenditure in 1960-&#x2019;61. This year, 1968-&#x2019;69, the figure is 2.5 per cent. In 1960- &#x2019;61 it constituted 6.6 per cent of the State&#x2019;s total expenditure from the Revenue Account; this year the figure is 16.8 per cent. Therefore one is grateful that planning is being undertaken in this way and that an account of such planning is given to this House.</p>

<p>I do not want to comment again on what was said about Armcor, but I just want to say that I, too, was fortunate enough to be able to attend the launching of the rocket at St. Lucia last year and to share in that historic occasion. I should also like to associate myself with the congratulations which were extended and the gratitude which was expressed to all the scientists, technicians and officers who were concerned in that project and who have made it possible for us to have progressed such a long way already in that field to-day. I should also like to refer in brief to the Sibasa exercise and the opportunity we were given from this side of the House to attend that exercise.</p>

<p>Before my time expires, I should like to mention another matter in respect of which I shall be very pleased if the hon. the Minister can let us have his comments at a later stage in this debate. This matter is the girls&#x2019; unit, which was announced by the hon. the Minister some time ago, but which still was in the planning stages, and for which a suitable site and area had to be found. I have already discussed the matter with the Department, but I should like to mention it once more in this House to-day. In my opinion there is no more suitable place at which to establish this girls&#x2019; unit than Potchefstroom. [Interjections.] I regret that no hon. member opposite has a place like this to offer for the girls&#x2019; unit, but Potchefstroom is a national constituency, one which is pre-eminently suitable for such a training centre. In Potchefstroom this training centre for girls can be linked up with the university. The teachers&#x2019; college is situated on a site adjacent to the military camp and adjacent to the Dam, the recreation centre there. It is an ideal cultural centre for the training of these children. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Potchefstroom has spoken of the high morale in the Army. He said that it had never been so high. I am certainly not going to decry the morale of the Army at the present time. But I will say that when he says that it has never been so high, he is making a very sweeping statement.</p>

<p>I should like to make a few observations on the announcements the Minister made here this afternoon. The first one concerns the announcement of the development and manufacture of the new weapon system. I think it is a source of pride to every South African to know that we in this country are able to tackle the design, development and manufacture of this very highly technical kind of equipment. I think it is a good thing for all of us to know that. I think it is also a good thing for our enemies to know what South Africa can do.</p>

<p>The second announcement the hon. the Minister made, in regard to improved scales of pay, I think will be universally welcomed by the members of the Forces. Without having had an opportunity to study those improvements in detail, it would appear that they are in fact very good. All one can say is that when we are dealing with the Defence Force to-day where you require such highly trained technical people, improved and good salaries are, and should always be a must. You cannot recruit the type of person you require in the Army to-day or retain him unless you pay him well. I am quite sure that these improvements will go a long way towards remedying the shortage of men, especially in the Permanent Force. You know, Mr. Chairman, listening to the announcement in regard to improved pay, I was thinking whether it would not be worth my while to try and ask the Minister to have me back. I think I will do better there than I am doing here. I see the hon. the Minister is smiling.</p>

<p>The third announcement I think was a very timely one. I say so, because al sorts of allegations and unpleasant rumours are going around about Atlas over the last couple of years. We sincerely hope that the steps they have taken now to bring a change and to put the factory on a different footing, will put an end to all these unpleasant stories that we hear. One must expect, as the hon. the Minister quite rightly pointed out, that when you start a new industry like that, something quite new to South Africa, that there will be growing pains. There will be difficulties. So we only hope that the new steps that he has in mind will to a certain extent overcome those difficulties.</p>

<p>Reference has been made by various speakers to the White Paper. I have studied the White Paper and I found that it is a most interesting and informative document. Reading through it one cannot but come to the conclusion that, if all this is correct, all must be <span class="col_5235-5236" refersTo="page_1106"/>well in the Defence Force. There is only one question that worries me, and that is whether all we read and see in there can, in fact, be implemented.</p>

<p>That brings me to the question of the training of the men, from the lowest to the highest rank, men who are to handle our equipment, our fighting formations and the various units that we may have. As was mentioned by the hon. member for Durban (Point), the new training scheme has been in operation for approximately two years. There is no doubt about it that it is not as yet running smoothly. It is not running as we visualized it would run at the time the legislation was passed. As was mentioned previously, I think all of us, and both sides of the House, get very much the same sort of complaints, namely that of a waste of time, especially in the latter part of a soldier&#x2019;s training. Some of these complaints are quite ridiculous. I received a complaint the other day from a young permanent naval rating. He did his training at Simonstown where he got so fed-up that he eventually could not stick it any longer. He told me that his time was taken up by polishing brass and all that sort of nonsense. I straightaway took up the case but before I could follow it up and trace this man, I found that he had deserted.</p>

<p>He may have been that type. One cannot take notice of these individual complaints, but complaints are there that there is a waste of manpower. This points to the fact that there are not sufficiently trained and experienced personnel in the branches of the Service to train these people properly. There is another point that we must remember and that is, whether we like it or not, that the military service to-day is unpopular with most of the boys. It is popular with some of the parents, because when a young man has been through his military training, he is a better man. Many parents realize that. To those people military service training, as. we do it to-day, is popular. But there are very many other parents who maintain that it is a waste of time. They want their son to go to university. They want their children to start on the farms. They want them to go into commerce, and so forth. I think with the rank and file the feeling is that military training is not popular.</p>

<p>It is not popular. The average young man does not see the threats or the dangers facing South Africa. He thinks that these people are just scaremongering and that this training is not necessary. The economy is buoyant and they can find a job outside the moment they leave school. When they come to the Army they have to work for very much less. Those are the reasons why the military service we expect from our young people to-day is unpopular.</p>

<p>I do not think it is fair for anybody at this stage to condemn the training scheme. I do not think it has had a long enough trial period. I am wondering whether it is not time to start giving attention to an alternative. In this respect I am thinking of a Permanent Force Brigade, a composite brigade with all its supporting arms and services. I know that I will be told at once that it is not even possible to fill all the posts in the present Permanent Force. I know there is a shortage. This is, however, merely an idea. Such a unit will be very highly trained and will be very much more effective than the training which we given these other young people. It will also be flexible; it will be trained to a very high degree of efficiency. These people can have their equipment up to date, they could be at home with their equipment, they will know how to handle their equipment. It has ever so many advantages. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to know in which respect that hon. member who represents North Rand and farms in my constituency and goes on holiday during the recess, has contact with the youth so that he can say they are not enthusiastic about the Defence Force&#x003F; However, I leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>With the introduction of the White Paper, one thinks with great sadness this afternoon of the previous Minister of Defence, Advocate Frans Erasmus, who has since passed away. It does one&#x2019;s heart good to see how all these matters which he initiated, have grown and developed until they have reached the stage to-day which he had been planning from 1948 to 1959. In fact, this White Paper is a major tribute to his memory. On page 5 of the White Paper we find the following paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The potential of the commando force will be fully utilized by adapting their equipment, training and organization to their inherent task. They should not be regarded as a second Citizen Force, but rather as groups organized on a military basis whose first task it is to ensure the immediate and continuous protection of their own home regions.</block>

<p>This is, <i>inter alia,</i> precisely how Advocate Erasmus viewed this matter. I mention this because a particularly great responsibility rests on the shoulders of the commanding officers of our commandos to-day. I am thinking of those leaders of the Commando Force who, as my hon. colleague for Potchefstroom has said, are taking great pains and are sacrificing <span class="col_5237-5238" refersTo="page_1107"/>their spare time, etc., while they receive only a very small commanding officer&#x2019;s allowance from which, among other things, administrative costs in respect of the commandos have to be defrayed. I should like to advance a plea to-day on behalf of the commanding officers of the Commando Force for this allowance to be increased in the light of the greater responsibilities they carry. Also, I should not like to see a portion of this allowance go back into the pocket of the Receiver of Revenue. Such allowance should not be assessed by the Receiver of Revenue. I also want to plead that the adjutants and the quartermasters of the Commando Forces be paid a proper remuneration. More duties have been assigned to them as well and they have to spend much of their spare time in organizing the commandos. In fact, they are the pivots on which everything hinges. These people should also be paid a proper remuneration for the valuable service they render during their spare time. Mention is also made in the White Paper that the commandos are of the utmost importance as far as protection of their own home regions is concerned. Since the commandos are so essentially important, I want to plead that the Department of Defence, in co-operation with the local authority, should provide facilities to serve as headquarters of the commando in the main town of the area in which it operates. There is a great need for something of this nature. If the commandos have their own headquarters, it will also create a feeling of pride among the civil population who will see it every day.</p>

<p>In the second place, I also want to thank the hon. the Minister for the announcement he made as regards the 100 per cent housing loan which is anticipated. However, I also want to plead that the hon. the Minister and the parties involved in this matter, may consider introducing a housing allowance in the meantime in respect of those people who occupy their own or rented houses until such time as they are able to obtain permanent accommodation in official quarters. In spite of the increased salaries members of the lower income groups, such as corporals and so forth, have to make considerable financial sacrifices in order to fulfil their tasks in the Permanent Force. A great number of these warrant officers are living in flats and rented houses with their families and they have to incur considerable expense in order to get to their work. The result is that the wives have to go out and work and the result is ultimately that they resign owing to the difficult position in which they find themselves financially although they would not have liked to resign for other reasons. If a housing allowance could, in the meantime, be paid to all ranks up to the rank of, say for example, colonel, it would provide in a very great need.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the question of pensions, although this does not fall within the scope of the White Paper. It is a fact to-day that the pension of a member of the Permanent Force dies with him. If he dies while he is still in the Service, his widow is not well provided for. If he dies after having retired on pension, his pension is discontinued immediately in spite of the fact that he may have been in the service for 20 to 25 years. The widows&#x2019; pension which is paid out amounts to very little and the widow cannot provide for herself and her children, not to mention sending the children to school and possibly to a university later. I want to plead that the pension which accrues to a member of the Permanent Force, be paid to his widow until such time as she marries again or up to the time of her death. I think she is entitled to it because her husband has contributed his full share in the Service. I very much like to advance this plea, because I know that a great number of these Permanent Force widows are having a difficult time. We also have the example of young married members of the Permanent Force who get killed in accidents. Recently we had the case of a young Permanent Force pilot who was killed in an accident after having been married for only one day. This young widow merely qualified for compensation in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. The contributions the pilot had paid to his pension fund up to the time of his death were not refunded to her. I want to ask that the full amount of the pension contributions be paid out to young widows in cases such as these.</p>

<p>A military bio-medical institute is being erected in my constituency at a cost of more than R1 million. Provision is made in the Estimates for the erection of this building. There is a possibility that a large military hospital will be built there in future. Therefore, I want to ask the hon. the Minister even at this early stage that, in view of the fact that the area of Verwoerdburg has no medical services and has to avail itself of the services of Pretoria, provision should be made for the civil population of this area to make use of these services during peacetime as well. If this request is granted, Verwoerdburg will provide the nurses who will assist with the nursing of the civil population.</p>

<p>As regards the publicity aspect, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the fine progress that is being made in respect of the publication <i>Commando.</i> It has been a long time since the publication maintained the high standard it is maintaining at present. A variety of articles are published in this publication, and the standard is quite high. However, I am very sorry that this publication is not distributed to a greater extent among Citizen Force members who are liable to military service and members of the commando forces. Maybe the Supreme Command could give its consideration to this aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>Two years ago I raised the question of the erection of church buildings for our army chaplains in this House. I now want to thank the hon. the Minister on behalf of our people for the fine church building we have at Oudtshoorn <span class="col_5239-5240" refersTo="page_1108"/>to-day and to which the Defence Force made a substantial contribution.

<p>Sir, before I sat down I was speaking of the idea of a permanent composite brigade instead of our present training. There are many advantages and many disadvantages to a scheme like that, but I leave it to the Minister and his staff. One of my colleagues on this side will elaborate on this in the course of the debate, and perhaps attention could be given to this as we go along. The big trouble in the Permanent Force, as we all know, is the question of trained Permanent Force personnel. If we could fill our Permanent Force establishment, most of the Minister&#x2019;s troubles with regard to training and everything else will be greatly reduced. The new pay scales will undoubtedly help and we hops that during the course of this debate the Minister will be able to give us a few more instances where he is able to improve the lot of the Permanent Force people over the next couple of years.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is one matter that distresses me very much. It is not a very pleasant matter to talk about and that is the question of discipline. I am not entirely satisfied that everything is in order as far as discipline is concerned, and I want to tell you why, Sir. We had the case which was reported in the newspapers the other day where a number of young Permanent Force people went over from Pretoria and interfered with the students in Johannesburg. I do not want anybody to think that I have any sympathy whatsoever with the small minority of long-haired adolescents who have not got enough work to do, but what distresses me is that it looks very much as though this was an organized effort to interfere with the students. I speak subject to correction but if the newspaper reports are correct, it would appear that there were N.C.O.s present and that this was an organized effort. I think that is a very bad manifestation.</p>

It is not a very serious thing, but it is something that disturbs and distresses some people. I live very close to Voortrekker Hoogte. I have been driving around the place quite a lot and I see that quite a number of the street names there have been changed. Names which have been there for many a day have been changed, and these streets have been renamed after persons who, quite honestly, are completely unknown to me. I do not know who or what they are. This seems to be so unnecessary; there seems to be no point in changing these names. After all, these old names are part of our history. They are being obliterated and replaced with other names. There is no originality about it and, as far as one can see, there is no reason for this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand made a few important remarks at the beginning of his speech and I think that, in view of his experience in the Defence Force, one may probably take notice of his remarks, but the hon. member also reminds me of a cow which gives a large pail of milk but kicks over the same pail of milk once her hobble is removed. This is what the hon. member reminds me of with the remarks he made at the end of his speech.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to make a few remarks in connection with the training of our Defence Force for combating terrorism. I believe our Defence Force will have to be trained to an increasing extent in future to combat terrorism. It is my well considered contention that we are going to have one of two wars in future: The one war which is going to be an atomic war which I do not think will ever take place in Africa although it might take place in Europe. I think the war which is going to affect Africa or probably South Africa in modern times and in future, will be a war in the nature of that which is being fought in Israel at the moment, namely a war of terrorism, in other words, a hit-and-run war. I think we will have to prepare our Defence Force for this type of war to an increasing extent. A report was published recently to the effect that a terrorist leader, Lazarus Kavandame, had surrendered, a report to which too much value was probably attached in that I do not think that the fact that this terrorist leader had surrendered in Mocambique, will have any effect on the infiltration of terrorism in Southern Africa. I do not think this is the case. I had the opportunity to make a few interesting observations in connection with this matter at U.N. last year. I discussed matters with a great number of the African leaders, leaders of the Arab states and with terrorist leaders who gave evidence at U.N. as well as with petitioners, and so forth. It was interesting to have found that our enemies at U.N. have more or less abandoned the idea that South Africa would ultimately be attacked by one or more of the African states. One can accept that they have abandoned that idea. But, in the second place, they have more or less abandoned the idea that the U.N. or some of its organizations will one day succeed in bringing South Africa on its knees. The Security Council as well as the General Assembly will continue taking resolutions from time to time and South Africa will still be subject to abuse in future, but it more or less amounts to the fact that our enemies at U.N. have given up hoping that they will achieve their aims through the organs of the U.N. But it is interesting to note that they rely to an increasing extent on terrorism to conquer South Africa. One of the delegates, Barutti of Saudi Arabia, put it to me very strikingly. He said to me: &#x201C;Young man, Algeria was conquered through terrorism; Cuba was conquered through terrorism; Israel will be conquered through terrorism and South Africa will, in fact, be conquered through terrorism.&#x201D; This is constantly the tone of all the discussions which take place at the U.N. Frelimo&#x2019;s delegates gave evidence there. They showed films to the delegates at U.N. to bring to the attention of the world the struggle which is being waged by the terrorists, and the films they showed, which were of Russian and Czechoslovakian origin, were interesting. The hon. member for Yeoville, who is not here now, and I saw those films. The way they presented the case of terrorism to the world was rather striking. The film began by showing how the white regime in Southern Africa was allegedly suppressing the Blacks and how they were being trained for the task of terrorism from a very early to a very advanced age and how they were being trained, and so forth. They presented these things in a very striking manner. Prelimo&#x2019;s national anthem&#x2014;Sane Mozambique! Sane Mozambique!&#x2014;constantly served as background music until it actually gave one goose-flesh. It was presented in a very emotional manner. To me it was an eyeopener, so much so that when we left the place in which the films had been shown, seasoned delegates of Western countries actually had tears in their eyes. It is also interesting to note that while this subject of terrorism was being discussed in one of the committees, the terrorists were referred to as &#x201C;terrorists&#x201D; by South Africa&#x2019;s delegate to that particular committee, Von Hirschberg. The Tanzanian delegate jumped to his feet and told the chairman, Farah of Somalia, &#x201C;Mr. Chairman, I object to this white racist of Pretoria referring to these freedom fighters as terrorists.&#x201D; It is interesting that one delegate after the other took up this refrain and the chairman of that specific committee ruled that those people should not be referred to as terrorists in future, and that they should be referred to as freedom fighters. It was a source of great pride to me when South Africa&#x2019;s delegate, Mr. Von Hirschberg, said: &#x201C;Mr. Chairman, I am compelled to accept your ruling, but I want to put it to you and to every delegate who is present here to-day and, in fact, to the world, that whatever terminology South Africa may use in future in respect of these people, we shall, when speaking of them, mean that they are terrorists and nothing else.&#x201D; To me it was an eye-opener to see, while these people were giving evidence, how many representatives of countries got up and offered financial aid amounting to millions of dollars in order to promote terrorism in their attacks against the white minority in Southern Africa. Representatives of other countries got up one after another offering aid amounting to millions of dollars. Virtually half the number of countries which are members <span class="col_5243-5244" refersTo="page_1110"/>of U.N. committed themselves in one way or another, whether financially or morally, to promote terrorism in Southern Africa. This is an aspect which we should take into account. It is a fact that the terrorists in Southern Africa have enormous financial sources and even military equipment at their disposal to-day. I find it interesting that a report was received only a few days ago to the effect that they are provided with even aircraft, modern jet fighters. I do not think we should view this matter lightly. In fact, I have here a report which was published in <i>Die Burger</i> of 26th March, 1969, in which it was stated that between 400 and 600 terrorists armed with modern weapons were waiting in camps in Zambia to invade Rhodesia across the Zambesi. This report came from Salisbury. My time is limited, but I nevertheless want to emphasize that we shall in future have to take into account these attacks by terrorists. I now want to refer to a speech made by the hon. the Minister in this House on 3rd April, 1968, as reported in Hansard, volume 23, column 3328. He. used the following words and I want to ask the Minister to repeat in no uncertain terms to those countries in Africa which are accommodating terrorists the warning he issued in that speech. On that occasion the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to say here this afternoon that making a country available as a base for terrorists constitutes provocation of a nature which gradually becomes so serious that it turns into guerrilla warfare. Such a situation recently arose for Israel. It then becomes necessary for a country to take sterner action against those threats. I want to say this afternoon that it will be a good thing if the people who are inciting terrorism and guerrilla warfare against South Africa come to realize that provocation may eventually lead to severe retaliation for the sake of self-respect and peace.</block>

<p>I think the time is opportune for the hon. the Minister once again to issue a strong warning to African countries which are accommodating, inciting and assisting terrorists who are directed against Southern Africa. For this reason I also think that we should equip our Defence Force in future in such a way for them to have a sound knowledge and the best training methods to combat terrorism and that they should also be provided with the necessary weapons to deal with it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I think we are all grateful to the hon. member for Middelland for having raised this question of terrorism. The attitude of this side of the House is well known in this connection. We are as keen as the Government to eradicate terrorism whereever it may raise its ugly head on or within bur borders, and there will be no lack of support from this side of the House whenever it comes to any constructive steps being taken against terrorist incursion into South Africa.</p>

<p>I wish to refer this afternoon to naval matters and I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Supreme Command on the part they must have played in arranging for our visits to the Argentine and to Australia. I think it would also be remiss of me if I did not congrtulate the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the diplomats who made those visits possible. But what I think is most important is that we on this side and the Government should congratulate the members of our Fleet on the magnificent performances they put up as ambassadors for our country, both in the Argentine and in Australia. I think it is fair to say that these cruises to both those countries have been of inestimable value to the members of the Fleet, more particularly because an opportunity was given to the men in those ships for training over a long period of time, sometimes in most adverse conditions, conditions which do not necessarily obtain off our coasts. They have therefore had practical experience of long cruises and I think that is to be welcomed. I hope also that the visits to these two countries foreshadow perhaps defensive alliances between South Africa, Australia and the Argentine.</p>

<p>Now I should like to deal with the speech made by the hon. the Minister on 31st March, 1967, at Simonstown on the occasion of the 21st birthday of the South African Navy. Under the heading &#x201C;Botha Pledges Top Conditions for the Navy&#x201D; in the <i>Cape Times,</i> he said:</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Defence said last night that to attract the best talent to the S.A. Navy, better working conditions, training facilities, housing and improved equipment would be provided for naval personnel.</block>

<p>I think that two years now having elapsed, we are entitled to ask the Minister whether he will make a report to the House on the progress that has been made in these connections. There are some noteworthy matters which I should also like to bring to his attention.</p>

<p>The first is that in response to a question from me it appears that there is a vast increase in the civilian personnel at Simonstown. I should like to tell the Minister that there is much criticism in Simonstown, from both people in the Navy and outside, of the fact that there are a number of employees in the Navy and in the Dockyard for whom there does not appear to be enough work. It seems to me that we are perhaps increasing that side of the Defence Force far too rapidly and without much purpose. I would also mention that the Dockyard police have been increased by 12 in the last three years, whereas criminal offences by members of the Permanent Force in the last three years amounted only to 22 and those of trainees to 2.</p>

<p>Then I should like to refer to the question of dismissals. Here I think there is an alarming trend not only in regard to dismissals but also resignations. Of the officers who are on general duties, four have been dismissed in the last five years, together with five technical and <span class="col_5245-5246" refersTo="page_1111"/>administrative officers. Of the other ranks, of those in the technical services, 20 have been dismissed, and in the non-technical services 252 were dismissed. Now, dealing with the resignations&#x2014;and this gives cause for considerable concern&#x2014;of the officers on general duties, in the last five years, 35 have resigned. Resignations in the technical and administrative services number 35; of other ranks in the technical services, 265, and those in the nontechnical and administrative services number 1,088. I think it should be borne in mind that there are many members of the Defence Force at Simonstown who would like to resign because they can enjoy better conditions outside of the Defence Force, but they are prohibited from doing so because of arrangements made between the Defence Force and other civilian concerns, whereby the civilian concerns agree not take ex-employees of the Defence Force.</p>

<p>Now I should like to deal with the question of admissions to the S.A. Navy. I have had occasion to take up with the Minister a number of cases where applicants from the seaside areas of South Africa have applied for service in the Navy and have been refused for some reason. I want to make the suggestion this afternoon that preference should always be given to those applicants for the S.A. Navy who come from the maritime areas above those who come from the inland areas. I think it is far better for the reason, that they are more readily available when required after they have completed their service, and it seems a <i>sine qua non</i> that they will be more familiar with the conditions of the sea than those from inland areas.</p>

<p>Now there are some strange things that occur in the Defence Force, and more particularly in the Navy. I should like to deal with the question of selections of those who go to the Naval College at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay. It appears that they are selected to go to that Naval College on the basis of their success in the Senior Certificate. It appears also that they select them after aptitude tests and after personal interviews. In response to recent questions, the Minister said: &#x201C;Slegs die beste word gekies&#x201D;. I am sure that only the best are chosen, but it is a very strange thing that when I inspected the college at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay recently, in one working party of 12 I found no fewer than three Ministers&#x2019; sons. I am sure that they must have obtained first-class Senior Certificates and I am sure that they must have passed the aptitude tests with flying colours, and I am sure that they must have made an enormous impression on those who selected them to go to the Naval College. But I think we should ask how many other Ministers&#x2019; sons and how many other Members of Parliament on that side of the House have had their children at the Naval College at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay on the basis of these criteria of selection.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I believe it is in the public interest that these matters should be brought out into the open and the Minister now has an opportunity, as the result of what I have said this afternoon, to explain to South Africa why it is that these things happen. Then there are some other strange things that happen in the Defence Force and I should like to quote from the publication <i>Commando.</i> I have mentioned this matter in the House before. Among the books reviewed by <i>Commando</i> was a book colled <i>Positiewe Nasionalisme</i> by Prof. Kotz&#x00E9;. It was recommended as suitable reading for members of the Defence Force. The Minister&#x2019;s answer at that time was that the Defence Force was in no way responsible for the opinions of those who reviewed the books, and I accept that, but I do not believe that to review a book like that and to make recommendations such as that brings about the spirit of harmony in our Defence Force.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter, and that is the question of the use made of Defence premises. I asked a question in the House as to why the Nationalist Party celebrated its 21st birthday in the Naval Gymnasium at Saldanha. The Minister&#x2019;s reply was that Defence premises such as that gymnasium hall could be used for social and cultural purposes. The social and cultural matters, that the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs addressed that social and cultural gathering about were such as &#x201C;The movement outward was no departure from Nationalist Party policy,&#x201D; <i>inter alia.</i> That is a blatant abuse of Defence premises, and I hope the Minister will comment on that as well.</p>

<p>Then, lastly, there is something I raise in all seriousness. I do not think the names of the submarines were well chosen. It transpires that the names were chosen by the Supreme Command plus the Minister, after consultation with Dr. Punt of the Simon van der Stelstigting. I would with very great respect commend to the Minister that in future when we acquire submarines or other surface vessels, members of the Navy should be given an opportunity to suggest appropriate names for those vessels. I hope that the Minister takes that suggestion in the spirit in which I mean it. There has been considerable criticism in the Navy about the naming of those submarines and I would ask the Minister sincerely to take that into account when naming vessels in future. I see the Minister is looking at me angrily and that he is going to reply to what I have said in the same way he has replied to me before, in a bitterly hostile, attacking manner, but I would just like to say that I have raised these last matters in the spirit in which we approach Defence matters on this side of the House, namely in the interest of South Africa.

<p>It was not my intention to participate in this debate so soon again, but the hon. member for Simonstown has an unpleasant way of doing things. I want to tell him that it does not do him much good in the Navy. He will be surprised at what is being said about him, not by officers sharing my political convictions, but by officers who have his language in common with him and who have never revealed their political convictions to me. He will be surprised. I want to tell him that his actions create the impression in the Navy that he has ulterior motives.</p>

<p>I adopted the attitude from the outset that I would only name the submarines after I had had proper consultations. What happened in this case was that the Navy made suggestions. In the second place I want to say that when an Acting Minister replied to that question, it was in my absence. The Naval Chief of Staff was not here either. Those names which were suggested by the Navy plus the other names which were considered&#x2014;there were, as far as I can remember, three groups of names&#x2014;were referred to the Supreme Command. Only after the Supreme Command had signified their agreement did I approve of those names. In other words, I consulted the Supreme Command of the Defence Force. I want to point out that there is nothing unusual about naming submarines after women. This happens in many countries. The submarine in which I went for a cruise in France had the name of a woman.</p>

These are the grounds on which those names were chosen. The Supreme Command had the opportunity to consider these names. The Navy had the opportunity to suggest names. Only after that did I take my decision. I do not know why this matter is again being raised now.</p>

<p>Well, it is strange that the complaints do not reach me [Interjections.] I shall tell you where the trouble comes from. The trouble arises when people who have nothing to do with these matters start sowing suspicion and writing articles which disparage the names of the submarines. I do not intend shirking my responsibilities in that way. We made proper, reasoned statements as to why we chose the names. It is my responsibility to take the final decision. I intend doing so as long I am Minister. Now, I have again given the reasons this afternoon.</p>

<p>I now come to <i>Commando. Commando</i> is a publication that has improved tremendously lately. It is my point of view, and I think it is the right one, that members of the Defence Force should read as much as possible. That it why reviews of various books are published from time to time. I have never had any reason to complain about books reviewed in <i>Commando.</i> Now the hon. member selects only one of those books. He makes a fuss about it. Does the hon. member also look at other books reviewed in <i>Commando</i>&#x003F;</p>

<p>But why then does he have to drag in these trifling matters&#x003F; Then the hon. member did a very nasty thing, which I hold against him. I hold it against him because it is a reflection not only on the integrity of the people whose sons are at the Naval College, but also on the people who have to select those boys. It is also a reflection on our Naval Chief of Staff. I will not allow that hon. member to insult the Naval Chief of Staff of South Africa. I will not allow the hon. member to do that. And I want to say the following to him this afternoon, because the I.Q. of these boys are tested. The qualifications of these boys are examined as well as their achievements at school. They are also given a medical examination. It is on the basis of these <span class="col_5249-5250" refersTo="page_1113"/>things, and these things alone, that these boys are selected.

What the hon. member really wants to suggest is that pressure is brought to bear to get boys admitted there who cannot be admitted there on merit. I challenge him to give me one example of a boy who was selected for the Naval College and who did not gain admission to the college on merit.

<p>The hon. member also referred to a speech I made in Simonstown in which I envisaged certain improvements. That is true. I did envisage certain improvements. In the first place 129 houses in Da Gama Park were renovated at a cost of R66,000 by the Department of Community Development during 1968. Formal tenders are being invited at the moment for the renovation of a further 104 houses at an estimated cost of R60,000. The tenders will be disposed of within three weeks. At the moment 13 houses are under construction at Da Gama Park. These are virtually completed. Tenders will be invited this year for two blocks of flats, semi-detached houses and houses which will provide 90 housing units. It is hoped that building operations will be commenced in the second half of this year. During the past year 16 housing units were completed at Wingfield, while 19 housing units are still under construction. In Durban 19 housing units were completed at the Bluff during the year, which are available to staff of the Navy, Army and Air Force at Durban. The Department of Community Development is at present negotiating for the purchase of private houses at Simonstown which will also become available to Naval staff after the houses have been converted and renovated.</p>

<p>I am discussing a matter which is of interest to all of us and in respect of the basic principles of which the hon. member for Durban (Point) said we did not differ. Why do hon. members not give me the opportunity now to state these facts properly&#x003F; I was saying that private houses, after conversion and renovation, would be made available to Naval staff. Offers have been received from the town council and the matter is in the hands of the Department of Community Development now. In addition I now want to tell the hon. member that we have just invited applications for the submarine staff. The hon. member also referred to the resignations. Of course there were resignations. Of course there is a great demand for well trained people in the country. Of course wonderful offers are made to persons in the entire Defence Force. We have never said that that position does not cause us any concern. It does. It is also causing us concern in the Navy. But we have now invited applications for submarine staff. We have had 841 applications. In other words, we shall be able to select the successful applicants. Among those applicants there are quite a few <span class="col_5251-5252" refersTo="page_1114"/>with good academic qualifications. In other words, the situation is not as bad as the impression which is being created. The position is that in certain divisions of the Defence Force problems really exist. That is why we said some time ago when we introduced compulsory military service that we hoped to combat some of our manpower problems by means of the system of national service.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The intention with the system of national service was to solve some of our problems through that system. We are gradually gaining the success we expected. It is not only a question of resignations.</p>

<p>*The reverse side of the picture is also promising. I now want to tell the hon. member that I am prepared to argue with the hon. member 100 per cent on merit as regards any argument of that kind. I am prepared to accept criticism from him in the form of arguments based on merit, but I am not prepared to accept criticism from him in the form in which he expressed such criticism, i.e. criticizing boys who are doing their duty. To come back to this matter, I want to ask him with regard to the boys who are selected for the Naval College to go on that short officers&#x2019; course, whether the hon. member has satisfied himself as to what a stiff course that is.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that after three months of basic training they are made to undergo a very stiff course for three months which requires not only a great deal of energy but also intelligence. Then these young chaps go on to the ships. Some of those people held key positions on the ships that went to Australia last year. They did excellent work. When a boy is capable of satisfying those requirements without complaining, we should not try to use it as a subject for politicking as happened to-day. That is why I got up immediately to tell the hon. member that I feel ashamed and sorry about the fact that he made a point of this.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was really pleasant to listen to the way the hon. the Minister exposed and completely shattered the hon. member for Simonstown. If I had been in this shoes, I would have been so ashamed that I would have risen and asked permission to leave the House. But while I was listening to all his attacks and charges, which have now been proved to be groundless, I was proud of the fact that in respect of the base at Zeerust no specific complaints in regard to the staff or servicemen had ever been brought to my notice. That made me feel free again to bring the development of that basis to the notice of the hon. the Minister once more. In that regard I also want to say that at that base there is a particular need for a recreation hall, for the good of the trainees as well as the staff.</p>

<p>Now I want to drop that subject and associate myself with the congratulations which other hon. colleagues extended to the hon. the Minister and his staff. I want to congratulate him on his excellent and illuminating White Paper which he tabled here. It is a report which furnishes information in regard to the composition, the training, the development, the equipment and the striking power of our Defence Force, which is really reassuring to every interested citizen of the country who wants to take cognizance of that. The information furnished in this White Paper can also have a beneficial effect extending far beyond the borders of our fatherland. It can enhance the prestige and the status of South Africa, also with military strategists when they determine the value of South Africa&#x2019;s Defence Force within the set-up of the Southern Hemisphere. The significant role it can play in combating the communist threat as well as the strategic Western bulwark it already is at the southernmost point of Africa while the Suez Canal remains closed and will in any case remain a dangerous sea-way into the distant future, is irrefutable. A strong, mobile defence force means security. Security gives rise to confidence, and confidence gives rise to rapprochement&#x2014;rapprochement and understanding with other states which have common threats to combat and distinctive interests to protect&#x2014;these are the things for which South Africa has a need and which can always mean a great deal to us. Information in respect of the position of our Defence Force and the striking power of South Africa can always, as far as that is concerned, be of great importance. I find it a pity that there are still people in South Africa, and in this House as well, who hold the view that too much is being done in respect of Defence and that too much money is being spent on it, people such as the hon. member&#x2014;I could almost say the eccentric hon. member&#x2014;for Houghton. But we do not want to dwell on that.</p>

<p>I want to come to the introduction to this White Paper, which I found particularly striking. The hon. member for Potchefstroom read it out here and only referred to it briefly. In order to emphasize what I want to say, I myself should really have read out the whole introduction once again, but there will not be time for doing so. When I read it, I got to think that this was really the military confession of faith which, in a few significant words, summarized in a nutshell the object of the development of our Defence Force in South Africa. One has <span class="col_5253-5254" refersTo="page_1115"/>to read, re-read and analyse it in order to be able to enjoy and emphasize at its true value the full import and striking power of every word and every sentence which the hon. the Minister used in such a summarizing manner. The very first sentence starts with the words, &#x201C;For those who want to listen &#x2026;&#x201D; This is a statement with a message in the widest sense of the word intended for the ears of all the inhabitants of our own fatherland, of every population group, but also for the ears of our friends as well as our enemies, including those who are far beyond the borders of our country. It is intended for all citizens who are willing to listen attentively and who are prepared to pay attention to what is said in this briefly summarized introduction. Unfortunately it is true that many people and even statesmen do not want to listen to the truth and do not wnat to accept the real facts in respect of the objects of the development of our Defence Force. They see nothing but hostile motives in this. That is why the words &#x201C;want to&#x201D; have such a special meaning in this sentence; in other words, to give everybody who wants to with the emphasis on &#x201C;wants to&#x201D;, i.e. everybody who is willing to listen in an honest and unprejudiced manner, the assurance that no subtle, no secret, no imperialist motives are involved; it is only aimed at defending, not at attacking. This reduces the object to the most basic and primary human right of self-defence and safeguarding what is by rights and unquestionably one&#x2019;s own sanctuary, one&#x2019;s own possession, one&#x2019;s own way of life and one&#x2019;s own fatherland. This is very important and must also be understood and accepted this way in the outside world. The hon. the Minister went on to say: &#x201C;We threaten nobody &#x2026;&#x201D; There are no aggressive motives, no land-hunger, no economic considerations for our wanting to fight, no bloodthirsty or destructive urges, no hankering after &#x201C;lebensraum&#x201D;. All of this whilst we are deeply conscious of the fact that we are well and truly being threatened by ill-informed and prejudiced enemies in Africa, in the Orient, and by the communist bloc of the Russian and the Chinese combination, as well as, to a lesser extent, by other sections such as our many enemies in international organizations and the terrorist movements to which the hon. member for Middelland rightly referred. In addition there is the threat from underground movements here in South Africa. This message concludes with these words, &#x201C;&#x2026; but we will also not suffer being attacked &#x2026;&#x201D; In other words, we shall employ, to the maximum, the striking power, the power of resistance of an excellent Defence Force and the spiritual power of the whole of South Africa against any attack.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Marico will not mind if I do not follow him on the interesting topic of underground and subversive activities, of which I understand he has considerable knowledge.</p>

<p>I should prefer to come back to the hon. the Minister of Defence and the matters which he raised across the floor of the House with me. First of all, I should like to say how much I welcome and we on this side of the House welcome, his statement regarding improved housing facilities at Simonstown. He made a promise in 1967. It seems that the first part of his promise is coming true. I welcome that and I congratulate him on it. I am sure that all servicemen in Simonstown will be just as pleased as I. The hon. the Minister also mentioned that he would welcome from me an objective discussion about the state of the Naval Forces, more particularly those points that I drew to his attention, such as the dismissal and the resignations from the Navy. I gave those figures to the House and to him, because I thought they were a cause for concern. I am glad that he shares that concern. I hope that as a result of some of the better facilities that are to be provided at Simonstown, the spate of resignations will at least be stopped.</p>

<p>Now I should like to move on to the question of the Naval College at Gordons Bay. First of all, I seldom speak in this House unless I have intimate knowledge of the subject on which I speak as a result of a personal inspection. [Interjections.] I went to the Gordons Bay Navy College after raising a question here and at the request of the captain of the college. I might say, as I have said before in connection with Saldanha, in connection also with all the naval installations of Simonstown, that I was most impressed with what I saw there. When I spoke earlier, I pointed out to the hon. the Minister that there were some matters that seemed to be strange and that required answers, <i>inter alia,</i> the fact that there are three sons of three Ministers at Gordons Bay undergoing training. In answer to the question that I asked recently, the hon. the Minister said that the people who went to that naval college were chosen on the basis of their senior certificate results, on the basis of their aptitude tests and on the basis of personal interviews. Now all the Minister had to do this afternoon, was to say that the hon. member for Simonstown must not make insinuations which are incorrect and that he has proof positive that each of these Ministers&#x2019; sons were chosen only on the basis of merit. He need not have gone any further. This is not the first time that this hon. Minister has reacted in such a touchy manner. On each other occasion that I have raised matters to do with the naval forces in Simonstown, he has attacked me. The same applies to the questions that I ask. Invariably at the end of his answer, there is some snide and some cheap remark. I think that I am entitled to say that this Minister&#x2019;s past is surely catching up with his present.</p>

<p>I should also like to deal with the question of the names of the submarines. I ask the hon. the Minister to accept what I say. I asked the question in the House as to how the names were arrived at when he was overseas quite fortuitously. It happened to be appropriate at the time and I put that question on the Order Paper. This is what my question was and this <span class="col_5255-5256" refersTo="page_1116"/>is what the answer was. I asked whether the naval personnel were invited to suggest appropriate names for the submarines. If so, which personnel, what names and in what order of popularity were names suggested&#x003F; The answer then given me was that naval personnel were not invited to suggest appropriate names. Until the answer which the hon. the Minister himself, gave to me this afternoon, I was under the impression that naval personnel had not been consulted. I am perfectly correct in saying that naval personnel generally are dissatisfied with the names given to the submarines. I made a constructive suggestion that in future the naval personnel should be consulted. In fact, they were consulted as the hon. the Minister now tells me, but not according to the answer that was given to me by the gentleman who answered my question on the Order Paper for him in his absence overseas. I was quite entitled to raise those matters across the floor of the House, namely those that are constructive, those that I believe give cause for concern, those that seem to indicate that certain aspects of the Defence Force activities are not quite right. I would like to be able to protect this hon. Minister from the sort of statement that was made by the retired chief of staff in 1953 about his predecessor bar one. The Navy and the other members of the Defence Force are at one in their praise of his immediate predecessor, but are not at one in their praise for his predecessor bar one. This is what Gen. Beyers said in 1953:</p>

<block name="quote">I resigned the post of chief of the general staff without any request from the Cabinet for the reason that I took exception to the manner in which Mr. Erasmus carried out the functions of his portfolio of Defence.</block>

<p>I accepted the appointment of chief of the general staff in the first instance on the distinct understanding that there would be no departure or deviation from military principles. When, in breach of this understanding, the Minister departed from those principles, and in doing so was upheld by the Cabinet, I resigned.</p>

<p>Moreover, as a professional soldier and a chief of staff, I could no longer tolerate Mr. Erasmus.</p>

<p>I hope that no member of the Defence Force will be able to say this about this Minister at the termination of his period of office.</p>

<p>Mr Chairman, the hon. member for Simonstown will not get away as easily as that with his story in regard to the reference to the naval college at Gordons Bay. While he was speaking, I made an interjection and asked him what he was suggesting. He said in reply that he maintained that irregular political influencing had taken place. We can get a copy of his Hansard. The hon. member said that he maintained that those young men were there as a result of irregular political influencing. That is what I objected to. That is what the hon. member said after he had received a reply from me to a question on the Order Paper. In that reply I told him on what grounds young men were chosen. That is why I challenged him to furnish his proof. That is why I told him that that was a grave, slanderous accusation against the Naval Chief of Staff. The naval chief of staff informs me that when those young men are screened, the officers in charge are not aware of who those young men are; they do not know with what young man they are dealing. They only have the results of that young man&#x2019;s achievements before them.</p>

<p>I have asked the Naval Chief of Staff to get it for me. I shall explain it on Monday. However, I am prepared to take his word for it that, when the screening takes place, the men in charge do not know who those young men are. Now the hon. member comes along, having received from me a reply drafted after thorough consideration, and he thinks that towards the end of the afternoon he can get away here with a very ugly accusation which does not only cast a reflection on the integrity of the Ministers concerned, but also casts a very serious reflection on the integrity of officers. I object to that in the strongest terms, because Gordons Bay is one of our fine institutions. A very fine spirit is being maintained at Gordons Bay. I have had dealings with those young men, and I have dealings with them from time to time. Some of those young men visited my home last year. Amongst them there were English-speaking young men, young men from Jewish families and Afrikaans-speaking young men. A very fine spirit prevails amongst that group of young candidate officers.</p>

<p>Precisely. In that case, why does the hon. member level this nasty, slanderous accusation&#x003F; Why does he do it if he does not want to cause trouble by doing so&#x003F; That is what I revolted against.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred again to the question about the submarines. The Naval Clref of Staff and I were overseas at the stage when that question was replied to. The commandant general was also overseas at that stage. If a wrong impression had inadvertently been created through that reply, I apologize for it. However, the fact of the matter is that the Navy was in fact consulted. The Naval Chief of Staff consulted his chiefs of staff. I want to be honest and say that I really do not think that there is a defence force anywhere in the world which has to hold a referendum before giving a name to a man-of-war or a submarine. I think that would be childish. When we gave the names, we decided to determine first of all what kind of names we wanted to give to the submarines: names relating to nature, or names relating to animal life, or names relating to marine life, or names relating to the lives of heroes. At that stage we <span class="col_5257-5258" refersTo="page_1117"/>decided that it was time we honoured the woman of South Africa. We decided on that because it had already been done in various other navies of the world. I do not say that this has been done on a large scale, but I can mention to you several submarines which bear the names of women. That is nothing new!</p>

One of the reasons for my selecting that name, was that France was the country which helped us when no other country wanted to do so. I did not say that she was a French citizen; I said that she was of French descent. That is recorded in the statement. Subsequent to that everybody who wanted to make comment, started writing, and they can write as they please. I do not mind. However, it is not their task to take the final decision; it is mine, and I intend to carry it out.

However, the hon. member should not try to employ tactics of this nature, because they do not have a beneficial effect on the Defence Force, nor do they have a beneficial effect on relations in the Defence Force.

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown gave a masterly performance of how a member of the House of Assembly should dissociate himself from courtesy and chivalry. We are very grateful to him for showing us his true colours in such a first-rate manner.</p>

<p>We notice that in the Defence Estimates an amount of R380,000 has been voted for new building works at Bloemfontein. We are very grateful that there will also be extension in this sphere. Having referred to extensions and possible extensions, I want to point out to the hon. the Minister, in regard to a training centre for young women, that in addition to Potchefstroom similar facilities exist at Bloemfontein. Over and above all these facilities which Potchefstroom can offer in respect of our young women, Bloemfontein has an airport as well. The hon. the Minister is, in addition, aware that the Municipality of Bloemfontein has offered, free of charge, almost 30 morgen for that project. Moreover, the Municipality has also offered certain services. This matter is, I hope, still pending, and I hope the hon. the Minister will take cognizance of the fact that that offer still stands. We appreciate that the costs involved and accommodation are possible problems. If accommodation should be available elsewhere, is it possible that the hon. the Minister will pay attention to it&#x003F; However, we also want to submit to you that throughout the country there are nurses&#x2019; homes which, if one were to judge by the shortage of nurses, should have numerous vacancies. If the hon. the Minister could liaise with the hon. the Minister of Health, we might cut the Gordian knot in that respect by simultaneously reducing the shortage of nurses, because in the training programme for our young women provision is also being made for nursing as a very important subject. Therefore I foresee that there can be liaison between these two aspects.</p>

<p><span class="col_5259-5260" refersTo="page_1118"/>We are also very grateful for the attention paid to housing in the White Paper. I notice, as did the hon. member for Pretoria (District) that 100 per cent housing is envisaged. I also want to associate myself with that hon. member&#x2019;s representations, i.e. that the hon. the Minister should, in cases where military staff have provided their own accommodation, consider paying certain allowances to them until such time as the ideal of 100 per cent housing has been attained.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Middelland said. It is obvious from the White Paper that a defensive policy is envisaged and is also being implemented. That is right. If one analyses it further, it is very clear that in terms of this policy we foresee that, operationally, action will take place on our own territory. In other words, we shall not act in foreign territory. It is clear to us that our Defence Force is well prepared. There is no doubt about that in our minds. According to evidence received from abroad our Defence Force is well prepared. This is not evidence given by our own people; it is evidence given by overseas journalists. These people regard our Defence Force as being prepared and ready for every possible contingency. However, this is not the complete picture, for the policy of the hon. the Minister also makes provision for civil defence, which is integrated with the Defence Force. The present state of affairs is that provision is being made for nursing as well as fire-fighting, etc. Why did Germany pass Switzerland by during the Second World War&#x003F; The reason is that every man, woman and child knew precisely what was expected of him or her. In other words, it was possible for every man, woman and child to be integrated with the programme of defence as a whole. Their task did not only include nursing or fire-fighting. I also want to mention to you, Sir, the example of wartime France. Wartime France took a long time to mobilize underground. In that process everybody eventually knew what was expected of him. Women could handle weapons; they knew how to handle the intelligence service and they could perform all sorts of other services, secondary services, otherwise performed by men. It is very clear to me that if we as a national front should want to frighten away intruders from outside, it would be inadequate if we merely took the concept &#x2018;civil defence&#x2019; to mean nursing and fire-fighting. Civil defence should embrace much more. I just want to illustrate this in a practical manner. Suppose the inhabitants of Messina were to wake up one morning to find the police station occupied by terrorists. At this moment something like that seems absurd, but in Vietnam, for instance, the terrorists infiltrated Saigon in one night and occupied strategic positions. We must be aware of this possibility. Now my question is what would the inhabitants of Messina do if they were to hear such news on that morning&#x003F; They would be panicstricken. That is why I say that the public of South Africa should be aware of the fact that in future they will have to do much more towards forming a national front as regards the outside world, in order to discourage any possible onslaughts, be they unconventional or conventional. The reason why the public are so easy in their minds, is that they are conscious of the readiness of the Defence Force. For a future perfect deterrent it will be necessary for us to be in a position to mobilize, as it is alleged Switzerland can do to-day. In a time of emergency in Switzerland the head of every family will open an envelope on being given a certain codeword. This envelope contains all the instructions for every member of the family. In this way co-ordination is effected between one and all, between the Defence Force and the civil defence services.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to dwell too long on the remarks of the hon. member for Bloemfontein (West) and I do hope that the Minister and his Supreme Command will not be rushing into a 100 per cent mobilization as has been suggested by the hon. member. I am sure that the threats and dangers which beset our country are fully and reasonably appraised, and that the preparations which are being made are necessary and reasonable. I want to make a confession to the hon. the Minister and that is to tell him that I never at any time had any liking for being involved in conflict under the sea, on top of the sea or in the air. Therefore I want to discuss matters regarding the cream of the Army, i.e. the Infantry. The hon. the Minister has given us a great deal of interesting information regarding the development and the production of missiles in this country. He also gave us other information regarding the armaments which are available. However, I think there is one thing we must bear in mind when assessing the preparedness of the country for the type of warfare in which we are likely to be involved. If we should be involved in such a conflict at all, be it with terrorists or any other infiltrators, the Infantry will be the ultimate group which will be involved in this war. No matter what the weapons might be, be it from the air or from the sea, the final winkling out of the terrorists is the job of the infantryman. We have seen it in Vietnam, where with all the power of bombardment the terrorist forces can only be hindered, but not subdued. I raise this matter because I believe that although the standard and programme of training which is required from the Infantry by the Chief of Combat Forces, is excellent, there is a tendency for the infantryman to become more a digit than a member of a regiment, more an individual serviceman than part of the regimental or battalion unit in which he eventually will be involved in the case of war. I believe that this is one reason why there have been suggestions that the young men are not particularly interested in army service. Sir, many of us recollect the days before the last war and the period of training in the Active Citizen Force, as it was then, when there was regimental spirit which was maintained in sporting activities and things <span class="col_5261-5262" refersTo="page_1119"/>of that nature. There was a camaraderie which was built up in times of peace which was extremely valuable when it came to operations in wartime. Sir, I wonder whether some of the procedures which are being adopted at the present moment are really necessary. For instance, when the serviceman starts his period of continuous training, he is equipped with clothing and equipment but when he has finished that period of training he retains merely what one terms the pimlico items, the articles of clothing, but all other articles, such as his arms, his field equipment, his sleeping equipment and so on, are taken back into ordnance. I wonder whether people always realize what a tedious job befalls a unit commander if he wishes at some stage to draw rifles for a weekend bivouac with his regiment. The numberings on these rifles mostly run into eight figures, and when these rifles have to be drawn from an ordnance store, the numbers have to be checked and the rifles checked in again; an inordinate amount of time is wasted. This wasted time and the tedious work can be avoided by just not having that type of operation and that type of training, and I wonder whether it is not possible for the Supreme Command to consider the establishment of regimental armouries where these arms can be properly kept under care and are easily accessible for the regiment at any time. Sir, the other matter which I believe is detracting from the development and retention of the battalion unit as such is the looseness in regard to the continuous training periods which are required for servicemen after they have done their first 9 or 12 months, as the case may be. At the present moment they must do three periods of 26 days, one in each year of a three-year cycle. I believe that it would be far more valuable if it was laid down that this should be the second and the fourth and the sixth year or the third year, the sixth year and the ninth year, because one would then have into the unit a regular intake of men for their short-term continuous training or refresher courses and one would be able to retain more of the regimental spirit within the unit. I believe that that would assist considerably in the twelve-day annual periods done by N.C.O.&#x2019;s and junior officers. I have experienced it in my own family that when these youngsters go off to do their twelve-days&#x2019; training, they do not go to their unit; they are sent for training to the training battalion at Oudtshoorn and they are given people to train who are quite unassociated with the particular regiment to which they belong. I believe that these are matters which are important and deserve consideration from the Supreme Command.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with two other matters and I have to deal with them very briefly in the time at my disposal. The first is the functioning of the selection boards which have been set up where the armed forces cannot take in the full number of persons liable for training. I have had it reported to me from a responsible source that where a local selection board cannot absorb the total number of people available, there is some cause for disquiet, not from the point of view of where the person is to be sent but from the point of view that persons are not selected for particular units. This is a matter which is causing some concern. I know that it is a difficult problem. I see from the statement which was issued by the Commandant-General that there are now 120 of these boards, and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can assure us that each of these selection boards has a code of procedure which must be followed and that there is not too much left to whatever the local feelings of the members of the board might be. I think if it could be confirmed that there is a definite set of rules and procedures to be followed, it would allay and stop a certain amount of comment. I pass this on to the hon. the Minister purely as hearsay. I was in fact talking to some of these servicemen the other night socially and one of them said: &#x201C;The man who does service nowadays is the man who does not have any influence to get out of being selected.&#x201D; Sir, this is for ordinary service. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could give that assurance and allay fears which exist in some quarters that preference might be given to some people in local areas.</p>

<p>In the one minute that is left to me I want to deal with a matter which I raised with the hon. the Minister last year. Sir, we have had a lot of talk about culture in this House during this Session. I want to suggest to the Minister that if there is one culture which is common to all sections of the South African population, English and Afrikaans speaking, it is the Scottish culture, and I want to ask the Minister again, as I did last year, whether means cannot be found within the framework of his finances to assist Scottish regiments in regard to the procurement and the provision and maintenance of their Scottish uniforms for those regiments which have been long established in our South African Defence Force.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to offer the hon. member for Green Point my apologies for not following up on what he has said. Mr. Chairman, we in South Africa are extremely fortunate in possessing so much we can feel proud of. We have a fine country of which we are proud. Each of the two language groups are proud of a fine past. I could continue in this way and mention a good many things of which we are proud. But I think that whatever our feelings towards all these wonderful things we share, we are not less proud of our Defence Force. It has already displayed dynamic growth in recent times, and we are justly proud of it. Arising out of what we have heard in this debate, and after the hon. member for Durban (Point) had commenced his speech, I firmly believed that this was perhaps a topic on which we and the Opposition could see eye to eye; that it was common ground on which we could approach closer to one another. When the hon. member for Durban (Point) was some distance into his speech, I began to have second thoughts. [Interjections.] Sir, I still have hope for the <span class="col_5263-5264" refersTo="page_1120"/>hon. member. He need not be so concerned about this. I think that if one were to knock off the rough edges and polish him up a bit, he would perhaps be able to make a speech next year which would be quite in line with what he announced at the outset of his speech here. Then the hon. member for Simonstown rose to speak with the same fine preamble, but to my great disappointment he subsequently adopted that course he adopted. To me, and to the good taste I should like to see maintained in this debate, it was a disappointment. My reservations increased, and the Opposition must not take this amiss of me. During that minor skirmish between the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Simonstown, it was clear to me that with their attitude and with their persistent interjections they were satirising either the Minister or the entire situation, and I find that quite deplorable. The spirit they displayed here is not the spirit they ought to display.</p>

<p>I said that we were justifiably proud of our Defence Force. Recently one finds it striking that the old stigma which formerly attached to the uniform has completely disappeared. I can still remember, when I was a young child, how a worthy old gentleman one day refused to greet a prison warden simply because he was wearing a uniform. We are grateful that that kind of thing is something of the past, but it probably had a lot to do with our history. But it is a thing of the past and we are glad that this is so. The men in our Defence Force, whether on land, on sea or in the air, are the men of whom we as ordinary citizens expect that if it should be necessary they will even be prepared to offer up their lives for South Africa and for us. Let us hope that that day will never arrive. Let us rather hope and pray for a lasting peace, but we will not allow ourselves to be caught napping. It we make these exacting demands on them and they are prepared to choose that profession, for our country and our people, then I believe it is the task of each one of us outside the Force to make much of these men, since this is the most suitable time, and accept them as people who are prepared to make the greatest sacrifice for South Africa. Let us give them our goodwill, our sympathy and our hospitality. I would like to put it like this. Let us regard each of the men in our Defence Force as a member of each family in South Africa. Let us give to them now which we may not, alas, be able to give them later on.</p>

<p>I want to express another idea. I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether it is possible for us to expand and develop the commando system further. What I really mean by that is whether we cannot attract more of the people outside the Active Force to it&#x003F; In times of extreme emergency we know that civil defence, in every place where there is a concentration of people, is of the utmost importance. I feel that we should in fact launch a campaign to expand the commando system further. I also want to express my pleasure at our having progressed so far that we are able to incorporate civil defence in the Defence Force. This is only the beginning of a new era as far as that is concerned, but we have every confidence that under the competent leadership, which we have always been able to rely on, it will be developed into something exceptional.</p>

<p>The idea I want to conclude with has been expressed on various occasions. I want to say this, that South Africa desires nothing from any country in the world except friendly relations and commercial ties. That is why we have a Defence Force, and why we are not adjusted to onslaughts or antagonism. That is why we can make an appeal to every individual in our country, and I am speaking in particular to those who are supporters of the Opposition, to give everything in our power to develop this Defence Force of ours into something fine so that it can meet the greatest expectations we have of it.</p>

<speech by="#lindsay">

<from>*Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. LINDSAY</person>:</from>

<p>I should just like to say to the hon. member for De Aar that it is precisely for this reason, i.e. that we want to see our Defence Force expanded in the way he says it should be done, that we are levelling this criticism of ours, so that if a wrong course is adopted in any section it can be quickly stopped. I should like to focus the Minister&#x2019;s attention on the item for tuition fees for overseas courses. I presume of course that the amount we see in the Estimates does not include the costs of conversion courses, such as those for submarines and aircraft etc. The amount which we appropriate annually for this matter is something which gives me great cause for concern, particularly when one takes the tendency over the last few years into account. In this way we see that the amount decreased each year up to 1968, when we appropriated only R60,600 for that purpose. Last year, of course, an appreciable amount was spent on this again, but now we see that such a small amount is being allowed that, in my opinion, the position is quite unsound, and for the following reasons. Since we&#x2014;and this has been mentioned more than once to-day as a small country make it our goal, with our relatively small Defence Force, to successfully withstand any attack which is made on us, we must prepare our Defence Force to its maximum efficiency. This must take place within the limits of the financial means which we are at this very moment giving the Minister. We all know that the necessary munitions are expensive. The Minister told us this afternoon how the prices had increased. But there are not only the direct costs; there is also the fact that the munitions rapidly become obsolete as a result of rapid technological development. The purchase of the right kind of munitions is therefore of the utmost importance. It is not only the price and the type which is of importance, but also in what respect it is suitable to our country in our circumstances, and above all to our soldiers. I am fully aware that munitions cannot simply be purchased, but I definitely believe that there is probably no <span class="col_5265-5266" refersTo="page_1121"/>better opportunity for a true evaluation of such munitions as when officers and men go overseas on courses dealing with these munitions. Secondly I want to say that it is a disturbing aspect of our Defence Force that we are rapidly approaching the time when many of our senior officers who went through their baptism of fire during the last war now have to retire. Nor do I wish to imply that a leadership can only be competent if the leader has been under fire. But let me put it this way: Fighting a war and playing war games are two different things. I believe that war games are extremely important and play an indispensible role in the training, not only of the leaders, but of the Force as a whole. They must be used as a source of experience precisely for the purpose of preparing for the real thing. In the same way it is important that this should not be done on one&#x2019;s own or in isolation. The techniques and utilization of munitions also change. It ought not, as it were, to be acquired by correspondence course. For efficiency the expansion of knowledge is essential. For our country that expansion is only possible if members of our Force are able to co-operate with those of others.</p>

<p>There are of course problems. We all know what the attitude of overseas countries is. May I just say in parentheses that I think the time has come for overseas countries to realize that we as an Opposition, although small in numbers in this House, nevertheless have a large following among the voters outside. [Interjections.] It is not much less than 50 per cent. We are quite capable of dealing with the Government if it should make a false move, without any need for their (overseas countries) having to lend a hand with their ridiculous boycotts which not only endanger South Africa but also their own way of life. I am saying therefore that those problems have to be solved by diplomatic action and mutual visits as has been suggested to-day. That is a very good thing. But in addition I believe that a great deal can be contributed by sending as many members of the Defence Force as possible on overseas courses.</p>

<p>In the third place, since we read every day and hear about the manpower shortage, and the Permanent Force also has to contend with that problem&#x2014;we are glad to learn of the increased salary scales which the hon. the Minister mentioned this afternoon&#x2014;the possibility of an overseas course is one of those additional benefits which can contribute so much, not only towards keeping a man in the Force, but even towards attracting him to the Force. I firmly believe that the Navy, for example, will receive an increase in the number of applications from compulsory trainees, as a result of additional benefits which these welfare visits have resulted in. You see, Sir, it is that possibility only, the fact that one has a chance, that makes the world of difference.</p>

<p>Lastly I just want to say, although it is not possible for us to purchase all the different kinds of munitions there are, and because it would also be ridiculous and nonsensical to want to try to, it is nevertheless quite essential that our chaps should know how those munitions function, and what their possibilities are. It is essential, because the time might come when they will need that knowledge. What is the easiest, the cheapest and the best way of acquiring that knowledge&#x003F; It is naturally by taking a course and becoming acquainted with it. This is by far and away the cheapest. I am therefore saying, Sir, that in order to achieve this purpose I should like to see quite a number of zeros being added to the figure which is at present indicated in the Estimates, even though these have to be taken from some other place. I hope the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to doing this.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member will pardon me if I do not refer in detail to his speech, except perhaps to say in passing that a great shock is awaiting him next year, since he has presumed to state that the electorate is behind him. If the hon. member is perhaps absent here at that stage he will have to come and find out what happened.</p>

<p>What I should like to discuss to-day is a matter which is very dear to us in the platteland, namely our commando system. I want to express my gratification at the fact that the old stigma which attached to the commandos is slowly but surely disappearing. I think I am justified in saying that we who were involved in the initial stages of the re-organization of the commandos, who took the courses, etc., are of the opinion that that old stigma is disappearing. We are grateful that we have our own training centre in the shape of the Danie Theron combat school at Kimberley &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; where our commandos are now receiving training on the basis which is adapted to the kind of defence they will have to undertake. I want to congratulate the Minister, as well as the High Command, on this step. In the past a deficiency definitely arose in regard to the training of commando members, officers as well as men. I had the privilege of attending quite a number of courses, and I always felt that there was a deficiency owing to the fact that one was actually receiving training in a direction which was not adjusted to the purpose of the commando system.</p>

<p>For the hon. member&#x2019;s information, I was Information Officer of my commando. I think it is perhaps more than he can say. Incidentally, I took it very much to heart that I had to resign as officer from the commando, because I was also Second-in-Command of the commando. We in the rural areas are very pleased that this tremendous adjustment and amendment in regard to the training of officers, as well as <span class="col_5267-5268" refersTo="page_1122"/>men, has taken place. I can give hon. members the assurance that, arising out of the reports which we receive from time to time from officers and men attending that military academy, they find it particularly instructive, and that they derive from it the true benefit of civil defence, the real purpose for which the commando system exists.</p>

<p>Over the years a certain degree of antipathy towards the commandos arose. It was a heartbreaking matter for us in the rural areas, who also wanted to play a part in the defence of our country. We always felt that we did not form part of the defence force. I attended two courses at Voortrekkerhoogte, Pretoria, and I must honestly say that as far as the officers were concerned we were well received, but that there was always a feeling that one was not altogether welcome. We were called &#x201C;commies&#x201D; as well as other names.</p>

<p>If the hon. member cannot understand what I was saying he should face the front. That antipathy has completely disappeared. I put it down to a proper, well-founded planning in regard to civil defence and the commandos. In the isolated parts of the Cape, however, we have a great many problems in regard to this commando system. I may perhaps be sticking my neck out too far, but I wondered whether the Minister would not at some time or other consider imposing a little more compulsion on able-bodied men to join commandos. In the old days we had what we called the Shooting Associations. We had a great time, shooting at targets, etc. We are still doing so to-day, thanks to concessions from the Minister. But in the rural areas a certain resistance has grown in some people as far as training is concerned. I wonder whether one cannot strengthen the commandos in the isolated rural areas by means of a certain degree of compulsion; for we are having a difficult time. I must admit we are even having a difficult time getting C commando up to full strength, particularly when the men have to cover long distances. However, I want to pay tribute to those who by way of voluntary entry rendered tremendous services, and particularly the commanding officers of commandos, who may have to make great sacrifices and contribute a good deal in order to expand the commandos to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>In passing I also want to express my gratitude, by way of regulation, Members of the House of Assembly, Provincial Council Members, Senators, etc. can once again participate to a certain extent in the affairs of commandos. and that we can, as in the old days, go and have an enjoyable time shooting and practising to be marksmen. We will still be able to handle a rifle if it should be necessary. I do not know whether some of the chaps will still be able to lie on their stomachs, but perhaps they will still be able to sit and shoot.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet on the commandos. I think every one of us who represent country seats, have a very real interest in the commando system of training. If it ever comes to trouble in this country and terrorist operations, the commandos are going to play a very important part indeed. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet asked whether it would not be possible to create a bit more interest in the commandos in some of the outlying areas. One of the points that seems to bother a lot of the young people that I speak to in the commandos, is that the training they undergo&#x2014;not the central training, but the camps that they have to go through every year &#x2014;seems to be confined to guard duty for one or two periods, and only the third one is out into the country to do manoeuvres and similar operations. I am quite certain that a lot of the feeling against commando duty is the fact that there is an excessive amount of guard duty that has to be done by commando trainees, as against the far more interesting, and I think the far more important, aspect of their training, which is to get them out into the countryside. Mr. Chairman. I want to make the point that the Commando trainees&#x2014;I think I am right: certainly in my area, anyway&#x2014;are mainly the people connected with farming. One of the matters that worries me a great deal about the training in our Army, is the fact that there are to-day so few of our white copulation who are connected with farming and at home in the countryside. I want to make the point that we in South Africa are to-day facing a threat which comes from the Chinese Communists. If there are going to be terrorist activities, it is going to be inspired by the Chinese Communists. The whole message that one gets through all the activities of Chinese Communists is that it is based on control of the countryside. We see it in Mocambique, Vietnam and wherever the Mao thought is in control of the situation. They want control of the countryside, because once they have gained control there, the towns fall into their hands like ripe fruit. It seems to me that we have to concentrate on the training of our infantry. The hon. member for Green Point referred to them as the cream of the Army. That is something which we can discuss at another time. However, the foot soldier is the only answer to terrorists and guerrilla <span class="col_5269-5270" refersTo="page_1123"/>activity of the sort that we have seen in our modern world inspired by the Chinese. The vehicle and the road can be made and has been made into an absolute deathtrap by well-organized guerrilla activity. The classic tactic is to strike at an isolated post of some sort and then ambush the major roads leading to it. This is something which we have to bear in mind when we are training our people. The mobility of the foot soldier has to be based to a large extent on his physical fitness and his ability to cover the ground as a foot soldier, because the vehicle while it can be used in certain areas as a means of transport, is so liable to ambush because it has to make use of certain tracks and certain roads sometimes through impassable territory.</p>

<p>When we talk about the commandos, in my area we have the Highway Commando, for instance, which covers the Pinetown area. We also have the Umkomaas Commando which covers the tremendous great valley of the Umkomaas itself which is ideal guerrilla territory, because it is heavily bushed and heavily wooded. It is country where people can hide out. I believe that the ideal training for the members of the commando would be to scout out now the difficult spots, the places where people can hide, on the ground so that when the time does come that there is that sort of trouble, they will be completely at home in the country that they will have to defend. I believe that this is something that we just have to keep in mind. The hon. member for Middelland mentioned the terrorist chief that came over to the Portuguese in Mocambique and said that he did not feel that this was the end of the story. I am quite certain that he is right. This is not the end of the story in Mocambique. The problem that we have to face, behind the beginning of the guerrilla activity, is what happened to the French in Vietnam where there was a screen of continuous guerrilla activity behind which the training of regular soldiers took place. What defeated the French was the emergence of a regular trained army. It was an army which was built on the foot soldier and on thousands and thousands of people who were forced to carry every single thing that was used by those soldiers: the food, the ammunition, the medicine and everything else to enable them to be mobile. I think that we have to study very carefully indeed and realize the implications of the campaigns that were fought in North Vietnam and are being fought to-day in South Vietnam, and to the north of us in Africa, to realize the immense mobility that dedicated fit foot soldiers have, moving through difficult terrain, and the surprising amount of logistical support that can be provided to these people by means of foot carriers, people who are conscripted or forced to carry the actual materials of war of the people who are functioning as guerrillas.</p>

<p>There is one other point, which is the question of the supply techniques by air to our own forces where they are mobile or where they are cut off in the extended areas where they are searching for these people who move about in this way. I think we are fortunate that a great deal of our country does not lend itself to guerrilla activity of this nature. But then we in Natal are in a particularly vulnerable position, because we are right up against the border of Portuguese East Africa. We have a tremendous amount of country which is ideal for this sort of operation. If one was looking out for places to stage operations of this nature to train our forces, Natal is the one place one could come to and find thousands and thousands of acres where one would be able to stage this sort of operation and train our forces in anti-terrorist activity. I believe that this is the direction in which we will have to look. I mention particularly our commando troops, because I feel that they, being so much better acquainted with their own locality, the area in which they reside and live, if they are specifically trained for that particular area, would have a far greater striking force in this kind of warfare than the regular army who have to be based in certain areas and still have to be transported to the areas where they are needed. The commandos are the chaps right there on the ground and should be ready at an instant&#x2019;s notice to participate in warfare of this kind. I do suggest to the hon. the Minister that he might consider that more time for training purposes be allocated to the commandos. The people called up in my area seem to spend much time in doing guard duty. I do not pretend to know everything about commando training, but as I understand it, the real nature of commando troops in the countryside should be to be a fit mobile striking force.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find it a pleasure to follow the hon. member for Mooi River to-night. I think the hon. member set an example of constructive criticism and recommendations as one would expect from the Opposition where they support every aspect of our Defence policy. The remarks he made were not of the same nature of those we had from certain other members of the House earlier this afternoon. I want to commend him for that. I think he did a proper job to-night. I want to associate myself with him as well as the hon. member for Middelland as regards the role the foot soldier should play. After all, it remains a military axiom that the Artillery and the Air Force can be used to strike hard and soften up the enemy, but that it is the foot soldier who consolidates the position and has to go in afterwards. That is why I am particularly glad of the announcement made by the hon. the Minister here this afternoon in connection with low-flying attacks and the weapon which had been developed to counteract such attacks. This weapon might still mean a great deal to us, but that does not mean that we should not apply our techniques and even this technique of low-flying attacks itself. I shall come back to this matter at a later stage.</p>

<p>In the first place, I should like to congratulate <span class="col_5271-5272" refersTo="page_1124"/>the Minister as well as the Air Force as a whole this afternoon. I want to congratulate them on the establishment of the advanced flying-school at Pietersburg. I have watched the whole of that operation since its beginning. I must say that the whole of the operation went off smoothly and effectively. It was really surprising. The Air Force had a very competent commanding officer there. His liaison work with not only the public of Pietersburg but also with others who were involved was particularly good. The result was that the public of Pietersburg was proud to welcome the members of the Air Force. The members of the Air Force, in turn, enjoyed the hospitality of Pietersburg. I can say that the members of the Air Force are quite happy there. Much has been said in this House about morale this afternoon. In this connection I can only say that the morale of the Air Force is as high as it was at any time during the war. I shall not say the morale is better, because it is a relative thing. The one was in wartime and the other is in peacetime. Nevertheless, the morale is extremely high. The Air Force base at Pietersburg became the home of, <i>inter alia,</i> the well-known and famous No. 1 Squadron of the Air Force. We are very proud to accommodate that Squadron at Pietersburg. In the second place, Pietersburg also became the home of an advanced flying-school for the training of pilots in advanced jet-flying techniques. In the third place, Pietersburg also became the home of a training-school for flying instructors in attack techniques. There is also a large radar unit at Pietersburg. One can therefore appreciate that the base at Pietersburg plays a particularly important role in the functional management of the Air Force and that it also plays a very important role in the general defence of the country as a whole. Problems are always experienced when a new base such as the one at Pietersburg is established. One of the problems we have there, is the problem of housing. That is why I want to express my gratitude to-night for the fact that an additional amount of R520,000 was provided in the Estimates for the erection of new single and married quarters. This amount is in addition to the amount of R300,000 which was appropriated previously. If this building complex is erected, I believe that housing will simply be a temporary problem and that the future will look after itself.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the White Paper which was issued. I want to associate myself with all the other hon. members in their praise of the White Paper. Personally, I think it is a most informative document. It is also a very timeous one. Every right-thinking and right-minded citizen of South Africa will feel proud when he reads the White Paper. He will also experience a feeling of safety because he knows that this Government is looking after the future of South Africa. However, there is one minor matter which causes me some concern. I want to refer specifically to the Air Force. We are all concerned about this; it is something that cannot be helped, namely the fact that we are so utterly dependent on foreign organizations for our aircraft. I want to refer to the assembly and the partial manufacture of the Impala training aircraft. This is an enormous breakthrough as far as we are concerned. We are very glad about it. But I want to advance a plea with the hon. the Minister to-night in respect of something which may have received his consideration already. I believe he has already discussed the matter with the Supreme Command. However, I feel I should raise this matter all the same. I want to advance a plea here for a major issue, namely a development programme for the design and possible manufacture of our own air-to-ground aircraft. It does not have to be such a sophisticated aircraft at this stage, but I appreciate that it is going to be an enormous programme, the cost of which will at least be between R3 and R4 million. If such a programme were to be initiated it would take at least four years from the day the first blue prints were prepared until we would be able to manufacture the first prototype. But we have to think big; we have to think seriously, because I am sure we have the scientific and technological know-how at our disposal. I say this because I believe in what I say. I should like to quote a few lines from paragraph 68 of the White Paper. It is stated there that &#x201C;As regards the acquisition of armaments the policy is to exploit our own scientific and industrial capacity as far as possible&#x201D;. I am virtually convinced that the way Atlas is constituted at the moment, it will be able to carry out such an order. I may be wrong, but I was told that Israel designed and manufactured a cargo plane in these times it is experiencing at present. This aircraft is able to take off and land within a short distance. If Israel can do this, I believe we have the technological ability to do the same. Such a breakthrough will free us from this octopus-like stranglehold of being dependent on foreign organizations. I want to add that there is a deficiency in our Air Force as regards our striking force from air to ground, particularly as far as unconventional warfare is concerned, which presents the major threat, rather than conventional warfare, as has been said by other hon. members. I believe we can safeguard ourselves even further by that means and I hope the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to initiating such a development programme. A programme of this nature may possibly be on its way already.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the dying hours of a Friday afternoon and with the parade about to be dismissed, I do not intend to follow on the questions which I have raised earlier this afternoon or the Minister&#x2019;s reply at this stage. I shall wait until we have heard from him further on Monday, and then I should like to follow up those matters. I should, however, like to associate myself with those who have commented on the welcome statements which were made by the Minister in regard to the new weapon system and the improvements in the pay structure. We shall have the opportunity to study the details more: carefully and then comment on them later.</p>

<p><span class="col_5273-5274" refersTo="page_1125"/>In regard to the question of training I should like to add two points. The first is in regard to selection boards. I do not want to go into a lot of detail; I have asked numerous questions about the selection and allocation of servicemen, but one thing worries me and that is that these boards apparently are at this stage not being designed to carry out the original intention. When we debated the amendments to the Defence Act, the hon. member for Kensington, who shares this bench with me, according to Volume 21 of Hansard, column 7452, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In other words, you would have representatives of the forces but also strong representation of the local civilian population, people who know the local circumstances &#x2026;</block>

<p>The Minister, in reply, and I quote from column 7457 from the same year, 1967, said:</p>

<block name="quote">That is precisely what we envisage.</block>

<p>In other words, bringing in people with local knowledge and knowledge of the people. In 1967, when we questioned the hon. the Minister, he said that he had not had the time and that it was a rush appointment and therefore they had only been able to use Permanent Force officers on the boards. However, another year is gone and on the 11th February this year I asked the hon. the Minister firstly how many selection boards were appointed during 1968. The hon. the Minister said that there had been 120. Secondly I asked the hon. the Minister how many of these persons were not members of the Permanent or citizen forces or officials in the Public Service. The answer was that there was none. In other words, this selection is being made entirely from one point of view, the point of view of the Army without taking advantage of the local knowledge which should be available. I appreciate that there is consultation with school principals but we asked that school principals should be co-opted to the boards, but the hon. the Minister refused that suggestion. Local people can give information on local conditions and on the backgrounds of the people involved. Admittedly there is tremendous competition for the Navy, and more people apply to go into the Navy than there are vacancies. But when one hears of a person with a completely naval background, for example sons of naval officers who themselves have had training in say fishing, yachting or skin diving, being posted to other units, whereas we hear of other people who have no link with the sea being put into the Navy, it makes one feel that the selection boards could well do with the advice of local people who, in regard to the individual youngsters, could advise the selection board. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to review his attitude in regard to these selection boards, and I should also like the hon. the Minister to carry out the undertaking which was given when the Bill was originally introduced.</p>

<p>The other matter I want to raise is the question of mid-year call-ups. When the Bill was originally introduced in this House, and in the discussions that followed, we were told that the later call-ups would mainly be comprised of Public Service personnel who would not suffer because they would be paid before and during their training. We were also told that as far as possible the later call-ups would come only from that group of people who would not be affected. Instead of that we find that persons who planned to take for instance a university course, or a course at the technical college, in other words people planning activities which necessitate them starting at the beginning of the academic year, are being called up, although they had said before the selection board that they intend to go to the university or technical college. I accept that when such a case is taken up, it can be put right. All the cases I have heard about, when taken up with the department, are transferred to start their training at the beginning of the year. However, there are many chaps who do not go to their M.P.s, who do not take up the case and they are adversely affected.</p>

<p>The problem with the midyear call-ups is that these persons cannot get work say from January to May. No employer wants to take on somebody who is going to be called up in a few months time and who will then be away for nine months. It is creating a great deal of hardship. But what is worse, these lads are hanging around for five months without a job and tending to get in with the wrong crowd and get into trouble. Numerous parents have spoken to me about the problem. They say, &#x201C;My son spends the day on the beach; he cannot get a proper job. He had a temporary job. but he gave it up.&#x201D; Idle hands lead to mischief and they tend to hang around without keeping themselves occupied and therefore they often get themselves into trouble. I am worried about this and I feel that we should be able to meet a great deal of the requirements from those who were originally contemplated. We were given the assurance that all the mid-year call-ups could come from Public Service sources. We should at least try to do something about this blank gap, which means that a boy does not only lose a year <i>of</i> his life, but in fact a year and a half. I do not want to go in any further upon the training aspect. However, I do want to follow up one or two points which have been made earlier in this debate.</p>

<p>There seems to be an extraordinary sensitivity to any sort of criticism on the part of hon. members and the Minister himself. I do <span class="col_5275-5276" refersTo="page_1126"/>not know what hon. members such as the hon. member for Pietersburg, who spoke last, expect; do they expect everybody to get up and do nothing but praise the Minister and praise the department&#x003F; Every time there is criticism there is a squeal to high heaven. We are entitled to raise criticism.</p>

<p>I refer to question No. 10 of the 14th March. This question dealt with an approach by the <i>Sunday Times</i> for information on aircraft. The information had been published overseas, it had been broadcast overseas, but the Minister refused to allow this newspaper to publish it. A few days later he suddenly found that it was in the national interest that it should be released. It was, however, released to another group of newspapers. We criticized the question of the Minister&#x2019;s power of censorship at the time. I think he is carrying it too far. I, for instance, asked a question about the various strengths of the Permanent Force, and the hon. the Minister said that it was not considered in the public interest to give these figures. However, here in the Budget all the figures are given. On the 21st March it was not advisable, but when the Budget was issued it was advisable, because the number of officers and the other ranks are all clearly stated. But a few weeks before it was not in the public interest to give it. I do not believe that that is how the Minister should control censorship and secrecy. He is carrying it to extremes.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when one has a good case, one does not mind receiving criticism. Therefore we on this side of the House do not mind at all if hon. members on the other side criticize us from now until next week. The hon. the Minister has never hesitated one moment to spend all his time dealing with every point of criticism and replying to it fully. I think the hon. member for Durban (Point) should not be so sensitive, because what does he do&#x003F; He comments on the translation of the White Paper. We have no objection against comments that the translation of the White Paper could perhaps have been worded differently here and there. Let us keep this discussion on a high level. The example mentioned by the hon. member is that of a person whose English does not seem to be too good, which has nothing to do with the White Paper at all. He quoted the order issued by a Commando C.O. as an example, knowing full well that one could do the same by comparing the Afrikaans of an English-speaking person. This was the objection, and the sensitivity mentioned by the hon. member has nothing to do with criticism of the Budget. If one wants to politicize in this way, as the hon. member for Simonstown also wanted to do here this afternoon in the case dealt with by the hon. the Minister, then it is not a case of sensitivity on our part, and we shall reply to them on it. Hon. members opposite must not think that we will take actions of this kind lying down. This is what it is about. It has nothing to do with sensitivity. Our case is so sound that we are not sensitive when criticism is expressed.</p>

<p>I still have a minute or two left and I want to try to finish a matter which I was discussing with the hon. the Minister when my time expired earlier this afternoon. I was discussing the matter with the Minister and I should like to complete it now. This matter is in connection with the establishment of the girls&#x2019; unit. I was explaining why Potchefstroom is so excellently situated with all the facilities in the cultural and other fields for the establishment of such a girls&#x2019; unit. I should like to take this further now. [Interjection.] Unfortunately the hon. member for Durban (Point) has no idea what this is all about, because he has never heard of this. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to look at the matter from another angle as well. Potchefstroom is situated on the perimeter of the Vaal Triangle, where one-third of the white population of South Africa lives. Can the hon. the Minister and the Government not consider establishing two of these units in due course&#x003F; One could be situated in the southern part of the country, somewhere in the Cape Province, and the other at the place I have requested. These girls will have to travel long distances by train. If one such unit can be established here in the Western Cape somewhere, where there is a large concentration of Whites, and another one at a place like Potchefstroom, for instance, then these units will be at the two poles. Young men and boys do not mind travelling a thousand miles by train, but we should not like girls to have to undertake such long journeys unnecessarily.</p>

<speech by="#pieterse">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. J. PIETERSE</person>:</from>

<p>If we were to give every week a name according to the most important events of that week, then I think we could have called last week the S.A. Defence Force Week. It was truly a week of a series of unparalleled highlights. Firstly we had Admiral Gnavi of Argentina here on a visit, and that shows us what close ties of friendship have been knit with other countries in the Southern Hemisphere, and one would like to express the hope that this will happen on an even larger and more general scale. After that we had the White Paper on Defence and Armaments Production, and how inspiring that was. What authority and confidence it inspired! It is very clear that the S.A. Defence Force has teeth, and our enemies will have to take cognizance of that fact. They will have to ponder this fact and reflect at great length; otherwise they will he sharpening their knives in vain, we will be too much for them.</p>

<p>This was followed by the announcement by the hon. the Minister in regard to the guided missile. It was a wonderful announcement and it is clear that a rash and foolhardy aggressor will find that it has bitten off more than it can chew and will very quickly come down with certain allergies. I should like to extend my sincere congratulations to the hon. the Minister, as well as to the men of the S.A. Defence Force and the scientists who developed this weapon, and wish them everything of the best for the future. They are playing an important role and form a major link in the defence chain of our Defence Force.</p>

<p>In addition I cannot help paying a word of tribute in passing to our dynamic Army with its dynamic young group of officers. One expects a great deal from them still. With so many young people at the helm and with such brainpower, things simply cannot go wrong in our Defence Force, and our country has a firm foundation on which to build.</p>

<p>Since the amount of R1,390,000 is being requested in these Estimates for the specific purpose of being used at Voortrekkerhoogte for housing purposes, electricity supply, roads, etc., I should like to dwell for a moment on this matter. Almost half of this amount is to be spent on housing, and this gives one cause to feel grateful. One likes to see that these people are well accommodated, and at a reasonable rent. Here the Department of Defence has already accomplished a great deal, and a good policy has progressed far along the road to completion.</p>

<p>At present the houses are being allocated on a points system and the man with longer service has the advantage because he receives 10 points for every completed month of service and he even receives special point allocations after 20 or 30 years&#x2019; service, and then of course he also receives recognition for children. This is the best and the fairest system because if affords recognition to the man who joins the Defence Force and stays there, and to my way of thinking this is an excellent way of recognizing, and consequently, of rewarding faithful service. These people understand this method and accept it.</p>

<p>Those who are not accommodated at Voortrekkerhoogte know that it is merely a question of time, and they believe that, just like the faithful, they must not be hasty. But there are nevertheless people here who feel that the fact that they are caught up in this interim position requires a new approach, and perhaps a more sympathetic one. I am thinking for example of newly married couples, of people with large families who do not have so many years of service behind them. They have only recently entered the Army and do not have sufficient points to make provision for their large families, and must therefore rent houses outside Voortrekkerhoogte. If any concession could possibly be made in this regard it would be very welcome. I should like to refer here to the example of what is being done in the Public Service, where there is a concession in the form of a subsidy in respect of the rate of interest on their loans.</p>

<p>Then I also want to point out that there is an amount of R100,000 in the Estimates for the improvement of electrical installations in domestic buildings. This is very welcome, because it is really necessary in many of the older buildings that improvements be made. It has always been striking that on one side of Voortrekkerhoogte one can find the most modern equipment, such as the Mirage for example, and on the other one can find other articles which are a little bit older, such as a coal stove. These people will appreciate it very much if this contradiction in terms can be eliminated and if more hygienic circumstances and amenities can be supplied by eliminating those coal stoves.</p>

<p>Another major improvement is the amount of R37,000 on the Estimates which will be used to improve roads and services. It is felt that the new ideas in respect of township development, where the services on the roads are completed before the houses, are good ideas and the correct ones. The snag is simply that the older areas, which are already lagging behind, lag further and further behind because all the attention on development is concentrated in the newer areas. This amount of R37,000 is to make up the backlog, and it is a very good idea. One can perhaps think in terms of increasing this amount a little in future, because there are still a good number of roads which <span class="col_5279-5280" refersTo="page_1128"/>have not yet been developed. I am thinking here for example of the road to Kempheuwel.</p>

<p>Another matter which I should like to mention to the hon. the Minister, relates to the Defence Force Medical Continuation Fund. When the present dispensation came into effect in January 1964 there were a few men who, without a break in their service, had at that date already been taken into the service of the Defence Force under section 20. I want to emphasize that there was no break in service. The line must be drawn somewhere, and the date which was subsequently chosen was January 1964. The consequence is that they and their families and not enjoying benefits under the Medical Continuation Fund which are being enjoyed by people who joined subsequently. If the hon. the Minister could ascertain how many people are involved in this and whether they cannot be accommodated, these people who approached me in regard to the matter would appreciate it very much indeed.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>If there is one matter which is of concern to all of us, then it is the adequate defence of our country. I think our objective in this regard would be the same too. We would like to achieve the optimum effort with the least waste of manpower and with as little expenditure as possible of our natural resources. It is in this connection that I would like to put one or two proposals before this Committee.</p>

<p>I think it is generally accepted nowadays that wars are won and lost and that conflict is resolved in the international field not so much as a result of the use of physical manpower but rather as a result of a country&#x2019;s industrial capacity and its economic staying power. All power in a certain sense derives from economic power, and what I believe is important is that our economic potential should be increased all the time. In this sense the fundamental choice that we face as a nation is the ratio that we should set between gold and lead, or to put it more appropriately, between bullion and bullets. It is this ratio which is of major consequence to us. As I have said before, our best long-term defence is our economic strength. We all accept it that portion of our national capacity should be diverted into defence activity, but the choice that is before us is what particular portion should be so diverted.</p>

<p>To see this in its perspective, I think one could put it as follows: All defence expenditure is basically inflationary, so we do not want to spend more than is absolutely necessary in terms of the obligations that we will have to meet. Inflation is, of course, a major problem that we face in this country. I think defence expenditure is also economically unproductive in this sense that it does not yield revenue. If I buy a machine too, it is economically a productive investment, because I can use this machine tool to manufacture other items. But if I invest in a machine gun, then it is not revenue producing and economically it is unproductive because a machine gun cannot manufacture anything; all that it can do is to fire bullets. This means not further revenue but further expenditure. Accordingly it is important for every country to determine what portion of its national wealth it should divert to this defence commitment. Sir, it is customary for nations to express this in terms of the amount that they spend, and they normally express it as a percentage of the gross national product. In the White Paper which we have before us we are told that we are at present spending 2&#x00BD; per cent of our gross national product on defence. This seems an insignificant amount in order to safeguard our long-term security. But, Sir, 2&#x00BD; per cent of our gross national product is a relative figure. It is only slightly less than we spend on education; it is certainly more than we spend on basic research, and at 270 odd million rand, which is the nature of our defence budget, we are spending on defence close on 17 per cent of total State expenditure on Revenue Account. In this sense it therefore becomes a very sizeable amount.</p>

<p>But I want to suggest to this Committee that even this amount is only the direct amount that we devote to Defence; that there are certain other hidden costs, because in our particular case where our forces consist of a small Permanent Force element and a very much bigger Citizen Force element, we divert large numbers of people from the productive sector away from productive tasks. If we allow for this in its economic totality, we find that we spend not only 2&#x00BD; per cent of our G.N.P. on defence, but twice as much or even three times as much. Therefore, it is an investment of very considerable consequence. I believe that our country should from time to time review whether we are making the best possible use of our economic and strategic resources. This is an issue which one cannot leave to the defence staff only, because by the very nature of these matters, they will tend to overinsure. I want to propose that the Government should consider appointing at the highest possible level a Strategic Resources Advisory Council which would go well beyond the idea of a Defence Council. This body would operate at the highest possible level. Not only would the defence staff and other interests be represented on such a council, but also our top economists. They should be represented because in the ultimate sense our defence activity is an economic commitment. This is the thought which I, in the first place, should like to put before this committee.</p>

<p>Going hand in hand with this is the question of the composition of our defence services. This, I am sure, is largely a function of the assessment which we make of the sort of strategic situation we shall have to face. Generally speaking, it seems that we are facing three sets of eventualities, first of all, conventional warfare, secondly unconventional warfare and thirdly a combination of the first <span class="col_5281-5282" refersTo="page_1129"/>two. More and more knowledgeable people suggest that unconventional warfare is the type of warfare we might have to face. If this were the case it would further strengthen my argument. For years our Defence Force consisted of a small Permanent Force element. It consisted of an administrative, a training nucleus and a very much bigger active citizen service. The old system has served us well in the past, but I suggest that the time might have arrived where we should review this situation. I believe that the ratio which obtains at the moment might well have to be changed. To begin with, warfare is changing and we need the professional element, a bigger Permanent Force. We want a strong, mobile, highly trained force that could deal with any incursion into South Africa instantly, and see to it that the spark does not become a conflagration. Nobody here can deny that a professional element will be better placed to cope with this sort of situation. Seen against the broader economic canvas of South Africa, it will also cost us far less. If we were to change the ratio and have a bigger Permanent Force element and a small Citizen Force element, we shall be able to pay for it more than adequately when these hidden economic costs to which I have referred, are taken into consideration. Therefore, I suggest that we should consider a change in the ratios which obtain at the moment. We should work in the direction of a bigger Permanent Force and a smaller Citizen Force.</p>

<p>I can think of only one objection which might be held, and that is that it may be said we shall not be able to obtain these people. We cannot fill all the vacancies at the moment. That might well be so, but if the Permanent Force wants to fill all these vacancies, it would have to become competitive. This is not just a question of what the people are paid, but also of the fringe benefits which go hand in hand with salaries. I cannot comment on the rates of pay, because the hon. the Minister has just announced new rates and we must first of all study the effects the introduction of such rates might have. However, I want to refer to one fringe issue namely housing. In the White Paper it is said that the Cabinet has accepted that housing will be stepped up from 60 per cent to 100 per cent. This sounds very good, but at the moment we are nowhere near to 60 per cent. I say this, because recently I asked the question of how many married Permanent Force personnel are in fact housed in married quarters. Only in one grade did it exceed 60 per cent, and that was warrant officers, where the figure of 61.3 per cent was given. Of the generals, only 52.6 per cent are housed in married quarters. For privates it is as low as 11.3 per cent. The average would therefore be a low one unless we have an army which has more generals than privates. What I am trying to suggest is that a tremendous backlog has to be made good. At the moment it seems to me that the average number of people who are housed is in fact very much below the 60 per cent mark shown in the White Paper. I asked the hon. the Minister quite recently what percentage of people who have resigned were actually living in married quarters. The hon. the Minister replied that 3 per cent of them were not living in married quarters. Surely, this is not correct, because by implication it means that 97 per cent of those people who resign from the Permanent Force are housed in married quarters. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not try to reply to the points which have just been raised by the hon. member for Hillbrow. I think the hon. the Minister will reply to them. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the inhabitants of the Republic of South Africa have a sense of safety and security to-day in this country in which we live. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the inhabitants of South Africa have this sense of safety not because of indifference or plain over-confidence, but because we know that we have attained the highest standard of military preparedness, thanks to his dynamic leadership and the watchfulness of the Department of Defence. We are very much aware of the unrest and tension in the world. In spite of this, I say, we are enjoying this safety, even though we know that threats are directed at South Africa from time to time. Our sense of safety and security is based on the standard of military preparedness which we have achieved in South Africa, thanks to the training received by our boys in all the divisions of our Defence Force. We have a high regard for the way in which our boys are being trained, the way in which their services are being employed in the time they have at their disposal. We also know that heavy demands are being made on the boys of South Africa as a result of the great economic development and expansion in South Africa. But in spite of that our young men are being trained and made fit for military service. We are grateful for this, and we highly appreciate it. In fact, this is what our sense of security and safety in South Africa is based on.</p>

<p>Sir, there is however a deficiency which I should like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s notice. I want to ask whether the time has not arrived for a proper and thorough investigation to be made into the training of our girls in South Africa in this field, so that they may train and equip themselves for a time of crisis that may occur. May it never occur, but if it does, they would then be trained and equipped and would know how to act and how to conduct themselves at such a time. I want to say at once that I am not asking for the feminity of our girls to be destroyed. I am not asking that we should turn our girls into hard militarists. Israel is often held up as an example to us. I am not going to plead for that and ask that it be applied here as well. I am asking whether the time has not arrived for a thorough investigation to be ordered into the possibility of training our girls, so that we <span class="col_5283-5284" refersTo="page_1130"/>may afford recognized women&#x2019;s organizations in South Africa the opportunity of expressing their views on this matter. It is my experience that there is a growing desire amongst the girls themselves to undergo this form of training. I have wondered whether we should not consider the possibility of introducing short courses during vacations at which our girls can receive the necessary instruction so that they will know how to act in times of crises if these should occur. This desire on the part of our girls is not simply a matter of seeking adventure. It springs from heartfelt patriotism, a feeling of love for the fatherland; they feel they also want to make their contribution if necessary. I want to say at once that in wanting to do this we do not want to prejudice the primary function and purpose, the natural function of our girls. It is their function in the first place to be on guard at the cradle of our nation. The wife and mother must see to it that South Africa will have the young men to train for the defence of their country. We have no intention of attacking anybody else; our only endeavour is to defend our country and everything that is holy to us. That is why the girls of our country feel the need to be instructed and trained to be able to contribute their share. The hon. the Minister explained here last Friday why our submarines have been named after noble women from our history, women who played their part in South Africa. There was a time in the history of South Africa when women also played their part in the military field and made a contribution to safeguard South Africa.</p>

<p>If we are reading the signs of the times correctly, we do not foresee a conventional war. We are expecting something more in the nature of guerrilla warfare, more specifically terrorism. We have learnt that the terrorist does not attack people who are capable of defending themselves, that they declare war not on those who can defend themselves, but on the defenceless. Therefore I think the time has come for us to investigate ways and means of training the South African woman to defend herself and her family in a time of crisis and when her husband is away. I am asking for an investigation so that recognized women&#x2019;s organizations may give their views on this matter. I think it should be practicable to train and instruct our girls over short periods, such as during vacations. They can join civil protection societies afterwards so that they can make a contribution in every area in which they happen to be. Our girls are definitely keen to receive this training, and therefore I plead with the Minister to have the matter investigated. On this basis we can build up South Africa to the maximum state of military preparedness of which we are capable, not for the purpose of attacking other countries, but for the purpose of defending ourselves in any crisis that may arise.</p>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s announcement of increased scales of pay for members of the Permanent Force is, of course, welcomed by us on this side of the House. These improved pay conditions will obviously ensure a more efficient and larger Permanent Force. This does not necessarily follow that we should have a smaller Active Citizen Force. On the contrary, I do not believe we should reduce the size and numbers of our Defence Force at all. However, with a stronger and larger Permanent Force our Active Citizen Force may possibly not require a lengthy period of training. But on this score, time will show.</p>

<p>I want to come to another problem, a problem which faces many of us during the recess; it is in connection with the calling up of our young men for training in the Active Citizen Force. We have selection committees or Selection Boards, moving from one school to the other, meeting the boys who are leaving school, discussing defence problems with them and finding out from them, what period will suit them best to do their training. This system of having select committees to interview the boys is a good system. The prospective trainees have to fill in forms stipulating the time that will suit them best for their training. We have, generally speaking, two groups of boys&#x2014;those who want to go to university and those who do not. I have so often seen that boys who do not intend going to a university are called up to commence their training early in January, normally from the 7th, 8th or 9th January, and that boys who intend going to a university are called up only round about the middle of the year to start their training in July. This can cause a lot of inconvenience to our civilian public, and often, we as members of Parliament are confronted with the necessity of having to contact the Exemption Board in Pretoria, which, I must say, has been willing at all times to assist us. I want to pay tribute to the assistance which this board has given me personally in the past, but I believe it is quite unnecessary that such a problem should arise. What should be done is that those boys who stipulated that they want to go to university should be given preference for the training period commencing in early January, so that they can complete their period of training before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one of the most important facets of our Defence Force is probably the fifth branch, i.e. civil defence. The fundamental principle of this has as its object the protection and safeguarding of our civilian population. Civilians are to an increasing extent becoming victims of war conditions. In earlier days this was not so much the case as it is to-day. It has become essential that that aspect of defence receive the necessary attention. Every country of the world sees to it that it is combat ready in that sphere, and that they do not become complacent, because complacency is the enemy of watchfulness. We in South Africa find ourselves in a fortunate position. Wars were last waged here many years ago, approximately 60 years ago. Although a natural disaster recently struck Port Elizabeth it is not often that such disasters occur in South Africa. For the public outside therefore there is no immediate threat. But this situation can change overnight. Then we must be prepared. We must therefore regard this as a major task and as a challenge, i.e. to make the public more aware, and have them take an interest in this aspect of defence and of our defence force. The reasons why there is such a lack of interest in civil defence is precisely because things are going so well for this country in which we are living. Things are going so well for us, and that is why people are in fact complacent. This afternoon I want, in particular to make an appeal to the Press to cooperate in the national interest on this facet of our existence. I feel that our newspapers are not devoting sufficient space to this matter, and that this extremely important aspect of our defence is not written about sufficiently. I want to ask the Press whether it is not possible for them to make place in their newspapers for a weekly column dealing with this matter. It is necessary for the public to be motivated. We have found that if the Press is asked to insert an advertisement in regard to certain activities, a small advertisement is hidden away somewhere in the newspaper. No prominence is given to such advertisements. I want to address a very friendly request to the Press to give more prominence to advertisements dealing with such activities. We have the same thing happening when reports on such activities are printed in the newspapers. When demonstrations are given in a certain area the Press is very reluctant to accept invitations to such functions to take photographs and publish reports so that the people can in this way be motivated. The newspaper men will know how to present a matter like this in the newspaper, so that the interested people can be roused in this way. <i>Inter alia,</i> far more prominence could be given to the passing out of firefighting groups. The Press could also have given more prominence to the matter when the State handed over 61 fire engines at a cost of R800,000 to local authorities. The same applies to our radio services. We think that we could make far more use of the radio to stir people&#x2019;s interest. The local authorities can conduct more firefighting demonstrations, in conjunction with our war liaison officers and at the same time as our ward demonstrations, and here people in high authority can play a role when attending such functions.</p>

<p>I have wondered whether my hon. colleagues, the members of the House of Assembly, would not be interested in our getting together a team of members of Parliament on a firefighting course and using the publicity for this in the Press to activate people. In addition there are the provincial authorities who could take a greater interest and who could take the initiative in this connection. I feel that the Government has done what it possibly could. I am convinced that the hon. the Minister will shortly make a certain statement because I know that this matter is occupying his serious attention. Turning our attention to those fire engines which were handed over, if those vehicles cannot be manned, they cannot be utilized, and that is why we need the manpower of volunteers who must take a greater interest. We are thinking of the industrialists and businessmen who could also give greater attention to encouraging their employees to take an interest in civil defence. There could also be a great deal more interest in the classes which can be attended by civilians, so that we will be prepared.</p>

<p>It is with appreciation that I also want to take cognizance of the study group which has been sent overseas, accompanied by a competent engineer, to investigate shelters. I think that a great deal can be done in this regard as well in South Africa. However, I want to express my thanks to all the volunteers who have already equipped themselves in this direction. I want to convey my thanks, particularly to the liaison officers who have done hard work and who have remained remarkably patient, the same applies to the officials in the Civil Defence section, who have up to now evinced a great deal of patience. Then there is something I am very pleased about, and that is that the Minister of Defence and the Department are co-operating with the Department of Education. I am thinking here of the youth defence programme into which investigations are being instituted and recommendations made in regard to the cadet training for young boys, the protection corps for young girls, first aid, firefighting, and rescue work, and the instruction and training of officers. I want once again, if these steps have been taken, to activate the public and did not succeed, to make an appeal to the Minister of Defence to consider making it compulsory. We ascertained as long ago as 1966, when it fell under the present Prime Minister as Minister of Justice, that he predicted that something like this could possibly take place.</p>

<p>In the course of my observations I shall refer to certain aspects of those matters to which the hon. member for Hercules referred, and I shall therefore not reply to him now. As far as the <span class="col_5287-5288" refersTo="page_1132"/>hon. member for East London (North) is concerned, I just want to say that it is not correct that prospective students are treated in that way. The position is that, if a prospective student indicates that he wants to attend a university, he has two alternatives. He can either choose to complete his year&#x2019;s training immediately and is then called up in January, or he is afforded the opportunity of attending the Commando Combat School. In other words, the policy is that prospective students have a choice. If such a person wants to go to university immediately, he has to say so, and if it is at all possible he goes to the Commando Combat School. There he receives a very short basic training course and he performs certain services before the university starts. But he is not called up in the middle of the year.</p>

<p>No, that is not so. It happens in a few cases where there is lack of clarity. The hon. member must take my word for it that in cases where this is brought to our notice, it is rectified immediately, but these people should after all have some knowledge of the provisions of the Defence Act; they should not sit still when they are called up in error. But a student has a choice; he may say &#x201C;I want to complete my year&#x2019;s training before I go to university.&#x201D; This happens to thousands of young men who prefer to complete the year&#x2019;s training first, and this is very good for them.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to approach this whole discussion from a different angle to-day. When we discuss Defence in general and the Defence Force in particular, there are a few basic premises we should bear in mind. The first of these is that the Defence Force and the defence of our country is not merely aimed at, in the first place, building up a war machine. I think the impression has been created in some of the speeches made here that we still have the old mentality which prevailed in South Africa, i.e. that a defence force and a defence policy are aimed at establishing a war machine only, and I think that we should accept right from the start that that is not the exclusive object of a defence policy and of a defence force. We are not looking for war. Those words of the hon. the Prime Minister have been recorded in the White Paper. We want to avert war as far as possible, and that is why the Defence Force is only in the last instance an instrument of war. But it has many other tasks in pursuance of our policy; it has many other service levels on which it makes its contribution to the country&#x2019;s security and its defence. Viewed against the background of our ideal in South Africa, i.e. to bring about and maintain economic and political stability in our own country but also to help to ensure this in Southern Africa, our defence policy and a strong Defence Force constitute an important contributory factor towards guaranteeing and helping to guarantee such economic and political stability. That is why I agree with what one of the hon. members said here, i.e. that one needs economic power to establish a strong defence force, but, on the other hand, one also needs a strong defence force in order to ensure economic stability in the times in which we are living. That is why we are continually taking into account the needs of other State institutions as well as our own economic capacity when we determine the needs of the Defence Force. I think it was the hon. member for Hillbrow who referred to what we said in the White Paper in respect of the expenditure on defence in comparison with the national product. The hon. member should compare the expenditure on defence as against the national product in South Africa, with that of other countries. I have here a very lengthy list of countries in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and from this one sees that South Africa is one of the countries whose expenditure on defence in comparison with its national product is amongst the lowest in the world. In other words, the accusation cannot be levelled that we are spending unprecedented amounts which <span class="col_5289-5290" refersTo="page_1133"/>are disproportionate to our other economic needs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, but the hon. member referred to it. I could not understand what he wanted to say by making that point. Immediately after the hon. member referred to that, he advocated a permanent force because, and this is all I could infer, he adopted the attitude that certain expenditure on defence would be inflationary. Material purchased abroad for the Defence Force, does not contribute to inflation. As certain expenditure on defence is unproductive, and not all such expenditure is unproductive, the hon. member advocated a bigger permanent force. However, it would cost R2&#x00BD; million per year to maintain a permanent force battalion. What deterrent value does one permanent force battalion have&#x003F; For this reason I say that the expenditure which is at the moment being incurred on the present basis in respect of our defence policy&#x2014;i.e. a nucleus which consists of our Defence Force, in which the majority of our expert leaders have been included, and a national service system which maintains the Citizen Force and the commando systems and which is therefore based on the idea of a national army&#x2014;does in actual fact only represent 2.5 per cent of the total national product in South Africa. The percentages in respect of other countries are as follows: Spain 2.3, Switzerland 2.4, Denmark 2.6, Belgium 2.8, Italy 2.9, Norway 3.7, Sweden 3.9, The Netherlands 4. West Germany 4.3, Greece 4.5, Yugoslavia 4.7, France 5.3, Britain 5.7, Portugal 6.7, Bulgaria 3, Rumania 3.1, Poland 5.4 and Russia 9.6. And so I could quote many other figures. Therefore I think that the amount which South Africa is spending on defence under our present system is by no means disproportionate to our national product. Due regard is in fact being had to South Africa&#x2019;s economic needs and regard is also being had to what other State Departments require from us. Regard is also being had to what the Government has to do in respect of education and other important service levels of its activities. The Government is acting in a responsible manner as far as our expenditure on defence is concerned. In other words, the present system cannot be criticized as being excessively expensive. That is the point we made in the White Paper.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a strong, balanced defence force and in addition to that, as we are developing at present, an armaments production organization, which is more and more being geared for making South Africa self-sufficient in the sphere of important strategic materials, are important instruments in the hands of the Government, not only for preparing for war, but also for being used in improving and developing international relations. In this regard I want to give a few examples. In the first place, I want to refer to an article which was written recently&#x2014;in March, 1969&#x2014;and which appeared in a booklet, entitled &#x201C;The United States Naval Institute Proceedings&#x201D;. This important article was written by Vice-Admiral Schofield. He gave a survey of the position in the present circumstances. In this article he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When three years ago the Soviet navy finally discarded the defensive policy which for centuries had been its role and assumed an offensive posture it thereby greatly increased the options open to it of bringing pressure to bear on the West and by expanding its area of operations created a problem regarding the protection of shipping routes which has so far been ignored, but for which a solution must be found.</block>

<p>He went on and referred to the increase in shipping. In this regard he said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">As populations grow and industries expand the importance of sea-borne trade is enhanced and this can be seen from the increase during the last 20 years in world shipping which has risen from 29,340 ships totalling 80 million gross registered tons in 1948, to 44,000 ships totalling 182 million gross registered tons in 1967. The total world sea-borne trade which in 1964 amounted to 1,480 million metric tons is increasing at an average rate of 9 per cent per annum. Of this total about 60 per cent is accounted for by oil, the balance of 40 per cent being dry cargo.</block>

<p>In other words, as a result of the industrialization in the world and, on the other hand, the awakening of Russia to the fact that it had to develop into an aggressive maritime power, the sea routes of the world have become so much more important. In this article the author deals with the idea that there are vacuums which have to be filled and that the world should not adopt an attitude of aloofness towards the necessity of facing up to the problems and dangers which are going to arise as a result of this development. The point I want to make is that a balanced defence force with its armaments production is a handy instrument in the hands of any government, and also in those of the South African Government, for establishing those international friendly ties and alliances which are necessary, especially as viewed from South Africa&#x2019;s strategic position, to enable us to play a proper part in regard to this problem to which I have just referred. That is why the Defence Force paid naval visits to the Argentine and also to Australia, to which hon. members also referred appreciatively. That is why we have just proceeded to approving a R12 million project, which has already been started, i.e. to establish in South Africa maritime headquarters which will be amongst the most modern of their kind in the world. This project will enable to us to render a key contribution in the sphere of maritime defence. This is not only viewed from the angle of the <span class="col_5291-5292" refersTo="page_1134"/>security of South Africa, but also from the angle of being able to render a service to the shipping of the free world. That is why it is an important instrument for establishing ties of friendship with countries which have common interests with South Africa. In the second place, the fact that we have also made progress in respect of our armaments production, enables us to develop international ties of friendship, because in co-operating with other countries we acquire the know-how which we require in some cases. Organizations which have that know-how, make their investments in South Africa and in that way they transfer their know-how to our country. In this respect it is a handy instrument for establishing ties of friendship with other countries in the diplomatical sphere.</p>

<p>There is a fourth aspect. This is the contact which exists between the Defence Force staff &#x2014;not only the combat officer, but also the experts in the Defence Force&#x2014;and their counterparts elsewhere in the world. This renders an important contribution towards the strengthening of diplomatic relations with those countries with which co-operation is sought. In other words, the Defence Force is not merely a war machine, but it also serves the country in a much wider field. In conducting a debate on the interests of the Defence Force, we should not look upon it as an instrument which calls up a young man in order to train him for a few months. We should not look upon it as an instrument which teaches a young man how to use a rifle so that he may fight in a war. In this world in which we are living it has acquired a much more extensive task. In this regard it is also interesting to see to what extent we are bringing this idea home to influential circles. I am referring here to an article which was published on 28th February this year. This article was written by General S. L. H. Marshall, a world famous author, a strategist and a man whose opinion is held in high esteem internationally. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When a line is drawn through the top of Africa, across the Arabian Peninsula, to the corner where Iran meets West Pakistan, with this base, the one point at Karachi, and the other at the Canary Islands, a triangle is projected evenly towards the Cape. Much open ocean is enclosed, as well as a twelfth or thereabouts of the earth&#x2019;s surface. With Aden out, now that the British are yielding it to the Arabs, the only modern and friendly parts are in Southern Africa. Simonstown, 30 miles from Cape Town, is the only great naval base and graving yard in that quarter of the world. The United States must not discount the connection between such a facility and the conserving of its world-wide strategic interests. In the event of a major war in the Middle East, a struggle over Iraq, for example, in which our forces might become engaged, we would have to lean on that prop, since we have done so before.</block>

<p>In other words, in these circles of people who can speak with authority, the idea is gaining ground, for diplomatic reasons, that for reasons in the interests of trade and for reasons of greater co-operation in the free world, the contribution of the South African Defence Force is playing a progressively greater role. In that spirit we must consider the contribution we are discussing here to-day.</p>

<p>Fifthly, the acquisition and the application of modern weapons, as well as the acquisition of know-how for manufacturing such equipment in South Africa, are an important contribution to us, both scientifically and in the sphere of engineering. The young men who are being called up for a year, not only for military service, but also for national service, gain and acquire know-how in this process. Once they have completed their first year of service and return to civilian life, they are more mature and are able to make a greater contribution in the professions they are going to follow. That cannot be bought with money. I can illustrate to hon. members what is being done at the Commando Combat School. I can illustrate to hon. members what is being accomplished at our infantry schools, naval schools, air force schools and other military schools in the form of know-how and spiritual growth, through which those young men become an asset upon returning to civilian life. That cannot be bought with money.</p>

<p>But, in the sixth place, to-day our Defence Force is no longer based on the old ballot system, which only envisaged the training of the youth for military purposes. I hope that we have now reached this stage where even members of Parliament who are still using the word &#x201C;ballot system&#x201D; will stop doing so. Newspapers which are still writing about the &#x201C;ballot system&#x201D; should kindly wake up now. The ballot system came to a blissful end 14 months ago. We have a national service system. National service implies something which is different from the ballot system with its military training for a few months.</p>

<p>National service is, in the first place, service to the country in handling and helping to protect expensive equipment, for that equipment is the property of the nation. These goods to the value of R2,000 million which are at South Africa&#x2019;s disposal in the form of sophisticated war and defence materials, are being maintained, cared for and protected by means of the national service system. In the second place, national service is a process whereby the young man is made more mature physically and spiritually and whereby he becomes a better citizen of his country. In the third place, national service is a system which creates opportunities through which young men acquire skill and know-how, which benefit them in the professions they follow later on. Furthermore, national service is the basis on which the participation of the entire nation is enlisted in defending the country. This is no longer the duty of a small group; the youth of the entire nation is involved. Sometimes <span class="col_5293-5294" refersTo="page_1135"/>when one sits listening to the speeches made not only in this House but often outside this House as well, when one sees how the attitude of some parents is that of trying to evade such national service for their child, and when one sees how the attitude of some employers is that of continually asking for such service to be postponed until that person is eventually married, then it astonishes one that this can be the attitude which we, who speak of faith in the future of South Africa, can adopt towards the national service system which this Parliament has introduced. National service is not a punitive measure. The hon. member for North Rand said that some people regarded it as a punitive measure. He knows that it is not a punitive measure. It is an opportunity through which the person concerned is made more mature and better equipped for serving his country. This is an opportunity he is given in the Permanent Force, under the guidance of experts in the Permanent Force, and an opportunity in the Citizen Force and in the commandos&#x2014;as we are now re-organizing them into urban, industrial and rural commandos&#x2014;to be able to make a daily contribution, in various spheres, for the sake of the nation he professes to love.</p>

<p>Now there are complaints about the periods. I am told by, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for Durban (Point), that the last month or two go to waste and that the young man has nothing to do. But, surely, that is not true. That was the case under the old ballot system. This national service system has only been in operation for 14 months, and we have to a large extent eliminated this idleness. In a moment I shall refer to the fact that we have on a large scale started introducing new training processes, by which means we are keeping these young men busy. We have devoted attention to spiritual welfare and the use of leisure. As the funds become available, we keep these young men busy with positive work, even when they are not on duty. The complaint that they are idle towards the end of their year of national service is gradually disappearing altogether. We are still suffering from a certain mentality, namely that we are still thinking in terms of the old ballot system. This is my reply to hon. members who say that the national service system has now been in operation for so long that we should start thinking of reforming it. This is my reply: It has only been in operation for 14 months. It has by no means had a chance to prove what effect it will have. Give it another two years, and see what our youth will look like then, after 30,000 young men per year will have been handled under this national service system with what we shall have learnt in the meantime. Then we shall find a different attitude. I think that, instead of striking up the Lamentations of Jeremiah, it is the duty of parents, employers&#x2014;I said this at an employers&#x2019; association the other night&#x2014;and every member of Parliament in this House, because we drafted this Bill and placed it on the Statute Book together, and also the duty of the officers who may still be living under the influence of the old dispensation, to convey the message that national service is not the old ballot system and purely military training. National Service is a different attitude towards one&#x2019;s country. I hope that with these few general observations we shall realize that what we should in actual fact see evolving before our eyes, is much more than a military power only. We should see an attitude of national service to the country evolving. Through that attitude of national service we are enhancing the ability of our country&#x2019;s citizenry to defend themselves, as well as their know-how. By those means we shall be better able to take our place in the Southern Hemisphere, owing to our strategic position as guardian of the sea route around the Cape, if we approach this in a positive manner.</p>

<p>There are a few matters which were raised by hon. members and to which I want to refer specifically. In the first place, there were the hon. members for Mooi River and Middelland who referred to the question of unconventional warfare, or terrorism, as they called it. In the White Paper it is stated very explicitly that the Defence Force is not preparing itself for conventional warfare only, but we have already started to concentrate on a double-barrelled policy, i.e. to be prepared for conventional warfare but also to train our people for unconventional warfare. We have methods whereby we keep ourselves informed in respect of the latest approach to the terrorist onslaughts in the world. There are departments in our Defence Force who are making a special study of that, and answers are being sought to those methods and they are being passed on in the training. To-day we have five places in South Africa where young men are continually, on a full-time basis, receiving training in unconventional methods. I am not going to mention the names of those places, but geographically they are situated in such a way that they meet the problems with which a young man will have to cope. In this regard I may just mention that in the past two years the system of training has been changed so as to adapt to a possible threat. Training is being provided in fieldcraft, in concealment and disguise, which form part of the training in unconventional methods. There is the establishment of strong bases; tracking; the locating and destruction of enemy bases; active patrols; field-firing exercises; convoys in ambush drill. Every three years Citizen Force units are given the opportunity, in rotation, to take part in joint training exercises for the purpose of carrying out counter-guerrilla operations in rural areas. Where groups cannot be formed, for instance in regard to university units, they are trained and utilized at corps schools, as a corps, in individual exercises in possible infiltration areas. To give staff officers practice, regular signalling exercises are held at commands. Commandos must know their own respective areas like the back of their hands. Bivouac days have been done away with, and the same applies to passing-out parades upon <span class="col_5295-5296" refersTo="page_1136"/>the termination of bivouacs. At present they are undergoing seven days&#x2019; training per year in possible infiltration areas, and there rural commandos concentrate on fieldcraft, active patrols, tracking, ambush drill, field-firing, etc. Urban commandos concentrate more on urban internal security. In other words, at the Danie Theron Combat School, which we established in Kimberley and which has become the heart of our commando system, we are not only providing officers&#x2019; courses, but also preparing members of our commandos for these methods with which they will have to cope. And there they are given motivation. These people are informed as to why this has to be done. There are hon. members who reproach me for this; I shall deal with one of them later. They reproach me because we want to motivate people, because we want to give people an idea of why they must fight. But in these times in which we are living, one cannot treat people like mercenaries; one must give them an idea and tell them why they are being called upon to make these sacrifices, and what it is they have to resist.</p>

<p>We went further as far as the problem of waging unconventional warfare is concerned, and we adjusted our Air Force to this. It was done with the approval of the Government, because we do not take decisions on these things just like that, as if there were no planning behind it. There is a State Security Council which forms part of the Cabinet and of which the Prime Minister is Chairman. These proposals are submitted to that council from time to time, after they have been worked out. We adjusted our Air Force in order to obtain greater mobility, and not only that, but also to make it better prepared for the unconventional task. And our latest orders, the delivery of which we hope will begin shortly, is in fact aimed at enabling us to cope with the unconventional aspect thoroughly.</p>

<p>In this regard I should perhaps just refer to something else, and that is the question of our Air Force squadrons. If hon. members will bear with me, I think I must for the sake of the information which is needed, just communicate what the recommended improvement is in respect of our commando squadrons which have now been approved. The commando squadrons have now been transferred to the Air Force. Hon. members discussed this in the House last year. With effect from 1st April, 1969, the following changes will come into operation. The existing 12 squadrons will be uniform, with 20 pilots each, that is, the total strength will be 240 pilots. The annual allocation of flying hours per member is being increased from the present 33 hours as follows: In the Republic of South Africa, 48 hours, and in South-West Africa 50 hours. The allocation of the extra two hours for South-West Africa is in order to compensate for the long distances which have to be covered in order to attend training sessions. The tariff per flying hour to compensate the member for the use of his aircraft is being increased from the present R6 per flying hour to R10. Additionally, fuel and oil for authorized service is being provided free of charge by the State. The age limits for initial appointment are 18 and 54 years respectively. Normally the retiring age is 55 years, but members who comply with the medical requirements for a commercial pilot&#x2019;s licence will be allowed to serve up to the age of 60. There is no problem in regard to private insurance cover for commando squadron aircraft; that is, during peace-time exercises normal peace-time coverage is sufficient. I think that in this way we have now placed the commando squadrons on a proper basis as well, and I want to express the hope that they will be able to play an important role.</p>

<p>Now, as for the hon. member for Durban (Point), he referred to the loss of manpower and stated that he found it disturbing. Of course it is disturbing for us as well, and I find it most disturbing, but I want to tell you that many of the people who leave the Defence Force do not leave because they are dissatisfied. Many of them leave because they are such an attraction for employers. I think it is a feather in the cap of the Defence Force that it produces people who are in such high demand. We simply cannot compete with the private sector. We are trying our best, and the Government has gone out of its way to accommodate me in certain proposals this year. But those people are not lost to South Africa. They are contributing their share with the knowledge they acquired in the Defence Force.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to housing, and so, too, the hon. member for Pretoria (District). The hon. member for Durban (Point) then stated that if Public Works could not do it, it should be done under contract. But Public Works do not build houses. It is the Department of Community Development that builds houses. And the principle has been accepted that where we previously granted a quota of 60 per cent for the services, this now becomes a 100 per cent quota. This has been accepted by the Government, and we are able to start programming in order to cope with this housing problem. But secondly, the Government recently announced another housing scheme for public servants of which Defence Force members will also be able to make use. It is this joint scheme by the building societies which has been announced. Thirdly, the Department of Community Development is at present building 750 units at an amount of R9 million and is programming a further 650 at R7 million. In other words, we are getting on with the job. We are not accommodating our people in the old makeshift quarters the previous Government accommodated them in, which was the reason for the slums we had at our military bases. We are building decent houses. The hon. member for Durban (Point) then thought he had me in a corner; he said that he wanted to refer to two matters; he wanted in the first instance to <span class="col_5297-5298" refersTo="page_1137"/>refer to the question of selection boards. He said that he had put a question to me, and the question he had put to me was: &#x201C;How many selection boards were appointed&#x003F; To how many of these were persons appointed who were not members of the Permanent or Citizen Force or officials in the Public Service&#x003F;&#x201D; He then read out with great glee the reply I had supposedly given him, namely &#x201C;none&#x201D;. Why did the hon. member not read my reply fur ther&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>But the reply was &#x201C;nil&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Why did he not read the reply further&#x003F; For the reply went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The members serving on the selection boards are officers who in their private capacity are civil servants, tradesmen, farmers, and professional experts. They represent all walks of life and thus are conversant with the various problems of the private sector.</block>

<p>The fact of the matter is that serving on most of the selection boards are commandants of the citizen force regiments, or commanding officers of commandos, or other officers. These selection boards represent the entire national life of the country; these are people who know their districts. But the hon. member chose not to read this out. He wants to create the impression that only Permanent Force people are serving on these selection boards. He cannot get away with that. I am satisfied that these selection boards are serving their purpose and that they will continue to function even more efficiently.</p>

<p>But in addition to that the hon. member also said that I was playing the censor. He said that the <i>Sunday Times,</i> his friend, asked me to make a certain statement on the purchase of aircraft. I shall tell him what aircraft those were, and I shall tell him the story better than he can tell it. They were Hawker-Siddeley aircraft which were purchased for two purposes, i.e. as communication aircraft and as aircraft by means of which certain persons in the public service could be transported. There were many good reasons why, when certain negotiations were in process and certain demands had been made, that news should not have leaked out.</p>

<p>But it was published overseas.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must kindly give me a chance; then I shall tell him the story if he wants to hear it. At the beginning of the year, in January, <i>Die Burger</i> approached me and informed me that the news had leaked out to them and asked me whether they could publish it. I then said &#x201C;no&#x201D;, for very good reasons, and about four to six weeks later the <i>Sunday Times</i> phoned me one evening. I never complain when newspapers phone me. They sometimes phone me up to 11.30 and 12 o&#x2019;clock at night when that hon. member is sleeping peacefully. I do not complain when the newspapers phone me; I am prepared to do this service. They asked me whether they could publish the news and for the same reasons I said &#x201C;no&#x201D;. At a certain stage when certain information became available to me I went to the Cabinet and consulted the Cabinet and said: &#x201C;We are now able to publish this news; what must we do&#x003F;&#x201D; The Cabinet then decided that an official announcement should not be made but that we should release the news that we had obtained the aircraft. The news appeared the next morning in <i>Die Burger</i> of 7th March, but it also appeared in the <i>Cape Times</i> of the same morning, together with a photograph of the aircraft. The hon. member is now picking me out and saying that I play censor for one kind of newspaper only.</p>

<p>That same morning that news also appeared in a Transvaal English morning paper, as well as in a Transvaal Afrikaans morning paper. In other words, I did not withhold the news and give it to one section of the Press only. In any case it was not an official announcement. But there were very good reasons why it could not be divulged earlier. Let me say this to the hon. member now: From time to time I hold discussions with the National Press Union on which all newspaper companies are represented. I do not now want to read out in public letters which passed between us in my own defence. I have a good understanding with the Press Union and I accommodate them as far as it is possible, but there is certain information on Defence matters which they cannot publish without my permission and I intend carrying out the policy strictly.</p>

<p>At that stage I did not know about information which had been publisned overseas, but let me tell the hon. member this: Sometimes information from South Africa is initiated abroad and then I am confronted with an overseas report and I am requested to comment on it. I do not walk into that trap. Sir, I am satisfied that this system works, although it entails a great deal of unpleasantness for me. If I could avoid these <span class="col_5299-5300" refersTo="page_1138"/>obligations I would do so gladly, and I am certain that if the heads of the Defence Force could avoid it, they would also do so gladly, but for the sake of the security of the country we must do this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand complained about street names in Voortrekkerhoogte. I did not know what the position was, but I made a few inquiries, and it appeared that the streets, the names of which were changed were Lord Roberts Road, Station Road and Kwagga Road. The new names are Andries Pretorius Road, Piet Relief Road &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand spoke about a Permanent Force Brigade. This is the same principle as the one advocated by the hon. member for Hillbrow, viz. a larger permanent force. I think that I have already, in reply to the hon. member for Hillbrow, pointed out the costs aspect. But I think there is perhaps something to say for our trying to fill the vacancies in our Permanent Force in some other way. Attention is being given at the moment to a proposal which will entail no extra costs. This is to see whether we cannot fill certain posts in the Permanent Force from the ranks of national servicemen for a limited time and in this way cope with certain problems, and in this way, too, maintain the Force on a proper basis. We are making a study of this at the moment and when the proposals are ready we will have to take a decision on them if necessary.</p>

<p>Sir, I am sorry that I now have to return to the hon. member for Simonstown. The hon. member for Simonstown made a speech here on Friday in regard to which there were quite a few verbal exchanges between him and me. I have in the meantime got hold of a copy of his Hansard report. This is What the hon. member said with reference to admission to the naval college at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It appears that they are selected to go to that naval college on the basis of their success in the senior certificate. It appears also that they select them after aptitude tests and after personal interviews. In response to recent questions, the Minister said: &#x201C;Slegs die beste word gekies.&#x201D; I am sure that only the best are chosen, but it is a very strange thing that when I inspected the college at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay recently, in one working party of 12 I found no fewer than three Ministers&#x2019; sons. I am sure that they must have obtained first-class senior certificates and I am sure that they must have passed the aptitude tests with flying colours and I am sure that they must have made an enormous impression on those Who selected them to go to the naval college. But I think we should ask how many other Ministers&#x2019; sons and how many other Members of Parliament on that side of the House have had their children at the naval college at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay on the basis of these criteria of selection.</block>

<p>I thereupon asked the hon. member, &#x201C;What are you suggesting&#x003F;&#x201D; to which the hon. member replied, &#x201C;I am suggesting that undue preference is given to them&#x201D;. I thereupon said to the hon. member, &#x201C;I shall take you up on that; you should be ashamed of yourself&#x201D;. The hon. member then proceeded as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe it is in the public interest that these matters should be brought out into the open and the Minister now has an opportunity, as a result of what I have said this afternoon, to explain to South Africa why it is that these things happen. Then there are some other strange things that have happened in the Defence Force and I should like to quote from the publication <i>Commando.</i> I have mentioned this matter in the House before. Among the books reviewed by <i>Commando</i> is the book called &#x201C;Positiewe Nasionalisme&#x201D; by Professor Kotz&#x00E9;. It was recommended as suitable reading for members of the Defence Force.</block>

<p>The hon. member then proceeded to object to that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Deal also with Saldanha; it is in the next paragraph.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As regards the meeting at Saldanha, I have already given an explanation in this House. On that occasion I outlined the rules of the Department of Public Works which have to be complied with in renting this type of hall. Has the hon. member not read that&#x003F; Or do I have to keep on explaining to him&#x003F; But I want to bring him <span class="col_5301-5302" refersTo="page_1139"/>back to his allegations about the naval college at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay, because he is not going to get away from that this afternoon. I have here the curriculi of last year. Incidentally, another subject was added this year. I find that these boys have 504 periods within slightly less than three months: Seamanship, 224 periods; rules of the road, 60; navigation, 100; and communications, 120. This is the stiff course which these young men have to pass to be promoted to the position of midshipman within the space of a course of less than three months. Thereupon they take up duty on ships where they have to serve in key positions for the rest of the year. Therefore this is not child&#x2019;s play. What is achieved by another midshipman over a longer period of time, these boys are expected to achieve in less than three months. Last year there were 17 of these boys, this year there are a few more than thirty. The Naval Chief of Staff informs me that intelligence tests were conducted on these boys by the staff of the National Institute for Personnel Research of the C.S.I.R. During the tests the staff members are not aware of the identity of the various candidates. I also have the results of the tests in front of me. Those results are grouped in order of merit by the National Institute for Personnel Research. The number of candidates was categorized in a total of 60 groups. The three sons of Ministers fell in the top 17 groups. These groups are regarded by the National Institute for Personnel Research as outstanding. Selection takes place on the basis of the results of the candidates&#x2019; basic training at the training institute of the Navy, on achievements at school in mathematics and physics, on qualities of leadership, on tests of the National Institute, and on grounds of medical fitness. They have to pass in all these tests before being admitted to this stiff course. I have here with me the list of candidates at the naval college this year. The hon. member for Simonstown deemed it fit to cast a reflection here in Parliament alleging that political influence had been used to gain admission to the naval college for the sons of colleagues of mine. By doing so the hon. member insulted not only the Naval Chief of Staff but also the officers who were concerned in this matter; and he cast a reflection on one of the finest institutions in this country. As I have said. I have the names of the boys here. The hon. member is now objecting to the presence there of three sons of Ministers, on the grounds of their intelligence and on the grounds of their achievements. All of them were either prefects or head prefects of their respective schools. All of them passed with either A or B symbols. I have particulars here of their achievements in mathematics and physics, and also of their basic training at Saldanha and at Simonsberg. I find that the percentages achieved by them ranged from 71 per cent to 95 per cent. The three sons of Ministers achieved 77 per cent, nearly 74 per cent and 84 per cent. What the hon. member omitted to say is that four boys of the school to which he went, Bishops, attend the college and that Bishops is the only school that has more than one boy at the college. But for that the hon. member is not grateful. He does not thank me nor does he recognize that as an achievement for his school. No, he preferred to make a petty attack on the integrity of colleagues of mine and on the integrity of the Naval Chief of Staff. What is more, the hon. member does not verify his facts before making an attack of this nature. As a result he cast a reflection on the National Institute for Personnel Research as well, because they did not know who these boys were when they selected them. I also have here the comments of this National Institute on the achievements of these boys. In all three cases their comment was &#x201C;exceptional&#x201D;. This then is the kind of pettiness we get from the hon. member, an hon. member who is representing a constituency in which the headquarters of the South African Navy are situated. As such he can, if he wants to do so, make a contribution on maritime affairs in this House, but he prefers to crawl about in the garbage-bins. I want to tell the hon. member now that unless he changes his attitude he must expect the naval officers concerned to think very little of him, because he in point of fact insulted them. Furthermore I want to say that I hope the hon. member will have the decency, and I think he has that in him, to get up here and to apologize to the Naval Chief of Staff. He need not apologize to me, but I ask him to apologize to the Admiral of our Navy and to apologize to the Naval officers who had something to do with this work, and to apologize to the naval college as well.</p>

<p>If he does not do so, we know what label he will wear in future. I leave it at that.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the complaint of the hon. member as regards <i>Commando.</i> In his complaint he wanted to suggest that we were making wrong propaganda in the publication <i>Commando.</i> I have here with me the December issue of <i>Commando</i> in which the reviews of these books appeared. The first book reviewed was &#x201C;Battlefields to Harley Street&#x201D;. The review on this book reads, &#x201C;Surgeon with the Kaiser&#x2019;s Army&#x201D;. The second book is &#x201C;Positiewe Nasionalisme&#x201D; by Professor T. J. Kotz&#x00E9;. This is a book which is recommended as a handbook on political science at one of our largest universities. The hon. member, however, wants to reject it. One of our largest universities recommends it to its students, but he does not want me to bring it to the attention of the Defence Force. The third book is &#x201C;To my son in Uniform&#x201D;. This book was published in New York. The fourth book is &#x201C;A Military Genius: De la Rey, Lion of the West&#x201D;. The fifth book is &#x201C;A World Famous Regiment: The <span class="col_5303-5304" refersTo="page_1140"/>Gordon Highlanders&#x201D;. The review reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is a very readable book with perhaps a special interest to South Africans.</block>

<p>The title of the sixth book is &#x201C;Swaziland&#x2014;Hulpbronne en Ontwikkeling&#x201D;. The hon. member, however, selected only this one book and raised objections to that here. I want to tell the hon. member that he is capable of achieving greater heights than this. He is capable of doing something better. Try it next time. I now leave the hon. member at that. I hope he will avail himself of the opportunity this afternoon to tender his apologies. I am not asking him to apologize to me, but to apologize to the esteemed officers whom he insulted.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Green Point. I have given instructions for a careful study to be made of the speech delivered by the hon. member as it was a positive contribution. I do not agree with everything he said, because in my opinion the present system of training is working well. Although regiments meet as units only once every three years, there still are the three days per annum for which units may be called up for specific purposes. If we weigh up all the arguments, I do not think that we shall find that the old system is better than the present one. On the contrary, I think the present system is better. But I agree with the hon. member that there should be a regimental tradition just as there should be a tradition in commandos. The hon. member will concede that this will depend to a large extent on the commanding officer and on the headquarters and the spirit prevailing in those headquarters. For that reason we obtained a concession from the Provincial Administrations in respect of, for example, the commandos. Commandos, too, have now been placed on the list of bodies to which contributions may be made by local authorities for the construction of headquarters. South-West Africa has also agreed to this. I think this is a step in the right direction. I trust that the public as well as local authorities will also provide assistance so as to enable regiments to acquire headquarters. This will be instrumental in building up the regimental spirit, the spirit of unity. They should meet there. I do not think, however, that we shall be able to revert to the old system in order to achieve this object. I shall nevertheless give the hon. member the assurance that we shall study his speech with a view to seeing what we can learn from it. I know the hon. member is interested in the question of formal dress at functions. This is a matter which has not been finalized. Many things are implicated in this. I hope he will give me more time to reach finality in this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet referred to the position of the commandos. I can only tell him that 10,000 members are allocated to the commandos at present under the national service system. Eventually the commandos must profit from this. I know that there are a few commandos who are struggling because of geographic circumstances, but sometimes also as a result of inefficient commanding officers. If a commanding officer is equal to his task, even if the commando is spread over a large area, things will go well with such a commando. I may just mention one commando, without giving the name of its commanding officer. Just go to the De Aar Commando and see what is being accomplished in that vast area under the leadership of a man who knows what he wants. There is also the Highway Commando in Natal. Go to the commando of that commanding officer and see what he is accomplishing. Where there is a will on the part of a commanding officer, there is life.</p>

<p>Hon. members also referred to the necessity of mobility. The White Paper deals with the purchase of transport aircraft which will be delivered soon, as well as with the acquisition of the Super-Frelons for our Air Force. This will bring about a large degree of mobility. It also deals with the acquisition of armoured cars for the Army, which will increase the mobility of the Army, and helicopter-carrying ships for our Navy. At the moment we are considering the acquisition of fast craft which will also increase the mobility and the striking power of the Navy.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to the question of civil defence and the training of young women to which hon. members also referred. I want to say at once that the Civil Defence Section has already done good work in South Africa. I just want to refer to a few examples of what has already been accomplished. The Civil Defence Section has already instructed as many as 71,000 people in elementary first aid. In urban areas 827 volunteers have been instructed in fire-fighting. In certain centres subsidies have been allocated to 38 local authorities for the acquisition of fire engines. In 13 cities which have area controllers, surveys of means of combating emergency conditions have been completed. This happens in co-operation with local authorities and other Government bodies. Furthermore, we have had a study made of the question of an institution at which leaders for Civil Defence may be trained. I have made public pleas that our young women should be trained in this connection. We caused investigations to be made into 21 places in the country to see whether those places met the requirements. We started with a building situated near Dunnottar. We found that that was not suitable for various reasons. I do not want to go into that now. We felt that the training centre should be situated as near as possible to a military base but yet not adjacent to such a base. We said that the institution should be situated in an area in which the young women could have a social life on a good level. After all, we cannot keep our young women in the field. This is the launching of a new scheme. Whether or not it will be a success, will depend to a very large extent on how it is launched. A countrywide investigation for suitable facilities was <span class="col_5305-5306" refersTo="page_1141"/>conducted. Eventually we found two places which, in our opinion, will enable us to meet the requirements we set. The first place is the old school for domestic science at Potchefstroom. This, however, will only be available after 1972. In the meantime we are conducting negotiations with the Provincial Administration in this regard. No decision can be taken before all this has been finalized. I personally conducted negotiations with the Cape Provincial Administration as well and in that way found the second place for this purpose, i.e. the school for domestic science at George. This is a beautiful institution with large grounds. It is modern and has all the conveniences required for giving these young women their training in proper surroundings.</p>

<p>In my constituency, and in a very fine constituency at that! The idea is that the Cape Provincial Administration will make provision for the girls who are attending that school at present in decreasing numbers, at technical high schools and other schools in George. These facilities will be made available as from an agreed date next year, but not during this year. What is of importance, however, is that it is not costing the Department of Defence millions of rand to erect a building like this, as the State owned these buildings and as the facilities are available. The idea is for the young women to be given training in first aid, home nursing, driving and operating ambulances, elementary fire-fighting, handling of communication systems, organization of civil defence, physical culture, the handling of fire-arms, self-defence without arms, mental care, general office administration or any other aspect which may be required to round off the training course of leaders. We want to begin small and the idea is for us to train leaders who may be allocated to organizations such as the Noodhulpliga, the Red Cross and the St. John&#x2019;s Ambulance. We do not want a duplicating Defence Force, we only want to inspire the existing voluntary organizations with young women who have been given a good grounding in performing these tasks. The idea is for this spirit to be spread gradually in this way throughout the population. I hope that the first institution will be such a success that we shall be able to proceed to the establishment, in keeping with the plea delivered by the hon. member for Potchefstroom, of a second institution of this nature at Potchefstroom. Large numbers should never be involved in this training programme; the intention should rather be to produce efficient leaders of quality to leaven, feed and strengthen existing organizations. At the moment we are subjecting the Civil Defence Section to an inspection by the Public Service Commission. The object is the proper incorporation of this section into the Defence Force. The Chief of the Civil Defence Section, General Retief, made a study tour to Europe so as to acquaint himself with the latest methods of civil defence. As he makes suggestions, these suggestions will be considered. However, I want to emphasize at once that the Civil Defence Section should not be dependent on the State for its success, but should be dependent for its success on the voluntary service the civilian population is prepared to render to this Section.</p>

<p>Now I want to conclude. I think I have replied to most of the points which were raised. The question which was raised here of the ability of the Air Force to effect air delivery still remains; I can think of another question which was raised by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, i.e. that of overseas courses. We are not opposed to such courses, but we should not send our people to attend such courses unnecessarily. We shall watch the position, however, and as the need may arise, we shall send people to attend such courses, but we shall not incur unnecessary expenditure. I want to ask hon. members to forgive me if there are any points to which I have not replied.</p>

<p>I should like to make a request here. On the basis of the spirit which prevailed in most of the speeches, it is clear that we are in agreement as regards the broad approach of the defence policy; it is clear that we believe in a strong Defence Force. As I outlined at the outset, however, I hope that all of us also believe that the Defence Force has broader tasks to fulfil than that of being a mere military machine. I hope that the hon. members will help me to win the friendship of parents and the public for the Defence Force in cases in which such friendship still does not exist. I hope hon. members will not pay too much attention to petty gossip which is spread from time to time. If there are complaints hon. members feel can be proved, bring those complaints: if a young man is being victimized because he is complaining legitimately, he must repeat his complaints and then action will be taken against those who are victimizing him. I have this confidence in the Supreme Command, but I hope that we shall also evince a spirit of appreciation towards the Commandant General who is in charge of what is one of the largest organizations in this country to-day. I hope that we shall evince a spirit of appreciation towards the Defence Force Chiefs, the Chief of the Combat Forces, the Chief of Maritime Defence, the Chief of the Army, the Chief of the Air Force, the Chief of Defence Staff and their heads of sections. I hope the spirit will be born in our nation that we shall stand by our Defence Force because we know that our Defence Force stands by our nation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>Firstly, I want to express my appreciation towards the hon. Minister of Defence for the way in which he made his reply and for the spirit in which he did so.</p>

<p>As Coloured Representative I should like to confine myself briefly to that division in our <span class="col_5307-5308" refersTo="page_1142"/>Defence Force known as the Coloured Corps. As a person who takes an interest in, and who must take an interest in the history of the Coloured population, and also as a person who knows a little of the history, it was my privilege to observe the public appearance of the Coloured Corps during the inauguration of the State President. I think that any one of us who also at one stage did a bit of parade bashing on the parade would agree that on that day with the inauguration of the State President the Coloured Corps acquitted itself of its task very well indeed. During the first week of January I had the privilege of receiving an eminent visitor from Western Germany in my home. He was interested in visiting the places of interest in South Africa. <i>Inter alia,</i> I took him to Eerste River, to the training camp of the Coloured Corps, I want to place on record here to-day that I wish that I, as did the hon. member for Durban (Point) and the Hon. the Leader of the Opposition, When I underwent my training could have done so for just a little while at such a well-equipped training camp as that one. The visitor from Western Germany told me that that camp was equal to the best American military camps and training centres in Western Germany. It was a privilege to visit the camp, but it also with a touch of nostalgia that I did so. I want to pay tribute here to the commander in chief of the Coloured Corps, specifically Commandant, now Colonel Bredenkamp who had to take his leave as a result of his promotion. In view of my interest and my knowledge of what is happening there I want to state here that the hon. the Minister can take cognizance of the fact that he will seldom come across an officer who did his work with such absolute dedication as Colonel Bredenkamp did at Eerste River. He had an aptitude for the task entrusted to him, he knew how to appoint his officers, he knew how to work with the people he had to deal with. He was not a commanding officer, but a father: he was regarded by the men of the Coloured Corps as a father. I want to pay tribute to him here and express the hope that his further career will be a good one. I also want to wish his successor everything of the best. When one has the experience it is a remarkable phenomenon to note how the Coloureds naturally take to military training. This fact is proved by the successes to the Cape Corps, namely the Coloured Corps. Coloureds are good seamen and it is encouraging to know that there are some of our warships to-day that are manned by Coloured seamen. I do not think the commander of the South African Fleet will have any objections if I mention this, because he has experience of this kind of Coloured seamen which he gained when he was commander of the Gamtoos in the Mediterranean. The point I want to come to is that there are so few people who realize What role the Coloureds have played in the military history of South Africa. It dated back to the time of the Dutch East India Company. Attention was focused prominently on the Coloured for the first time on 14th January, 1806 at the battle of Blouberg. It is an established fact that the greatest losses suffered by the English when they landed at Blouberg in 1806 were suffered as a result of the artillery of the Malay slaves, which forced them to lower their boats so far from the beach that many of them overturned, as a result of which many of their soldiers drowned. It is on record that it was the Pandoers of that time who fought in the battle of Blouberg and who comprised General Jansen&#x2019;s rearguard troops when he had to fall back. After the Second Occupation of the Cape the English took over and the Coloured unit then became the Cape Corps. If one is interested in this it will be an established fact that for 80 years subsequent to that the Cape Corps comprised the garrison on the eastern border. They happened to be the first soldiers to wear khaki uniforms in South Africa. The English were still wearing red jackets with white webbing. In the Second Anglo-Boer War there has been a great to do about how the English allegedly abused Coloured soldiers but so little is said about the Coloureds in the Transvaal and the Free State who fought to the bitter end alongside the Burghers. There descendants are to this day still living near Pretoria at Onverwacht. Colonel Erasmus of Warmbaths is living testimony to this. The Coloureds also fought in the First World War. They do not commemorate Delville Wood but the battle of Square Hill in Palestine in 1915. When General Allenby marched in triumph through Jerusalem the Coloureds took the place of honour behind his white horse. He said at the time: &#x201C;No man can have the honour to command men of better fettle than the men of the Cape Corps of South Africa&#x201D;. In the Second World War the Coloureds played their role on behalf of South Africa. I want to inform the hon. Minister that there is a tremendous amount of interest among the Coloured population in the Coloured Corps. Our Coloured fellow citizens are westerners by background, westerners by origin and are also potential westerners. They must be set alongside the Whites. Potentially the Coloureds are brown Whites. Their potential is the same. If we follow a policy of differentiation in regard to the Bantu and we regard the Coloureds as being of that extraction as mentioned by D. S. Marais in The Cape Coloured People, 1652 to 1937, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When Jan van Riebeeck landed at the Cape there lived in the fastness of Table Mountain the Bushmen. On the shores he met the Hottentots, with whom he established more or less friendly relations. Very soon the Dutch colonists had to import slaves from the East for labour. Bushmen, Hottentots, slaves, white soldiers and sailors. Behold the ancestors of the Cape Coloured people &#x2026;</block>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the end of his speech the hon. the Minister appealed <span class="col_5309-5310" refersTo="page_1143"/>for a spirit of co-operation in the building up of our defence forces. I want to say to him that if he makes speeches such as he made here this afternoon, it is going to be very difficult indeed to give him that sort of support. For the first hour or so of his speech he rehashed again the debate on the Defence Bill and what we have said before. We agree and have no argument about that.</p>

<p>On Friday the hon. the Minister attacked my colleague, the hon. member for Simonstown, and he offered to make certain information available to him. On Friday the hon. member for Simonstown said, after dealing with the question, that all the Minister had to do this afternoon was to say that the hon. member for Simonstown must not make insinuations which are incorrect and that he has proof positive that each of these Ministers&#x2019; sons were chosen only on the basis of merit. Instead of doing what he promised on Friday, namely making available to the hon. member for Simonstown the information, the hon. the Minister launched a third attack and a most personal attack on the hon. member for Simonstown. I believe this is not the way to sort out our differences. If we have differences let us attack each other, but let us do so in a different spirit from that which the hon. the Minister used this afternoon. Let us do it in a different spirit from that which he used when he was dealing with the question. I link this indirectly with the question of national unity, of equal treatment in the Defence Force of the two language groups and his attitude when he dealt with the renaming of streets in Voortrekkerhoogte. This country and nation of ours have a history full of pain, bitterness and division. But if we are going to take out of that history and enshrine in our Governmental institutions only the things which one section wants, or one section likes, one is not going to create that spirit, which I believe the hon. Minister wants in the Defence Force. Why could we not have had, if we are enshrining pre-Union history, some of the heroes of pre-Union history in the military field who fought at Isandhlwana and at Rorke&#x2019;s Drift and in other areas of South Africa&#x003F; Instead of this we do away with harmless names like Lancaster Road, Cavalry Road, and Fusilier Road. They are all renamed with regard to one section of the people only and in connection with one part of our history. And then the hon. the Minister pleads for national unity.</p>

<p>He and other hon. members have said that the morale of the Defence Force has never been higher. I want to say that there are rumblings and I therefore plead with the hon. the Minister not to let us go back to what is known as the Erasmus-era of the Defence Force. There are rumblings of side-tracking of people into dead-end jobs, of premature retirements of others, of rank-jumping in promotions, of meteoric rises, of the promotion of persons who failed the Lieutenant&#x2019;s to Captain&#x2019;s course and who failed &#x201C;taaltoetse&#x201D;. These are the rumblings and I appeal to the hon. the Minister not to let a spirit which has virtually disappeared from our Defence Force, the spirit of sectionalism and discontent over alleged discrimination, creep back into our Force. Our forces until recent years had been broken down to almost nothing. It is admitted in the White Paper that in 1960 we had virtually no Defence Force. It has been built up in the last nine years into a Force in which all South Africans could have a place, in which all South Africans felt they were wanted and needed and had a contribution to make. But in recent months, over the last year or so, latent grumbles and latent grouses have been creeping back. I am not going to deal with personalities. I am not going to deal with instances. I am merely going to plead with the hon. the Minister not even to let a suspicion or a semblance of a suspicion appear in our Forces that we are going back to the days of preferences in promotion; because when there are these meteoric promotions they have a reaction on the long-established members of the Forces, and the Minister knows it. I do not have to go into details. The same when we talk of bilingualism. I know it is the Minister&#x2019;s intention and I know it is the intention of the Army, but do not let us bluff ourselves about it. Do not let us, immediately anyone suggests that anything is wrong, get up on our high horses and blow our tops. Because that is what the Minister does. As soon as there is any criticism, as soon as there is anything except praise, it is immediately denied and the Minister gets angry and excited about it. Look at the things he has replied to this afternoon. He has either denied them or he has ignored them. He has denied that housing is going slowly. We quoted figures, but the Minister comes back and says he has all these houses being planned. He did not deal with our appeal for Citizen Force servicemen to be paid Permanent Force pay for their short camps. He did not refer to the reference to employers making up the difference after the Government had played its part. He did not deal with the mid-year call-up, and so on. But when there was criticism from our side the Minister was up on his feet immediately attacking violently, and personally in many cases, because we dared to criticize. Let us accept that this side of the House wants to help the Minister; it wants to help the Government. It wants to play its part in building up a truly South African Defence Force. But I plead with the Minister not to do things like he did in regard to the street names, in regard to his reaction to everything we criticized, but to allow us to play our part in building up confidence in a truly South African Force. The hon. the Minister concluded his speech by saying: If you have complaints, bring them to me. But on Friday he dragged into this House a complaint which I had brought privately to the department and which I had not publicized, one of many complaints I have brought privately and without publicity and which have been dealt with. But the Minister chose to bring it into this House <span class="col_5311-5312" refersTo="page_1144"/>and to use it as a basis for attacking me. Yet at the end of his speech he says we must come to him if we have complaints and he will investigate them. Where do we stand&#x003F; Do we come to him, so that if it is not proven he can use it to attack us on&#x003F; He knows the seriousness of that particular complaint. Did he expect me to sit on it&#x003F; It was brought to me by one of my colleagues.</p>

<p>The Minister knows that cannot be done. The hon member for South Coast gave him the circumstances and the facts, and I am not prepared to break a pledge of secrecy on any provocation. I gave him a photostat of the letter. The only thing which was excluded from it was the address. It was a photostat of the original letter, even to the signature, the name of the person who signed it. I could do not more than that, and I am not prepared to break my promises not to disclose facts. But the Minister must not ask us to bring problems and then use them to attack us. I want to say this again, that we have built up over the years a proud military tradition. It went downhill for a period but it has built up again. Now, let us try to maintain that spirit and that level of morale, of confidence and of co-operation in our Forces which I believe we had achieved and to a large extent maintained.

<p>It is a pity that we have to go back in history now, but if the hon. member wants to take that course, we can meet him. Conditions in the Defence Force were such that a Minister who was known to be coming could enter an officers&#x2019; mess and walk out at the other side without one single officer rising. That is the spirit which prevailed in that period. That is the British imperial tradition of which they are so fond, which prevailed in the Defence Force at the time. He should not complain now that we have, for the first time, a sense of unity, which offends him. Now that we have gone to so much trouble in building up that unity, and now that this hon. Minister has gone out of his way to build up unity in the Defence Force, they come forward with these petty attacks such as those made by the hon. member for Simonstown. And this afternoon the hon. member for Durban (Point) came to his assistance and tried to defend those petty attacks. If this is to be an example of the way in which Defence matters are debated, i.e. as the hon. member for Durban (Point) put it, then we are quite happy to satisfy him and to meet him on the same level. At least it is a level on which he feels at home. I was surprised that he rose to such a high level on Friday, but now he has returned to his traditional level, and we can meet him on that level. l[Interjection.]</p>

<p>I want to return to the question of the sons of Ministers to which the hon. member referred. I was privileged to obtain information on a previous occasion, without asking for it &#x2014;I did not poke my nose into those matters as the hon. member for Simonstown did; I do not know on whose authority he undertook that inspection&#x2014;but I obtained information on a certain occasion, and it so happens that there are a number of men in the Defence Force who are being trained to-day and it so happens that there are Ministers&#x2019; sons among them who are responsible for some of the best results and who represent some of the most select material that we have in South Africa. I met them personally, and I know about the difficult position in which a certain officer found himself one one occasion when a son of an eminent person achieved such brilliant results in his military training that that officer was at a loss as to what he should do. He was concerned, on the one hand, that if he were to do justice to this young man, it would seem as though he wanted to highlight the achievements of this young man for the sake of a certain person; but on the other hand, he said, he was having trouble with his conscience because this man&#x2019;s achievements were such that he was entitled to special honours, and he felt that his extraordinary achievements should be judged according to their worth. That officer decided&#x2014;to my mind quite rightly&#x2014;to award this young man a distinction which he had deserved purely on merit. Sir, that young man was the son of the hon. the Minister of Defence; he is a person who achieved quite outstanding results when he underwent his training. Now I want to ask hon. members, if a young man does well in our Defence Force, whether he be the son of a Minister or an M.P. or not, is he not entitled <span class="col_5313-5314" refersTo="page_1145"/>to being treated each according to his own merit&#x003F; These men are also eager to serve their country in the SA. Defence Force. These young men work hard and are devoted to their task. Must they be penalized because they happen to be the sons of Ministers or of other members of this House&#x003F; I think this is the most unfair thing we could do, not to the parents, but to those young men who work extremely hard and are devoted. I know some of them personally and I know how much effort they are putting into it and I know how dedicated they are. I think the hon. member for Simonstown was very unfair towards those young men and their friends, and I therefore think the hon. member for Durban (Point) was just as unfair in defending that kind of attitude.</p>

I am not prepared to sell my history and to crawl before enemies from the past. In order to get in his blow at me, the hon. member did something now which was also done by the hon. member for Simonstown a few days ago. It is something which they regularly do when they run out of arguments, and that is to refer in a derogatory way to a previous Minister of Defence. They had their differences with him and I do not take it amiss of them.

<p>People spoke to him personally, just like the one who spoke to him personally about that decent young instructor of ours, and when we appointed a board of inquiry we found that the very reverse was the case. I am asking the hon. member for the source of his information, but he does not want to disclose it to me. The hon. member can come to me with any complaint and then tell me that he cannot disclose the source of his information to me, and then he expects me to take notice of it. If I take no notice of it, if I refuse to take notice of gossip, then the hon. member says that I must watch out; that their co-operation is involved. Who does the hon. member think he is frightening&#x003F; Let us drop this childish behaviour. Let the hon. member rather call his own colleague, the hon. member for Simonstown, to order. Let him rather follow the example set to him by the hon. member for Green Point, a man with military knowledge, who makes his contribution and voices his cricitism here in a decent way. Let the hon. member follow the example of the hon. member for North Rand, who has unfortunately been replaced as chairman of the Defence Group by that hon. member. I say &#x201C;unfortunately&#x201D;, because he would have made a better contribution. If the hon. member wants to fight, let me tell him that I have no desire to have trouble in connection with the Defence Force, but if the hon. member wants to fight, I will fight back for the sake of my self respect. Let us understand each other very clearly this afternoon. I stand for the equal treatment of Afrikaans- and English-speaking South Africans in the Defence Force. I go out of my way to win the confidence of Afrikaans- and English-speaking officers. I go out of my way to obtain the co-operation of both National Party and United Party Officers, and I have it. I am respected in those circles to-day because I have gone out of my way to do that. Therefore I say to the hon. member that he must not think he will scare me with great gesticulations and with the sort of voice which he raised here at the end of the debate. He will not succeed in doing that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, once again we come to our annual review of the Tourism Vote. I may say that in the past we have found year after year that the position has remained fairly static. The Minister was a little upset, I think, last year and even the year before, when I called the Department of Tourism the Cinderella department. My own opinion is that it has not moved very much away from that position. It is true that you have a Hotel Board under the Minister, a board which is doing good work and has done very good work. At the moment one cannot say what the actual end-results will be. Of the hotels which have applied for grading, I think approximately 450 have now been graded, leaving a large number which for various and good reasons have not yet received their grading. Then there is Sa-tour, which deals with certain aspects of tourism, endeavouring mainly to bring people to this country from overseas and from neighbouring territories. The internal situation, as I understand the position, has been left to the Department of Tourism.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to deal first with the hotel position. There are many obstacles in the way to getting this industry on a sound footing, particularly when we bear in mind what everybody is saying and what everybody is welcoming, and that is that we are entering the Jumbo Jet age, when we are going to bring numbers of people to this country. The question is whether we are going to be in a position to deal with them if we get them. I think it was Mr. Du Plessis who said, When speaking at the conference, that we could deal with them and that there were very few or no problems. As far as I can ascertain, everybody else who has spoken on this subject is very worried and uneasy about the question whether we are making adequate preparations and whether we are going to be able to deal with this situation. Let me take one item as example. The hotel trade experiences great labour troubles, and very little seems to be done to sort this out. The Minister will no doubt say to me that that is not his department, but what the Minister does in regard to tourism affects almost every single other department. He should be the catalyst that causes things to happen, but instead of being the catalyst, he is always passing the buck. Whenever <span class="col_5317-5318" refersTo="page_1147"/>you ask him whether he can do this or that bis reply is that it does not fall under his department. He should be able to consult them and get something done in the interest of the tourist industry. I quote a letter that has been handed to me by a colleague, the hon. member for Hillbrow, which sums up this particular problem very adequately. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is an acute shortage of labour in the hotel industry. Most hoteliers are forced to employ unregistered Bantu as there is no labour available from local labour authorities. Influx labour cannot be brought into any areas as there is no accommodation available neither on hotel premises nor in location hostels.</block>

<p>He says that in Johannesburg there is a backlog of 18,000 beds and that there are no plans available at the moment to remedy this situation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If an employer is fortunate enough to be able to get an employee, he is compelled to dismiss him after twelve months, just when he is trained. Hoteliers can only see a very dismal future if the various Cabinet Ministers involved do not take steps to investigate fully the problems facing the industry. The Department of Tourism is spending vast amounts of money to bring tourists to this country and to improve the standards of hotels. On the other hand the Department of Bantu Affairs is removing the means Whereby hotels are able to provide higher standards of service and attention. This is the foreseeable future of the hotel industry: A ship with a captain but no crew.</block>

<p>I think this adequately describes this problem. This is a matter which should be given urgent attention. There are many other problems in the tourist industry which also deserves urgent attention. There is a sense of unease and disquiet; there is a sense of urgency that something must be done to promote this industry and to put it on the right footing. Unlike the Minister, I have no doubt in my mind that, properly handled in the future, the tourist industry can bring in revenue that will fill the gap that is left by the diminishing gold-mining revenue. The Minister was reported to have said in a speech that he did not believe for a moment that tourism as a source of earning foreign exchange, could ever equal the gold-mining industry.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>I go further and say that if a dynamic policy was followed with regard to the tourist industry, it could equal the gold-mining industry. It seems to me that the Minister almost has a feeling of pessimism in regard to this portfolio. He has occupied this portfolio for six solid years and we feel that the position to-day is still practically what it was when he took over. I think the first and immediate objective must be to close the gap between what we earn as a tourist country from tourists coming into the country and what we expend and export in connection with South African tourists going overseas. In that regard there is a gap of R10 million or R12 million. It should be our first and immediate objective to close that gap. The next and the long-term objective should be to try to use the tourist industry to augment the diminishing earnings of the gold-mining industry. Time and again we have made various suggestions to the Minister and one is almost in despair as to what to suggest next. This report of Satour is an interesting, competently and efficiently framed document as far as it goes, but obviously it does not deal with the problems of tourism. Under &#x201C;Important Events&#x201D; it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the course of the year the Board had the privilege at one of its meetings of discussing with the hon. the Minister matters of policy and the future planning of tourism within the Republic and abroad and also general directives of the Ministry of Tourism pertaining to the hotel industry, market research, marketing of group travel, travel facilitation and the co-ordination of tourism and promotional activities.</block>

<p>I mention this because it seems to me singular that it should be an important event. I think the Minister should be in constant consultation with that board. He should be at most of its meetings and discuss matters with them to see what can be done, because it is a difficult situation which exists here. As a matter of fact, it seems to me there should be a subcommittee of the Cabinet because every Cabinet Minister has something to do with tourism. If there is a sub-committee of the Cabinet things may be co-ordinated and something may be done. There is the Minister of Planning, the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Economic Affairs, even the Minister of Bantu Administration&#x2014;all these have something to do with tourism. If we have such a sub-committee of the Cabinet something may be done. Where are the surveys&#x003F; Last year the hon. Minister poured cold water over the suggestion that there should be surveys. He discounted the idea of surveys from outside and said that they would do it internally but that it would take a long time. Well, I think it has to be done much quicker than that.

<p>Unfortunately the time at my disposal does not permit me to react to the hon. member for Von Brandis&#x2019;s <span class="col_5319-5320" refersTo="page_1148"/>speech. I nevertheless just want to tell him that I cannot accept his allegation that a labour shortage allegedly had a detrimental effect on our tourism. There may be other factors which have that effect, but certainly not labour. Perhaps another factor is that very high tariffs are imposed on tourists. This is perhaps one of the reasons why persons from the middle income groups abroad cannot visit us&#x2014;the costs of accommodation here are altogether too high. I have here a letter from one of my constituents who recently inquired about accommodation. He said that R16 per week was asked for a bachelor flat out of season and R60 per week in season. Why this big difference of R44&#x003F; It is such unprecedented things that ought to enjoy our attention.</p>

<p>Provision is made in the Estimates for R1,825,000 for Tourism; R1,452,000 of this has been set apart for Satour and R24,000 for advertising purposes. Tourism has not yet come into its own. The Republic&#x2019;s revenue from foreign tourism is estimated at R100 million. On the other hand, we export gold to the value of R773 million, wool R107 million, maize R74 million and fruit R100 million. Now compare the amounts voted by the Government for these industries to the small amount voted for Tourism and things do not look so bright for tourism. In reality we lose more on outgoing tourists than we receive from incoming tourists. As a matter of fact, it is estimated that in 1967 we showed a deficit of R11 million in this connection. This state of affairs ought to be put right in the course of time. We evidence a growth rate of 7.7 per cent, according to the 1967 report. But I believe that we should gradually increase our tourist industry to a growth rate of 15 per cent and even more. However, at the same time I want to warn against the Opposition&#x2019;s idea that we should cause a so-called tourist explosion to take place in order to have tourists streaming into our country. They must think of many factors which we have to keep in mind. First there is transport, and especially our road transport. They must think of the caravans on the roads in the holiday season. They must think of the accommodation and the other services which must be supplied. It goes without saying that if there were to be a rush of tourists during the season it would result in a great deal of dissatisfaction. We would also have dissatisfied tourists. Instead of being an asset to us they would return to their own mother countries and greatly damage our case.</p>

<p>The Department of Tourism is still a relatively young department. If we now look at what has already been achieved in this short time and with limited funds, I feel that the hon. the Minister and his Department deserve our appreciation. If we take into consideration that in the year 1967 82 per cent of those who visited our country came on holiday, 12.4 per cent on business and 5.6 per cent for educational purposes, it is clear, from the report of the Tourist Corporation, that the interest of foreigners in South Africa is not only limited to holidays, but that they are also interested in our tremendous economic development. In the educational sphere there has also been an increase, although it is only very small. We notice here that it is only .5 per cent, but it is a good thing for us to do everything in our power to draw foreign visitors, thereby also showing them what we are doing here in our mother country to acquaint the primitive Bantu people with Western civilization.</p>

<p>I should also like to mention another matter. I want to associate myself here with the hon. the Minister of Tourism. I feel that in the first place we owe it to our own people to promote internal tourism among them. Therefore we must do everything in our power to make it possible for them to tour in our mother country. It would be impossible to expect the Department of Tourism alone to be held responsible for compensation in respect of future losses as a result of the collapse of the gold mines. It is very unreasonable and unfair to hold the Department of Tourism responsible for that. I feel that the Department of Tourism has done South Africa a tremendous service, and we should like to see tourism in our country extended, and making a great contribution to our economy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to suggest that we develop one of the greatest sights in our country so that we can draw tourists from abroad to a great extent. What I am referring to is the Blyde River canyon holiday resort. That place lends itself beautifully to the erection of an aerial cable-way, so that tourists can go over the Rondawel Koppe for a better view of that beautiful natural phenomenon.</p>

<p>My next proposal is historic in nature. R24,000 is being voted for films, etc. However, I want to make a suggestion in respect of the historic trek of Louis Trichardt, the greatest diplomat of all the Voortrekkers, the man who tamed the Transvaal and the northern parts of our country for us, and who also did wonders of which perhaps no one is aware, in the scientific sphere. At a later stage an entomologist set out on Trichardt&#x2019;s train in order to determine the history of the Tsetse Fly. I feel that if we could make that Trichardt trek route over the Drakensberg accessible to visitors, so that they could also follow it in safaris on horseback and could see what tremendous achievements were made in crossing that mountain with ox-wagons en route to Louren&#x00E7;o Marques, we could use one of the outstanding events in our national history for the additional promotion of our tourism.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to finish what I was saying when I had to be stopped by the 10-minute rule. I want to point out that the urgency of the matter I am advocating this afternoon has been confirmed by others. It was confirmed by no less authorities than the persons the Minister has appointed to various boards. Mr. Knobel, the director of the Kruger National <span class="col_5321-5322" refersTo="page_1149"/>Park, who I think is on one of the hoards, Satour, speaking at a conference, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are not ready for the tourist explosion in 1975. Tourism should bring in more revenue than gold.</block>

<p>This is contrary, of course, to what the Minister feels. Then he went on to say that all our facilities are not adequate, such as hotels, transport and the ports. Then Mr. Venter, who is president of the Hotels Association and is a member of the Hotels Board went on a study tour overseas. He said the balancing of our foreign trade is an increasingly important role, a point which I made earlier. So one can go on to authority after authority. The Johannesburg Publicity Association at their annual meeting asked for a blueprint on the tourist industry. That is what is needed. We want to know what the objectives and the plans are, how the Minister is going to achieve them and whether he has the information to base this blueprint on. I doubt very much whether he really has the information. What is necessary, is a full inquiry into the potential of the hotel industry and what is needed in every respect in this country. Hotels may be needed in certain places. We must find out whether they need financing or not, what transport facilities may be needed, as well as a hundred and one other matters that appertain to the tourist industry. I do not believe that we will get anywhere until such an inquiry is instituted. It must either be an inquiry by his own Department by means of surveys, or an inquiry by an outside body. That may cause a delay, but at least one would know where we are factually in this matter. There would be recommendations to work on, such as we had before the Hotel Board was instituted. There was a very good inquiry into the matter. The recommendations came as a result of the inquiry. I believe that it has proved itself. I think it is high time either to do it internally by way of a committee of the Cabinet who will be responsible for various aspects of the matter, or an outside inquiry before proceeding further. We should know where we are exactly with regard to the tourist trade in this country. We are missing to-day golden opportunities for the earning of revenue and the increasing of our importance in the tourist world. The Minister&#x2019;s own statement revealed that our trade comprised only .2 per cent of the world&#x2019;s tourist trade. It is not very much when one takes it in those terms. It has been pointed out that we could bring it up to 20 per cent. Why should we not&#x003F; The other countries have increased their tourist trade by 51 per cent over a very short period. Why should we not be able to increase it&#x003F; If we could bring it up to 20 per cent, in the course of 15 years we would have overtaken the revenue of the gold-mining industry. I believe it can be done. The attempt should be made to do it.</p>

<p>Do we spend enough on tourism&#x003F; It has been pointed out that in Portugal R290 million was spent on the promotion of the tourist industry. In our country it is R1.7 million. I do not suggest it should be such a large amount, but it constitutes 10 per cent of their budget. It is about .0001 per cent of our budget. We seem to be playing around with the problems of tourism. I urge the Minister to give attention to this matter, so that something may be done. Either give attention to it and get the job done, or get out!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Von Brandis wants to imply that the hon. the Minister of Tourism has no plans for the tourist industry in South Africa. However, if one looks at the report of the Hotel Board of 31st March, 1968, and at that of the South African Tourist Corporation for the same financial year, it is clear that we are not so badly off here in South Africa, although we perhaps draw relatively fewer tourists than other countries, especially Europe. The income from tourism for countries such as Britain and West Germany is 1 per cent of their national revenue. For countries such as Canada and Italy it is about 2.8 per cent. I think that it is only in Austria where tourism supplies about 7.9 per cent of that country&#x2019;s national revenue. If the tourist industry earns about R100 million per year for us, and our national revenue is about R10 billion, our percentage is almost 1 per cent. This would then compare favourably with countries such as Britain and West Germany. On the other hand, we must bear in mind that those countries lie near to other densely populated states and a great portion of the population of those states only needs cross the borders in order to tour those countries. On the other hand, South Africa, with a view to its remote position&#x2014;it is 6,000 miles from Europe and virtually as far away from most of the other Continents&#x2014;cannot expect to draw foreign tourists to the same extent. If we look at what the Hotel Board has already done, according to last year&#x2019;s report, it is clear that it is doing its best to give attention to the question of trained hotel staff. It is stated in this report that a special committee has been appointed which will go into the question of the training of hotel staff in general, with specific reference to the Bantu and the Coloureds. I myself have for years been connected with the Peninsula Technical College which, I think, instituted a course for waiters in hotels here in the Western Cape. A considerable number of Coloured waiters have already been trained. I think that we may be satisfied that within reasonable limits this Department has fulfilled its function properly, as is evident from the fact that when tourism in the world as a whole did not present a rosy picture last year, South Africa&#x2019;s stream of visitors nevertheless increased constantly. We had an increase of 16 per cent in the number of European tourists visiting South Africa. In the case of America we had an increase of 17 per cent on the previous year&#x2019;s figure. In the case of Australia we had an increase of 65.1 per cent. I therefore want to say that this Department, in view of our position in the world, did not altogether <span class="col_5323-5324" refersTo="page_1150"/>deserve the criticism which was levelled at it here to-day.</p>

<p>I nevertheless want to associate myself with those who appealed for the establishment of tourism as a large industry in South Africa. I think that there are a few specific factors in favour of the possibly more rapid development of this Department. One factor which I should like to mention is that South Africa occupies a unique position in Southern Africa. By stimulating the tourist industry in South Africa we could make a tremendous contribution, if we involved not only our own country, but others as well. According to figures supplied by the Portuguese Government, 360,000 tourists visited Mozambique in 1967. In the same year about 275,000 tourists. I believe that if there could be cordial cooperation in which we, with our greater resources, could play a leading role, we could do a lot to promote economic prosperity, not only for ourselves, but also for this region as a whole. In that respect South Africa is situated in a favourable position to extend its tourist industry to a much greater degree.</p>

<p>It is also a a fact that to-day there are 25 international airlines serving South Africa, and that in the past year, 40.2 per cent of all visitors to South Africa came to our country by air. In that respect we are in a better position to-day to draw more tourists from other countries.</p>

<p>A third factor is that with the closing of the Suez Canal we now find that, with about 150 passenger liners left in the world, about one-third of them call at least once, or even two or more times, at Cape Town and Durban. In that respect we are also in a favourable position in that, with this additional traffic around our coast, we can have a greater tourist industry in South Africa.</p>

<p>I just want to mention a few things to which more attention could possibly be given. It goes without saying that there is the question of advertising about which more could possibly be done, as the Tourist Corporation&#x2019;s report indicates. We find, for example, that there is an increase of more than R100,000 in this Department&#x2019;s budget for Satour. On the other hand, we find a very great decrease, from R175,000 to R112,000, i.e. about 33 per cent, in the amount which will be spent by the Department in respect of advertising. The one therefore virtually cancels out the other. In this report I get the impression time and again that the corporation feels that even more could be done by means of films and other information media to make South Africa better known.</p>

<p>In the Hotel Board&#x2019;s report for the period ending 31st March, 1968, it has also struck me that 184 hotels have been graded and grouped up to that stage. In the list which is provided there are only five non-White hotels, i.e. 2 to 2&#x00BD; per cent of all hotels. The question arises as to whether the Hotel Board and all other bodies concerned could not perhaps give better attention to this problem, which could become a more substantial problem in the future. It would mean that bigger and better facilities could be offered to the growing numbers of non-Whites who are in a position to tour in South Africa.</p>

<p>As far as Cape Town itself is concerned, the position in respect of tourist accommodation is probably not very different from that in the rest of the country. A committee was appointed last year by the Cape Chamber of Commerce which issued a report at the beginning of this year. In that report it is pointed out that in 1936 there were 6,500 hotel rooms in Cape Town, but that there were only about 5,000 at the end of 1968. There was therefore a decrease of 1,500 over a period of 22 years. That special committee indicated what steps could be taken to obtain additional hotel accommodation here in the Mother City. The one factor which is indicated is that the allowable density for hotel development on premises is much higher in other Provinces than in Cape Town. This means that on specific premises one could supply more hotel beds in places such as Johannesburg and Durban than in Cape Town. One asks oneself whether this is justified in the present circumstances, where building sites are becoming increasingly limited and where, in many cases, hotels have already been established and obviously cannot be moved. Is it necessary to allow such a small density and to make the mass factor so small&#x003F; Can the mass not be increased in the case of hotels in Cape Town&#x003F; If this were possible the existing hotels would offer a better investment field for the investors because then the owner would have the assurance that one day he would more easily be able to sell his hotel. If he wanted to extend he would also be able to do so on the existing premises. I think that it is specially important to note that when a tourist stays at a hotel he frequently spends only a day or two there. It is therefore not necessary to have large gardens around such a hotel. My own experience in other countries I have visited has been that there is virtually no question of gardens. One merely gets a room and if one wants to get close to nature, one goes out to find it. I think that in the case of Cape Town this is a problem to which the Hotel Board and perhaps also the Department could give its attention. [Time expired.]</p>

All I am trying to convey is that it was this Government also which established the Department of Tourism. It was this Government which established a Hotel Board, although the previous Government had a commissioner&#x2019;s report on the hotel industry, of which that hon. member was chairman. In 1944 or 1945 that commission recommended that a Hotel Board should be established, but the previous Government did not establish that Board. This Government established a Hotel Board.</p>

<p>I should like to come to another point which the hon. member for Von Brandis made. He talked about the Hotel Board, and said that the Minister was inclined to try to pass the responsibility on to other departments when the hotel industry complained to the Minister about inadequate labour. That is not correct. I do not know where the hon. member obtained that information. He said that he was quoting from a letter to the hon. member for Hillbrow. But the Hotel Board has approached the Minister on various occasions. It was the Minister who tackled the problem of Bantu labour in the hotels in the Hermanus area, for instance. Those Bantu were allowed to stay on for a further period. It was this unfortunate Minister, to whom the hon. member for Von Brandis was referring, when he said: &#x201C;He should do the job, or get out&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei can get up later and make his ten minute speech. I am now talking to the hon. member for Von Brandis. I am telling him what the facts are. The hon. member also spoke about the hotel industry. The Minister is in touch with the industry all the time, through the Hotel Board. That is the mouthpiece of the hotel industry. If there is an isolated letter which floats around, from which the hon. member for Von Brandis can quote, I do not regard that as having necessarily come from the Hotel Board. However, if the Hotel Board approaches me, as the Minister, I immediately attend to them. The hon. member only has to ask the Hotel Board, on which Fedhasa have representatives, whether that has not been the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about Satour. He said he was very surprised to see that in Satour&#x2019;s report the Minister&#x2019;s attendance of a meeting was made out to be something special. He said that the Minister should attend all their meetings. Sir, the chairman of Satour is now the Secretary of the Department of Tourism. He did not use to be. The contact between Satour and the Minister is therefore undoubtedly far better to-day than it ever has been before, because the head of the department is the chairman of Satour. That is the reason why it was done. It was never the intention that I should attend their meetings. This is not my way of working with Satour, which is an autonomous body. However, it was right that the Secretary of the department should be the chairman of Satour.</p>

<p>Maybe. As a matter of fact, I think they referred to a number of important events. Sir, the hon. member for Von Brandis cannot get out of it that way, and so easily. Here we had a case where the fact that the Secretary of the Department of Tourism was made chairman of Satour was criticized. And yet the hon. member now says that the Minister should have a closer link with Satour. The Minister could not have a closer link than he has to-day.</p>

<p><span class="col_5327-5328" refersTo="page_1152"/>The hon. member for Von Brandis referred to certain statements I made about the gold industry. I think he appreciates now that there is a big difference between what I stated and the demand, and the suggestions, which were made, and what he had in mind. He referred to the fact that the gold supply was diminishing. What was suggested to me was that the gold industry could be replaced by the tourist industry.</p>

<p>My point is that that should be your aim.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is my aim. Of course may aim is to make the tourist industry a large industry. However, I am not so foolish as to make statements and support statements that the tourist industry can replace the gold industry in South Africa. Because mine is a realistic approach, the hon. member says that I am not enthusiastic. It is like a man in business. Does he think that a man in business who says that he is going to make a million rand is a wonderful man even if there is no possibility of him making more than R10,000&#x003F; That is the difference.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the gap. The hon. member must know that I, more than anyone else, realize that there is a gap. I want to tell him that the gap has in fact increased. He may not know that. He said that the gap was R10 million. To-day it is R13 million. That is the assessment. The question is: Why is the gap widening&#x003F; I know that it may be possible that, as more accommodation becomes available, we can have more tourists in this country than we have to-day. However, one must also bear in mind the position in South Africa to-day. There is money about in South Africa. Our people are comparatively well-off. More and more of them go overseas and spend money. I do not suppose that the hon. member for Von Brandis would want me to close the gap by forbidding people to go overseas. I shall not do that. To make it more attractive for people to come to South Africa is another matter. May I point out to the hon. member that there used to be a higher return fare from Britain to South Africa or from the Continent to South Africa than from South Africa to the Continent. I said that was absolutely wrong. It was fixed internationally. I said that it could not be done, because it was the same distance either way. By exertion of pressure through Satour and through JATA it was eventually agreed that there should not be a difference. That is only one factor. It did not change the gap. However, it was something that was established in fares which attracted people to go overseas rather than to visit South Africa. That was stopped. Now it is the same fare. This matter of attracting tourists to South Africa is very difficult. It is no good closing the gap and ending up with thousands and thousands of disgruntled tourists. The worst advertisement a country can have is when tourists are brought to the country where there is not sufficient accommodation and amenities. The result is that they will go back disgusted with their trip to South Africa. Such a tour to South Africa is expensive. Therefore, undoubtedly the matter has to be handled carefully. I will point out to the hon. member that it is true that the actual overall percentage increase was only about 8.8 per cent in 1968.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>The same as last year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in 1967 it was also 8.8 per cent. It did not reach the 300,000 which I hoped it would reach. It only reached 299,772. Our object was to reach 300,000. It is no good my saying that my object was to get &#x00BD; million, It would have been foolish of me to have made such an exaggerated statement. Even on 300,000 I was 228 down on what I hoped to get. However, what is a satisfactory feature of the figures is whereas the increase in Africa, and the Rhodesias particularly, was only 3.40 per cent, the increase in Europe was 20 per cent. The increase of tourists from Britain rose from 38,780 to 47,710. Britain is still the country from which the largest number of tourists come to South Africa. The tourists from Germany increased from 7,500 to almost 9,000 which is nearly 1,500. The numbers of tourists from countries like the Netherlands also increased. For instance, the number of tourists from Italy increased by over 1,000. The average increase of the number of tourists from Europe, America and those countries to whom we look for tourists, was well over 20 per cent. In fact, the number of tourists from Canada increased by 26 per cent while the number from America increased by 12 per cent. However, it would be no good trying to increase the number of tourists from these countries unless we have the accommodation facilities for them. This is a problem. This is why I want to say to the hon. member for Von Brandis who, I presume, talks for his party, that I am not prepared to think in globular figures when I know, in fact, if we should have globular figures of tourists in this country, we would only send dissatisfied tourists back. However, the position is changing all the time. Improvements are made.</p>

<p>Oh yes. As a matter of fact, I might undertake the survey which the hon. member referred to. I did not discount surveys. For the survey that I wanted private enterprise to do for me, they quoted R&#x00BC; million. I said that it was excessive. I decided that I would rather conduct surveys on a particular issue. They wanted to give me a broad survey of everything. I said that at R&#x00BC; million that survey was of no interest to me. Now I am surveying the position in particular sectors of our tourist industry. I know that the way the hotel industry is developing, in a matter of a few years, we will have about 5,000 extra beds available in the major cities of South Africa. One reads about this hotel development whenever one picks up a paper. Either a scheme is in progress or an amalgamation is being undertaken to develop certain hotels or to build other hotels. We have the Hotel Board financing hotels to improve themselves. The Government itself decided to give guarantees to international hotels in Johannesburg in conjunction with the city council. They offered the same facilities to Durban and also to Cape Town. The local authorities of Cape Town and Durban did not want to meet the 50 per cent obligation. On that basis I should like to know from the hon. member in what way he feels that the job is not being done and that the Minister should be replaced&#x003F; I am quite prepared to listen to him and learn from criticism.</p>

<p>Inquiries will be made as to the very facts which the hon. member for Von Brandis referred to, namely whether there are aspects of the hotel industry where there are bottlenecks, where there could be a different approach and where there should be a change. The hon. member talked about Portugal. For instance, a large amount of the money which he mentioned, is used by the Portuguese to own and build hotels of their own. That is something that I am sure the hon. member for Von Brandis would not approve of in principle. It is not something which we approve of.</p>

<p>I know that. You have the same position in Spain. They spend millions on owning and running hotels. I have always said that function is for the private sector. I agree that money should be made available through the Hotel Board and in certain respects by the Government. However, I do not think that it would be a healthy move if this Government spent millions on the establishing and running of new hotels. I think the hon. member would agree with me. It is done in certain countries. It is done in Portugal and it is done in Spain. But we follow a pattern that is similar to that of some of the other Western countries. I appreciate the criticism from the Opposition, because their job is to criticize and I am anxious to learn from the criticism. I would however say that the points which the hon. member for Von Brandis had in mind are to a large extent points that have worried this Department, points that they have tackled. These points have either been referred to them by the Hotel Board or Satour. The member for Von Brandis also said that the catalyst is lacking. However, this is not the case and I can assure him that it will never be the case. The whole Department and myself in particular will be ready to hear any representations and will consider any proposals that are made.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. the Minister had only one important argument. He said that he would not like to bring tourists to South Africa when there are not enough accommodation facilities. He called these his problems. This is exactly what the hon. member for Von Brandis has raised. He made it quite clear to the hon. the Minister that he is not the only person responsible for this situation in South Africa, but that he should use his influence to change the whole situation in this country. We know that there is an explosion all over the world as far as tourism is concerned. Surely we will have to prepare; otherwise South Africa will not get its rightful share so far as tourists are concerned. The hon. the Minister boasted about the fact that we had 270,000 tourists during the last year.</p>

<p>There has been an improvement, but I think the hon. the Minister should also listen very carefully to the criticism which is not only being raised by the hon. member for Von Brandis but also by other interested parties in this country. I want to refer him especially to an article which appeared in &#x201C;Travel at Home and Abroad&#x201D;. The article was written by John <span class="col_5331-5332" refersTo="page_1154"/>Marsh, the editor of this magazine. This is what he wrote:</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has come to its hour of decision on tourism. Either she is going to cater for tourists properly, or she is going to be forced out of the Tourism Stakes, and suffer the serious consequences. She can no longer sit on the fence. &#x2026; There has been a Minister of Tourism for half a dozen years, but he has been a lamentable failure at the job, if his success is to be judged by positive results.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister also boasted about the fact that he assisted the hotel owners in Hermanus in their efforts to keep their Native waiters. He has probably taken a leaf from the book of the hon. the Minister of Transport. A newspaper reported on this article by Mr. Marsh as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">These are some of the factors listed in the journal in support of Mr. Marsh&#x2019;s comments; Switzerland&#x2019;s biggest tour operator has lost so much money and been so discouraged by opposition from the South African Government&#x2019;s airline, that it has decided to cut its losses and drop a plan to build up business here. Durban&#x2019;s Louis Botha airport has proved unsuitable for dealing with incoming tour groups. One group took 2&#x00BD; hours in January to obtain immigration, health and customs clearance at the airport.</block>

<p>These are only a few of the factors listed. That is why the hon. member for Von Brandis suggested to the hon. the Minister that he should act as a catalyst in this respect. I do not want to believe these unkind things which are said about the hon. the Minister. I find it very difficult to believe all this about the hon. the Minister. I believe that he can do something about this matter. It is in his own hands to change his image as Minister of Tourism in South Africa. It is not necessary for people to say that he has been a lamentable failure. That is why I say that I personally would not like to believe it. It rests with the hon. the Minister; he can be more dynamic and by actively doing so make tourism much more attractive in South Africa. I think we are looking all the time for new avenues and channels through which South Africa can make itself more attractive to the prospective tourists. We on this side of the House want to do the same. The ordinary tourist can find many interesting things which we have to offer. Apart from looking to the masses as tourists, and this is a question I want to put, what about the tourist who have specialized interests&#x003F; I believe that South Africa should also cater for these people. I want to refer to a certain potential which we have in the Eastern Cape. I believe that this has not been explored as yet and that it has not been exploited to the full. I now refer to the posibilities of big game sea fishing in the Eastern Cape waters. We have a terrific potential there which can rival anything in the world, and that is not just the opinion of some enthusiastic deep-sea anglers. It was supported by a well-known expert, an authority like the late Prof. J. L. B. Smith, a top authority on fish. Prof. Smith was heard to say on many occasions that he was convinced that there was an unlimited concentration of game fish off Port Elizabeth, in the Mozambique current in the vicinity of Bird Island. We have evidence that just about all the premier games fishes of the world occur in our waters, not only around the Cape Peninsula, but also in our part of the country. Broad-billed swordfish have been washed ashore off the Eastern Cape. A friend of mine personally examined the carcass of one of these fish near the mouth of the Gamtoos River and every year a great number of yellow-finned tunny are caught there. Black marlin have been caught, as well as the striped marlin. Blue marlin have been identified in our waters. There is also a belief which was held by the late Prof. Smith that the white marlin occurs in our waters. Big-eyed tunney have been identified in the Eastern Cape waters. I mention these in order to explain to the hon. the Minister that here is a wonderful potential which should be exploited in order to get the important deep-sea anglers, who are prepared to pay a great deal of money for this facility, to come here. This is a potential which should be exploited to make our tourist industry more attractive. I need not mention to you, Sir, yellow-tail, barracuda and leervis. All these are found in Eastern Cape waters, but up to now this has not been exploited to the full.</p>

<p>When one discusses a subject such as tourism it is quite easy to be led by personal interests and to say, as the hon. member there has said a moment ago: We must do more about this, that or the other. This is the popular thing to say and it is very easy to say it, but it is quite a different matter to decide what precisely one should do. When one thinks of policy in terms of tourism, there are a few aspects one must bear in mind without just having a pleasant chat about the fish one can catch in the Gamtoos. The hon. member could just as well have told us what pleasure one could get from hunting springbok near Richmond. Then one must also bear in mind what the position is of your country to which one wants to attract tourists, what the geographical position is and what the density of the population is in one&#x2019;s country. One must also bear in mind what one wants to achieve with tourism. Does one want to regard it, as some people say popularly, as something to replace the gold mining industry, or does one want to regard it in the first place as an opportunity to advertise one&#x2019;s country&#x003F; I say these are all matters one has to bear in mind, and if one does that one will not reach the stage where the hon. members of the Opposition will express criticism of the kind expressed this afternoon, because this sort of criticism is irrelevant; it is neither here nor there. Somebody mentioned tourism explosion one day, and now some people like to talk about explosions; let us talk of a tourism explosion, because there was an explosion in Europe and many tourists are going there, and why can we not have it here as well, without thinking of what we are going to do with them here, of what we have to offer them and of what our aim is. In so far as there is a tourism explosion in Europe, it is a fact that they do not have to travel long distances there, and that people can quite easily travel backwards and forwards. In this connection it is equally important to realize that Europe is 6,000 miles away from us, and that America, which is our main source of tourists, is even further away, and any policy in respect of tourism will have to be adapted to that fact, i.e. the fact that thousands and thousands of people will not travel from that country to this one as they are doing in Europe; and, furthermore, the fact that it will only be the wealthy people who will incur the cost of travelling all the way to South Africa. In other words, when determining a policy for tourism one will have to take into account the fact that one is going to cater for the wealthy people. And if one thinks in terms of tourists, of people who will have to travel thousands of miles, accommodation is fundamental. In other words, hotel accommodation will have to cater for people in the very high income groups who will be prepared to pay. But something which is also involved here, is the question of transport. People who travel thousands of miles to visit our country, do not bring their own cars with them. They want to travel comfortably and very quickly from one place to another. That is why one will have to take into account the transport which will be required for that kind of tourist.</p>

<p>What is our aim as far as tourism is concerned, and could we, in the light of these phenomena, be in the same position the major tourist countries of Europe find themselves in&#x003F; I want to say to-day without belittling the aims of tourism, that our country simply cannot compete with countries such as Spain and Austria and Portugal and others, not only on account of distances, but also on account of our geographical nature and composition of our population.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks what I am talking about. May I remind him&#x003F; He represents an urban constituency, the very kind of constituency that should make provision for tourism, but he comes from a country area originally where many people like himself are living, people in their thousands who come to our sea-side resorts during the holidays; these are our own people who are looking for these facilities in the first place. It is different in a country such as Portugal where thousands and thousands of people do not think it necessary to travel thousands of miles to be able to go on holiday, but who make it their duty to devote themselves to the tourist trade and who go and work in those hotels and ancient castles and who make a living out of it. But the sheep farmer Jan Moolman wants to go on holiday to East London once a year, even though he may not represent that constituency. And there are thousands of other people who do the same. The Public Servant in Johannesburg and Pretoria, the teacher from the rural areas, all of them want to go to the sea-side resorts and it is at the coast where we actually have our actual tourist resorts. [Interjection.] The hon. member says he would not even look at the sea-side resorts, but there are other fine tourist attractions such as the Kruger National Park.</p>

<p>I now want to ask the hon. member for East London (City) whether he would go to the National Park should it now be thrown open to another half a million people. Can he imagine the chaos there will be&#x003F; Does he think the set-up in the National Park allows for millions of people to be dealt with&#x003F; That is why I come back to the point by saying that our approach cannot be the approach we have in Spain or Austria or Portugal. Our approach should be to try to attract the wealthy people as well as those who have influence, but our aim should not be to use tourism as a substitute for the gold-mining industry, because this it can never be. Our secondary industry is systematically replacing our gold-mining industry, but our tourist industry should be an industry on its own, which should develop on its own and which should earn us more revenue, and it should serve us on its own as a medium to advertise our country overseas. <span class="col_5335-5336" refersTo="page_1156"/>If this is going to be one&#x2019;s approach, surely it is wrong to speak of an explosion. I can understand that interesting bodies, travel agencies and others, which want to make as much money as possible out of an explosion on tourism, will make a great fuss and say that too little is being done in some respects, because they make some money out of it, but this is unrealistic. I say that when one approaches a policy in the way I have set out here, one must believe that, co-ordinated by all interests, the hotel trade, transport and other interests, there should be long-term planning where provision is made for an annual increase in the number of tourists one is able to cope with. I want to say to-day that a growth rate of 8 per cent, or as is said in some spheres, 10 per cent, which is the rate of growth we have at present as compared with that of last year, is an impressive one. I believe that if that rate could be maintained, a very high figure would be reached in 20 years&#x2019; time. But I want to repeat that it would be unrealistic to think in terms of an explosion which has to take place while one does not plan systematically to provide the necessary facilities. That is why I am convinced that, economically speaking and also as far as advertising our country is concerned, we may avail ourselves of the tourist trade, but then it should be planned and it should take place in an orderly fashion, and then it cannot be something we exploit to cause an explosion here.</p>

<p>I am most surprised at the hon. member for Stellenbosch speaking with so much pessimism about the possibilities of the tourist industry in South Africa. He is usually a man who speaks with great confidence and vehemence about the future of any undertaking in South Africa. I want to tell him that no less a person than the chairman of the Netherlands Bank, Dr. Frans Cronje, has himself stated that it was quite possible for the tourist industry to overtake the earnings from gold with its declining production in South Africa, and he says that could be done in a matter of two decades.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>What I am indicating to the hon. member is that the potential of our industry is far greater than he was prepared to concede. But the difficulty is this. The Minister this afternoon indicated his attitude. The Minister who is in charge of the portfolio of Tourism says: Let me have suggestions and I will go into them. This is an attitude which the Minister has taken also in regard to regional conferences. When something is suggested and some discussion takes place and one thinks that this is a matter which should now be investigated by the Department of Tourism, the Minister always says Well, you go into the matter and give me some broad plan and then we can do something about it. But I think the initiative in these matters should come from the Minister himself. The initiative should come from his department, from their investigations. Sir, it does not take much initiative to look at the areas and the resorts which are attracting tourists at the present time. One has to look at the growing tourist attractions which are provided in the islands of the Mozambique channel; one has to look at the attractions of the Mediterranean Islands and the increasing number of tourists who are flocking to the Grecian Islands. I would have thought that long before now the hon. the Minister would have looked to the islands which are off the South African west coast and which could well be developed as tourist attractions. I want to suggest a particular one which happens to be in my constituency, one of the seven islands along the west coast, and that is Robben Island. The Minister has sat and allowed a tourist attraction, such as Robben Island which could be developed by the private sector, to remain as it is and to be used unproductively as a prison colony.</p>

<p>I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that this is a matter that needs investigation by his department. The potential is there within a matter of five miles from the mainland. The hon. the Minister will know that that particular area of land has had a chequered history. History shows that it has been utilized from as far back as the year 1400 as an important stopping-place on the way round the Cape, and since then it has been used for various purposes; as a provisioning centre, as a postal station, as a leper settlement, for mental patients and during the war for Defence purposes, and now it is being used as a prison centre. I want to suggest to the Minister that this is a matter that needs looking into. We have the facilities and opportunities to make this island off the Southern Cape as great an attraction for tourists as any island in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>We can get rid of those. What will probably interest the Minister of Transport is the shocking neglect of the golf course there. It is not being used to-day; it has been neglected since the end of the war. But, Sir, I want to be serious. I believe that in the period between 1930 and 1940, when it was not being used by the State for any purpose, there was in fact an offer from the late I. W. Schlesinger, through his organization, of &#x00A3;1 million for the island. He wanted to purchase the island for development for this particular purpose, as a holiday and tourist attraction. I believe that this is a matter which the Minister should well consider because of the fact that this island is in a position where it could well be developed as a tourist attraction. Moreover, it has a climate which is far better than the climate of Cape Town itself. I has a rainfall of only 15 inches. Sir, I am sure the Minister will realize the potential of this island. There is the harbour, there are the yachting facilities, bathing facilities and fishing facilities. I hope this matter will receive his attention. I believe it has already been brought to the notice of his department at the regional conference which was recently held, but nothing is being done to investigate whether this potential can be developed. There has been a request from the Western Cape and from members on both sides of the House that something should be done to develop this attraction for the benefit of the tourist industry.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to react to what was said by the hon. member for Green Point, who made a constructive speech. I think the Minister will react to that himself. I want to begin by saying that I myself do not have the slightest doubt either that the tourist industry in South Africa will one day become one of our most flourishing industries. As the position is to-day, the tourist industry is already earning, with the exception of gold and wool, the largest amount of foreign exchange for South Africa, i.e. R100 million, as was said here this afternoon. But although we realize the value of tourism, one must view tourism in the right perspective, and one should not be over-hasty with visions of a throng of millions of tourists in this country. I think the hon. the Minister and the Secretary for Tourism and his department are setting about the entire planning of tourism in a systematic and proper way. The Opposition will therefore do much better to come forward with constructive criticism, as the hon. member for Green Point did, instead of following the example of the chief spokesman of the Opposition who came forward with criticism alleging that the Minister was not doing his work and that he would have to go if he could not do his work. The position as regards tourism, as I see it, is that we in South Africa should, in the first place, start by laying the foundations for the tourist industry. We still are in the initial stages as regards our tourist industry, and until we have developed all the resources at our disposal, we cannot throw the gates wide open as was recommended here this afternoon. The most important matter is, of course, the question of accommodation, as hon. members on both sides of the House have already said. To-day we simply do not have sufficient accommodation to receive these millions of tourists hon. members mentioned. There are various reasons for this. One of these is the fact that the schools in the various provinces all have their holidays more or less at the same time. We know that the hon. the Minister of National Education is working on a scheme to see whether the holiday seasons of the schools cannot be changed. This will do much to help to make more accommodation available. Sir, in spite of what the hon. the Minister said here earlier to-day, I nevertheless want to ask him whether he will not consider, as a long-term project, having hotels built for average tourists by means of making loans available at a low rate of interest, just as Spain did in respect of the beautiful isle of Majorca&#x003F; I also want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the Industrial Development Corporation, which has done so much to develop our industries in South Africa, especially those that were struggling, cannot help the tourist industry as well, which, after all, is also an industry, by way of guidance and even by way of financial support. I wholeheartedly agree with the hon. member for Stellenbosch that we cannot go in for mass tourism at this stage. We should rather pay special attention to the richer people, for example, the moneyed Americans. When I was in the U.S.A. recently, I heard that there were at least 100,000 millionaires in America, and if we could get some of those tourists from America and from Canada to stay here longer and to spend more money here, it would benefit us much more than to get tourists who pay flying visits of a few days to Cape Town or Johannesburg and then return. There are enough rich Americans and Canadians to-day to fill every aircraft and ship coming to South Africa for at least a year. Last year, according to the figures I could obtain, 18,000 Americans visited South Africa. This represents only a very small percentage of the potential we could get from the U.S.A. as well as Canada, but this nevertheless means a very healthy increase of 20 per cent on last year&#x2019;s figure. This causes me to express a special word of congratulations to-day, in spite of the criticism expressed by the Opposition here, to the tourist organization in South Africa, and by this I mean the hon. the Minister, his zealous and energetic Secretary, Mr. Vladimir Steyn, as well as Satour, the people who succeeded in developing the tourist industry, in spite of problems we still have in our country, to such an extent that we were able to attract these 18,000 Americans to our country. There are many rich Americans as well as Europeans who have <span class="col_5339-5340" refersTo="page_1158"/>become bored with visiting other countries. They have travelled all over the world; they have been in the West Indies, in Britain and in Europe, and now they are looking for more interesting hunting grounds. I am convinced that South Africa, with the correct approach and the correct publicity, will be able to provide those new hunting grounds, those spectacular and unique experiences the Americans and the British are looking for.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should just like to say a few words about publicity, an aspect of which I think I have a little knowledge. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the fact that the Department of Tourism is now employing the services of a South African advertising company instead of American companies, as it used to do. Recently when I was in New York, I visited Satour&#x2019;s office there and I was impressed by the brilliant material which they are distributing there from a publicity point of view. Unfortunately I do not have a brochure here, but I can tell you, Sir, that some of the slogans and headings in the brochures they are distributing there are absolutely gripping, and will certainly grip the imagination of the American in his own idiom. I just want to mention one example I can remember, and that is the following heading in a brochure, &#x201C;Have you ever surprised a lady in her bath&#x003F;&#x201D;, and then follows a photo of an elephant playing in the water, and interesting scenes in connection with an elephant taking a bath. An interesting thing is, Sir, that people overseas are no longer so interested in lions; it seems to me as though people overseas are much more interested in elephants to-day. There are 7,000 elephants in the Kruger National Park alone &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and I think that we should shift the emphasis more from lions to elephants now. It is easy to understand why they are so interested in the elephant. It is an animal from prehistoric times, and they feel that they could perhaps see a lion in a zoo in other parts of the world, but that it is not an every-day occurrence to see large herds of elephants.</p>

<p>I also want to congratulate Satour on the slogan they devised to sell tourism overseas. They devised one single impact-making, comprehensive slogan under the title of &#x201C;South Africa: Come see for yourself.&#x201D; I think this is a very good psychological approach, because the message reaches not only the prejudiced, but also those who are ignorant about our country, and I want to ask whether this slogan cannot perhaps also be taken over by the other media that are making publicity for our country overseas, for example, the S.A. Airways and the Department of Information, and perhaps even the South African Foundation as well.</p>

<p>In the second place, before I conclude, I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that he should enable tourists to enter the country more comfortably, and in this connection I want to make a few suggestions. In the first place I want to ask whether he cannot use his influence as a Minister to advocate the abolition of one of the greatest evils in our hotels about which all tourists in South Africa complain endlessly, and that is the South African habit, or custom, or disease, or bad habit&#x2014;call it what you like&#x2014;of waking one up in hotels in the early hours of the grey dawn with a cup of tea or coffee. Sometimes that tea or coffee is quite undrinkable in any event. Few people ever drink that coffee, and the tourists complain that, when they still want to enjoy their early-morning sleep, the servants come and hammer on the doors. I want to deliver a plea to the hotels in South Africa to-day to consider whether they may not as well abolish that South African custom.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask whether taxi companies in our big cities cannot arrange matters in such a way that during the peak seasons of tourism, taxi drivers who at least know something of our country, can be stationed near our stations, airports or major hotels. A taxi driver is one of the first points of contact in any country. [Interjection.] Mr. Chairman, &#x201C;taxi&#x201D; is a generally accepted word in Afrikaans. &#x201C;Taxi&#x201D; happens to be a French word, and it is in common use in Afrikaans. The taxi driver is one&#x2019;s first contact in any country, and that is why I want to ask whether an appeal cannot be made to taxi companies to place more knowledgeable people, people who are well-informed about conditions and attractions in South Africa, at these important points of entry. Then I also want to ask whether we cannot devise a plan to welcome tourists in a more friendly way on their arrival at Jan Smuts Airport. I have in mind the employment of a team of efficient and attractive girls, for example, as we find a well known commercial bank in South Africa is doing. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to discuss tourism is to discuss an industry which has great possibilities. In this debate tourism was referred to from time to time as an earner of foreign exchange. This is true, especially when one has regard to the fact that a year or two ago there were 128 million people who travelled outside the borders of their various countries, and who spent R6,000 million in the process. According to the latest estimates South Africa&#x2019;s share was 275,000 tourists in 1968. But, Sir, the question arises whether we are not over-emphasizing tourism as an earner of money and whether one should not pay more attention&#x2014;this is important to me&#x2014;to tourism as a means of creating a sound mutual understanding between people and nations. As regards our approach to this entire matter, I think that in future we should perhaps place more emphasis on this aspect, so that we may help to create more goodwill towards South Africa through tourism.</p>

<p>As regards tourism in general, however, there are certain problems we are struggling <span class="col_5341-5342" refersTo="page_1159"/>with. There are problems in respect of accommodation, in respect of the elimination of which the Hotel Board is making a very major contribution. I want to pay tribute this afternoon to the good work the Hotel Board has done in this connection within a very short time. They may rest assured that the good work they are doing is held in high esteem. But they cannot do all the work by themselves. Now I want to submit for consideration that the time has arrived&#x2014;this to a certain extent proceeds from the argument my colleague made a moment ago in respect of the welcoming of overseas visitors at airports&#x2014;that a little more attention should be given to establishment of visitors&#x2019; clubs for overseas tourists, which, on the one hand can be instrumental in meeting the accommodation requirements, and on the other hand, can provide information and guidance and make those people feel at home in South Africa. Not only should they make the visitors feel at home, but they should also see to it that, wherever those visitors may come from, there will be a typical South African atmosphere in the places of accommodation, and that that atmosphere will be maintained and that the overseas visitors will derive full benefit from that. If we do this we shall, in my opinion, be making a major contribution in any event towards the creation of goodwill between ourselves and overseas visitors.</p>

<p>But now there is another matter in this connection to which I should like to refer as well. I want to deliver a specific and to the point plea for closer co-operation between the Department of Tourism and the Department of Cultural Affairs with a view to our overseas visitors being enabled to an increasing extent to become acquainted with the cultural treasures of South Africa as well. I foresee that the time will come when hardly any visitor will not have had an opportunity of visiting places such as our cultural history museums and other places of cultural interest as well. If we take our overseas visitors to such places they will also be able to form a better understanding of our sentiments in South Africa. Consequently I am asking whether the time has not arrived for seeking closer liaison between this department and the Department of Cultural Affairs.</p>

<p>I also want to ask, in another connection, whether it will not be possible to give consideration to the publication of a properly compiled and comprehensive tourist guide to replace this mass of pamphlets, brochures and folders which are made available from time to time with a view to publicity for our tourist industry. This could include everything, also what is contained in these loose pamphlets, etc. Such information, if properly compiled, may serve as a permanent work of reference for prospective visitors.</p>

<p>As a result of a plea delivered last year, I should like to hear from the Minister whether attention has been given to the possibility of integrating the Tourist Corporation more closely with the Department of Tourism. We tried to make out a case for this last year, and the understanding was that the hon. the Minister would go into the matter more deeply. Can the Minister give us any indication of whether something like that is feasible&#x003F; I still feel convinced that if the Department were to have full control over the Corporation, it would be possible to have a larger degree of uniformity in their activities, and this could only stimulate the promotion of this industry.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to reply at this stage to some of the points raised. The hon. member for Lydenburg in referring to the Blyde River Canyon said that consideration should be given to having a cable-way in that canyon. In my opinion there would be great opposition from a large section of the public who might say that the erection of a cable-way might destroy the natural beauty. All I can say to the hon. member is that it is a matter which he should take up with the provincial authorities responsible for the development of the Blyde River Canyon, and that he should try and convince them that this is something which they should consider. They have developed this canyon. It was not done by private enterprise but by the province. If they consider that this suggestion has merit, they will no doubt give it their support. My own feeling is that there would be a great deal of public feeling against such a development in that beautiful natural resort and that beautiful canyon. The hon. member also referred to the Louis Trichardt trek. I have seen the path that was worn by the ox waggons wheels and to South Africans this means a great deal. This would undoubtedly be appreciated by them but on the other hand I do not think that overseas tourists will take very much notice of it. However, because we are also concerned with our internal tourists I feel it is something that should be brought to their notice and to that extent I support the hon. members.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point referred to the potential of tourism. I do not disagree that there is a potential of tourism. All I can say to the hon. member for Green Point is that I do not believe in a complete exaggeration of the situation. The hon. member mentioned Dr. Frans Cronje. I know Dr. Frans Cronje well. I also know that he is chairman of the Netherlands Bank. But I do not agree with him when he said&#x2014;and I am not speaking on the long term&#x2014;that on the short term there could be almost a complete revolution in the tourist economy which could bring about a situation whereby tourism could replace gold as a source of foreign currency.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He said that it might be equal to the gold industry. He was not saying that it could replace the diminishing gold industry, but that it could equal the gold industry. When the hon. member for Von Brandis mentioned this matter I immediately said to him that there was a difference between what he said when he spoke of the diminishing gold industry, and what had been stated previously. Previously it had been stated that this could be equal to the gold industry. It is no good bluffing myself. If I stick my neck out like that, I am sure that the first people to chop it off would be the hon. members on that side of the House. I am not prepared to make statements which are exaggerated. I want to stick to facts. In regard to the increase of tourism in South Africa from year to year, I should like to refer to the speech of the hon. member for Stellenbosch. He is quite right. One cannot produce a situation where there is a tourist explosion, because this will undo all the good work one has tried to do over the years. That is why I said we should be realistic. Let us approach tourism from a realistic point of view. If we do so, I feel that we can make headway.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point also spoke about the regional committee meetings which I have attended. He said that I was inclined to ask those committees for their suggestions. He said that I should initiate such suggestions. Surely the hon. member does not appreciate the situation. I think there was a case where the hon. member for Simonstown spoke to me personally, at this meeting at Fish Hock in regard to the Miller&#x2019;s Point fishing harbour, which they wanted the State to develop.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I am just using this as an illustration. The hon. member wanted me to initiate an inquiry. I refused to do so, but said: &#x201C;If the inquiry is initiated by your people through the Divisional Council, I shall be quite prepared to consider whatever is submitted, and I shall then submit it through the right channel, because I also believe that there are certain people who are completely against the idea of Miller&#x2019;s Point being developed into a fishing harbour.&#x201D; There are always two sides to such a matter. The hon. member mentioned Robben Island, a matter which was also raised at this conference. Does the hon. member really think that I should initiate the sort of scheme he has in mind, namely to develop Robben Island into a vacation island&#x003F; I do not want to call this a wild-cat scheme, but there are many more things my Department and I can apply ourselves to, things which have greater possibilities than to develop Robben Island. That is why, when the hon. member for Newton Park spoke about big game fishing, I realized again, as I have always realized, that this is one of the aspects of the South African coast line that can be further developed. I have made a point of appealing to people in this regard, particularly when it comes to the fishing arrangements we have at Simonstown. I have attended functions they have had. I feel that the last international tournament they had was fantastic. I have also been up to places like Port Alfred, Kosi Bay and Sordwana. Here I was thinking in terms of the Mozambique Channel, because it may not be off the Eastern Province, but nearer the Mozambique coast, that one may find the biggest game fish.</p>

<p>I go into facts, but I do not go into wildcat schemes. The hon. member for Newton Park referred to an article about the lamentable failure of the Minister to fulfil his task. I read the article too. In actual fact, I have read other articles in a similar vein by people I take notice of when I think notice should be taken of them. However, I must say I was not impressed with the author of this particular article. Generalities like that just do not impress me. If the man wrote about the people who were held up at Durban on the airport, I am prepared to say that I would have gone into a matter like that. However, in actual fact, I would also say that my experience at airports has been very satisfactory. That also applies to the time before I became a Minister. Just recently I was travelling in a Rhodesian airliner which must have been carrying over 100 passengers. The treatment which the authorities gave the passengers of that aircraft was very good and quite equal to anything which I have experienced abroad. The hon. member also talked about specialized tourists. Of course, we are in favour of specialized groups of tourists, groups of a particular nature. The only group that we do not really approve of, are the people who come to South Africa for hunting purposes. In this country we do not believe in providing hunting facilities. We have our parks, but we do not believe in hunting.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I will not. I would be very reluctant to see hunting in our game parks. Even when it was pointed out that the game had to be thinned out, I completely supported the Parks Board when they said that the game should be thinned out by warders and not by hunters. I think this is a policy which a large number of people in South Africa support. There is hunting being done on other farms, but not in our game parks. The hon. member also talked about the fishing facilities. I should only like to emphasize that if anything in that direction develops, it will be nearer to the Mocambique border than down to the Eastern Province, because it is in the Mocambique Channel itself where the marlin and the big-game fish are found.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vasco referred to the ships that are coming to Cape Town particularly. All I can tell him is that every effort is made to contact the ships that come in. We have been in touch, particularly, with lines like the P. &#x0026; O. line whose tourist ships used to pass through the Suez Canal. Since the Suez Canal has been closed they come via Durban and Cape Town. Every effort is made to accommodate these tourists and to give them the opportunity of seeing as much as they can during the short period during which they are here. The ships do not stay very long; they are <i>en route</i> particularly for Europe, but we do as much as we can as far as they are concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein spoke about the accommodation bottleneck, and about loan money at lower rates of interest for the erection of new hotels, such as in Majorca. In this connection I can just say that we face a problem when we supply loan money, through the Hotel Board, to hotels in a place where there are already established hotels. It undoubtedly does not appeal to the established hotels. It does not appeal to me either. The attitude is that the money which we supplied to the Hotel Board, was supplied on the understanding that priority should be given to the improving of already established hotels. Incidentally this question of loan money which is used for the improving of hotels, is not referred to me, but when it comes to a new hotel it is referred to me. The only one which was referred to me and to which I agreed, was in the case of Hluhluwe, where there was no hotel and where the accommodation in the game reserve was not adequate. In that case there was every justification for the new hotel. The basis on which the hotel has been allowed there, was that the reserve is a tourist attraction and if hotel accommodation could be offered near the reserve, it would be of great advantage to the tourist industry. The hon. member also referred to the rich Americans; all I can tell the hon. member is that Satour is regularly in touch with 100,000 of the rich Americans who have gone overseas but who have not yet come to South Africa. It is being done through that agency to which the <span class="col_5347-5348" refersTo="page_1162"/>hon. member referred. The hon. member also referred to the complaints about the early morning coffee and tea; I shall pass it on to the Hotel Board. The hon. member suggested that the tourists should be welcomed by taxi drivers and attractive girls. Well, I suppose that all we married men will not be prepared to say that there should be attractive girls, although we might think so. Nevertheless I appreciate the point which he has made.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the matter about the Department of Tourism and Satour, which the hon. member for Springs has raised. Satour is an established, autonomous corporation, and it has been granted the right to operate as such by an Act of Parliament. That being so, I did not feel myself justified to refer this to the department, neither do I feel myself justified to make any suggestions to the Cabinet, nor to consider it myself. My own point of view is that Satour operates efficiently and I am always in contact with the chairman of Satour, who is also the Secretary of Tourism. I think that the present way is the best way of developing Satour. The same applies to the Hotel Board. I do not want to dominate the Hotel Board through my department. All I can say is that the Hotel Board is an autonomous board of which the Deputy Secretary of the Department is a member. Some matters are referred to me, but the ordinary running of their activities is done by the body itself and therefore the responsibility rests with them. I have found that this basis works very well and I do not want to take on the role of being the person who dictates to these boards in detail how they should operate and what they should do. Therefore, I reject this suggestion, and I do not see any justification for any change in that direction.</p>

<p>I think I have answered most of the questions which were raised here. In regard to the other questions which I have not answered fully, I can say to the hon. members that I have made notes of the questions and that they will undoubtedly be attended to by me and my department.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this afternoon I am grateful for the opportunity of once more being able to focus attention on an area which is not a large area and which is not merely an area in my constituency either, but an area which actually includes the whole north eastern part of Natal. This area is, by chance, of inestimable value to tourism. In addition we also now have the new hub of development towards the future expansion at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. In the future Richard&#x2019;s Bay will be linked by road and rail to Vryheid, and thereby also to the Eastern Transvaal. A large national road is also being contemplated from Pongola to Richard&#x2019;s Bay. We therefore find that all these communications channels are directed at Richard&#x2019;s Bay, which is regarded as the growth point and which will, at a later stage have to provide for more than .8 million people. It is the present day tendency to make use of air transport. If we were to look at the figures supplied in the Satour report we would know that air transport supplied about 40 per cent of the total transport for tourists. Not only do we have to complain about the lack of landing facilities for aircraft in that large area, but we also have to complain about the lack of means of transport which will be necessary for tourists as soon as those communications channels have been established. This aspect is going to need very prompt attention. Then there is also the question of large buses being prohibited in the game reserves. In the light of what the hon. Chief Whip of the United Party said here a moment ago, in connection with the Jumbo-jets, I wonder how the numerous tourists from the large cities and airports will be transported to these tourist resorts.</p>

<p>I now want to confine myself more specifically to the question of beaches, beaches which stretch from the Tugela River to Kosi Bay close to the Portuguese border. In this area we have the terrible situation that not a single inch of that beach area is open to development by private initiative. It is a situation which the entire country is not aware of. If is an indefensible situation and, seen from a tourist&#x2019;s point of view, it places us in an impossible position. A small portion of the land in that area, which does not belong to the Department of Bantu Administration, falls under the Department of Forestry, and the major portion under the control of the Natal Parks Board. I now want to refer to the Natal Parks Board.</p>

<p>At a place such as Mtunzini, where there is a beautiful lagoon, the Natal Parks Board adopts the standpoint that they control everything beneath the surface of the water, but they they do not control its surface area. If problems arise about who should control the surface area of the water one can land in all kinds of difficulties. I put the matter to the Director of the Natal Parks Board and when I asked him what he could do about it he suggested that the lagoon area be annexed to the Mtunzini Town Council. However, when the Town Council applied to the Natal Parks Board their request was refused; this is now the type of co-operation we get from them.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that the camping spots at Richard&#x2019;s Bay during the holiday season are so inadequate that people camp next to the roads in the veld, while no facilities exist.</p>

<p>A new problem has now arisen again at a place where the Zululanders traditionally go for their week-end sport, i.e. Mapelane. About 35 people have small holiday cottages here which are made of wood. They are also, <i>inter alia,</i> ski boat clubs. The people have now been instructed to leave that area because the Parks Board, with the great powers at its disposal, has simply decided that they must no longer be allowed there. I now ask myself, who must we turn to&#x003F; Is the Parks Board the absolute monarch who arranges and decides <span class="col_5349-5350" refersTo="page_1163"/>everything in that area&#x003F; They not only did that, they also appointed an official to search the people and vehicles entering there. I want to claim this evening that there is probably no statutory board in South Africa which acts as high-handedly as the Natal Parks Board. In addition, they always do so against the explicit and express wishes of the public. Each time it is a deliberate attempt at displaying their powers and frustrating and angering the public.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that descriptive word. The same applies to the St. Lucia municipal area. This area does not border on the sea itself because the actual strip of beach also falls under the control of the Parks Board. At False Bay they spoke of development to the tune of about R1 million, specifically at the so-called Picnic Point. However, when we asked them when they were getting round to the development they replied that it was still in the embriological stage. Although there was no money for the development at Picnic Point, we subsequently heard of an amount of R600,000 being voted for development at Midmar. We then asked why there was money for development at one place and not at another. Thereupon they replied that they were being threatened by the Government and that the Government has said that they could not gain control over the Midmar Dam before they had developed it according to the Government&#x2019;s specifications. The hon. members see the logic of that argument; if the Government threatens the Parks Board they do it very quickly. They are hard at work developing that area merely because the Government exerted pressure on them. I believe that it is the task of the Department of Tourism also to use its influence in the interests of the tourist attractions of the Zululand coast.</p>

<p>With respect to the need for accommodation which has already been discussed this afternoon, I want to quote you a statement by the Parks Board.</p>

<p>&#x201C;To yield to the ever-increasing demands for more and more accommodation in significant game areas (not &#x201C;inside game reserves&#x201D;, but in &#x201C;game areas&#x201D;, i.e. also on the beaches) would make those areas less and less suitable for what the visitors hope to see.&#x201D;</p>

<p>They also stated:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;A game reserve experience is evaluated in direct ratio to the degree of &#x2018;loneliness&#x2019; which one experiences.&#x201D;</block>

<p>If things go on like that I see no other alternative but to recommend that the work of the Natal Parks Board be taken over by the National Parks Board.</p>
