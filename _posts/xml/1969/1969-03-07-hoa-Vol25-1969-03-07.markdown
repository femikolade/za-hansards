<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#bennett">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a) 6th January, 1969.</li>

<li>(b), (c) and (2)<br/>It is common practice, when introducing a new type of aircraft, to arrange a demonstration flight and to invite prominent persons in different walks of life as guests on such a flight. When the flight is arranged to take place over a meal hour, it is the practice to serve refreshments. The purpose of these flights is to promote goodwill and to obtain publicity for the airline.<br/>In view of the foregoing, no purpose will be served by giving the further information desired by the hon. member.</li></ol></li>

<li>(3) Yes, owing to the fact that the Southbound flight from Johannesburg (flight SA 323) suffered a technical delay at Jan Smuts Airport, arriving 1 hour 20 minutes late at Cape Town, the demonstration flight with this aircraft was completed too late to permit of return flight SA 310 departing on time. This flight, which is the connecting flight for overseas flights at Jan Smuts Airport. <span class="col_2071-2072" refersTo="page_1058"/>was delayed 1 hour 18 minutes and, as a result, flight SA 230 to Zurich was delayed by 1 hour 5 minutes at Jan Smuts Airport awaiting five joining passengers on flight SA 310.</li>

<li>(c) McCarthy Contractors (Pty.) Ltd. prepared the specifications whereafter it was checked by engineers and architects of my Department.</li>

<li>(d) R1,623,780.</li></ol></li>

<li>(2) No, except the customary retention period of three months in respect of the houses and six months in respect of the roofs, after the houses were taken over by the Department.</li>

<li>(3) No. In terms of the Deeds of Sale, all risks relating to the properties passed to the purchasers.</li>

<li>(4) Yes. The National Housing Commission has offered to release those purchasers who desire it, from their contract. Owing to inadequate maintenance by some purchasers, moisture penetration occurred between the joints of panels in exterior walls, which damaged the sides of the panels where the penetration occurred and which therefore had to be rectified.<br/>After the Department of Community Development with the assistance of the National Building Research Institute of the C.S.I.R. had designed a method to ensure effective moisture protection, the Housing Commission resolved to effect such moisture protection to all 300 houses at its expense.<br/>The Commission, however, simultaneously resolved that in view of the tried durability of the dwellings as proved after the period of 5 years of their existence, purchasers would in future be required to adhere to their obligations in terms of their deeds of sale, namely that the buildings should be kept in a good condition both on the inside and on the outside. However, since the scheme was originally an experimental preconstruction scheme which may, after the experience with the moisture penetration, have caused some purchasers concern, especially considering the fact that the Commission itself will in future not expend further funds on maintenance, it was decided to afford such purchasers the opportunity of cancelling their deeds of sale. In all fairness, all three hundred purchasers should be afforded this opportunity and therefore all of them were advised of the concession in order for them to make their choice.</li>

<li>(5) Yes, except in respect of the planting of grass and shrubs, wire fencing and the making of garden paths.</li>

<li>(6) No, since those who terminate their deeds of sale, will be allowed to remain in the relative dwellings as tenants.</li>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>At the Second Reading of this Bill we opposed this measure and we still intend opposing it to-day. The Minister, in introducing the Second Reading, referred to the motion which he introduced in this House in 1962. On that occasion he traced the history of this system of trial, and he said that as far as he could gather its history went back over 700 years in Europe, and that it was generally assumed that it was the British who had developed this form of trial although it was not certain exactly where it originated. Sir, this system of trial was brought to this country and enforced here in 1827 after the second British occupation of the Cape. It seems a pity that a system with such a long history, a very creditable history as the Minister pointed out at the time, should now be abolished in this manner. It cannot be said that this system was forced on South Africa by the British. It is a system which certainly has been preferred in the English-speaking countries of the world, but I would like to remind the House that in South Africa, the Voortrekkers, when leaving the Cape, took this system of trial with them to the Free State and the Transvaal. It was certainly not forced on them. They themselves instituted this form of trial in those two republics. The system had only been in force in the Cape for seven years when the Voortrekkers took it with them to the new republics. That, I think is evidence of the great store placed by the ordinary citizen on the fairness of trial in this manner and the desirability of this system of trial.</p>

<p>We know that the laws applicable to trial by jury have been amended from time to time and that the system has to a certain extent fallen into disuse. The hon. the Minister and other speakers have also pointed out that a jury may be swayed by emotion, although we have taken steps to avoid that by giving the Minister certain powers to stop trials by jury. It may also be said that the layman is not the best man to judge the facts. I disagree with that, but I would like to point out to those critics who say that the ordinary citizen is perhaps not the best man to judge the facts, that judges are not infallible either. In fact, if judges were infallible in deciding matters of fact, we would have no appeals to the Appellate Division, but the fact is that they are fallible and that is why it is necessary to have a system of appeal. I would point out that if the system of trial by jury is abolished, an accused may be tried by one man alone, and although it may be said that he can go on appeal if he disagrees with the finding on the facts by the judge, it is not always easy for him to do so because there is considerable cost involved in appeals of this nature. Sir, if in 1962 the House felt that it was not advisable to abolish this system of trial, I ask the Minister why he is now proceeding with the abolition of this system. The then Minister of Justice could have adopted the motion but he did not do so.</p>

<p>We know from what the Minister has said now that the different bodies which have been consulted are not unanimous in supporting him. He quoted Mr. Justice Hiemstra as being critical of this system and he relied to a large extent on the judge&#x2019;s criticisms, but as the Minister quite rightly pointed out the judges did not all agree with Mr. Justice Hiemstra&#x2019;s point of view and he will probably have seen in the newspapers that in a recent case in East London, the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Addelson, remarked on the fact that he was probably hearing the last case to be judged in the Eastern Cape by a jury, because of this Bill which is now before the House. The judge expressed his regret and he remarked that other judges shared his great regret that this system of trial was to be abolished. I say therefore that the judges are certainly not in agreement on this issue. The Minister told us that he had not consulted the Bar Council or the Side Bar on this issue because they had been consulted after the 1962 debate, and that he had no reason to believe that they had changed their minds. I say that in view of the fact that the judges themselves are not in agreement and that the Minister believes that the barristers and attorneys are opposed to the abolition of this form of trial, it is a pity that he is now proceeding with this measure. If the system is dying out, as the Minister says, because less and less use is being made of it, why not let it die out on its own then; why does the Government interfere? If the ordinary citizen does not want this system of trial it will die out on its own. But while they do want it, I submit that we should not take this privilege away from the citizen who wishes to have this system of trial.</p>

<p>Sir, as I remarked in the Committee Stage, <span class="col_2105-2106" refersTo="page_1075"/>trial by jury is one of the hall-marks of a democratic State. The Minister, I think in 1962, pointed out that when the jury system was first introduced it had a certain effect on the administrators because they realized that if a law was unpopular or harsh in its application, juries refused to convict the accused if they disagreed with the administrators. So this system has had its advantages in the democratic world, and I submit that we should keep this system in this country, since we pride ourselves on the fact that this country is still one of the democracies of the world. I appeal to the hon. the Minister even at this late hour to give this system of trial a further lease of life, and to do what he did in 1962 when he withdrew his motion after discussion in this House.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>When I spoke at the Second Reading, I appealed to the hon. the Minister not to go ahead with this Bill, and I want again to add my appeal to that which has just come from the hon. member for Transkei. I have examined the reasons put forward by the hon. the Minister in the Second Reading as to why he wishes to get rid of this right, because it is a very important democratic right. One of his motives was that this system was falling into disuse. I am sure he is too good a logician to think that that motive is sufficient to justify such far-reaching action. His second motive was that there were too many people in the country who were exempted from the obligation to serve on juries. There are two things that he can do, if he likes. Firstly, I do not suppose there are fewer than half a million people to choose from, even when all the exempted people and the sick and the lame and the females are excluded. He can, if he likes, make it compulsory for women to serve on juries. Then he talked about administrative difficulties. How can it present any difficulty at all? I do not think that the reasons which he has put forward are in any way convincing. Lastly he said that the Judges, or some of them, had advised in favour of the abolition of this system.</p>

<p>But he also says that the Bar Council has advised him against it. The member of the Bar Council is the future Judge and so perhaps the Minister is out of date. He is antiquated in that respect and instead of listening to the Judges he should listen to the future Judges, who can foresee the future, because he is dealing with the future. He is not dealing with the present; the system is in disuse at the moment. If it will always be in disuse I cannot say. One thing that stands out about trial by jury is that lawyers are always Judges in their own cause and this is one occasion on which the layman has a right and may demand to be judged by his own people. There can be cases where lawyers are the complainers or even the accused. In these cases the layman has the only opportunity of fighting the legal combination which could be created against him. In the interests of the lawyers themselves they should say: Well, if you do not like it, you can be judged by your own people and not by another lawyer.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I am interested to notice that on the other side of the House there was not one voice raised in favour of this system of the administration of justice. The hon. member for Durban (Central) made the point which I think is the really valid point in the whole of this discussion, namely that the system of trial by jury is the only way in which the common man, the farmer as well as the townsman, has a chance to take part in the administration of justice. Mr. Speaker, we stand here in the words you recite every day when we come into this House, i.e. &#x201C;for the welfare of society and the just government of men&#x201D;. I believe that every single person has the right and duty and ought to be allowed to take part in what is the process of the welfare of society and the just government of men. When the hon. the Minister moved a motion in 1962 in regard to the abolition of juries, he sketched the background of the jury system very briefly, but I think he missed the essential point, which was that the jury system has been tied inextricably to the cause of political liberty, especially in Great Britain.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, also in the United States. It is as a result of the victories won for political liberty in the British Isles. I believe we should look at this system which the hon. the Minister rightly says comes out of the dimmest antiquity of the Anglo-Saxon people. He rightly said it was used in the Doomsday Survey, an administrative procedure where 12 good men were on oath required to furnish to the appointees of the king the facts surrounding their locality and to establish in the Doomsday Book the right of every single man, every baron, lord and the king himself in England (in 1083) as it then was after the Norman conquest. Right through the whole history of Great Britain one finds that juries have been used. It was used by Henry II when he began to encroach on the rights of the barons, and it was against this, and this is something which I think is so commonly overlooked, that the barons who drew up the Magna <span class="col_2107-2108" refersTo="page_1076"/>Carta appealed for the traditional rights of the people of England to be protected. They were looking for their rights and not the rights of the common people. There was never a period in the history of England that there was less justice done than when the Star Chamber was established which did away with the right of trial by jury. In 1628, when Sir John Elliott, Chief Justice Cook and others began to lead the opposition to the growing autocracy of the Stuart Monarchy, they made an appeal for the ancient rights and liberties of the people of England.</p>

<p>The re-establishment of trial by jury was a central right in order to do away with the injustices which occurred under the Star Chamber system. All this comes back to the same story, namely that the common man should have a right to express his opinion and his voice in the administration of justice and to make sure that justice should not only be done, but shall be seen to be done. There is such a concern in this country to-day regarding the culture of our people and I want to say that this is part of our culture. This is part of the very thread of the life of the English-speaking person in South Africa. I believe that this system of trial by jury cannot be lightly thrown away and discarded because the hon. the Minister, or some of his advisers, happen to feel that it is something which can simply be done away with because it is no longer being used to such a great extent. This is a very real, living thing in our lives and the day may yet come when we will live to regret the fact that whatever the inconvenience may be to the common man and however much it may take him away from his work and however much it is a bother to the people who have to empanel juries, this system whereby the common man can participate in the administration of justice has been done away with. This is a system which has been adapted over the centuries and why should we do away with it and abandon it now when, in our country, we might have occasion and cause to adapt it to various other administrative procedures? The hon. the Minister made the point that there are no peers when Bantu are tried. This of course was a justification of trial by jury, namely that a man should be tried by his peers. I wonder whether it ever occurred to the hon. the Minister that it might have been possible to use Bantu juries in cases where Bantu were concerned in their own particular areas. This will allow the Bantu people to see that justice is not the administration of the white man, and it will show them that they themselves have got a very real and living right and interest to establish what the facts are so that the truth might be known and exercised in the courts of our country. It occurred to me that this is a system which has lived through the centuries and that it can be adapted to very real present uses in our country. I want to support the hon. member for Transkei in his appeal to the hon. the Minister. I can see from the stony face of the hon. the Minister that my appeal will fall on deaf ears, but nevertheless, I want to record my own emphatic feeling that this is a system which ought to be preserved even if it is merely left to fall into desuetude by the course of time and by lack of interest of our own people, rather than being abolished by the positive action of the executive branch of our Government. I do want to make this appeal to the hon. the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Mooi River said that this system is of such wonderful importance to the English-speaking people of this country. I should like to point out to the hon. member to what extent this system is used in his own province, that is to say, in the Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court. In 1959 there was not one single trial by jury, in 1960 1.3 per cent of the trials were trials by jury, in 1961 there were no trials by jury, in 1962 .5 per cent were trials by jury, in 1963 to 1965 there were no trials by jury, and 1966 .5 per cent, in 1967 .49 per cent and in 1968 there were no trials by jury. The hon. member&#x2019;s province has therefore itself abolished the system.</p>

<p>I have the highest regard for the history of the jury system, and in 1962 I took great pains to trace its history. I expressed my appreciation for the jury system as it existed and as was applied. I also expressed my appreciation for the jury system as it existed and was applied in this country. The fact of the matter, however, is that the system has abolished itself. The system has fallen into disuse, and a further fact is that it is an expensive system to maintain. As I told hon. members in my Second Reading speech, we still have to draw up these lists for each magisterial district after each general registration. This, of course, entails a tremendous amount of work. In course of time these lists become obsolete. People change their addresses. When an accused prefers to have a trial by jury, the deputy sheriff must serve as many as 150 summons in order to assemble 21 jury members. When these 21 persons have eventually been assembled, the accused gets up and says: No, he would prefer to be tried by a judge and assessors. That is what happens. In reality the system has abolished itself, and is not being abolished by me. Hon. members on the opposite side want us to maintain it artificially and at great expense, so that we do not break with the past. There are other things in our legal system which have also fallen into disuse over the years, things in respect of which the courts have said: &#x201C;They have been abolished by disuse.&#x201D; The jury system is on our Statute Book, and as long as it is there, we have to maintain it artificially. This is the one and only reason why I am proposing in this House that the jury system be abolished.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill, as it is before us now, with the amendment which has been incorporated in it, deals specifically with matters falling within the sphere of responsibility of the Minister of the Interior. During the course of discussion on this Bill, which deals in the main with administrative functions, the hon. the Minister has met some of our objections. He has conceded merit in our criticisms on certain aspects of the Bill, and he has undertaken to investigate these aspects. What is now important, Sir, is the attitude of the Minister in regard to the administration of this Bill, and the manner in which he will put it into operation. There are certain points in that regard I should like him to clarify before this Bill is read a Third Time.</p>

<p>The first point is that, in terms of this Bill, the Minister will have the authority to extend powers to classes of officials who come within the purview of his department. It is a departure from the present state of affairs in that in future it will be possible, for example, to give powers of arrest, under the applicable laws, namely the Aliens Control Laws, to persons who previously as individuals were granted such powers by notice in the <i>Gazettes.</i> These powers will be very wide. As I have said, they will include the power of arrest. We on this side conceded that the Minister had reason to ask for this amendment, because of the remoteness and the extent of the borders where alien control must be exercised. These are the areas where the admission to and departure from the country across our borders must be controlled. But, Sir, it will be in the nature of things that this control and these powers of arrest will in some instances be vested in officials of what one might call a junior status in the service. These officials will have power to arrest aliens or persons suspected of being aliens because they are not in possession of documents to prove their right to be in the Republic. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that this power is one which will, for its implementation, need the highest degree of discretion and circumspection when it is used. One can compare this power with powers which already exist, namely powers relating to other sections of our community. In the case of the nonwhite community, the power of arrest exists, for example, when a Bantu is not in possession of his pass documents when asked to produce them. There are many occasions where persons do not carry their documents of identity with them. One often wonders how many of the hon. members sitting in this House, for instance, if they were suddenly requested to produce their identity cards, would be able to produce them from their pockets or their wallets.</p>

<p>Well, I accept that the hon. the Minister is setting a good example. What I want to impress upon the Minister is that there are occasions where persons quite legitimately are without their papers. This power, which has existed before, but which is now to be extended to lower grades of officials, to arrest persons, is a very serious one. I trust that the Minister will assure us that the instructions which he will give, and which will be given by his department, will ensure circumspection in the carrying out of these powers, and that adequate opportunity will be given to persons suspected of being unauthorized aliens in our country to produce their documents.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make is in regard to a question which has already been discussed, namely the question of loss of citizenship and consequent classification, for purposes of this Act, of a South African-born citizen as an alien. We have heard some rather extravagent arguments about it being a question of &#x201C;Good riddance&#x201D; to such people. We on this side agree that persons should not in every case retain full rights of citizenship merely because of birth. One concedes that there are laws in this country which deprive persons of their citizenship. But the Minister has conceded on his part that there can be, and probably are, cases of hardship and injustice under this rigid rule as it now appears in the Act. The hon. the Minister knows of the difficulties which arise in regard to other aspects of the administration of his Department, where rules are too rigid when dealing with individuals. I should like the hon. the Minister to undertake as soon as possible the investigation which he has assured us he will undertake, in order that he can rectify or alleviate the position which we see as oppressive under this Act, and I hope that he will introduce legislation, if necessary, to cover the case of the person who was born in South Africa, and who has lost his citizenship, but who is a good and worth-while person whom we would like to have back in this country of ours. This was our main objection to this clause and the Minister conceded that we had a point. The Minister has given us the assurance that he will look into this matter. We look forward to hearing from him what steps will in fact be taken.</p>

<p>There has been some confusion in regard to the loss of citizenship and the consequent application of clause 2 to persons who leave the country without a passport. It is accepted legally that the grant of a passport is the prerogative of the State. That is the position. There is no argument about that. But what we have found during the course of this debate, is a suggestion that that prerogative is in some instances not being handled according to the accepted and traditional tests which are applied by the State to determine whether a passport should be granted or not.</p>

<p>There is a large question mark in this House as regards the Minister&#x2019;s attitude to applications for passports by Coloured persons. The Minister has said that when a passport is requested by a Coloured person, or by Coloured persons, as has been happening, he asks for a deposit. He explained that the reason for such a deposit was to ensure that there would be no expense to the State if such a Coloured person were repatriated without acquiring the nationality of another state. But, Sir, the hon. member for Outeniqua, in the course of this debate, suggested that the reason for this requirement of a deposit or a guarantee for return fares, was to dissuade Coloured intellectuals from leaving South Africa. He suggested that, by putting difficulties in their way, they would remain here for the benefit of ther own Coloured people. I want to ask the Minister, as I asked him during the Committee Stage, to say quite categorically that the hon. member for Outeniqua was misinformed. I still hope that the hon. the Minister will at this stage of the proceedings assure us that the hon. member for Outeniqua was quite incorrect in what he said. I want to ask the Minister something which is most pertinent to the question of the loss of citizenship. I want to ask him whether there is a consistent approach in considering an application for a passport in the case of all South African citizens, no matter what colour or race they might be. In other words, if a person who holds South African citizenship approaches the hon. the Minister for a passport, will the same tests and the same requirements be applied to all citizens? I want to know whether there are not certain classes or grades of citizens who have differing tests applied to them. Because if the Minister does not request a white professional man who wishes to leave South Africa to provide these deposits or guarantees, but does in the case of a Coloured professional man, he lays himself open to the accusation that he practises discrimination, which cannot be tolerated in South Africa, also not on account of South Africa&#x2019;s good name. Having regard to the debate as it has proceeded thus far, at this Third Reading we are asking from the hon. the Minister a categorical assurance that there will not be this discrimination, discrimination on the basis of race. Because all are citizens of South Africa. The administration in any other way of these rights vesting in the Minister would be most harmful to the good name of South Africa. I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree with me on this point and that he, if there has been any administrative inconsistency in the handling of this matter, will see to it that it is put right.</p>

<p>The fourth and last matter which I want to raise on the Third Reading of this Bill relates to the question of the giving of reasons for deportation orders. This House when it was in <span class="col_2113-2114" refersTo="page_1079"/>Committee agreed to the Minister&#x2019;s request that he be not compelled to disclose reasons for deportation orders when such orders have been given, in his opinion, in the public interest. I am sure you, Sir, realize what the effect of this amendment may be. It does mean that every alien entering this country will have a sword of Damocles hanging over his or her head, the possibility that the Minister may at any stage decide, in the public interest as he sees it, to deport him or her without the person concerned having the right to test the validity of the Minister&#x2019;s decision. It might conceivably be argued that it is a good thing to have this sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of aliens in this country during the period up to the time they have acquired citizenship as it would act as a deterrent to those who might want to indulge in undesirable conduct. However, the majority of immigrants coming to this country are good men and women who come to this country with a view to remaining here. This amendment is going to mean that the Minister is going to be the final arbiter in this matter. So, I should like to make an appeal to him. I should like to appeal to him that he should open his door a little bit wider than it was done by his predecessor. I believe it is in the interest of our country as well as in the interest of the administration of this legislation that whenever an aggrieved person has something which he wishes to discuss either with the Minister or with one of his officials, that person should get the maximum opportunity to come and discuss his grievance. The Minister knows that in the past there have been errors of judgment in these matters, quite <i>bona fide</i> errors may be&#x2014;for instance on the basis of incorrect information. It is quite conceivable, and we have to accept it as such, that similar errors may occur again in future. Therefore, we hope the hon. the Minister will give us the assurance that he will allow any aggrieved person the maximum opportunity to be heard either by himself or by one of his senior administrative officials.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House did not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill because we realized that the administration of aliens and their movements required that certain administrative powers be entrusted to the Minister. We realize that the Minister has conceded certain of our criticisms of this measure and that he has undertaken to see how that criticism can be met by positive legislation. For these reasons, and provided the Minister gives us the assurance on the four points I have enumerated, we shall not oppose the Third Reading of this Bill either.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid I cannot adopt the same line as the Official Opposition and not oppose the Third Reading of this Bill. You may say that I am more sceptical than members of the Official Opposition but from my experiences in this House I have learnt that ministerial assurances are not sufficient. What one really requires is those assurances embodied in the legislation itself. It is not enough to leave it to the individual Minister concerned to exercise his discretion, benevolently or otherwise, when it comes to the implementation of laws which do not contain those safeguards which one believes are necessary. It is not, therefore, a question of my disbelieving the hon. the Minister. The position is just that I am not prepared to accept that assurances constitute a sufficient safeguard. I should like to see them being embodied in the legislation itself. If that is done, one can ask for amendments if one has any objection and when such amendments are not acceptable, one can then vote against the legislation.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, this legislation does contain certain very important amendments. We are moving ever more in the direction of granting greater and greater arbitrary powers to Ministers, without any redress and without any appeal against their decisions. This legislation takes us further along that road, and I am against it. I do not think good enough reasons have been advanced for the greater measure of control which is being considered necessary by the Minister. Appeals against and a review of decisions of the Minister are excluded for the reason that it is not &#x201C;in the public interest&#x201D;. This is a term which is being used more and more frequently in South Africa to explain anything which might be embarrassing to the Government. Everything is simply lumped under the umbrella of &#x201C;not being in the public interest&#x201D;. The Government always knows more than we know and everybody is prepared to accept that. As far as I, however, am concerned, I have been in direct contact with many persons who have been at the receiving end of this Government&#x2019;s policy, people who have been denied what is regarded as a privilege. By the way, in America the courts ruled that a passport was a right and not a privilege. But in the U.K. as well as in other countries it is a privilege, as it is in South Africa. But, as I have said. I have been in personal contact with people who have been refused passports and I am sure amongst them are cases where no reasonable court will find that good reasons have been advanced for refusing a passport. Another difficulty is that these people very seldom have access to the Minister himself to put their case. I have myself attempted to arrange interviews with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, in cases where I felt passports were unjustifiably refused. But I have not been successful and the people concerned had to leave South Africa on exit permits&#x2014;never to return again. The situation now will be that if they ever want to come back, they have to come back as aliens&#x2014;that is, if they are allowed to come back. And amongst these people are some of our finest young people, from universities and elsewhere, people who are citizens of which any country can be proud. The necessity for Coloured people to make large deposits, deposits not required from individuals of other races, has not been satisfactorily cleared up either. The hon. member for Green Point is, apparently, satisfied with the Minister&#x2019;s assurances that this <span class="col_2115-2116" refersTo="page_1080"/>particular form of injustice will be reviewed. As for me, I should have liked to see it being embodied in the law, giving the right of appeal especially where deposits are demanded. I see no reason why individuals of a particular race should be singled out for such treatment. I take completely the opposite view from that of the hon. member for Outeniqua who spoke yesterday. It is the right of this Government to deny professional Coloured people the right to leave South Africa because their services are required here, he said. That is the sort of mentality, of course, which is a totalitarian mentality. That was the practice followed by totalitarians during the Nazi days and it is the sort of experience which is to-day taking place behind the Iron Curtain. It does not, however, behove a country which professes to be a democratic country, to adopt practices which might be interpreted in that manner and, indeed, have so been interpreted by an hon. member of this House. Therefore I am against any extension of powers as given by this Bill.</p>

<p>I do not agree either with the fact that the right of appeal has now been withdrawn from aliens who are to be deported. The hon. the Minister told us yesterday that this House never intended that there should be an appeal. That may be so, but then I feel that the House was originally making a mistake, because I believe there should be the right of appeal. Now it is specifically being removed because the courts have upheld the view that an appeal in fact should be granted. Again I know of many cases of people who have been told that their right of residence has been withdrawn and that they have to leave the country. No reasons are given. Some of these people have been high-ranking churchmen who have done very good work among the non-white people, but because, just by the circumstances, they happen to be considered in a political light by the Government, because they have come under fire during cases that have been considered to have some political content, and have become political in their effect, those people have been told that they are meddling in South Africa&#x2019;s internal affairs and their right to remain here has been withdrawn. Now they no longer have any appeal whatever. For all these reasons I wish to record my objection to the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>To a large extent the hon. member for Green Point again raised the various clauses which we had disposed of in the Committee Stage. I think the hon. member did so with the intention of dealing more particularly with the future administration of those various clauses. He started off by dealing with clause 5. In this connection I just want to say by way of further explanation that section 30 of the Admission of Persons to the Union Regulation Act defines a passport control officer as &#x201C;any person on whom powers have been conferred or to whom duties have been assigned by the Minister as to the carrying out of Act No. 22 of 1913&#x201D;. The hon. member will appreciate that, in the light of the circumstances as we have discussed them here, certain problems arise in practice and that there are prohibited persons whom we are trying to get hold of and that it is not so easy to find them. As a result it became necessary for us to appoint people to act also in other places where there were such prohibited persons and, if necessary, to arrest them and bring them before a passport control officer for the necessary investigations to be made. I do not think that we should deduce from this that further powers are actually being granted to the Minister or to the administration. We are only trying to achieve more efficient operation. In this connection I just want to refer to clause 5. As regards that clause, we reached a settlement as regards the word &#x201C;may&#x201D;, which we altered and where we laid down that it &#x201C;shall&#x201D; be done &#x201C;as soon as possible&#x201D;. I also want to point this out to the hon. member for Green Point, and I want to express my appreciation for the interest displayed in this debate by members of this House. This is the benefit one derives from a frank discussion of matters of this nature. The hon. member raised the point, which was also discussed in the Interior Group of the governing party, and the hon. member for Waterkloof was responsible for the idea, i.e. that the provision should be amended as it has been amended now. I think that as it stands now it will cover all the difficult practical cirsumstances which may arise in the course of the operation of these matters.</p>

<p>The hon. member said quite rightly that the granting of a passport is the prerogative of the Government, but he expressed his misgivings about the fact that there is not always complete agreement about the reasons for refusing a passport. That may be, and I accept this as being the position, because the psychological approach of the Government in respect of passports may not be quite the same as that of the Opposition, and it is most certainly not the same as that of the hon. member for Houghton as regards the granting of passports. But in this connection I think we should content ourselves with the fact that, after all, the responsibility rests with the Minister. I do not want to evoke a discussion of the Vote at this stage, but as far as the administration is concerned, I want to point out to the hon. member that all the important cases where passports are refused are submitted to the Minister. Of course, the hon. member himself knows that where passports are issued in the normal course of events, it is done on an administrative level.</p>

<p>She cannot discuss anything without thinking that a Coloured person or a non-white person is treated differently from a white person. I do not want to analyse the merits of the speech she made this morning, but throughout the whole of her speech she made an analysis of the way the non-Whites were being treated. I want to give her the assurance now that, notwithstanding her misgivings, passports in the case of non-Whites are dealt with in the same way as in the case of Whites. [Interjection.] I am not talking of Coloureds only; I am talking of non-Whites. This does not apply only to Coloureds, but also to Indians as well as Bantu. I want to give the hon. member for Green Point and especially the hon. member for Houghton the assurance that in so far as we feel ourselves compelled to require deposits, we do not only require deposits in the case of non-Whites or only in the case of Coloureds. The percentage is probably larger in their case, but we also require deposits from Whites where necessary. As regards deposits, let me state quite explicitly that no differentiation is made between Whites and non-Whites when it comes to the question of considering deposits. Every case is treated purely on merit and the question of whether a person is White or Coloured has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>I want to conclude. The hon. member is now trying to involve me in a discussion of the way in which these matters are being administered, a discussion which properly belongs under the Interior Vote. The hon. member for Outeniqua yesterday mentioned the case of a particular person and his passport. The hon. member for Green Point knows and will agree with me that the reasons for the refusal of passports are not disclosed; this is an accepted fact throughout the world. But I want to say this to the hon. member, and I think he can draw all the conclusions he needs from what I am going to say now: There is only one consideration&#x2014;this is my policy and this is the way it will be carried out&#x2014;in the granting of passports, and that is national security. Mr. Speaker, I do not think this matter need be discussed any further at this stage.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I move the motion standing in my name as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, conscious of the achievements of the Government in the sphere of cultural development, expresses its concern at the increasing dangers of spiritual superficiality and degeneration and therefore lends its full support to the Government in combating this evil by positive action.</block>

<p>The motion presupposes three things in particular, which I shall dwell on in turn. In the first instance it refers to the positive way in which this Government is fostering the cultures of Afrikaans- and English-speaking people in our country, bearing in mind particularly the fact that this Government has in all the years since 1948 had to cope with major national problems which, from the nature of the case, had to receive priority. Nevertheless the Government has always given attention to the fostering of our culture, and for that we are grateful. But it still remains a difficult struggle to foster the cultural interests of a small nation such as ourselves here at the southernmost tip of Africa. That is why we have all the more reason to be grateful to the Government to the specific Minister concerned, and to his Department of Cultural Affairs, who have been devoting their energies to this great task with great enthusiasm. However, there is not sufficient time to go into everything they are undertaking in detail, but for the sake of the record I think it would be a good thing if we did nevertheless focus attention upon certain aspects.</p>

<p>It is the positive aim of the Government, through its Department of Cultural Affairs, and through its actions, to subject the individual, and in that way the nation, to sound formative influences, a process which the individual is susceptible to throughout his entire life. In the first instance these formative influences come into their own particularly in the fostering of our culture in general and in bringing home to our people an appreciation for our spiritual property. I am convinced that through the actions of the Government and of the bodies concerned in this matter, a very large measure of success has been achieved in fostering our culture in general and inculcating in our people the value of our spiritual property. But in the second place this is being done by educating the individual to be healthy in body and mind; in the third place by teaching our nation to enjoy and appreciate recreational activities and promoting the aesthetic enjoyment thereof by our people; <span class="col_2119-2120" refersTo="page_1082"/>fourthly by enabling the individual to make social contacts and to expand his circle of friends; fifthly to enrich the emotional life of the individual; in the sixth place to teach the individual to appreciate spiritual and moral values; and in the seventh place by ensuring the intellectual development of our nation. Those, Sir, I regard as the fields in which the Government has up to now succeeded in justifying itself in respect of our cultural requirements and our cultural interests in South Africa; and because these things are being done it is fitting that we should express our appreciation here and particularly so during the discussion of this motion, which is in fact what I am only too glad to do.</p>

<p>However, when we come to the second presupposition in the motion, which deals with the question of spiritual superficiality, I must point out without beating about the bush that we in South Africa, speaking of the Whites, are dealing with two cultures, an English culture which is very closely bound up with the general concept of a western culture, and an Afrikaans culture which, as one writer expressed it, is not a mere extension of the Western culture, but a renewed independent out-growth of that culture in circumstances which have made new demands on the Westerner here in this country. As an Afrikaans-speaking person I should like, not in a spirit of pessimistic defeatism but nevertheless in a very serious vein, to express a few ideas on the spiritual superficiality which is taking root here, and in particular to indicate how it is specifically affecting the Afrikaner. Seen from the Afrikaner point of view, we must ask ourselves this question: Where do the greatest dangers of superficiality lie? Sir, it is going to be my submission that the greatest degree of superficiality lies in the fact that our national consciousness and national pride are being undermined. Without elaborating on this for an unnecessary length of time I simply want to emphasize what is general knowledge, namely that the Afrikaners as the bearers of a specific culture, the origins of which lie deep in the past, have become the victims of a purposeful campaign in which the maintenance of an independent national Afrikaans culture is being presented in a suspicious light while the increasing unification of people on earth, in which the nation and its interests are being made subservient to the interests of the individual, is being strongly praised. I wonder whether we do in fact realize how far we have already progressed in that direction of wiping out national dividing lines, blunting our national solidarity, and breaking down our religious and family ties so that we can ultimately coalesce into an international unity. It is much later than we think. When people deliberately begin to break away from the responsibilities which they have towards their cultural compatriots, when they begin to evince a growing realization that the cultural attempts of their own people are no longer worth while, and when they begin to laugh at the inferiority which they then supposedly see in what is their own, it has become far later for us as bearers of culture here in South Africa than we want to admit. This expansiveness of spirit and this internationalism in our thinking predicts nothing good for the future. Before one can reflect on methods which can be applied to counteract this superficiality, we must also take note of the factors which could possibly be contributory to this superficiality. I told you a moment ago how we saw where this superficiality was occurring, but now there are factors on which one can very easily lay a finger and to which we must give our attention. In this respect I should like to refer to the question&#x2014;and now I repeat that I am talking in the first instance as an Afrikaans-speaking person to my own people&#x2014;that the Afrikaans-speaking person has reached the stage where we are suffering from over-confidence. The long road which lies behind us bears witness to efforts and struggle, but it also bears witness to great victories in numerous fields. But where do we find ourselves to-day? Are we as strong in our dedication and in our spirit of endeavour as we were in those days when we had to struggle to get what we believed belonged to us? Are we to-day still prepared to the same extent to harness our spiritual and physical powers to keep the soil in which our culture is rooted nationally fertile? In this respect in particular I want to break a lance for our numerous voluntary cultural organizations which are still prepared, despite the very heavy obstacles placed in their path, to play their full part in admonishing our nation culturally, so that they will adhere firmly to what they believe in. I think we accept too readily and too easily that these organizations will always be with us, and I want to state here to-day that if there is one means which can be applied very successfully in order to make our people continually aware that the struggle is not yet at an end, and if we want our people to realize that one must, in one&#x2019;s victory, continue to be as good a fighter as in the days when one was still faced with a hard struggle, then we must encourage and assist these numerous voluntary organizations with everything we have. At this early stage already I also want to advocate that our Government, which has up to now been prepared to support these undertakings with a very generous hand, should in future prove to an even greater extent that they will also in future want these organizations to do their share.</p>

<p>Of course we cannot leave everything to these numerous voluntary organizations. The Government will, just as in the past, have to continue to help develop our culture, which is after all the outlook on life of our nation as it is being realized in every field of our national life. When I refer with great gratitude, praise and recognition to what is being done by the Government, I add to that my earnest plea that even more should be done in future. I have already said that with the fostering of <span class="col_2121-2122" refersTo="page_1083"/>our culture we must look upon it as the outlook on life of our nation as it is being realized in every sphere of life. I should now like to draw attention to a few fields and ask that further consideration should be given to possible assistance in these particular spheres. In the first place I want to refer to our literature and to those people who have, through the written word, in the past made a tremendously great contribution towards making our nation aware of whence they came. I want to point out that in the past we advocated in this House that the Government should give consideration to granting specific assistance to these people. This morning I want, once again, to request&#x2014;and I know it is in good hands&#x2014;that the Government should in fact consider the position of these artists and see what can be done in order to alleviate their lot. But to that I want to add, without being a prophet, that I am convinced that alleviation will definitely come for them.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the role which our other arts can play in making the Afrikaner aware of what is his own. I want to refer to the field of our religion and morals, and how the Government can do a great deal to keep things in order in those particular spheres. I also want to refer to our social relations and to the relations between employer and employee, to which I shall return later. I want to refer to the economic life and how this forms part of our culture in this country and how contributions will still have to be made in order to prevent that sphere from being lost to culture. I also want to refer to the need for the national stabilization of our language and the preservation of the purity of our race. These are fields in which this Government has, without fear of contradiction, laboured with great conscientiousness during the past 21 years.</p>

<p>In conclusion I also want to refer to a further danger which we have perhaps to a great extent lost sight of up to now. I want to call it a danger, Mr. Speaker, in the full knowledge that it also has a reverse side. It has a very favourable reverse side, but it is a cultural danger to us. I am talking about the process of industrialization which is at present taking place in our country, and the effect which it is having on the spirit of our people. One should not call it a danger because it is important that our country should have an increasing measure of industrial development, and we cannot deny that it holds great advantages for us. However, are we not sometimes a little obsessed with the advantages attached to that, without taking note of the dangers? I want to state without fear of contradiction that the externalized routine which people acquire in this age of highly developed industrialization hardly&#x2014;and I am putting it very mildly when I say &#x201C;hardly&#x201D;&#x2014;affords the spirit any opportunity for betterment. The spiritual strength of the individual, the patriot, is dissipated in mechanical activity. The externalized, fine-seeming technical civilization brings sentimental films which are too easily repelling. It brings with it an over-awareness of sex. It creates mental anxiety and fear, from which an escape is sought in the use of strong liquor and other means of gaining oblivion. This kind of civilization degenerates in due course into a civilization of fine-sounding slogans and words without deeper significance: mankind in all his nakedness and in all his weakness is paraded before the world. Ridicule and cynicism become very popular. It is my argument therefore that there is a tremendously great task to perform in the way of informal education so that the nation can be led to greater spiritual independence from which will have to emerge, and will emerge, new cultural creations.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to advocate that we give attention to the facets to which I referred. These are important matters. But in that process we must not forget the small things; we must continue to activate our fellow-citizens to regard these things with the necessary respect. I am referring in particular to the small things, which Dr. Verwoerd once described in the following way. He said there were other things which counted in the life of a nation, often the simple wattle-and-daub hut in which a nation&#x2019;s leader was born and which in its innate smallness and in its humbleness makes one think back to our origins, our origins not out of riches but out of poverty, not out of prosperity but out of suffering, out of which, in fact, the character of one&#x2019;s nation of to-day was built. I say there are numerous opportunities in this respect which we dare not lose sight of. I trust that the Government, the hon. the Minister and his Department, will give their attention to this matter in future as well. We are too easily obsessed with the larger things in life, and our souls suffer because the small things are lost to us.</p>

<p>In addition I want to advocate, and this is the third statement to which I referred at the beginning, that this work be proceeded with particularly by the Department of Cultural Affairs in the way in which it has been done up to now, but at an accelerated rate in future. However, it must not be deduced from this that my plea this morning was that it was only the Government which has a responsibility in this respect. Far from it. When I raise a plea to the effect that this work should be proceeded with, then I am advocating in the first instance that recognition should be given to those outside bodies, and that the State&#x2019;s assistance should in fact be supplementary. In this way these organizations, and through them the nation, will be activated into doing this good work which will lead to greater prosperity in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member for Springs who introduced this motion can be congratulated on the fine, extremely calm way in which he introduced it. I want to inform the hon. member right at the outset that we on this side of the House are not going to move an amendment to his motion for the simple reason that <span class="col_2123-2124" refersTo="page_1084"/>it is one of those motions which can be discussed to good effect without moving any amendments. I cannot see how an amendment can serve any purpose under these circumstances.</p>

<p>In reality the hon. member&#x2019;s motion is a substantial one. Praise is meted out in the motion, and at the same time a warning note is sounded to the effect that the situation in South Africa still leaves much to be desired. We listened attentively now to the hon. member and all our attention was focused on him, but what I was particularly interested in was the second part of his speech, namely the increasing dangers of spiritual superficiality and deterioration. I think that the interest was principally focused on that leg of his motion. All of us probably expected the hon. member to quote grave examples of spiritual superficiality. On the contrary, all the hon. member did was to issue warnings, and to a certain extent he generalized and stated that there was a measure of spiritual superficiality among the people of South Africa and particularly, as he put it, among the Afrikaans-speaking sector.</p>

<p>When a motion of this nature is discussed, I think that one should try to find a more or less scientific basis for the hon. member&#x2019;s feeling that spiritual superficiality is in fact taking place. I must honestly admit that I did not find the examples the hon. member mentioned here adequate. I realize only too well that if one talks to people every day and comes into contact every day with our Afrikaans-speaking compatriots, then there are in fact cases which cause one to think, &#x201C;I wonder whether there is not an element of spiritual superficiality among our people?&#x201D; Is it really such a great danger? Are the majority of our people guilty of this? In reality this is after all the test one must apply: Is there spiritual superficiality among the majority of our Afrikaans- or English-speaking people? That is what we must ask ourselves.</p>

<p>During the course of his speech the hon. member stated that particularly when people began to talk about their own weaknesses in a disrespectful and scornful way, the tendency towards superficiality was there. Now I wonder whether this is an indication of spiritual superficiality? I wonder whether it is not rather an indication that South Africa is coming of age. I wonder whether it does not reveal a healthy sense of humour on the part of all the population groups in this country. I think it is a sign of growing maturity when a person can in fact ridicule his own weaknesses and refuse to take himself seriously.</p>

<p>When the hon. member states that there is spiritual superficiality what would you and I say it meant? I would say in the first place that it meant a lack of interest in the fine arts, in the sense that there were empty houses at stage performances, a lack of appreciation for sculpture, and an indifference to poetry and all the other literary arts. I would also say that such a superficiality would mean that a wide interest in a variety of subjects was totally lacking. One can also say that there is spiritual superficiality when people waste their time with small talk, instead of a thoroughgoing study of a subject or specific subjects. I would also say that it means that people have ceased to think, that they prefer to leave it to others to do their thinking for them. In addition I would think it means that they no longer have a love for their own cultural possessions, not even for their own, to say nothing of the cultural possessions of others.</p>

<p>If one applies these tests to South Africans, and particularly to the Afrikaners, are they really guilty of displaying spiritual superficiality? In addition I would also say that it means spiritual superficiality and deterioration when the vast majority of the public is fond of devouring popular reading matter in a superficial and banal way and only display an interest in what stimulates the instincts and urges. Is it really the case that this is the situation among our people? I am prepared to say that when there are dangers one must admit that they exist. But one must not see bogeys where none exist. I want to warn the hon. member in this respect that we really must not think that we, particularly the Afrikaans-speaking section of our population, can encase ourselves in a cocoon and then think that we will never be subject to any influences from outside. Some of the greatest cultural, political and economic leaders in South Africa studied abroad. Just think of how many people who have emerged as leaders in this House since 1910 were people who studied at overseas universities and who were therefore subjected to the influences of the outside world. Were they really under pressure from the foreign cultures and influences to which they were subjected to such an extent that they became completely alienated from our people? I do not think that is the case. One of the dangers which the hon. member for Springs mentioned is that a person can lose his national ties completely. He does not want the Afrikaans-speaking sector of our population in particular to forget what group they belong to. He stated that our language, and even our race, must be kept pure. I take it that the hon. member was referring to the Afrikaans-speaking sector in that respect as well. I do not share the hon. member&#x2019;s pessimism at all. I am glad however that I am able to say that he stated in his speech&#x2014;and I want to be fair to him&#x2014;that he was not too pessimistic. After he had stated that, he did in fact go on to deal with the dangers which he thought a wrong and foreign influence could have on South Africa. I want to say to the hon. member that we on this side of the House share the attitude adopted by the hon. the Prime Minister a few months ago when he said on a public occasion that he had confidence in the youth of South Africa. He said that in spite of the foreign influences which were being exercised on our youth to-day, our youth was not worse than that of a generation or two ago. I want to ask the hon. member again whether the situation <span class="col_2125-2126" refersTo="page_1085"/>is in fact as he tried to sketch it here? Are our youth worse off in the cultural sphere for example? Do they really possess less appreciation for that than the older generation? If that is the case one must then feel a measure of fear for the future of our young people in whom we do, after all, display the greatest interest? I do not share that fear, but have confidence in the young people of this country. However, it is in fact the case that the modern age is making increasingly greater demands on the individual. One result of the manpower shortage for example is that the most highly trained individuals in South Africa have to work all the harder. A second result is that specialization will be the order of the day. A third result is that there will be a continual call for increased production. Therefore, if we have the idea that there is a frantic pursuit of entertainment and light relief, this must not always be held up as an example of a form of superficiality. Not only physical relaxation but spiritual entertainment and relaxation have become a must in the modern age. The more we industrialize the greater that need will become. The hon. member sees in this a danger, in this sense that the individual is being absorbed into a greater international technological community. However, I do not see a danger in that so much, but rather in the fact that as a result of industrialization relaxation on a spiritual and physical level will have to play a greater role in future. If the nation of South Africa are offered adequate opportunities for relaxation, that superficiality will, if the hon. member is correct and there is in fact the danger of superficiality, not exist. I am afraid that the hon. member for Springs could have sketched that aspect better. Nevertheless he reminded us of what the State and the Department of Cultural Affairs were already doing in this respect and asked them to do more.</p>

<p>However, I want to associate myself with one point which the hon. member mentioned. He advocated that assistance should be given to the voluntary organizations which are helping to promote culture in South Africa. I want to say to the hon. member that I agree with him 100 per cent in that respect. More assistance can undoubtedly be given to these people, because they are playing a considerable role in the national life of this country. We should like to see more opportunities being created in order to prevent spiritual superficiality in South Africa, if we need concern ourselves about that.</p>

<p>I should like to bring one matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister, a matter which I think should receive his attention and that of his Department. There is in South Africa no opera company of any major importance. The only group which, to a certain extent here in Cape Town for example, entertains us from time to time with some of the best operas which we know, is the Eoan Group. I wonder whether the time has not come for the establishment of an opera company in South Africa so that South Africa can also play the same role in that respect and have the same opportunities as many of the European countries have, whose traditions in this respect go back a long way. One thinks of the best opera singers and songstresses which South Africa has already produced. Where are those people? Most of them have been forced to go to Vienna to find a scope for their talents, whereas we ought to be offering those people the most wonderful opportunities in South Africa. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will not in this respect consider giving greater support to the establishment of our own opera companies in South Africa so that we can also produce the best in that field and can develop our own talent and in this way offer these people a good livelihood. Why are all these people going overseas? They are going overseas simply because they are being offered better opportunities there than in South Africa. I want to urge the hon. the Minister to give attention to this matter.</p>

<p>There are other hon. members on this side of the House who will have something to say on other aspects of this matter. As far as I am concerned, I just want to mention one example, an example which in my opinion is not exactly a good example of superficiality. It is, however, a matter which should receive the attention of this House. The Afrikaans-speaking people will, in their outward movement, become more and more subject to foreign influences. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is concerned about the fact that we will, as a result of this new direction &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<p>&#x2026; and as a result of immigration and an increase in tourism in South Africa &#x2026; Does he think that that increasing exchange of ideas between ourselves and foreigners will in any way result in superficiality? I think we are entitled to put this question to the hon. the Minister. Because, you see, Mr. Speaker, the world is becoming smaller and smaller, all the more constricted. As it becomes more constricted and smaller, South Africa will be exposed to an ever-increasing extent to an exchange of ideas with the outside world.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>But the hon. member for Springs is concerned about it. He is concerned about the so-called foreign influences. Hence I am asking the Minister whether he shares that concern. There are certain groups in South Africa to-day, such as the Genootskap vir die Handhawing van Afrikaans, the Christelike Kultuur-Aksie, Anticom, and so on, which are continually trying to conjure up spectres by trying to make the <span class="col_2127-2128" refersTo="page_1086"/>Afrikaners believe that they are in danger. It is these people who are in fact sabotaging the outward movement and who are trying to oast suspicion on this new outward movement.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>That is why I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he also shares that opinion. I am asking him this question because it is, in my opinion, important that we hear his reply in that regard. The Afrikaner is at present as well established as he will ever be. His language is in no danger, nor his culture nor his economic position. But nevertheless there are people who are trying to induce a certain psychosis by pretending that the Afrikaners are supposedly in danger. That is why the hon. the Minister ought to see in this motion an opportunity of giving a clear reply to those people, people who are not so much in this House as outside, who are trying to induce this psychosis and exploit the situation by trying to make the Afrikaner believe that his language, culture and spiritual property is being endangered by immigrants and by rubbing shoulders with somebody who is not a member of his language group. If the hon. the Minister could give a reply to this question, he would be making a considerable contribution to the fruitful discussion of this motion.</p>

<p>Once again I want to thank the hon. member for Springs for this motion and congratulate him on the fine way in which he presented it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I listened with special attention to the opinions expressed by the hon. member for Newton Park. I found it interesting to hear him discuss a matter such as this, especially because normally he participates in agricultural debates only. There is one misunderstanding that I want to eliminate at the outset. I think the hon. member misinterpreted the hon. member for Springs as having said that the spiritual deterioration he referred to occurred especially among the Afrikaans-speaking people. What the hon. member for Springs really wanted to indicate by that was that he as an Afrikaans-speaking person was speaking on behalf of the Afrikaans-speaking people in the expectation that if an English-speaking person should participate in this debate, he would look at the moral standard of the English-speaking people from the English-speaking point of view.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I deem it a privilege to support the ideas the hon. member for Springs expressed here and to add some ideas of my own. I have great appreciation for the work the hon. member for Springs has done in this connection over the years. When one has to speak about a motion such as this, one must of necessity in one&#x2019;s own way first have thought about man, about his being, his activities, his origin, his aims, the time in which he is living, his habitat and many other facts of his existence. In that process one will of necessity start thinking about man through the ages, and as one finds him to-day in all his diversity. Of course one will not be the first person to think about these things; neither the last. One must also take into account the fact that one&#x2019;s argument about these matters will not necessarily be the very best. However, what is of importance to me is that one is, together with one&#x2019;s contemporaries, prepared to think about mankind as such, and in particular about one&#x2019;s own people and its pattern of life. This motion, then, refers to our cultural wellbeing, or our cultural ill-health, as it developed in the conditions that prevailed after the Second World War. I do not believe the influence of the Second World War on mankind has been investigated deeply enough yet. Here in South Africa I have not been able to find any detailed work which offered a clear analysis of the effects of post-World War II conditions on mankind. One does find loose fragments, compiled by a variety of persons, loose thoughts on man and his development after the Second World War. But the mass of material available to us still has to be processed. My contribution this morning will also be a rudimentary one&#x2014;actually, only an intuitive approach to the situation. To me, as someone who only came into contact with the realities of life after the Second World War, there are two salient factors. The first of these is that races and nations that had not come into contact with each other for centuries, came into very close and intimate contact with each other as a result of the Second World War. Ethnologically speaking, the Caucasians came into contact with the Mongoloids, and the Mongoloids with the Negroids of Africa, as well as with the population groups that are found within the specific main racial groups. In this connection I just want to make a brief quotation from the work of Ndabaningi Sithole, &#x201C;African Nationalism&#x201D;, which shows how he as a Bantu&#x2014;I think he belongs to the Shona group&#x2014;saw this effect of the Second World War. He writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">World War II, as many people have frequently noted, has had a great deal to do with the awakening of the peoples of Africa. During the war the African came into contact with practically all the peoples of the earth. He met them on a life-and-death-struggle basis. He saw the so-called civilized and peaceful and orderly white people mercilessly butchering one another, just as his so-called savage ancestors had done in tribal wars. He saw no difference between the primitive and the civilized man. In short, he saw through European pretensions that only Africans were savages. This had a revolutionizing psychological impact on the African.</block>

<p>Sir, I am reading this to you just by way of example that, in the mental world of the black <span class="col_2129-2130" refersTo="page_1087"/>man, the Second World War has indeed had an influence on his view of life.</p>

<p>But there is a second effect, and that is the enormous development in the technological field and the influence this has had on all the material inventions of man. The astounding inventions in the technological field have been aimed at exploring and controlling not only the macrocosm, but also the microcosm, and have also had an influence on the cultural creations of man. They have had an influence on his social organization, his economic life, his political organization, his education, his legal system, and also his religion. These changes that have taken place, have been brought within the range of vision and also within the reading range of man in an exceptional way by the other specific technological inventions he has produced. The thoughts of people, the ideas, the ideologies, events daily being brought to the notice of modern or post-World War II man by means of what we can group together under the concept of the Great Stereopticon. I want to quote briefly from a view expressed by Richard M. Weaver in his work &#x201C;Ideas Have Consequences&#x201D;. By the &#x201C;great stereopticon&#x201D; he refers in particular to the mass communication media. He writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The vested interests of our age which, from all kinds of motives, desire to maintain traditional values or to get new values set up in their place, have constructed a wonderful machine which we shall call the Great Stereopticon. It is the function of this machine to project selected pictures of life in the hope that what is seen will be imitated. All of us of the West who are within the long reach of technology are sitting in the audience. We are told the time to laugh and the time to cry, and signs are not wanting that the audience grows ever more responsive to its cues.</block>

<p>In the light of these ideas and one&#x2019;s daily experience I think it would be a good thing and would be interesting if one could in a truly scientific way determine the influence of the written word, the radio and television on modern man. As far as the Western Christian is concerned, this enormous technological development has the effect that the old accepted Christian concept that life is more than merely the period from the cradle to the grave, is changed into the ideal that the accent should only be placed on man in the period from the cradle to the grave, and that technology can control the material world to such an extent and make matters so much easier in this regard that it is worth one&#x2019;s while to adapt one&#x2019;s life only to the time and space aspect of one&#x2019;s existence. So it happens that the powerful established interests direct man&#x2019;s life towards comfort, and when comfort is no longer comfortable enough, then all the available media must be applied to stimulate the sensual until there is even the possibility that sensuality may be worshipped. In many centres, especially in the large urban complexes, we find this post-World War II man, who is like a spoilt child. During the previous four centuries, more or less, he was taught that his salvation lay in the conquest of nature. He is given the impression by some scientists that there is nothing that he cannot know and false propagandists tell him there is nothing he cannot get. Therefore, what he desires he wants to have, even if he has to get it by means of continual complaints or by means of unreasonable demands. This spoilt child is unable to see the relationship between effort and compensation. Upon further analysis one finds that he very often feels lonely, lost and disregarded in society, and therefore he devises many ways of attracting attention. He often achieves this by shocking people, by attacking and ridiculing what is traditional, and by establishing his own new orders at a moment&#x2019;s notice. He does not care about the disintegration of the accepted systems of society. In fact, he actually prefers conditions of social promiscuity. In this respect I have often, when talking to young people&#x2014;and I may mention it here to-day as well&#x2014;referred to a very fine speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister, Adv. Vorster, in 1962, at the Youth Congress of the F.A.K., in which he addressed the youth and in which he used the following phrase which has stuck in my memory: &#x201C;Careless dress engenders careless morals&#x201D; (Losse kleredrag bring losse sedes).</p>

<p>Seen against the background of the above-mentioned spoilt child and his muschroom like little cultures which are springing up today, these words of the Prime Minister contain a valuable message.</p>

<p>But in spite of these consequences of the great war, which the older generations experienced to a much greater extent than I did, there is in many countries, and in fact in all the countries of the Western world, a strong feeling for meaningfulness, order and integrity. The retention of those values that gave stability is being sought afresh to-day. To-day we find throughout the world numerous individuals, organizations and establishments that are now, more than ever before, aiming at the preservation of our Christian and Western heritage, especially as it has found expression within their own pattern of life. In various parts of the world, for example, the need is felt at universities to establish the so-called &#x201C;schools of cultural studies&#x201D; where students with a wide range of interests get the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the cultural subjects. But lately we at the same time find a revival abroad of the interest in the national past or the study of one&#x2019;s own environment. So, within the past four years, the School of Scottish Studies was established in Edinburgh (Scotland), the School of Folk Life Studies in Leeds, and the Museum of English Rural Life in Reading (England), all three of which are extremely vigorous, as is also the case with the dialect research institute which is attached to St. Fagan&#x2019;s Castle near Cardiff in Wales. In Flanders, for example, the establishment <span class="col_2131-2132" refersTo="page_1088"/>of regional circles, which study the immediate cultural environment, the so-called &#x201C;heemkunde&#x201D; (local lore), is receiving special attention at present. But in South Africa we also find this academic interest. As far as the Afrikaans universities are concerned, the University of Pretoria has had a Department of Afrikaans-Dutch Cultural History for many years, where a man like Professor Van der Westhuizen has been doing valuable work for many years; at the Potchefstroom University, the P.U. for C.H.E., I understand there is a Department of South African Cultural Care; then, in 1966-&#x2019;67, the Department of Afrikaans Culture and Folklore was established at the University of Stellenbosch, where a person like Professor Dr. Bun Booyens is doing very important work and is laying extremely sound foundations; I know that Dr. Bax also has a small department at the University of Cape Town in which he is making a particular study of Dutch cultural history. All this is taking place at the university level, and if I may refer to the English universities, I think it has perhaps become essential that they too should in the academic field give attention to the culture established in South Africa by our English-speaking citizens. Mr. Speaker, our Government made its most significant contribution with the establishment of the Department of Cultural Affairs, some of whose functions were placed upon the Statute Book here during the past week or so on which occasion it was evident that the Whites of South Africa would have to establish very close ties with other white nations of the world, especially in respect of our common origin and our common Western heritage. This may have the result that the infinite harm the Western nations were caused by the Second World War will in its after-effects not cause even greater disaster and greater loss of life and culture, but that the white nations throughout the world will daily become more aware not only of those elements seeking their downfall, but of their own identity, their own value and their own heritage.</p>

<p>Here in South Africa, as elsewhere, we will have to pay increasing attention to the attitude adopted to life and to the world by the rising generations, particularly in the preservation of our cultural heritage. I want to quote a brief thought in regard to philosophy of life from the work &#x201C;Oorsprong en Rigting&#x201D; by Professor H. G. Stoker, in which he writes as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The meaning of a philosophy of life appears, <i>inter alia,</i> from the following three statements: (a) Everything man does is founded on a philosophy of life; (b) the deepest motives of the actions of man manifest themselves in a philosophy of life; (c) philosophy of life gives expression to the real and deepest significance which reality (and this includes the world, man&#x2019;s existence and his life) has for man.</block>

<p>Therefore I want to ask that we in South Africa, on the part of the Government and other responsible bodies, should continually and with sympathy and patience and as best we can impress a philosophy of life on the rising generations which springs from the ideal of freedom as contained in our Christian heritage, as it has found expression here in South Africa in our own pattern of life.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, I want to make a final quotation from a speech by a person for whom I have always had the greatest appreciation and who certainly exercised the greatest influence on me. That is the late Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, who at a Nasionale Jeugbond meeting at Loskop Dam in 1965, said the following in speaking about the survival of the white man in South Africa. He concluded his speech with these words (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not so easy to be unselfish. It is not so easy to give oneself completely, but those who want to be leaders have to do so. Those who want to lead the nation, especially in difficult times, must do so above all, because the nation demands everything, not only a little, and this is my message to you, the youth. Be the leaders of the future by being the servants of the nation.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was difficult to infer from the motion introduced by the hon. member for Springs, as it stands on the Order Paper, exactly what the hon. member was going to tell the House this morning. Consequently it was necessary for us to wait until the hon. member had made his speech in order to see what contribution we on this side could make.</p>

<p>Before I come to his motion and the points he raised, I just want to refer briefly to one statement which the hon. member for Rissik has just made and which I find rather strange. This is his statement in regard to the tremendous spiritual harm that was done to mankind as a result of the Second World War. I do not know whether the hon. member was referring to what I regard as the major effect of the Second World War, i.e. the process of emancipating man over very extensive areas of the globe. This is most definitely something towards which we as South Africans ought to adopt a very sympathetic attitude. It is true that with the position in which Russia found herself after the war, there was also another side to the picture, and that certain parts of the globe had also come under its control and consequently this was a retrograde step. Over very extensive parts of the world the most important effect of the Second World War was the process of emancipation. Not that this was successful everywhere. One could mention examples of countries such as the Congo and others, where this was not so easy, but we must bear in mind that in its struggle to reach the position it has reached to-day, the white Western civilization also had terrible revolutions, as was the case in France and in<span class="col_2133-2134" refersTo="page_1089"/> England where the heads of kings and queens rolled in the sand. In this way the Whites, in advancing towards the emancipation of man, also experienced revolutions, which were in many respects much worse than what took place in Africa. I think that if one measures the whole revolution in Africa in terms of what took place in Europe amongst the Western nations, one will find that what took place in Africa is in actual fact a picnic in comparison with what took place in Europe. With reference to the points the hon. member made here, I just want to mention that South Africa was the first nation in Africa to free itself from imperialism and domination by others, and if there is one country and one nation which should always be sympathetic towards that movement, which gained so much momentum in the Second World War, for granting freedom and self-determination to others, then it is South Africa. That sympathy ought to be more evident in South Africa than in any other country of the world.</p>

<p>You must only be careful not to confuse that process of emancipation with the liberalism that is found in the world.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>What is that supposed to mean, Sir? Liberalism is another old bogey which is being produced from time to time. It is conspicuous that every reformer in the world has always been accused of being a liberalist. That applies to all of them, including Calvin. Every reformer who effected a change, has always been branded as a liberalist. One could go back right up to the Creator of the Christian religion; this has always been the attitude. The person who is opposed to change, always sees a form of liberalism in change. What that hon. member ought to do, is to learn to distinguish between change and liberalism. Of course, there is a difference in meaning between the classic liberalism to which the progress of the Afrikaner is also attributable, and liberalism in the sense in which the hon. member is using the word. But where would the Afrikaner people have been to-day if they did not have those inner urges of the classic liberalism? Would they have had their freedom to-day? I reject this easy method of dismissing certain matters by simply attaching a label to something.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs said many things here with which we can agree and of which we approve. We agree that a government should do everything in its power to encourage cultural development. We spoke of alleviating the lot of artists and authors. In the debate we had recently I also spoke to the Minister specifically along these lines, and at that stage he hinted that in the Estimates we could probably expect something good for those pursuing the art of writing. We approve of all those things. But I nevertheless want to make this point, Sir: I find it a pity that an exaggerated state of constraint is always being created, particularly when it concerns the Afrikaner people. I have always adhered to the view that the Afrikaner people have been destined for greatness, not for smallness. They have a colossal task in Africa. They are continually being told how afraid they should be and how they are always in the process of going under. If one analyses all the speeches on culture which one hears from day to day, one finds that they always try to stir up fear and that the Afrikaner people are being told that they should be careful because they are on the verge of going under. This does a terrible amount of harm to the Afrikaner people, and they could have made much more progress if their leaders had pointed to their opportunities, their potentialities as a nation, rather than the dangers threatening them. Let us take a look at the Afrikaner nation. The Dutch came first; they were followed by the French and they became part of the nation. Subsequent to that the Germans came and made contact, and the same applies to the Malays and the English. Under the old British Imperialism every effort was made to squash the Afrikaner, but it was unsuccessful. On the contrary, they grew. Groups of Afrikaners emigrated to many parts of the world. One group emigrated to the Argentine, and after finding themselves in a strange culture for years and years, far away from their country, they were still Afrikaner people. The trekkers in the Thirstland emigrated to Angola, and in this House we have an hon. member whose father was one of the leaders who led that trek back &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, the fact of the matter is that some Afrikaner people also emigrated to Kenya and that one could still find the Afrikaans community there after many years, in spite of all the contact with strange cultures which they had there. Here in South Africa we have had contact with Blacks, brown-skinned people and with any form of culture, as well as the tremendous pressure brought to bear by the mighty British Empire. What does that teach us? That the Afrikaner is a weakling who is always on the verge of going under? On the contrary, it has taught us that the Afrikaner is one of the toughest articles of modern times. Therefore one hopes that Afrikaner leaders will place the emphasis on the toughness of this section of the population and that they will advance fearlessly. I think the time calls for an outward policy in all spheres. Let us go back into the cultural history of South Africa. There was a time when the radio in South Africa was an English language private enterprise in the full sense of the word. The cinema, to which millions of people are flocking, is virtually 99 per cent English to this day. A few years ago it was possible for us to celebrate the wonder of Afrikaans, in spite of this mighty influence of another language. The effect of the other language did not imply their downfall at all. Today we have a bilingual radio service, and we<span class="col_2135-2136" refersTo="page_1090"/> hope that the day will come when we shall also strike a better balance as far as films are concerned. However, all of this has done absolutely nothing to the survival of the Afrikaner people and the growth of the Afrikaans language.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that I say that it is a good thing that the hon. member is placing the emphasis on encouraging the Afrikaans culture. However, I only hope that in using the word &#x201C;encouragement&#x201D;, the hon. member does not mean encouragement to the Government to intervene too much in these matters. We must always distinguish between the authoritarian approach and the fact that our culture is, above all, founded on the democratic tradition. This is so peculiar to the Afrikaner that we should never lose sight of it. To my mind the author N. P. van Wyk Louw phrased this very strikingly in one of his books in which he asked what the fundamentals of democracy are. He said that one person regarded the &#x201C;parliamentary institution&#x201D; as being the most important; another thought it was universal suffrage; another thought it might be proportional representation, and yet another thought it might be economic democracy, i.e. the labourer having a joint say in all controllable circumstances of his work. Whatever the case may be, the circulation of ideas is indispensable in every system which seeks to be democratic. In addition to what we want to promote&#x2014;since we are asking the Government to encourage it&#x2014;we should always respect the democratic character of South Africa and permit a free circulation of ideas. Of course, there is a limit to everything. We have checked communist ideas for a very good reason, i.e. because the communists informed us that they wanted to destroy us. Why would one therefore grant a person who has informed one that he intends to destroy one, the freedom to suppress one&#x2019;s freedom? There are obvious limits, such as those of filth and pornography. I do not say that when we come to these aspects there should be a free circulation of ideas&#x2014;that is obvious&#x2014;but whatever the Government undertakes, it must keep an eye on the democratic tradition of a free circulation of ideas at all times.</p>

<p>In his motion the hon. member spoke of the danger of spiritual superficiality. With all due respect to the hon. member I want to tell him that this is a charge which has been levelled over the centuries. Every generation considers that it is seeing grave dangers of superficiality. Then one asks oneself this question: When did this earthly paradise exist, which could then serve as a norm and of which we could say that it was the golden era and against which we can measure the present superficiality? There has never been such an era. There has never been a golden era, and over the centuries the charge has always been that superficialization was taking place. The question is still: what is the norm? I want to emphasize once again, Mr. Speaker, that we should distinguish between what one is so easily inclined to mistake for superficiality&#x2014;or what the hon. member simply called &#x201C;liberalism&#x201D; here&#x2014;and change. Change is part and parcel of human nature and it will always be with us. We should therefore not confuse superficialization with change. The other day I quoted an author who had said that &#x201C;every generation is a new country&#x201D;, and this is true. I am of the opinion that when one takes the history of South Africa and its people, we can face the future with the greatest measure of confidence. I do not want to say that there is no room for a great deal of improvement, and I should like to mention a few matters. The first is in the sphere of education. South Africa is privileged to be one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but I am sorry, however, to say that we are not utilizing that wealth for putting first things first. We need a government which would at all times put education and training first. In politics it always strikes me that when a political service is requested, the Government finds it very easy to find the money for that purpose, but whenever more education facilities are requested, it is said that there are insufficient funds. That is not true, because we have sufficient funds for doing everything that has to be done. In this regard I should like to mention a few aspects to the hon. the Minister. It is pathetic to see what little attention is paid to culture at some of our schools where a child has to spend the first seventeen years of his life. I am of the opinion that more money should be spent on this aspect. Sometimes it is pathetic to see how small the libraries are at certain schools where, by taking a little trouble, they can be provided with the necessary facilities.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the bells rang for the lunch hour, I was just engaged in emphasizing that we ought to give priority in South Africa to the question of education and training. It seemed to me as though the hon. the Minister felt that we were once again riding a hobby-horse, and that we were not giving recognition to the work done by him and his Department. But let me admit quite frankly that major progress has been made and that we have very high regard for what has been done by the officials in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department. We have respect for the people he has there. But when I said that, I did not really have the hon. the Minister himself in mind. I was thinking more specifically of the Government as a whole. I thought back, for instance, of what we saw in Cape Town at the beginning of this year, where large numbers of children had to be turned away from schools because there was not enough room. In certain cases this happened at Coloured schools, which do not come under the hon. the Minister. But my point is that such a thing ought not to happen at all in a country such as South Africa. In a country<span class="col_2137-2138" refersTo="page_1091"/> with our riches it is unthinkable that any child should at all be turned away from a school because there is not room for him. I would have thought that an alert government in South Africa, if it gave top priority to education, would immediately have set to work and shown that it was in earnest about the supreme importance of developing the human material in South Africa. This must apply to all races; because the intellectual standard of the Whites will also show a downward trend if they are surrounded by people who are not making any progress, nor any cultural progress in life. When one comes to education and training, I believe that all other matters should, if necessary, come to a standstill. It ought to be top priority.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the Minister that we believe that the schools should be the power-stations of cultural life in South Africa. There is tremendous scope for improvement. I am thinking of schools in my own constituency where the situation is pathetic. I do not think it is right that in a country such as ours schools should still be hampered by inadequate facilities for the cultural education and development of our people, as is in fact the case. One merely has to mention a simple example, such as libraries. This is one way in which the Minister can assist in encouraging the art of writing, i.e. by seeing to it that schools have adequate libraries. Wherever one goes in this country, this is the complaint one hears. Then there is the question of musical instruments. If there is one cause in South Africa which we ought to encourage, it is that of the art of music amongst the young people in our schools. Schools are continuously struggling to raise funds for purchasing the necessary instruments. There are outstanding, talented children who often do not have opportunities for developing their talents. After all, if one goes back into the history of talented young children&#x2014;for instance, Marion Friedman&#x2014;one finds that their talents were discovered at school. One asks oneself: What has happened to our major national festivals of music for schools? If I were in the Minister&#x2019;s position, I would organize major national festivals of music for our children in South Africa, festivals where they might be brought together in order to compete and might develop that aspect of our culture further. One asks oneself: where are the &#x201C;Hollywood Bowls&#x201D; in South Africa? These are matters to which one ought to give thought. The hon. the Minister ought to devote more of his attention to matters of this nature. In the second place, I want to plead that the Government should harness every technological means for promoting culture in South Africa. This is most definitely not being done.</p>

<p>I do not wish to start another debate on television to-day. But I am not apologizing for mentioning it. Throughout the world one finds that the children of other countries are in many respects far ahead of the children of South Africa because of the influence of television. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Anything can have a bad influence if it is done to excess. The radio can have a bad influence. Anything can have a bad influence if it is not controlled properly. We on this side have never pleaded for uncontrolled television. What we want, is that when such a service is introduced, emphasis should be placed on education and cultural development in particular. This may be controlled in the same way as the radio is being controlled. But I have seen places where the radio has a bad influence. Especially in smaller towns, such as in America, where broadcasting is in private hands, it may have as bad an influence. I believe that, if one harnesses the technological developments in the world correctly, one could harness it for the development of cultural life in South Africa. The Minister who is sitting over there ought to take the lead in South Africa in pleading for the introduction of television. [Interjections.] No, he is not doing it. He ought to do so. As the Minister of National Education he is pre-eminently the person who could do so.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to mention one other matter. I want to ask that the hon. the Minister should give consideration to appointing a commission to inquire into the question of week-end idleness. We know that at present Saturday is the great day for sporting activities in South Africa. I am not pleading for another day for sport. In fact, I think we are overdoing sport in this country. But a serious social problem is developing in South Africa in regard to what people are doing on Sundays. This is something which is particularly evident in major cities such as Johannesburg, of which I am a representative and one who knows what is going on. Church services take an hour or more for those who attend them, but during the rest of the day tens of thousands of people mill about and often loaf about aimlessly, or thousands of them are bored in their own flats in the city. This is soul-deadening, and in itself it creates all sorts of spiritual problems. That is why there is a rush for Sunday papers to-day, or why that day is being made a second day of sport in private. This is a delicate matter and I know that there are malicious people who will try to suck poison out of what I am raising here now. But I want to make it clear that I am not advocating the continental Sunday. Nor am I advocating that we should try to get around the churches or that there should be any form of licentiousness. But as matters are at present, we are dealing with a very serious social problem in our major cities. I think there ought to be means whereby people may be helped to promote what is good in such a manner that it will still be in keeping with the character we should like to associate with the Day of the Sabbath.</p>

<p><span class="col_2139-2140" refersTo="page_1092"/>Towards the end of last year I had the privilege of visiting Germany. What struck me there, was that in the major cities, and especially in Hamburg, every cultural institution, especially the orchestras, was expected to give up one day in the year as a donation to the public. Consequently one finds that in the large, central civic gardens of the German cities some of the best artists are engaged in rendering a service to the public over weekends. I found it enjoyable to see the aged, families and flat-dwellers going towards the central civic gardens for the purpose of deriving spiritual refreshment from what the artists were presenting. I think this is something which is in any event worthy of imitation in any country. I concede that it will not be easy to find the right solution to this social problem. Nor do I suggest that I have the solution to that problem. But it seems desirable to me that the hon. the Minister should appoint a commission, of clergymen in particular, to see what can be done about these difficult social problems in regard to the urban week-end. They should see whether they can be of assistance in steering matters in the right direction.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Rissik when he was speaking made the point that this is a debate which is not restricted only to the discussion of the Afrikaans-speaking culture. I think it is a point well taken, because the whole motion centres around the lack of spiritual enrichment of the people of South Africa. We who are English-speaking and our culture stand in a peculiarly difficult situation, because we are a minority, and yet, at the same time, we represent the culture of the world outside, which is an extremely potent force. We represent the culture of the English-speaking world, which is being pumped and flooded into South Africa by all the powers that exist in the cultural world. Of necessity, we find ourselves the representatives in South Africa, where we are a minority, of a culture which overseas, I believe, has gone beyond what I would call the bounds of decency. I think we have to realize that this permissive society which is spoken about and which obtains throughout the length and breadth of Europe and North America, is not a freedom, but a discipline in itself, Which affects and takes over the minds of the young people. It could be made to appear that it is through our language, our culture and the contribution that we are making to South Africa that these kinds of thoughts are being introduced here in South Africa. I say this is not a freedom, but a discipline which requires young people to obey certain sets of standards which I am convinced the bulk of them simply do not accept; but because that is the mode of the moment and the fashion of the hour, young people throughout the world and to-day, to some extent, in our country feel that they are forced to obey and give way to what are, in fact, the desires and appetites of only a few people among them. I am quite convinced that the hon. member, in moving this motion, wanted to draw attention to that fact, to warn against the dangers which can come in. They will be dangers which come, I believe, from outside, because I do not think they have their roots here in our own culture, English and Afrikaans, in South Africa. I believe that we have in our country a tremendous reserve of spiritual strength which I think is going to be of vital significance to the Western world in the times ahead. I am quite certain that the youth of our people, in the world outside as well as here, will revolt against the present tendencies which manifest themselves in the novel, the stage, the film and all these kinds of manifestations where mankind is stripped of all decency, where one simply looks at mankind as he can be, very often at his very worst. I think that all of us have a part to play in this matter, whether as parents or as members of society, to stand up and be counted for the things we know are right. If these influences come into our country, it will not be the fault of the young people; it will be our own fault.</p>

<p>I believe that every single one of us has a task to see to it that we play our part. After all, spiritual enrichment is a matter of the mind. We have to look at the world as it is. We have to choose. All of us, not only here, but outside, have to make a positive contribution, because the culture of the people is a synthesis of the thoughts of all the people. One finds that some that are extremely left wing and some are extreme right wing. One can find in any given society exponents of the most outrageous thoughts, but the culture of the people is made up by the broad body, the consensus of opinion. Only those of us who stand firm for the things we know are right will be able to influence the future of our country. I believe that the Department and the hon. the Minister, who has control of the schools in a sense, have a vital part to play. I believe, from my own point of view as an English-speaking South African, that the Minister and his department have a vital part to play in the encouragement of our culture in South Africa. I can remember when I was in another House asking there that the Minister would consider the introduction of prizes, to be awarded in one year for an English-speaking person who produced a work of art in Afrikaans, and the next year the other way about, in order to encourage what I regard as a dialogue between the two different language sections in our country, so that we may have a flow of ideas, a point that was mentioned earlier on in this debate. I must say the Minister was kind enough then to welcome the idea very sincerely and very nicely, I felt, but I have not yet seen any action in this regard. It may be that the Minister has difficulties; I do not know, but I do believe there is still a part that this kind of action can play. I believe it would fit in with the motion which the hon. member has moved. It would be something that would seek to protect the spiritual heritage which we in South Africa<span class="col_2141-2142" refersTo="page_1093"/> have brought here and for which we have got to stand, if the civilization which we represent here is to stand at all.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very sorry that, in view of the very interesting discussion we are having here, the time factor should be catching up with us. If I were now to respond to everything which has been said, and add to that what I have to say myself, then there would not be sufficient time, but I shall try, as briefly as possible, to get to the heart of what we have been discussing.</p>

<p>For almost a week we have been dealing here with measures in regard to the fostering of culture, with cultural institutions, and with the preservation of our cultural heritage. We have been very busy with these matters. I think we have in this way perhaps built up an overall idea of what is in fact understood under the concept culture. I must say that I agree whole-heartedly with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout when he made the point, while we were dealing with the legislation on the fostering of cultures that it would ultimately be developed into the manifesto for cultural promotion. That legislation will afford us the opportunity to do so. I think it is one of the rare occasions on which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has understood and expressed my ideas and intentions clearly and so concisely.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Springs on this motion of his. He struggled with many practical problems which have to be considered in the fostering of culture. I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to all the hon. members for what they have had to say about what this young department of Cultural Affairs is already doing and what we will be more capable of doing in future, provided the very necessary evil, which goes hand in hand with that, namely the necessary funds, are made available.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Springs focussed the spotlight with great insight on the problems and challenges of cultural promotion, and in regard to a great many of them, little or nothing can be done. That is our greatest problem. He placed particular emphasis and drew attention to what we should really do in order to ensure a secure existence as a white nation, and how it should be tackled with unwavering purpose in order to ensure this continued existence.</p>

<p>Now, I am afraid that there has been a bit of misunderstanding here, and the misunderstanding arose with the hon. member for Newton Park in that he made the allegation here that it seemed as if the Afrikaans-speaking people were afraid for their culture and their survival was concerned, that they felt that they should to a certain extent remain isolated, that they were afraid of the outside world and of making the necessary contact, and that they felt they would be corrupted and their culture would be affected. I think that is far from the truth, and that it was by no means the intention of the hon. member for Springs to create that impression.</p>

<p>I think something is being overlooked. Those participating in this debate to-day were for the most part Afrikaans-speaking. We know our history. For more than two centuries the Afrikaans-speaking people had to wage a struggle, both an internal and external one, in order to be and remain themselves. There was no other language from which they could in any way derive inspiration. It is a language which grew out of the Afrikaner people themselves. As all of us probably know, the first group of people who struggled hard for our language was Die Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners. Their struggle was directed inwards. Our own people reviled our language, to mention only one cultural asset, as a patois. That was less than a century ago. A small handful of people had to wage the struggle in order to accord this language, which was reviled as a patois by their own people, the right to exist, to turn it into a cultural language, and to make of it a language with which we could confer with our fellow men and with the outside world.</p>

<p>But apart from the internal struggle they also had to cope with the external struggle. In fact the Afrikaner had to endure onslaughts from within and without on all his cultural activities, and it is obvious that it is only during the past few decades that he has felt confident that the struggle is no longer necessary. He knows that he has established himself, he is no longer ashamed of his language, he has a right to use his language, he has the right to practice it, to engage in all cultural activities confidently and in public. Now there is no longer such a struggle. Mention is being made of a so-called outward movement, but it is not this side of the House which attached that designation to that movement, nor is it a new movement. It is a perfectly natural development, which did not begin with the present Prime Minister now, because it has been in progress for a very long time. Dr. Malan did this, so did General Hertzog, and let us not merely talk party politics now&#x2014;Gen. Botha and Gen. Smuts also did this. To want to offend a label to the National Party and state that it has suddenly come to light with an outward movement and that some of its supporters are in favour of this while others are not, is surely not correct. It is utter nonsense. As far as the contacts which are being sought, since when have there not been contacts with the United Kingdom, for example, and with our other cultural mother countries? There is the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, besides the United Kingdom. There have always been overseas ties in the cultural field, in the political field, in all fields. I think this is a misinterpretation of what the hon. member for Springs had to say. There is no fear, there is no isolation, we are not surrounding ourselves with an impregnable barbed wire fence so that<span class="col_2143-2144" refersTo="page_1094"/> we can remain untouchable. We can stare the world in the face, we have something to offer, and our cultural achievements are already so immense that we are participating in world expositions, <i>inter alia,</i> in Sao Paolo and Venice, where we are gaining plaudits with our arts. I think we are past the stage where we want to dig in our heels and close ranks for fear that we will be overwhelmed by foreign cultures. For I do not regard the English language culture in South Africa as a foreign culture.</p>

<p>I think that we have reached a great degree of unanimity this afternoon and as far as the need to make more comprehensive and more efficient attempts in respect of fostering our culture. I think that is what became apparent in all the speeches which were made here. Various means and methods were suggested, and certain points were mentioned to which we will have to give attention and which we will have to emphasize. When I discussed this fostering of culture in a Second Reading speech I emphasized cultural diffusion and cultural creations. In the discussion which followed an attempt was made by one of the hon. members to give a definition of culture. I then replied, but I now want to say to with even greater emphasis: It is hopeless to try to define culture. The hon. member also candidly admitted that he was using the definition of an expert. However, I have now had an opportunity of going into the matter, and I want to point out that there have been hundreds of experts who have made attempts to define culture, but their definitions have not been complete, descriptive and inclusive enough. It is one of the concepts which one may as well leave at that. Just consider how widely this discussion ranged to-day. There is not one sphere which we cannot include under the concept of culture.</p>

<p>In the very short time at my disposal I still want to reply to a few aspects of this matter. The hon. member for Newton Park pleaded for an opera group of our own. I just want to inform him that we are already spending more than R2 million per year in subsidies for the performing arts in our country. This is being done jointly by the Government and the provincial administrations. This is one of the most expensive undertakings one can imagine. We began on a very small scale, and I am in full agreement with him that we cannot allow these talents of ours to drain away to countries abroad. We must retain them all, but opera is probably one of the most expensive of undertakings, second only to the maintenance of an orchestra of our own. But what is more, is the fact that if we have an opera group we must also have proper opera houses. But Cape Town expects that an opera house will shortly be erected. In Pretoria a very large opera house is going to be built, and Johannesburg is also going to get an opera house. Once we have these physical facilities, it will make the task of making proper use of those facilities much easier. I agree with the hon. member, and I should like to see this happening.</p>

<p>Other requests were made. I am going to say something about education at a later stage. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke about the question of the spending of leisure time. Once again I want to agree with him whole-heartedly that it is one of the greatest evils which exist, i.e. if in this era, which is passing very rapidly, there is still an opportunity for wasting time. However, there are unfortunately people who have nothing to do with themselves over a week-end. As a result of the fact that there is a working week of five days, we actually have two days of rest. During those two days these people do things which are definitely not conducive to good for any good community. I am stating the matter in general terms, without chasing up a new hare. We have now appointed a committee, which I recently mentioned in a Second Reading speech, which will begin its deliberations soon. The committee will consider in particular what can be done to organize the youth better, and channelize them in directions where they will in fact spend their time valuably. One of the terms of reference of the committee, on which great emphasis is being placed, is <i>inter alia,</i> the question of leisure time. I hope that the experts who have been appointed to this committee will succeed, with the aid of all the investigations which have already taken place&#x2014;and quite a good few have taken place&#x2014;in finding a formula by means which these people can be set on the right road.</p>

<p>Now, in conclusion, I want to say something about education. I actually thought that this matter would best be discussed under the Education Vote. But I want to agree with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. As bearers of culture we do in fact have two very strong means at our disposal. The one is formal education and the other is informal education. The formal is compulsory education and the informal is the post school training which is being provided by this Department of Cultural Affairs. As far as formal education was concerned, the hon. member saw fit to refer to all kinds of weaknesses which were to be found in it. I want to admit that it is not perfectly organized. When I say that, I am also doing so on behalf of those persons who cannot say it here themselves. These are, in other words, the provinces which are to a large degree responsible for formal secondary school education. I am including my own Department in this. The fact of the matter is that South Africa is growing so rapidly and has expanded to such a phenomenal extent, that it is quite impossible to get all these things functioning properly at the outset. In the years when the hon. member&#x2019;s party had to fight a war we did not even have proper buildings. The hon. member is now complaining that in this case as well children have to be sent away. In my days I taught in a tent. I also taught in the kitchen of a house. We had to do this, because<span class="col_2145-2146" refersTo="page_1095"/> the circumstances which were prevailing were at the time abnormal ones. I concede that the circumstances were abnormal. But the circumstances now are also abnormal. They are not all that normal. Tremendously rapid progress is being made. I want to say to the hon. member that in an area such as the Vaal triangle, for example, two new large schools full of children appeared, one can almost say, overnight. Let us just consider what is happening at universities, in the tertiary field. This year alone the increase in the number of students amounted to 3,200. We must therefore make provision for those 3,200 additional people. For example, it costs the state R3,600 to make provision for one student. It therefore costs more than R11 million just to make provision for the newcomers this year. I can continue in this vein. I am not looking for excuses, because these are all facts. Advance planning must take place, but we must be very careful. At certain places, particularly where the population is sparse, one can plan in advance, but one cannot erect a school or a hostel here or there in the platteland and then find that these places are not fully occupied. That is only that part of the formula.</p>

<p>We now come to libraries. I want to admit that when I first came to this Department and when higher and vocational education was still under our control, I found that the libraries at the higher technical schools and the higher commercial schools were of a particularly poor quality. I immediately held discussions with my Department and we have introduced a tremendous change there. When I arrived in Witbank for example, at the commercial high school there, I said: There is not even a piano here; how do you want the girls to occupy their spare time if there is not even a piano? These things are all facts, as the hon. member said. Take music appreciation for example. I just want to say that there has already been a great improvement. A great deal of time is being spent on singing and music and the art in those schools. But I do not claim to be perfect, and I agree that our formal education is undoubtedly the mother of the continued existence of everything which is absolutely essential in this country. If it is neglected there will be no children capable of eventually taking the matter further.</p>

<p>But when we come to the informal part, I want to say that we then find ourselves in the sphere in which we are engaged in, and that is the cultural sphere. The Department of Cultural Affairs, with the legislation which we have passed here, and with these very useful discussions and suggestions which have been put forward here, will be given much assistance. To the hon. members for Springs and Rissik I just want to say that Rome was not built in a day. But we now hope and expect that with effect from 1st January, 1968, when this Department of Cultural Affairs was established, with this high ideal which we are pursuing, with these fine objectives which we have and the tremendous amount of planning which is being envisaged, with the help of the hon. members here, and with the co-operation of the general public outside, I can foresee&#x2014;and it does not take a great prophet to do so&#x2014;our entering a new era; that we can look forward to a new major development; that with this development we can walk forward hand in hand, taking with us all our White population, Afrikaans- as well as English-speaking; that we will be able to retain and preserve the cultural assets we have, and that we will develop them into something fine which will not only satisfy us but which will cause us to gain favour in the eyes of the world, so that they will recognize us as one of the great cultural countries with a culture of our own and not necessarily an extension of Western culture.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of having investigations made by the appropriate authorities into the mineral and agricultural resources of the Northern Cape, such authorities to make recommendations as to the types and kinds of industry which can and should be developed in the triangle, Kimberley, Post-masburg and Kuruman.</block>

<p>Sir, 20 years ago, almost to the day, the late Dr. Malan came to Kimberley as a guest of the city, and I had the pleasure of presiding at a civic function at which he was entertained. At that time, the idea of incorporating South-West Africa into the Union, as it then was, was uppermost in Dr. Malan&#x2019;s mind, and I recall so well, that when the felicitous speeches were being made I said to him that I had great sympathy with him in trying to get South-West Africa into the Union; because I had been trying for many years just to get Kimberley and the Northern Cape into the Union. His ideal and dream have been reasonably successful, but we, in the Northern Cape, are still waiting to be recognized and acknowledged by the Government as being part of the Republic of South Africa, and as such, entitled to some share in Government-sponsored industry with which to stabilize the region, and, with which to give encouragement to industrialists and businessmen to invest their money there.</p>

<p><span class="col_2147-2148" refersTo="page_1096"/>Over the years we have had a concerted effort by all public bodies and public men in the region, who have forgotten their political affiliations in the one goal and objective of trying to persuade the authorities, that the time had come when something should be done for that part of the country. I want to acknowledge all those men, and there are many of them, who have given of their time and ability quite freely, with this objective in view. I would, however, be remiss if I did not say that the editors of the newspaper, which is based on Kimberley have done a sterling job in promoting this ideal by trying to create a community spirit and by propagating the idea, that the rich mineral and agricultural resources of the region should be utilized to the best possible advantage.</p>

<p>Various things have been suggested over the years. Organizations have been formed to promote the interests of the region and many suggestions have been submitted. I think back to the years when suggestions were made for the establishment of some branch of the railway workshops there. I think back to when we tried to persuade the Government to make it possible to cut small diamonds. I think of the arguments we have had with the Minister of Transport about Railway tariffs. I think of the days when we pressed for a good electricity supply, which of course has now come to pass, because the network is there, and it is just waiting for the industry to appear. Water was another problem with which the community was faced. As you know, Sir, the Vaal River is being dammed in its upper reaches for the benefit of the industrial areas in the Transvaal, even to the point, where water is being taken over the watershed of the Vaal River and Johannesburg complex into the Pretoria complex. We, in the lower reaches, have had legislation passed, by which the water supplies at our end of the river are regulated.</p>

<p>My purpose to-day in moving this motion is to make an earnest appeal to the Government to adopt the recommendations which this motion contains, because I feel that the community itself, is beginning to wonder what is really in store for it. It has been mentioned to me that the motion could have been much wider and could have included Upington and Vryburg. I want to say, that in framing the motion in the form in which I did, there was no intention of excluding these two very important centres in the Northern Cape region. My purpose was to confine the attention of the House to the potentialities, the wealth and the riches, which lie in the region in the form of base minerals and precious stones as well as salt and asbestos. When I tell you, Sir, that of all these materials which occur in the Northern Cape region, only two are processed in the region, namely lime, which is turned into cement, and clay, which is turned into bricks, you will wonder what the reasons are, why everything else is carted away to distant places. I have no intention to-day of pleading again, as I have done before, for the establishment of a third Iscor there, but I must say in passing that people in the Northern Cape are disappointed and seriously concerned at the trend in the Government&#x2019;s policies of promoting the interests of other parts of the country, which are already prosperous, and which do not really need at this stage, to have these additional facilities and industries. We do not say that in any spirit of giving up hope at all, but when I tell the House, that the steel production of the whole of the African continent is only .8 per cent of the total world output and that the Far East, excluding Communist China, produces 18 per cent, then you will wonder, Sir, why we in the Northern Cape feel that a concerted effort should be made to attract the market on the African continent. I say, that if it is possible for the Japanese to import raw materials on the scale they do, much of which comes from this country, you will wonder why it is, that the Japanese are so prosperous and have such a flourishing steel industry, whereas ours, although large by our standards, is small by world standards. The Japanese import 91 per cent of their ore, 70 per cent of their coking coal, 12 per cent of their scrap iron and 12 per cent of their pig iron. We view with alarm the type of remark we got from the hon. the Minister of Transport earlier in the week, when he talked about having trains carrying 3,000 tons of ore drawn by one set of locomotives. When we are considering taking raw materials away on such a scale&#x2014;and it is already happening; 180,000 tons was taken from Sishen iron mine this last year&#x2014;and when we realize that these are the thoughts in the minds of some Ministers of the Government, we feel the time has come, when we should at least draw attention to what we regard as an unfair balance in the economy of the country.</p>

<p>My views, I hope, will not only be shared by my colleagues opposite, who represent seats in the region, but I hope that they will make some contribution to-day, to let us know exactly what the Government has in mind. The motivation for this particular resolution arose from a report, which I saw in <i>The Argus</i> a little while back. One aspect surprised me, the other shocked me. The shock&#x2014;let me deal with that one first&#x2014;was that the area north of the Orange River is not to be regarded as a growth point. The surprise, of course, was that the report said that the Members of Parliament for the Northern Cape region had a plan. Eighteen months ago, in September, 1967. I wrote to each of these gentlemen personally and asked them, if they did not think the time had come to get together to formulate an action committee, if one may use that expression, to push the claims of the region and to promote its interests. I offered in that letter, since my political affiliations are in the opposite camp, not to take it amiss if they should decide not to include me in such a committee. I am hoping to-day to hear what has happened, because last year at a Nationalist Party Congress, I think at Port Elizabeth, a committee was appointed consisting of the Members.<span class="col_2149-2150" refersTo="page_1097"/> of Parliament of the region, with instructions to produce a report. I also want to acknowledge that the University of Potchefstroom, in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning, is making investigations into the proposition that I enunciated but on slightly different lines. I make all these acknowledgments, but the fact remains that to-day in 1969, 100 years after the discovery of diamonds in the Kimberley region, the City cannot be regarded as being one of the foremost from the point of view of growth and prosperity in the Republic. I think people there are entitled to know, without any further delay or any further beating about the bush, what the reasons are, what the prospects are, and how far they can expect to go. Sir, subsequent to reading the report that the Northern Cape, or for that matter nowhere in the Cape except the Ciskei and the Transkei, was considered by the Government to be a growth point, I made it my business to ascertain from the Department of Industries what they had in mind. I got a very nice pamphlet from them, and I must say that on reading this wonderfully attractive pamphlet, which has the innocuous title, &#x201C;Decentralized Industrial Development in South Africa&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Innocuous&#x2014;harmless. It is quite a simple word. It is the sort of thing that the hon. member could be described as. When one reads this, one realizes that the Government is seriously offering concessions to industrialists. I do not want to enter into the controversial aspect of what this pamphlet discloses. I want to discuss it from a totally different angle. The permanent committee for the siting of industry wrote recently to the Chamber of Commerce at Kimberley, with whom I have been in correspondence. They had been asked what prospects they had and what was in their minds with regard to the development of the region. The reply was, firstly, that they&#x2014;that is Kimberley&#x2014;were not anywhere near any Bantustans and, secondly, that they were considering doing something for other groups. That might have been for Coloured people and, if so, we are grateful. But I would like to stake a claim for White people, who are the business people and the inhabitants of the region. I want to know why, when the Government can offer the concessions which are offered here, other business people cannot get the same facilities and discounts, the same rates of interest and the same rebates on taxes which are set out in this pamphlet; because if the Government can afford to give cut rates on rail traffic from the Transkei and the Ciskei to the nearest port, then it makes a mockery of the argument of the Minister of Transport that railway rates do not militate against the siting of any particular industry, and that, if that was stated to be the case, then he would like to be given examples. It makes a mockery of that particular attitude, because in this pamphlet he does offer rebates on railage of goods manufactured in these areas. Furthermore, the areas which are mentioned in this pamphlet are in the main in the Transvaal. The reasons as to why they are in the Transvaal do not matter, it does not matter what the main purpose is of the facilities that are offered. What I want to establish is the fact, that there is a differentiation in the minds of the Government in regard to white businessmen, because if a businessman is prepared to set up his business in the places enumerated here, he would get these very good concessions. The people in the area and the region for which I plead, have said for years: &#x201C;Give us concessions on railage rates.&#x201D; I asked the Minister of Economic Affairs once at a congress at Kimberley if there was any chance of getting back some of the taxes which we paid over the years, some of the millions and millions and millions of rand which had gone into the coffers of the Government from diamonds, and he said that it was an unheard of thing to give a rebate on income-tax to special groups. May I say that for some years every Minister has been in this region, many of them just to shoot springbuck, but they have all had a good time there; they have all been shown what is going on. They know exactly what the aims and ambitions of the people there are, and, funnily enough, they have almost without exception pledged their support for the projects which have been put before them from time to time.</p>

<p>Sir, the basis of my contention this afternoon is that the time has arrived when we should know what the position is, and I am hoping that not only is the Minister of Planning going to support my proposition, but that he is going to give an undertaking that he will act along the suggested lines. I am also hopeful that the hon. member for Gordonia, who has also been one of the stalwarts in fighting this case, will join in and confirm what I am saying. I would like him to know that in my file here I have stacks and stacks of letters and telegrams expressing approval of the motion which I have moved here this afternoon and which I am hoping will be carried by the House. Every town council supports what I am saying; I have the support of every chamber of commerce and every public man of any consequence.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, all these people are waiting hopefully. The position is that the municipalities have made every possible effort to make the towns and the villages and the cities good, modern and up-to-date with modern amenities and every possible facility. They have gone out of their way to appeal to as many as possible to put some pressure upon the Government, upon the Minister, with the object of getting some Government&#x2014;and I want to emphasize that&#x2014;supported industries. There are many places in this country on which the Government has lavished great sums of money. I do not envy them their good fortune. All I say is, that the time has come when something should be done for this region. Why, even the Administrator of the Free State had complimentary things to say about the suggestions that were offered from time to time and promised his support. The hon. the Minister must realize that the public are perhaps better informed than I am, because I always take the word of Ministers when I meet them on the platteland and when we entertain them, as we have done; I have always accepted that when they spoke to you there their word was their bond, and I have no reason to doubt that that is so.</p>

<p>Sir, in the limited time still at my disposal, I would like to say one or two further things. I believe that salt which is the basis of chemical industries should be exploited. Eighty per cent of the country&#x2019;s supply comes from that area. No asbestos is processed in the region. I have already touched on diamond-cutting. The manganese and the iron-ore are being carted away in thousands and thousands of tons in the worst form of colonial exploitation that could ever be devised. We hear talk of terminals at the ports to which the Japanese are going to bring ships carrying away 100,000 tons of ore to Japan.</p>

<p>How right the hon. the Minister is. I think Dr. Van Eck is running the show in this field. I do not want to discuss Dr. Van Eck here. I have a great regard for the man; he is a very able person, but I think the position becomes quite impossible when Government Departments compete with business on the scale that they do. One finds that this is the thinking to-day, and the report of Iscor confirms what I say. The strange thing is that last year when I spoke to the hon. the Minister of Transport across the floor of the House he denied that there were any complaints about the high railage rates and port rates on exported ore. Within a month, I think, of the rising of Parliament one of the biggest Japanese iron and steel men confirmed what had been said here and the Minister of Transport was smart enough to make a reduction in certain port and dock dues at Port Elizabeth. Sir, I think we have a good case and I do hope that the Government will treat it with the same degree of sincerity in which I make this plea. I make a plea to the Government to face up to the fact that we require, need, and want some Government-sponsored industries.</p>

<p>My final point is this: When the Verwoerd Dam and the Orange River scheme project was announced, everybody threw their hats up in the air but what happened? Once again, although there were great promises made in respect of the P.K. le Roux Dam, better known as the Van der Kloof, and of the third dam down the river at Torquay, nothing has happened. This is the one that is near to us. I think one of these days we will have to ask some very searching questions about what is going on at Van der Kloof or rather what is not going on at Van der Kloof because this, Sir, is the whole backbone of the development of the southern portion of the region, namely water. The municipalities who had the foresight in years gone by to make provision for water supplies in the Vaal River, have had their water cut off, and that is a very serious thing.</p>

<p>The industrial complexes in the Transvaal are getting to the stage to-day where the Vaal River, above the Vaal Dam, must be used exclusively for the industrial development of Johannesburg and now for the industrial development of Pretoria, which does not rightfully fall within the ambit of the Rand Water Board and the supply of water from the Vaal Dam. Do not forget, Sir, that we also have to supply water to the Free State goldfields. Recently, of course, the Department of Water Affairs has built a dam at Oppermansdrift near Bloemhof. Sir, may I just say at this stage that the agricultural aspects of my plea to-day will be dealt with by another speaker to follow. The farmers in the Vaalharts area have also had to accept restricted water. The use of water there is not as free as it should have been.</p>

<p>Finally, I just want to say this: I believe that the planning is not anywhere near the visionary type that we require to-day. Anybody who has been in public life in this country must realize that planning and projection of future development have always been on too small a scale. The reason is, I think, that we are thinking small instead of thinking big. I want the Minister to-day to think big and to tell me, without too much persuasion, that not<span class="col_2153-2154" refersTo="page_1099"/> only is he convinced by me, but that he is more than convinced by speakers on his side of the House whom I hope will follow me now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. W. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are certain points raised by the hon. member for Karoo with which I disagree and certain ones with which I agree. It is a little difficult to agree with the hon. member especially if he begins a speech as he did this afternoon. I also want to say to the hon. member that he is somewhat difficult to follow, because one never knows where he is leading one. In my opinion a parallel can be drawn between the aspirations of a country and its inhabitants&#x2014;and now I am speaking of the large Northern Cape as mentioned in the first part of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion&#x2014;to process their own resources themselves and to receive the economic benefit thereof, and the aspirations of a particular region to derive some benefit from its resources, and not simply to have them drained away. But it is generally known that it is present Government policy, in terms of economic decentralization, to ensure more general utilization of economic benefits for our country. We must accept it and develop it in our position as the Government party. And yet the demands of backward and remote areas such as the Northern Cape will continue to increase and we shall have to heed those demands. At the outset I just want to say that I support the hon. member in respect of the broader principle, where he pleads for benefits for the inhabitants of the Northern Cape. I cannot do otherwise. But I just want to say to him that the matters which he raised, have already been put forward frequently and comprehensively in this House by other speakers and other representatives of that area. But I must differ radically from him about the manner in which the motion was drawn up, as if it were true that there has not yet specifically been any action on the part of the State to determine the agricultural and mineral resources. In the past five years continuous attention has been given to these problems. Before one comes to those problems, which he also mentioned, one must actually take into consideration the primary terrain in which a State task is a State task. In the field of industry the State ought to act in a supporting and a developing capacity, but this is not primarily its task, its terrain, in our free market economy. However, I do not disagree with him in his plea for border area benefits for the Northern Cape. I think that it is a meritorious request. One can find no fault with that. But I am in no doubt that the most important need of the Northern Cape at present, the greatest task for the State, lies in the establishment of a system of basic facilities, without which agricultural and mineral development, which he would like to see there, cannot take place. I am now thinking of the large Northern Cape, not of the small triangle to which he would like to reduce it, although he used the term &#x201C;Northern Cape&#x201D;. I am thinking of good roads, transport facilities, sufficient water for present and future needs and of cheap extended electric power. It is clearly a task for the State. We do not need to argue about this. It is specifically on the basis of investigations which have already been conducted and which the State had a hand in, that we can come to this conclusion. These investigations in the Northern Cape proved that the area is being crippled by certain deficiencies, which I have no doubt must be eliminated before any thought can be given to the problems which the hon. member mentioned, otherwise the development of those industries is not possible. Then the prospects of this greater Northern Cape will be rosy, especially if one abandons the principle of summarily removing the resources of a region without the region itself being able to enjoy the benefits of those resources, even if only to a certain extent.</p>

<p>I therefore first want to mention what has already been done by the State by way of regional studies to determine to socio-economic position, the bottlenecks and the prospeots of the Northern Cape. In 1962 the then Deputy Minister, Minister Haak, offered the assistance of the State in the drawing up of a regional study for the Northern Cape. This regional study was begun with the assistance of the State. Other bodies also contributed, and it is known that five parts have already appeared in connection with the work which has already been done, giving a general resume of the climate of the Vaal River basin, of the utilization of land and water, of an ecological study of the plant communities of the banks of the Vaal, of regional income, with a correlated projection to the year 2000, with due consideration for the use of water. It is fairly interesting to think of what the hon. member said, i.e. that there is no long-term vision. The reports which have already been brought out also deal with planning in respect of the present and future use of water of such sectors as industry, the local authority, the mines and the Railways. Other reports will follow and will appear in the course of this year. We also have that assurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister. Because studies of this nature do not only convey facts, but also embrace analyses, summaries, conclusions and recommendations, the hon. member may be assured that he will find all the recommendations in respect of the industries about which he is concerned in these regional studies when they are completed this year. In addition there are numerous proofs of what the State has already done to determine the resources of the Northern Cape, on fronts wider than merely the mineral and the agricultural. There was a socio-economic survey of the Lower Orange Region, which covers more than 40,000 square miles. It was carried out by the Economic Investigation Bureau of the University of Stellenbosch in 1967. The Department of Planning gave ample financial support, as did the development association of the Lower Orange. It was a comprehensive investigation and here I come once more<span class="col_2155-2156" refersTo="page_1100"/> to the point of the infra structure which is so necessary for those industries. The year before last a comprehensive investigation and the submission of a transport plan for the Northern Cape was completed by Professor Verburgh It was also done for the Department of Planning. In 1964 a regional survey was done of the Western Cape. It included a very large portion of the North Western Cape which the hon. member had in mind, and it gave rise to quite a few additional and also more intensive surveys. In addition to these studies the State also had a direct and indirect hand in many visits by high officials, Ministerial visits and investigations. These things undoubtedly indicate a great interest in and concern with the problems of the Northern Cape, not only in order to combat these problems but also in order to adopt a far-sighted approach in regard to the Northern Cape and to try to determine its prospects and, of course, the factors which impede development. I think that we can take appreciative note of the State&#x2019;s interest, its task and its actions in respect of the points which the hon. member raised. These studies and investigations revealed quite a number of facts. Conclusions could be drawn which were also of great importance for agriculture and mining. In the Lower Orange Region agriculture to-day constitutes 38.5 per cent of the gross regional product and in the more easterly parts&#x2014;i.e. nearer to Kimberley and thereabouts&#x2014;it still constitutes 24 per cent of the gross regional product. For mining the figures are respectively 13.5 (Orange) and 18.5 in the vicinity of Kimberley. These two sectors furnish the most important contribution, as you can see, to the geographic product which was already more than R152 million ten years ago. This is with the exception of Namaqualand, which I also include in the Northern Cape, and where the mining sector is predominant. There copper and diamonds alone yield an annual amount of almost R47 million in foreign exchange. We learned a few things from these investigations. The hon. member mentioned them. The hon. member is well acquainted with the mineral potentialities of his region. We know that the Northern Cape is the worlds largest supplier of blue asbestos. Regardless of differences of opinion, it nevertheless appears to be generally thought that the iron ore of the Northern Cape, which is valued at about 5,000 million tons, can earn a greater income for us at the end of this century than the gold mining industry has done up to now. We know that as far as manganese is concerned, South Africa is to-day the third largest supplier in the world. We know of the tin over there and also of the tremendously large salt deposits in the Gordonia district. There is also gypsum. These things are merely waiting for efficient exploitation. Alongside this mineral region there is the agricultural aspect. Agriculture makes no insignificant contribution to the economy of that region. On the contrary, it makes a particularly important contribution. In the Lower Orange we have 25,000 morgen of land under intensive irrigation. In terms of the present-day State expenditure members can see what tremendously large irrigation areas will be supplied with water by the Orange Scheme. These things and the investigations into the water position in our country&#x2014;which includes those portions&#x2014;and the investigations into agriculture, leave us in no doubt about what is contemplated in the future for agriculture and mining as sectors in contributing to our economy. One can surely not be in any doubt about that, as is implied by this motion. It is a good thing that industry is being given consideration, as the hon. member stated here to-day. But I think that in such a thinking process it is better to place first things first. And it is therefore my request that in consequence of the results of these completed investigations and of others still to come, preference be given at this stage to the speedy creation of an efficient and rounded off infra structure for the Northern Cape. These studies reveal certain problems to us. The most important was that industrial development&#x2014;except the truly local service industries, etc.&#x2014;and especially the exploitation of base minerals can never prosper in that region unless there is an ensured and sufficient provision of water for future agricultural, urban and industrial use; unless there is a cheap and easily excessible electric power network, which will not only cover the hon. member&#x2019;s vicinity, but will stretch over the entire Northern Cape; and unless&#x2014;and this is the most important&#x2014;there is not an efficient internal transport system, which is well-linked up with the metropolitan areas and is preferably rounded off with harbour facilities on the West Coast of the Northern Cape. We are applying ourselves to these problems because they are the most important. I have already spoken about water last year with special reference to those parts of the Northern Cape which we call the Lower Orange. I made out a case for a storage dam west of the confluence of the two rivers. I obtained certain assurances. And I also want to mention here what the State is doing. The Minister of Water Affairs appointed a special commission to plan for the water needs of the Lower Orange. This extends as far as Namaqualand. I mention this with appreciation today. However, I still stand by my past request in connection with a storage dam. Some of these regional studies have indicated that a power network is very necessary there. But our main bottleneck is the deficient transport system. Of the total rural network of significant roads in the Northern Cape only 6 per cent are tarred, as against 15 per cent in the central Cape and 22 per cent in the Southern Cape. The 6 per cent will perhaps be increased with a view to the existing road building program. But there is no final rounding off ab

out a very important road such as the one which must link up Namaqualand with the Lower Orange and with the important Witwatersrand centre. In respect of the authorities there are still at present, no encouraging signs to be observed that real action is contemplated in respect of the establishment of<span class="col_2157-2158" refersTo="page_1101"/> sufficient harbour facilities on the West Coast of the Northern Cape. I regard it as very important to open up this part of the country and its sources. I am therefore pleading for the most important things first. I intended to move an amendment&#x2014;and now you may laugh at me&#x2014;but I eventually felt sorry for the hon. member. I then decided not to move an amendment.</p>

<p>At this stage I merely want to say that my actual view is of a co-ordination of the regional studies which have already been done and of regional studies which may still be done. But those regional studies and that co-ordination must see the Northern Cape as a whole, which begins 500 miles into the interior and extends up to the Atlantic Coast in the west. It is a tremendously large area, whose salvation I think also lies to the west. In the final instance I want to say that the Department &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am busy dealing with the Northern Cape and pleas for an infra structure. If the departments coordinate these various regional studies with a view to the establishment of a sound infra structure for the whole of the Northern Cape, which is described in the first part of the motion, we will be satisfied and 120,000 Whites will be satisfied, as well as 250,000 Coloureds who live in a remote and extensive region. But in the co-ordination of and the decision about this infra-structure which must be established I ask that the profit and loss account not be considered for the present but that more attention be given to the long-term economic and social benefits. We have already accepted this principal in respect of the Bantu homelands. My plea is that we accept it with as much confidence and idealism in respect of regions which are far away from us and which are pioneer regions where the people deserve it and which require special attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that all of us connected with the Cape Province will echo and support the appeals which have been made by the hon. members for Karoo and Gordonia. In recent years, when still a member of the executive committee of this province, other members and I visited the particular area to view the problems facing that area. We had very modest requests for things to be done. I do not know whether it was indicative of the modesty of those people, or whether it was a manifestation of their despondency, but when a member of the provincial council from that area asked for some assistance as far as bridge-building there was concerned, he ended up by saying to us, &#x201C;Gee maar net een pilaar per jaar.&#x201D; They would then know they were moving in some direction, albeit slowly. But I think that at this time this &#x201C;een pilaar per jaar&#x201D; is a bit slow for the development of the northern area of the Cape Province. I think this is an area which needs attention, because it is of vital importance not only to the Cape Province but to the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>I am very glad to see the hon. the Deputy Minister of Planning here because I should like to discuss with him some of the thoughts he expressed on development when he spoke at Heilbron on the 21st of February this year, when he discussed the question of regional development. He made a statement with which none of us can disagree, I think, when he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is waar dat nie elke dorp &#x2019;n nywerheidsdorp kan wees nie, net so waar as wat dit is dat goudmyne nie by elke plek kan bestaan nie, maar, mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is ewe waar dat elke streek, elke distrik en elke dorp sy eie besondere hulpbronne, potensialiteite en moontlikhede het, en elk sodanige streek, distrik of dorp het die reg op die ontwikkelling van sy besondere potentiaal en moontlikhede sodat hy kan bydra tot die land se ekonomie en deel in die welvaar van die geheel.</block>

<p>We agree that the Deputy Minister stated the position very accurately. But it is a matter of now applying what he said then to the areas with which these hon. members are particularly concerned.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister went on to say &#x201C;Geen landsdeel mag in die gemeenskaplike belang oor die hoof gesien word nie.&#x201D; This applies also to the North-West Cape. Later on he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die streekgedagte impliseer dat iedere persoon en organisasie, veral openbare liggame, aan die beweging moet deelneem. Die streekgedagte is &#x2019;n metode spesifiek gemik op die optimum ontwikkeling van bestaande, latente of potensiele natuurlike of mensgemaakte hulpbronne, insluitende arbeid en kan op enige hulpbron of streek toegepas word.</block>

<p>That is correct, but there has been an awful long time since then before this development is really being tackled in these areas, before the development in the North-West Cape is really being tackled.</p>

<p>As far back as 1964 the provincial administration of the Cape received a detailed report on the regional planning of the Cape Province, and particular reference was made to the North-West Cape, in fact to what was then referred to as the Orange River Area. Very little has happened since then, though, and I want to suggest that one of the reasons is the fact that there is no real statutory obligation on any particular body to get a move on with this regional development. It is a question of passing the matter from one tier of government to the other in our three-tier system&#x2014;and a lot of tears are shed in the<span class="col_2159-2160" refersTo="page_1102"/> process. There is a lot of talk about whose responsibility it is to get on with this work and this development.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister knows that this question of some statutory or some governmental directive has been raised over and over again. Mr. Robinson, the consultant, reported to the Cape Provincial Administration in 1964, and at that stage he drew attention to the importance of creating machinery, powers and financial means to give effect to regional planning. He recommended an investigation of the statutory provisions needed to facilitate effective and integrated regional planning. He asked that there should be particular attention given to the machinery for the adoption of regional schemes, their desirable legal status, as well as changes to the existing system so as to secure proper implementation of regional schemes.</p>

<p>But these matters have drifted on. All that we have had before Parliament was the Physical Planning and Resources Bill where the motivation, according to what the hon. the Minister of Planning himself said, was not the economic factor, but the race policy of the Government. I mention this because this is a problem in the North-West Cape that must be tackled by virtue of the economic aspects involved, and not because of any ideological or party political factors. I think it cuts across party political differences. It is a development which is needed by all sections.</p>

<p>In that regard the Deputy Minister dealt very fully with this question of regional planning. Right throughout he laid the emphasis on the local authorities, the local interests, the local bodies, the local organizations, rather than on some central director. I wonder whether that is the correct way of doing it. I wonder whether that is the way that will achieve results. Let me quote one or two other passages from the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s speech. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die ondersoek moet &#x2019;n stap verder gevoer word ten einde vas te stel wat die vooruitsigte vir verdere ekonomiese ontwikkeling in die streek is op die gebied van landbou, mynbou, nywerhede, en die ander tersi&#x00EA;re bedrywighede soos handel, finansies en dienste.</block>

<p>These are commendable thoughts, but where is the action? Where do we have these sentiments converted into activity? The Deputy Minister went on to say the following, and here I feel is the justification for the motion moved by the hon. member for Karoo. The Deputy Minister said:</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is geen bepaalde wetgewing in Suid-Afrika vir die vorming van streekontwikkelingsverenigings nie. Daar is ook geen neergelegde reels aangaande wat as hul funksies beskou moet word, watter gebiede ingesluit moet word, watter persone en liggame as lede toegelaat moet word en op welke wyse programme uitgevoer moet word nie.</block>

<p>Surely this shows the necessity of some positive action which is to be taken by the Department of Planning. After all these investigations which have been done at various levels, i.e. on local authorities, provincial authorities and local bodies&#x2014;it has in fact been done as far as the North-West Cape is concerned&#x2014;we have reached the stage where some dynamism must be introduced. It can only be introduced by further Government action. I have said that this is a matter which concerns primarily the Cape Province but it concerns in equal measure the State. I venture to suggest that the Provincial Administration has, within its limited resources, done what possibly can be done, trying to assist in this development. Matters of public transport and rail development and the availability of water and related matters, are not the responsibility of the Provincial Administration, nor are they the responsibility of the lower tier, i.e. the local authority. It is the responsibility of the Government. The province is hamstrung by this matter. When I say it is of particular interest to the Cape Province one only has to have regard to what that development would mean economically to this province. At present this province has to be heavily subsidized by non-statutory grants because of the difficulties it faces because of its size. As the hon. the Minister knows, the Cape Province is bigger than the other three provinces put together plus a third of them in area. The hon. Minister also knows that the North-West Cape, which we are referring to this afternoon, is one of the areas which has not developed to its maximum potential. If one mentions the size of the province, I just want to indicate to you, for instance, that the length of the national roads&#x2014;which would cover the North-Western Cape, these &#x201C;uitgestrekte gebiede&#x201D;&#x2014;in the Cape Province, roads which have been built, are to be built and are being planned at the moment, cover 4,369 miles. In the Transvaal the total is 1,384; in the Orange Free State, 1,128 and in Natal, 1,053 miles. That indicates the vast area which is covered by the Cape Province. We cannot leave the potential of the North-West Cape undeveloped to the same extent as it is undeveloped at this moment. There is another aspect which is in the national interest and that is that the Northern Cape is strategically correctly situated for great industrial development for South Africa. It is on our west coast, and strategically, I mean strategically in the world picture, it is the area in our country in which there should be the maximum development. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister, in dealing with this matter, will indicate to us that some force, some impetus, can be given to the planning of the North-West Cape, not only for the benefit of the North-Western Cape, but also for the benefit of the Cape Province and the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#maree">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Green Point for dealing in particular in his plea with the interests of that part of the Northern Cape which<span class="col_2161-2162" refersTo="page_1103"/> we call the North-Western Cape. I do so because it is a matter very dear to my heart in view of the fact that I represent that area. However, it is clear to me that the hon. member is not altogether well-acquainted with what is actually happening there, because certain aspects which he mentioned are specifically those which are receiving attention.</p>

<p>To-day I should like to discuss the whole area of the Northern and North-Western Cape, because I regard that area as a unit&#x2014;the one the hinterland of the other. In the development of the Northern Cape it is very essential that that western portion be developed together with the rest of the Northern Cape, because they share the same water sources, are climatologically the same, are equally extensive, and for various other geographic reasons. I should like to make use of this opportunity to-day, because it is the first opportunity I am being afforded in this House of thanking the Department of Planning, and specifically the Secretary for Planning, for an extraordinary action which was performed in the interests of this area when, in 1957, he organized a visit of six departments on secretarial level, with dignitaries and experts in the respective departments. That visit was definitely not a holiday. Work was definitely done, Investigations were made&#x2014;I believe that it will lead to precisely what the hon. member for Green Point pleaded for&#x2014;to get to know the potential and the problems of the area. It was done at the highest level of all departments concerned. On behalf of that area I want to convey our sincere gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary for Planning for that tour which he arranged under very difficult circumstances. We know how busy those people are, we know how extremely difficult it is to coordinate those people in a combined tour.</p>

<p>When we think of that area, to which we referred to-day, we immediately think of a backward area. That area has, in the first instance, lagged behind as a result of the way in which development took place in South Africa. We know that, until very recently, development simply took place according to circumstances. If gold is discovered in an area, railway lines are constructed to that area and then the areas situated along that route derive benefit from it. When a war was fought in South-West Africa, a railway line was constructed in a certain direction and the areas derived benefit from it. Then the Department of Planning came into being with the purpose of co-ordinating that planning and conducting it in a specific direction. This is what is now taking pace; now there are investigations; now planning and pre-arrangement take place. That is why I say to-day that the Government is busy doing those things which are being asked for here at present, and we appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, while those things are taking place, it is most certainly a very good opportunity to bring the potentialities of the areas to the attention of this House. There are people who are inclined to say that the North-Western Cape is a backward area because it does not possess the potential and the wealth. I consider it an extremely erroneous view and I should like to use a few moments of the very short time at my disposal to speak a bit about the potential of the Northern and North-Western Cape in particular. It is a generally known fact&#x2014;my colleague has already referred to it&#x2014;that from the North-Western Cape, from the constituency of Namaqualand to be precise, R47 million in foreign exchange is earned per year with the sale of copper and diamonds alone. It is a well-known fact that diamonds are a very selfish mineral. What I mean by that is that the area concerned does not benefit from its diamonds because extensive safety measures are applied and because it does not actually need very much transport. It does not actually bring an infra-structure to the area, and that is precisely what has happened in those areas; with its diamond wealth and even its rich copper mines, those people acted very independently, and actually no great infrastructure was created. But in the meantime the State obtained extensive revenue from it. We realize, and I think that the Government is very conscious of the fact, that one cannot indefinitely scoop off the wealth of an area without ploughing something back into it. Then the less profitable minerals will eventually not be able to make their full contribution to the development of our fatherland and of that region. I therefore want to plead that very speedy action be taken in the development of that part of the Northern and North-Western Cape, while the mineral wealth is still in heavy production and while there are still diamonds, copper and other minerals in those parts which contribute to the wealth of the country. Sir, I must tell you that it has been proved with statistics that the high-grade copper in the North-West has decreased, but that there is a tremendous amount of lower grade copper. New copper deposits are still being discovered, but in that area the surface has actually only been scratched. I am thinking, for example, of a large region such as the Richtersveld, in which there has never yet been a mineral or even a water drill, because that area is so inexcessible that drills simply cannot get in there.</p>

<p>To-day no one can tell what the potential of that area is. We know that people continually tell one that it is an area of specimens (monsters), and here I am not referring to the &#x201C;monsters&#x201D; that catch people; I am referring to collectors&#x2019; specimens. It is a very eroneous conception. No one has ever gone to explore there in order to see whether those specimens are really large creatures or whether they are merely specimens. I think that the time has come for us to begin investigating very seriously whether these specimens are merely specimens or whether they have actual potential.</p>

<p>But there is also proven potential which we are absolutely certain about, potential which is to-day exploited with difficulty as a result of certain infra structure problems. We simply do not have power there. If you go to the<span class="col_2163-2164" refersTo="page_1104"/> North-West, you will find that the price of power there is very high because for the power which is, for example, generated at the mining town Na ba beep, coal is used which costs R10 per ton by comparison with R2 per ton in the Transvaal. One can thus realize that it is tremendously expensive power. You will also realize that we are faced with tremendous water problems in that area. We are faced with a water problem because at present the mines obtain their water from the dry bed of the Buffels River which has a large catchment basin. But the rainfall is very irregular and we are frequently faced with extreme crisis conditions in those areas. We were recently faced with a situation that after the Buffels River had not flowed for two years, there was only water in that basin for three months. You can imagine what a tremendous retarding effect it had on the production of that area and what a tremendously chaotic effect it could have if those conditions were to continue and the water supply of that mining town were to have dried up. That is why we are very busy thinking about an infra structure which is absolutely necessary there.</p>

<p>But I said that I should like to say something about the proven potential of that area.</p>

But I have not yet come to the potential and I have not come to the master plan and my time is up.

<p>I shall try not to land up in Japan this afternoon. I should like to go there one day, but I shall not land up there to-day. The hon. member for Namaqualand also strongly supported the motion, as we all do. We all feel it to be a very important motion and we are all very glad that it can be discussed this afternoon. He told us of the planning which is taking place, etc., and then he made a plea for certain parts which, he claimed, fall in the Northern Cape. All the previous speakers spoke of the importance of that part of our country, and we should all like to emphasize the importance of the area. However, this afternoon I should like to speak of a particular aspect, and that is the aspect of agriculture in the Northern Cape, and I shall confine myself to that.</p>

<p>The Northern Cape is an area producing quite an extensive amount of agricultural products along the Vaal, Harts, Riet and Orange Rivers. The wheat production along the Vaal River amounts to &#x00BD; million bags, and the production of dried peas amounts to 60 per cent of the Republic&#x2019;s production. The lucerne crop there constitutes about 50 per cent of the country&#x2019;s production. Some of the finest seed potatoes are produced there, and about 35 per cent of our cotton comes from those parts. In other words, it is a very important region as far as agricultural products are concerned. As far as animal products are concerned, 20 per cent of our butter and 30 per cent of our cheese are produced there. The cattle there comprise about 30 per cent of the Republic&#x2019;s livestock, and the sheep about 10 per cent. It is the region producing by far the most karakul pelts in the country, which are of great importance to us because they provide us with foreign exchange. The rainfall in those parts is rather low and droughts frequently occur. This year, as in all previous years, we have already talked about the difficulties with which the agricultural industry in South Africa is faced, with drought, shortage of capital and high interest rates, etc. Those parts are as subject to those factors as any other part of the country, and I do not want to speak about that now because we have already done so, and it is applicable to the entire Cape Province and therefore to those parts as well.</p>

<p><span class="col_2165-2166" refersTo="page_1105"/>I should like to mention two aspects which affect those parts in particular. The one is the encroachment of bushes in the Northern Cape, especially in the Molopo area. There is a portion of about 1.5 million morgen where bush encroachment has increased tremendously and is still doing so. It has become a tremendous hazard. I read here on page 32 of the report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Molopo area and Griqualand-West swarthaak, umbrella thorn and sweet thorn are encroaching on a large scale. It is estimated that swarthaak, which is causing the most trouble, has already invaded 1.5 million morgen in the Northern Cape on an alarming scale. At least 50 per cent of the natural grazing in the Molopo, which includes large portions of the districts of Mafeking, Vryburg and Kuruman, have been invaded by swarthaak. Veld deterioration is the main cause of the problem, which could have been prevented by judicious veld management &#x2026; Where natural grazing is correctly used and kept in healthy condition, bush encroachment seldom becomes a problem.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>You should rather have mentioned it under the Agricultural Technical Services Vote.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>Those are the problems which exist there and I should like to draw the Department&#x2019;s attention to them, because it is essential that those parts be developed, and if the expected development takes place as a result of this motion, the food production will be of the utmost importance to South Africa. I have already mentioned the number of morgen which are threatened and something will have to be done to combat that problem. We cannot merely allow a large portion of our agricultural land to be destroyed like that without doing something about it. We shall have to check it and the necessary research will have to be done to devise a plan to fight that encroachment. Today it is a costly process. It is virtually impossible for the farmer to eradicate the swarthaak. He cannot afford it, and the Department will have to carry out research to find an economical method of doing so.</p>

<p>The other aspect which I should like to mention is the question of water. All the previous speakers have already spoken of the water shortage in those parts. This is, of course, the greatest problem with which those parts are faced. It has already been mentioned that the Vaal River no longer brings any water, because its water is required for the Rand complex. When the Oppermansdrift Dam has been completed, at the end of the year, it will be a great help, but it will certainly not be sufficient; the other source is the Orange River. We are, of course, deeply disappointed that the work on the Van der Kloof Dam has been suspended and that everything has to wait upon that, because these parts would also have benefited greatly from the construction of the Van der Kloof Dam; water could then have been taken to Kimberley, to Vaalharts, to the Riet and Orange Rivers. All the irrigators along those rivers experience a shortage of water each year. Vaalharts is at present subject to water restrictions because the Vaal Dam received relatively little water during this rainy season. I understand that it contains a mere 42 per cent of its capacity. These people are consequently subject to severe restrictions. Year upon year they are subject to restrictions; year upon year the Lower Orange areas experience water shortages, and this is a tremendous impediment to agriculture in those parts. I want to appeal to the Government for something to be done now to commence work on the Van der Kloof and P. K. le Roux Dams again. Too much depends on those dams and it is essential that the necessary work be tackled there.</p>

<p>As far as the farms are concerned, one also has large areas which are experiencing water shortages. The Marais Commission recommended that the Kalahari be withdrawn entirely. I cannot foresee it ever happening. I cannot see how that large area, where a lot of meat and karakul pelts are produced, can ever be withdrawn, but we shall have to take the necessary steps to ensure that those parts are protected and that proper conservation methods are applied there. One of the necessities there is to ensure that more water is available. The Kalahari has too little water; its water is situated at great depth; much of it is bad and consequently it is difficult to farm in the Kalahari; the animals must walk long distances to water and therefore they trample the veld. What is more, the water of the Kalahari is not very permanent; it is situated at great depth and there is a possibility that that water will one day be exhausted. One therefore wonders whether the time has not come for the Government to investigate the possibility of pumping water into those parts. I realize that it will be a costly process, but I think that we can investigate it to determine how costly it will be. If the Kalahari does not have sufficient water, if not much more water can be brought to it, if the possibility exists that that water may perhaps one day be exhausted, it will perhaps be economical to pump the necessary water into the Kalahari from the rivers. For sheep one does not need such a tremendous amount of water. It may perhaps be economically possible and I think it should be investigated to see whether it can be done.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is all that I want to say. I wanted to emphasize that aspect of agriculture, i.e. the shortage of water in those parts. We can no longer neglect to supply the necessary water for those parts.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo moved a very interesting motion, one which may be very fruitful if it is discussed maturely. I am sorry, however, that he presented his motion in the way he did. He tried to imply that the Government had been giving no attention whatsoever to this important region of our<span class="col_2167-2168" refersTo="page_1106"/> country in the past few years; he tried to imply that all the pleas he had made in the past had fallen on deaf ears. His motion has two legs, of course. In the first leg of his motion he asks for an investigation into the agricultural and mineral resources of the Northern Cape. He asks for an investigation as though those resources have never been investigated and are not being investigated at the moment. The second leg of his motion calls for recommendations to be made in regard to the establishment of industries in the triangle, Kimberley, Postmasburg and Kuruman. As far as the first leg is concerned, I just want to say this: This implies that he is of the opinion that the Government has not been doing its duty towards that region. The hon. member is very badly informed. I told him by way of interjection that he was very badly informed in my opinion. I want to state most emphatically here this afternoon that the Northern Cape is a region to which the Government is giving serious attention, as I shall try to indicate. The development of the Northern Cape has been enjoying the attention not only of local interests but of the State in particular. A previous speaker mentioned the offer made by Minister Haak in 1962 when he was Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs. At an annual congress of the Regional Development Association of the Northern Cape and Adjoining Areas he made an offer that the State would assist in compiling a regional plan for the Northern Cape. That was as long ago as 1962. At that time the University of Potchefstroom was already engaged in making a survey for the development association. An auxiliary committee of the N.R.D.C. (the Natural Resources Development Council) was then established, and the University of Potchefstroom was requested to continue its work so as to fit in with a more comprehensive regional plan. That being the position, the University of the Witwatersrand was also brought in as that University was already engaged in making a regional survey of the Vaal River basin, which also had to fit in with a more comprehensive regional plan, so as to enable the co-ordination of all these endeavours. The Provincial Administration of the Cape Province as well as the Provincial Administrations of the Free State and the Transvaal were also brought in, and in 1964 all these organizations, i.e. the Northern Cape Regional Development Association, the Association of the Catchment Area of the Vaal River, the University of Potchefstroom, the University of the Witwatersrand, the N.R.D.C., the Provincial Administrations of the Transvaal, the Cape Province and the Free State, met at Potchefstroom and on that occasion Minister Haak once again attended the meeting and gave an assurance that in the first place this undertaking should be the responsibility of the State, and that in the second place the Department of Planning, which was to replace the N.R.D.C., would act as the coordinating body.</p>

<p>Two committees were appointed in 1964, one an auxiliary committee and the other a technical committee, and in view of the fact that water was the decisive factor, it was decided at that time that the water aspect of the plan should first be investigated. As you heard here this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, the hon. members all spoke of the Northern Cape as though it extended from Hondeklip Bay to far beyond Askam in the Kalahari&#x2014;actually the entire north-western part of South Africa, actually the dry part of South Africa where water is the important and decisive factor. The hon. member for Gordonia has already mentioned the fact that this auxiliary committee issued a report consisting of five volumes. These five volumes have been published. There are more volumes which are still outstanding and which will also be published this year. There are another three volumes which will be edited within the next month or so and which will then become available as well. The three reports deal with the following aspects: The first report deals with: Climate, water resources, traffic and tourism potential of the Northern Cape; the second report deals with: Population and social aspects; and the third report deals with: Economic structure and development possibilities. After the publication of these three volumes, eight volumes will be available of the report on this survey which has been conducted as a result of the steps taken by the Government. A final report will also be published which will deal with minerals, but as I shall indicate in a moment, a thorough investigation has already been made into the question of minerals. You will allow me, Sir, to refer in brief to this question as well. Various organizations have already made thorough investigations into the mineral potential of that region, but I want to make special mention of the fact that Iscor and Amcor have conducted a considerable number of investigations in that region. As hon. members know, Iscor has been doing prospecting on a large scale not only in the North-Western Cape but also in the Northern Cape. As far as searching for minerals as well as encouraging the mining of such minerals is concerned, the Geological Survey Division of the Department of Mines has also made a number of contributions by means of surveys conducted by that Division and by means of publications of that Division. I can mention a whole series: There is &#x201C;Die Geologiese Kaart van die Mangaanafsettings by Postmasburg, met toeligting van mnr. P. L. Nel&#x201D;; this was a special publication of that Division. Then there is &#x201C;The Iron Deposits of the Union of South Africa&#x201D; of Mr. P. A. Wagner, which deals with the iron ores of that region. Then there is &#x201C;The Manganese Deposits of the Union of South Africa&#x201D;, which also deals with the manganese deposits of those areas. Then there is &#x201C;The Pre-Cambrian Dolomite and Limestone of the Northern Cape Province&#x201D; of one Toombs. In addition there are &#x201C;Die Geologiese Bladkaart&#x201D; of Visser and &#x201C;Gips van die Republiek van Suid-Afrika&#x201D;. These are all minerals which are found in those parts. Then there is a contribution of the inter-departmental committee on Tiger&#x2019;s-eye. The following publications are being edited at the moment: A manuscript on &#x201C;The<span class="col_2169-2170" refersTo="page_1107"/> Geology and Mineralogy of the Kalahari Manganese Fields&#x201D;; a manuscript on &#x201C;Die Verspreiding, Ontstaan, die Struktuur en die Moontlikhede van die Asbesbelt tussen Prieska en Kuruman&#x201D;; &#x201C;Hersiening van die Geologiese Bladkaart van die Postmasburg-area&#x201D;; a handbook on salt&#x2014;as hon. members know, most of our salt is mined in those areas. In the vicinity of Postmasburg an area of 2,000 square miles will be covered by a magnetic and a radiometric survey from the air as part of a programme of the Department of Mines. I can also mention other facts. The Geological Survey Division has two regional offices in that area at the moment, one at Kuruman and one at Prieska. For the past eight years the staff of those offices have been doing a large amount of hydrological work as well as geological mapping, economic geology and engineering geology, and they have been rendering assistance to and advising members of the public and the mining companies in those parts. From this hon. members will deduce that a thorough investigation has in fact been conducted into the resources of those parts. I just want to add that the permanent committee for the location of industries and the development of border areas has conducted an investigation into the possibilities in respect of the location of industries in the Northern Cape. It is hoped that this report will be available at the end of April. I hope the hon. member has now been convinced that this area has been enjoying the attention of the authorities in particular. As soon as we have these reports at our disposal, we shall be able to give this matter further consideration. But what is also important, is this report of the Department of Water Affairs. I should like to quote an excerpt from that report in order to illustrate how important the question of water is to those regions. In this report a projection is made in respect of water consumption by the year 2000. (I do not know why it has been necessary lately for us to make so many projections to the year 2000.) The report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is indicated that the total consumption in the country will be 2,123,000,000 gallons per day by the year 2000, which will be 2.44 times as much as in 1965. The consumption by industries will increase to 528 million gallons per day by the year 2000 which will be 2.5 times as much as in 1965.</block>

<p>The important thing about this is that I have taken the figures from this same report in respect of those regions about which hon. members are concerned. A projection to the year 2000 was then made of the water consumption in those specific parts. I find that the projection in respect of those parts indicates that the water consumption will be more than triple the present consumption. In other words, these reports foresee tremendous development for that region. Whereas the projection in respect of the entire country puts the figure at 2.45, the figure in respect of that region is more than three times as much. I can furnish the figures to hon. members (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the moment (1965) it is 25 million gallons per day. The projection is that it will be 77.5 million gallons per day in the year 2000.</block>

<p>We see therefore that it will be more than three times the present consumption, in contrast to the figure of 2.45, which is the projection for the whole country. From these figures hon. members can therefore see that attention is most definitely being given to this region.</p>

<p>But the motion of the hon. member has a second leg. I now come to the question of the development of industries in that area, which he raised. The hon. member for Green Point quoted from a speech I recently made at Heilbron in which I said that every town and every region were not industrial areas just as every town and every region could not be a gold mining region. But each has its own potential and has the right to develop that potential. It is correct that I said that. But I want to draw his attention to the fact had I placed the emphasis on local initiative throughout. It is for local initiative to develop the natural resources in the first place. It is not the primary task of the authorities to set development in motion. The primary task of the authorities is the establishment of an infra-structure only. That is all. But the real initiative should preferably come from the private sector. This we must always bear in mind in dealing with this matter. The hon. member for Karoo proceeded from the premise that the Government was to establish and start industries in that area. This is not the Government&#x2019;s task.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made special reference to the processing of iron ore in those areas. It is true that the largest deposits of iron ore in South Africa are to be found in that area. As the hon. member for Gordonia has already mentioned the iron ore deposits in that area are estimated at 5,000 million tons, and the deposits of manganese ore at 1,000 million tons. These are two very important metals for the development of the steel industry. The hon. member then said that he was not advancing a plea for the establishment of a steel factory there, but that he nevertheless wanted to draw attention to this matter. That is how I understood him. I take it that he wants consideration to be given to the question whether the third Iscor can be established in that area. I think that is what he meant. I want to say at once that that area along with other areas are being considered for the establishment of a third Iscor in South Africa. That region has certain advantages as regards the establishment of a third Iscor. That I want to concede. I have already mentioned the potential iron ore deposit of 5,000 million tons as well as the manganese ore deposit of 1,000 million tons. These are factors which contribute to the possibility of establishing a third Iscor in that area. On the other hand, however, other factors are not favourable, and these we duly have to take into account. I hope the hon. member for Gordonia too will not hold it<span class="col_2171-2172" refersTo="page_1108"/> against me when I say that not only the Northern Cape or the North-Western Cape should be seen as a whole when the State is creating an infra-structure, but that all of South Africa should be seen as a whole. When we come to the infra-structure of the country, we may not look to one region only; we must have regard to the country as a whole. Now, there are a considerable number of unfavourable factors which the State has to take into account as regards the establishment of such a steel industry in that area. Coal and coke, for example, are being mined a long way from that area and will have to be transported over long distances. This of course will make the manufacture of steel in that area expensive. Steel is being manufactured cheaply in many countries, and in order to compete with them, we must be able to manufacture it as cheaply as possible.</p>

<p>The generation of power is another factor which has to be taken into account. At the moment we use mainly coal for the generation of power. We envisage generating power also by means of a hydro-electric scheme when the Orange River project has been completed. In addition there is the prospect of a nuclear power station here in the Western Cape. But at the moment we have to depend on coal. Consequently the generation of power for that area will be very expensive. This is a prerequisite for the establishment of a steel industry in any area. Transport is another factor; not so much the transport of the material, but the finding of markets for the processed material. All markets are situated a long way from that area. The processed material has to be exported or go to areas in our country where it can be processed further, for example, the Rand and Pretoria.</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned the decentralization of industries and the pamphlet he received in this connection, but he said that no attention had been given to this particular region. I have already drawn his attention to the fact that the permanent committee for the location of industries hopes to issue a report in April on border industry development in that specific area, which will be placed at the disposal of the Minister of Economic Affairs. Further discussions will be held subsequent to that. Therefore this matter has been receiving attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens mentioned the significance of that area to the agricultural development of South Africa. This is so. He confined himself to bush encroachment in particular. Now I want to tell him at once that in point of fact bush encroachment does not have a great deal to do with the motion we are discussing here this afternoon. He merely referred to that in passing. Perhaps the hon. member is not well informed, but I can tell him that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is combating this very effectively.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the report mentioned that. But that Department has been employing very effective methods of combating bush encroachment.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned the question of water which had to be brought to that area. This will naturally happen. He knows why the Van der Kloof-P. K. le Roux Dam is not receiving the attention at the moment which he wants it to receive. Surely he knows well enough what the reason is. There is no question of that project being shelved. The entire plan in all its phases will be carried out from time to time according to when the country can afford to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is not really much more one can say about this particular motion. I just want to bring it to the attention of hon. members once again that the entire situation of that entire region, as large as it is, including the North-Western Cape, is receiving special and serious attention from the Department of Planning. It will most definitely always receive the attention that can be devoted to it, because we have to deal with the whole of South Africa, and we cannot have regard to one region only, however important that region may be. That region has very rich natural mineral resources, but it does not have other things, such as water and power, whereas human material too is still thinly scattered. There would have been human material if the region had these other things. If water and power are too expensive, however, we simply have to mine those deposits and process the ore elsewhere. One cannot process everything at the place where it is mined if circumstances do not justify that being done. I am surprised at what the hon. member for Karoo said. He spoke here this afternoon as though we were applying a kind of colonial exploitation and as though the rest of South Africa was exploiting that area. Throughout the years when that exploitation was being done outside South Africa, the hon. member and his Party did not lift a finger. Now that we are processing those resources inside South Africa, they describe that as exploitation of that part by the rest of South Africa. In my opinion that was a particularly unfair remark. We must see to our fatherland as a whole and not have regard to one part only. The authorities will most definitely do their utmost to do justice to every area, just as they will do justice to this region too.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that I have received the assurance from the hon. the Minister that the Government is paying attention to this particular region of the Northern Cape. We have never doubted this either. We are very much aware that the Northern Cape expects to be given full attention. In fact, we have felt for many years that we have lagged behind in many respects and that we should receive the full attention of all bodies in order to bring about improvement and progress as regards the conditions in the Northern Cape, which we feel should already receive attention to-day.</p>

<p><span class="col_2173-2174" refersTo="page_1109"/>I do not want to deal again with the matters and the facts which were mentioned here. However, there are two important matters pertaining to the Northern Cape to which we have to pay attention and in regard to which action will have to be taken in the near future. The first is water. It is necessary that the Northern Cape region, and the farmers in particular, should be certain at this stage that they have security. In no aspect of agriculture, whether it be irrigation or stock farming, will the farmers have a secure future unless the water supply is assured. I am glad that we have the assurance, according to the information at our disposal, that we will be able to provide security to the farmers of that settlement as from next year, as progress is made with the Verwoerd Dam. We are, however, concerned because we have no certainty that the Orange River project will be carried out as announced. I want to assure you, Sir, that if the Orange River project, as originally announced, is not carried out, it will result in the farmers of the Northern Cape having no prospects in certain respects. I therefore plead that we should carry out the project as it was originally announced.</p>

<p>We do not want to discuss the manganese and ore of Postmasburg and those parts now. The hon. the Minister has furnished us with a good explanation in this regard. I may just assure you, Mr. Speaker, that there is one restrictive factor in this respect, namely the tariff on the export and conveyance of ore and manganese. The hon. the Minister made an appeal to private initiative recently. But as far as the mining and processing of iron ore and manganese is concerned, private initiative is hampered to such an extent by the transport tariff that in many cases we cannot make any progress. It is having such an adverse effect on us, on Postmasburg and those parts in particular, that some people have to be paid off. Those people are then forced to leave that region and to find employment elsewhere. It is also having an adverse effect on the population figure in our area. Transport is one of our basic problems in those parts. Everything that is transported from those parts goes in an easterly direction. Therefore, until we have roads and railways, no development can take place there. If we have transport from the south to the north, the Northern Cape will be developed. We found recently that while we were able to transport thousands of bales of lucerne to the north, we had to handle them at least eight times before they reached their destination, the place where they were to be used. Transport is therefore a vital factor. I am not insisting to-day that the next Iscor should be situated at Postmasburg or wherever. But we are sure&#x2014;and our area lays claim to it&#x2014;that if there is one place which deserve&#x2019;s it, it is the Northern Cape. We are pleading for it, not only because we should like to have it there, but also because we need it. If the Northern Cape has to cede the great potential which is available there, to other parts of the country, we shall certainly feel that we were not afforded the opportunity of making use of what we were granted.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that we in the Northern Cape are lagging very far behind as regards development. We shall be very glad if we, as a development association, can muster our resources to bring about the development of the Northern Cape and if we can receive the assurance in this connection that we have the full support of the Government and the hon. the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, firstly I would like to express my appreciation for the support given by the hon. member for Gordonia and particularly by the hon. member for Prieska. It is refreshing and heartening to know that my plea is a good one.</p>

<p>I want to comment only on one aspect and that is the siting of the new Iscor. The hon. the Minister mentioned the lack of water and the cost of bringing in coking coal. I do not want to enter into any controversy, but I want to establish, as a fact, that we had the water when this suggestion was first put forward. The dams in the upper reaches of the river have almost completely closed off the supply of water in the lower reaches of the Vaal River. The flow of water below Barkly West during the winter is to the order of 500 to 600 cusecs, which is very little. Secondly, we feel that the Van der Kloof Dam should be proceeded with without any delay and this will solve the water worry. As regards the matter of coking coal I want to say that this coal is carried all the way to Iscor from Natal. If one cares to read Iscor&#x2019;s report which came out quite recently, one will find, that all their coking coal comes from Natal. It goes to Pretoria and to Vanderbijlpark. Even if it did not, there are new methods of manufacturing steel, namely by the use of electricity and basic oxygen furnaces. We have a fine supply of power in the area in question and the Escom people have done a magnificent job. Having established these facts, I want to say in conclusion that I am glad to hear that there is going to be a report in April in regard to the possibility of industries. The hon. the Minister must not get me wrong. I say that the Government must sponsor industry and that we want one good sponsored State industry to give encouragement to other people and to counter the disabilities with which that part of the country suffers. I take no exception to remarks made at me as to the way or style in which I have introduced the motion or to the accusation that I always bring this up. I feel very strongly on this matter and I believe that I symbolize the feeling of the people in that part of the country and I do hope the hon. the Minister will accept it in that spirit. Having said this, and having had a very good discussion and considering the fact that the matter has been ventilated and that we, as well as others, have learnt a lot, I would now like, with the permission of the House, to withdraw my motion.</p>

<p>With leave, motion withdrawn.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>When this debate was adjourned on Wednesday afternoon, I had just started off by saying a few words in connection with the death of Mr. Hugo, and on behalf of the Opposition I welcomed Mr. Kruger in the important position he is occupying now. I had also put a question to the hon. the Minister in connection with one aspect of the pension proposals submitted to us by him in his Budget speech. I was concerned about the fact that the increase of 2 per cent per annum would continue to apply for 20 years only and an many cases would cease at a stage when these people were really old and decrepit and in need of special care. The Minister then said by way of interjection, if I understood him correctly, that we could consider the matter during the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I understood the hon. the Minister to have said that he would consider the matter during the Committee Stage, and I wondered whether the Minister would move the necessary amendment. I want to address a very serious plea to the Minister to reconsider this matter. One realizes that a ceiling has to be placed on a concession like this sooner or later, but people who retire on pension are elderly people in most cases, and humanly speaking very few of them are going to live for more than 20 years after their retirement. Why discontinue this concession at a time of their life when they will need it more than at any other time of their life? I sincerely hope the hon. the Minister will give this bis consideration. This also affects another case. It also affects people who retired on a very small pension because of ill-health or indisposition; they had to retire from the service prematurely and consequently their pensions are small. Now it will be their experience that this increase will be discontinued after a period of 20 years in spite of the rising cost of living. They may still live for a short while and suffer real hardship. It would have been possible for me to agree whole-heartedly with the Minister and say the period could be under 20 years if the Minister, as a member of the Cabinet, could give us the assurance that it would be the policy of the Government, and that the Government would implement that policy, to arrest the depreciation, the erosion, of our money in South Africa. If we can have the assurance from the Government that the value of the rand will remain stable, we shall not plead for something like this. But the Minister knows as well as I do what the position is. It is not only this Government; virtually all Governments in the Western world to-day follow an economic policy of which a gradual depreciation in the purchasing power of money forms part and parcel. Seeing that the Minister knows this and that we all know this, why impose this penalty on deserving people? The Minister feels he has to come to their assistance, but he announces that he will stop this assistance at a time when they will need it most. I sincerely hope the Minister will give further consideration to this matter.</p>

<p>Before coming to the real point of the amendment we want to move from Opposition side to the Budget proposals of the hon. the Minister, I should like to discuss a few matters of a general nature with the Minister and I should like to have his reaction to them. One is the striking and increasing dependence of the Railways as such on other divisions of the South African state transport organization. I see that in 1968-&#x2019;69 the Railways budgeted for expenditure amounting to R701,519,000 and revenue amounting to R671,369,000, i.e. for a net shortfall of R30 million. For the new year, 1969-&#x2019;70, the Minister is budgeting for expenditure amounting to approximately R736 million and revenue amounting to R686.5 million, in other words, for a shortfall of not R30 million but of R49 million on the Railways for the next year. Yet the Minister is budgeting for a shortfall of approximately R5 million in his total budget; the extra money being derived from other transport services. This year the harbours will provide a surplus of R15 million and the Minister estimates that the amount will be R18 million next year. This year the Airways will provide R4 million of this revenue in excess of expenditure, and next year it will provide R8 million. The pipeline will yield a surplus of R20 million this year<span class="col_2177-2178" refersTo="page_1111"/> and a surplus of R40 million next year, nearly as much as the total shortfall of the railway service for the whole country, and this will be provided by the population concentrated in the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging triangle. I want to say that there may be merit in subsidizing the cheap tariff goods from the other services, such as the Airways or the Harbours, where the money is derived from the entire population. But I can find no justification in the motorists of a small part of South Africa, namely Pretoria, the Witwatersrand and Vereeniging, subsidizing the rest of the public of South Africa to the tune of R40 million per annum as far as their transport costs are concerned. This simply cannot be justified. It is not even the general public that is doing so, but only the motorists. We all know that if part of these transport costs could be borne generally, that would mean a decrease in the cost of living for the entire South Africa. But this thing he refused to do for years, this thing which he said would be uneconomic, foolish and short-sighted, the Minister is now employing at the expense of his own voters in order to cover up the inefficiency of his administration in other fields. But the day of reckoning will come, and I think the day is fast approaching when the motorists of South Africa will say that this exploitation, this discrimination, this unfair and unjust treatment cannot be maintained and cannot be justified.</p>

<p>Another matter is this. I think the hon. the Minister should tell us what he and the Administration intend doing as regards the large revenue which the Railways at present derives from the transport of iron ore, manganese ore, and other ores. As the hon. the Minister knows, there is a danger that the export of ore may be curtailed as we can no longer compete with our international competitors. We see from the information supplied to us by the Minister that the revenue derived by the Railways from the transport of ore from April to December amounted to R3.9 million. We see that last year South Africa sold ore to the value of R25.5 million to Japan. We see that 3&#x00BC; million tons of ore were exported through Port Elizabeth and Louren&#x04AB;o Marques and more than 50 per cent of that tonnage probably was pig-iron. As I have said, Chile, and Australia in particular, can now supply this ore more cheaply to Japan than South Africa can do. We have already lost a large part of that market; we shall lose it as from April and what we have retained is almost negligible. We have only retained that because a large organization such as Iscor decreased its price, to use its own words, &#x201C;in disregard of commercial considerations&#x201D; to such an extent that it could compete to some extent with countries like Australia and Chile. I want to say at once that the Railways assisted in making our ore more competitive, but not sufficiently so. The Railways decreased the loading and handling costs of this ore from 84c to 64c per ton. Overtime charges were decreased from 12c to 6c and a daily working cycle of 24 hours was introduced in our harbours in order to allow of loading operations being continued throughout the day and night. The Minister told us of the spectacular results achieved with the introduction of new trucks which brought about a reduction of up to 1,300 trains per annum. All of this is very important, but the price of our ore nevertheless remains from 15 to 20 per cent higher than that at which it can be supplied to Japan by Australia. It has already been suggested that some of the ore be conveyed by pipeline so as to enable us, especially since our country is so dry, to make use of water transport. We are very pleased to see that a Bill was passed earlier on this Session to make provision for the conveyance of ore and other solid materials by means of a pipeline. The hon. the Deputy Minister was somewhat shy, he did not want to tell us whether it was the intention that solid material should be conveyed in that way from Sishen and those areas. He did not want to reply to our questions in regard to the provision of water in those areas. Perhaps the Minister will be less reserved, perhaps he will give us more information so as to enable us to form some idea of the amount that can possibly be saved on the costs of ore which we supply to Japan in particular in order to meet the competition of our new competitors.</p>

<p>To me it seems, and I should like to see the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to this, as though steps will also have to be taken to make it possible to accommodate and load large ships of from 100,000 to 200,000 tons in our harbours. Perhaps it will also be necessary to consider a direct decrease in the rail tariff in respect of this ore in order to maintain our important market in Japan. The Minister should not tell me that one day it will be possible to load these large ships at Richard&#x2019;s Bay, because time is running out. According to Japanese sources our export to Japan has already, decreased to a maximum of approximately 400,000 tons per annum. This is much lower than the tremendous tonnages we exported during the past few years. The danger is that once one has had to relinquish such a market to one&#x2019;s competitors, it will not be such an easy matter to regain that market. The Minister should tell us what can be done soonnest for making it possible to load large ships, for example. It is estimated that with large ships as much as R1.50 per ton can be saved on transport costs between South Africa and Japan.</p>

<p>The next matter of general interest which I want to discuss with the Minister, is something I raised during the debate on the Railways Bill we dealt with earlier on this Session. This is the complete inadequacy, meaninglessness and uselessness of certain speculations of the Railways and Harbours Board, of which the Minister is Chairman, in connection with the costs of new works to be undertaken by the Railways. The case in question, as hon. members will remember, was the Vryheid-Empangeni line, which, according to the Additional Estimates of 1965-&#x2019;66 would have cost R40 million, and which was increased by more than R3&#x2153;<span class="col_2179-2180" refersTo="page_1112"/> million to R43,375,000 in the Brown Book of the following year. The very next year it was again increased by just over R2&#x00BC; million to R45,600,000. This year it is again being increased in the Brown Book by as much as an additional R29 million. Now the costs will not amount to the original R40 million which Parliament was asked to vote and on the basis of which Parliament had to judge the plan, but will be R74,759,360. This is nearly double the original amount. From the Deputy Minister we had an attempt at explaining this complete miscalculation. It was totally unsatisfactory.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Is this the correct amount now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No. The Railways and Harbours Board warns us that this still is a guess. We must not think that this will be the final and correct amount. There are various excuses. Now suddenly the terrain is so difficult. But the most important factor with regard to the construction of a new railway line surely is the nature of the terrain. It must be ascertained whether the terrain is mountainous, whether there are many rivers or sandy flats. Now the excuse is, after they have asked us to vote R40 million, R43 million the next year and R45 million the year after, that they actually did not know the nature of the terrain over which the railway line was to be constructed. Now suddenly, after they have added these three amounts, they discover that they have to ask for an additional R29 million. They cannot tell us where it is going to end. They can only say, &#x201C;This is not the end yet&#x201D;. This really is a shocking state of affairs. How can the hon. the Minister estimate what the economic Yield of the construction of such a railway line will be if after three years he is already R34 million out on his original estimate of R40 million, and has to warn us that he has possibly made even larger errors, as the future will prove? This is not the only case. I am merely mentioning a case here and there. There is the Bantu line which is being constructed from Reunion to Umlazi. The original amount asked for in 1964-&#x2019;65 was R4.900.000. This amount was increased every year and is now in the vicinity of R6 million, an increase of 14 per cent. Then there is the line from Merebank to Chatsworth for the Indians in Natal. We were asked for R5,200,000 in the Brown Book of 1964-&#x2019;65. For three years they stayed at that amount of R5,200.000, which remained virtually constant. Only three years later we were asked for an additional R147,000. This we forgive. This we can understand. The next year they asked us for an additional R28,000, and this we also forgive. This we can understand. And now, in the new year 1969-&#x2019;70, they ask us for an additional R2,824,486. Now the amount no longer is R5 million, it is R8 million, an increase of nearly 60 per cent. What has been happening in the course of these five years that they only have to discover at the end of it that they were nearly 60 per cent out in their calculations? Nobody can tell me that the terrain is so impossible in this case. It practically is a suburban line. Then there is the line from Metsi to Kaapmuiden, where the terrain is in fact a little more difficult. In the Additional Estimates for 1965-&#x2019;66 we were asked as hastily as could be for R9,130,000. The following year we were asked to vote a further amount of R7&#x00BC; million, the year after that we were asked for a further amount of R1,130,000 and in the next year for another small amount, and the amount of R9,130,000 soared to R17,539,061. Mr. Speaker, surely it is meaningless and surely it is not worth the trouble and unjustified to come to Parliament to ask us to support the hon. the Minister in connection with decisions to construct new railway lines if the facts and the calculations on which we are asked to base our judgment are completely valueless. This can only be attributed to negligence. If there were only one or two cases, one could still have understood it.</p>

<p>In this connection, Mr. Speaker, I should like to mention a few further examples. I now refer you to Annexures D and subsequently E of the Reports of the Controller and Auditor-General on the Railways and to the Brown Books for the years concerned. Reference is made in these documents to the Metsi-Kaapmuiden railway line. In 1965-&#x2019;66 an amount of R100 was asked for. This was merely for starting the work and was very reasonable. Although R35,000 was spent in that year, we have no objection to that, because we have to accept that the amount of R35.000 was used for planning the work properly. The next year we were asked not for an amount of R100 but for an amount of R750.000. But, Mr. Speaker, so well had the matter been planned that the Controller and Auditor-General informed us that in that year, although Parliament had had every confidence in the hon. the Minister and his Board&#x2014;because we believe him when he comes to us with his requests&#x2014;the Railways did not use R684.709 of that amount of R750,000. But you should not think that they were discouraged, Mr. Speaker, because these are determined men. For the past financial year, 1967-&#x2019;68, the hon. the Minister asked for R4 million. Now they were going to show us and now they were going to pull up their socks. Now we have to learn, however, that of that amount of R4 million they did not touch R3,314,500. What is going on with the administration of the Railways? What is one to think of something like this? I can mention many other cases. There is, for example, the Vryheid Sikaine line. In the Additional Estimates of 1965-&#x2019;66 we were asked for R100. Not one cent of this R100 was spent. That did not prevent them, however, from asking for R750.000 the following year. But later they returned and told us, &#x201C;Thank you for the R750,000, but of that amount we have been unable to spend R658,541&#x201D;. Why then did they ask us for that money? Without any regret they asked not for R750,000 which they could not spend, but for R3 million the following<span class="col_2181-2182" refersTo="page_1113"/> year, i.e. 1967-&#x2019;68. Apparently they had taken new courage by that time. They then returned and said that they had been unable to spend R2,661,848 of that R3 million. Mr. Speaker, surely such things have no meaning and are a waste of time. Surely it is inefficient and incompetent and completely meaningless to come to Parliament with such requests. It is just like apartheid. Big figures and big promises, but nothing is being done. The only thing which now remains is for the hon. the Minister to stake his political reputation on spending the money by 1978. [Laughter.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, numbers do not count and money probably does not count either. Mr. Speaker, in this regard Parliament as well as the nation is entitled to expect an improvement, and that the Minister, as Chairman of the Railways Board, will pull up his socks and at the same time will not be too proud to bend down and pull up the socks of the commissioners as well. This whole matter compels one to ask what is going on as regards the planning of the Railways and to what extent one can depend on the expectations of the Minister with regard to future developments. What is one to expect in that regard in the light of the cases I have mentioned here where their planning resulted in a complete fiasco? In connection with these cases I have no sympathy whatsoever with the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>But now I come to another problem, one in respect of which I do have sympathy with the Minister. One becomes even more concerned about planning on the Railways when one considers the manpower position, something for which the Minister is not, of course, responsible in the first place. This is a countrywide problem, one which hits every sector of our economy, the Railways possibly harder than many other sectors. The Minister himself expressed his concern about this state of affairs on more than one occasion. Also in his Budget speech of last Wednesday he said that the staff position was causing serious concern. As a matter of fact, he saw it as a virtually incurable ailment with which one would have to learn to live. How serious is this matter in fact? The Assistant-General Manager (Staff), Mr. Botha, told a meeting of Railway trade unions in September last year that there was a shortage of 15 per cent in white railway staff, and that approximately 3,000 people were working on the Railways who ought not to be there. They were not competent enough, they did not have the qualifications to do the jobs in which they had been appointed. But, he said, the shortage of staff on the Railways was so acute that even unqualified and incapable people had to be appointed in an attempt to get the work done. We have been told that the traffic increased in ton-miles every year. I have checked what the position is and I have found that 23,100 million tonmiles were covered in 1960 and 34,091 million in 1968. In this respect the average annual increase is more than 5 per cent per annum. But the number of staff, on the other hand, remains more or less constant. As a matter of fact, the number of staff in key positions, positions related to the running of trains, is decreasing. An official of the Railways pointed out that the decrease in these key positions had been taking place at a rate of nearly 4 per cent per annum over the past six years. The System Manager at Bloemfontein said there were vancancies for 300 drivers, firemen, electricians, loading staff and guards on the Orange Free State System. In a speech of 14th June, 1968, he admitted that goods traffic in South Africa was seriously being delayed because of the serious shortage of manpower. He said he was pleased that he was able to say that passengers had not yet been inconvenienced by that. This speech of his revealed an extremely serious state of affairs, and the Minister will not be able to deny this. Of course, the Administration is doing its best to meet this shortage, and it is not doing so without success either. One the one hand it is doing so by urging the existing staff on to greater productivity. On the other hand it is mechanizing where possible and buying more effective rolling stock. This is part of the Administration&#x2019;s endeavours to bring about greater productivity. By means of salary adjustments the Administration is providing incentives to the workers to be more productive. These are all laudable steps.</p>

<p>But the most important means being employed by the railways, air services and harbours to meet this shortage, is overwork. On a previous occasion the Minister told us that he knew what it was to work overtime because he too had to spend from 12 to 16 hours on a locomotive. But how often did that happen? In his time something like that was an exception. To-day, however, it is general practice. As a matter of fact, the Railways is being kept going only by continuous, excessive overwork. Over the week-end my friend, the hon. member for Hillbrow, and a journalist of <i>The Sunday Times</i> made an analysis of the position. Their findings are particularly interesting. It is estimated that R68 million will be spent on overtime during the financial year 1969-&#x2019;70&#x2014;an increase of R17 million, or nearly 25 per cent; 14 per cent of the total wage bill of the Railways consists of overtime.</p>

<p>Will you suggest that it be abolished?</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if one cannot expect intelligence from the hon. member, then at least a sense of responsibility. I am speaking of excessive overwork and as far as that is concerned, I suggest that it be abolished, not only on the Railways, but everywhere where people have to work to make a living. I hope that satisfies the hon. member. Is the hon. member in favour of excessive overtime? One does not know, of course, what<span class="col_2183-2184" refersTo="page_1114"/> the long-term answer to this extremely difficult problem is, not as long as the Minister accepts that we have to struggle along under our present system of labour and wants us to accept that this shortage of labour is a chronic disease which we must just accept and learn to live with. But according to announcements of the Government itself the economy in South Africa cannot continue to grow as it did in the past while the manpower position remains as acute as it is at present. In debates in this House reference has already been made to the economic development programme recently announced by the Department of Planning. It was pointed out that if we wanted to maintain our rate of growth at 5&#x00BD; per cent per annum, the demand for White and non-White labour would increase more rapidly than the supply, would exceed the available manpower in South Africa. This is a deadly and inescapable fact, i.e. if we want to maintain a rate of growth of 5&#x00BD; per cent, the demand for labour, White as well as non-White, will exceed the available manpower in South Africa. The Department of Planning estimates that, as far as Whites are concerned, the demand will exceed the supply by 28,000 by 1973 if we can succeed in regularly bringing 20,000 economically active immigrants to this country per annum. The Department of Planning admits that we do not have the manpower. It is inconceivable that we shall acquire the necessary manpower to maintain a rate of growth of 5&#x00BD; per cent per annum. Even if it would have been possible for us to accelerate our rate of immigration to 30,000 economically active people per annum, we shall still have a shortage of 30,000 workers in five or six years&#x2019; time.</p>

<p>Now I want to ask what the Minister&#x2019;s policy is in this connection? Does he really believe that he will succeed in meeting the requirements of transport in South Africa by means of mechanization, by means of salary adjustments, by means of increased demands as regards productivity? Does he think that he will be able to do so without something drastic being done in this connection?</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The overtime payments to which I referred, are only made to a section of the staff. As far as I know, there is no estimate of the demands made on individuals, and on specific groups in this connection. Does the hon. Minister perhaps have this information? Can the Minister prove by giving chapter and verse that no excessive demands are being made on railwaymen in the case of individuals and in the case of specific groups? There are many Railway workers, of course, who welcome overtime because of the higher standard of living overtime enables them to maintain. There are many others who disapprove of overtime; there are many men who tell us that their family life as well as their health is suffering because of overtime. The point I want to make, however, is that there are many of them who permanently adopt their way of life to the increased income they receive as a result of this overtime work, and if things ever were to be different, it would be extremely difficult for them to adapt themselves to a lower income. What concerns one is the human aspect and the problem this is going to create for the Railways. The human aspect is that family life is in fact being neglected; we come across this wherever we come into contact with railwaymen. We know that people are being overtaxed; that they become too exhausted to do their work properly, that there is no way out for them as the Railways will come to a standstill if they do not constantly give more and more of themselves to the Railways. Many of them are loyal servants of the Railways and they are constantly giving more and more of themselves than what the Minister has the right to expect of people. Sir, I am concerned. What are the future plans of the Minister? He comes to Parliament and asks us to vote money. It is true that he does not always spend the money. But we have to vote money for large future extensions. Where is the Minister going to find the manpower to cope with these extensions? We learnt of ten new Boeing aircraft which are being purchased. Some of them are of the new type, the 723 or rather the 737, for which people have to be retrained.</p>

<p>The Government of the Minister taught me that numbers do not count. The number does not count, Sir; what does count is that new types of Boeings will be put into operation before long, which will necessitate the retraining of people, the creation of new simulations of flying conditions and the training of new manpower. At present the hon. the Minister has difficulty with the maintenance of the aircraft he already has. There is dissatisfaction amongst the technical staff because excessive demands are being made on them, and the Minister knows as well as I do that the letter of the law is not being carried out as regards the maintenance of aircraft, because there is not the necessary manpower to do so.</p>

<p>It is true. It is only by telescoping certain tasks that the work can be done. The hon. the Minister knows that this is true. Can the hon. the Minister give us a guarantee that he will have the manpower for keeping these additional ten mighty aircraft in the air, for operating and maintaining them? Where is he going to find the manpower for doing so? He does not have the necessary manpower to do this work properly as far as the aircraft we have at present are concerned. Does he have the necessary manpower to man the new railway lines which are being constructed from Richard&#x2019;s Bay to Vryheid and in<span class="col_2185-2186" refersTo="page_1115"/> all other parts of the country properly?

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we shall come to that. If the Minister is going to have the manpower, where will it come from? It is not enough for the Minister to shake his head, with that euphoric expression on his face, and to say that he will obtain the manpower. We want to know and the nation wants to know where that manpower is going to come from. Is he going to use the hon. member for Colesberg to do shunting work? They are already using staff of the training schools of the Railways to do shunting work; they are already doing desperate things. What are they going to do to maintain this growth? Already there are serious signs that the efficiency of the Railways is suffering as a result of the manpower shortage. Although people employed on the Railways are giving more than can be humanly expected of them, the efficiency of rendered services is suffering. There are unheard of delays. Farmers are complaining about the condition in which their livestock arrive at the markets as a result of poor treatment because of the manpower shortages. Industrialists and businessmen complain about delays in the delivery of goods. Because of delays on the Railways Durban is further from Johannesburg than it ought to be or is. Because of delays on the Railways Cape Town is further from its hinterland than it ought to be.</p>

<p>I want to issue a warning to the hon. the Minister because I think it is time he is warned. The Minister as well as the rest of the Government is living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise if they think that in maintaining their present policy they will be able to do the work of South Africa properly and thoroughly and in addition guarantee the growing prosperity of our nation and the higher standard of living of our nation. This is inevitable and the Minister must have the courage to admit it. He is admitting it in his deeds. He is building houses and he is bringing in Bantu employees, something the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration will not allow private individuals to do, because he knows what the real state of affairs is in South Africa. The only thing I am asking of the hon. the Minister is that when he replies to this debate, he will stand up as a senior Minister of the Cabinet, who is responsible for one of the most important and most essential services to the people of this country, and tell us, as he did a short while ago, that he will obtain the necessary manpower for all the major plans he has for the future. But let him tell us something more; let him tell us where he is going to get those people from. Let him have regard to the warning of the Department of Planning of which I reminded him to-day, and let him tell us how that shortage is going to be supplemented. Sir, we cannot play the fool with the future of our nation. We cannot play the fool with the future standard of living of our children. And I am accusing the Government, the Minister of Transport, to be specific, that they are doing so unless they have the courage to speak up and tell us what they can do; we shall help; we shall co-operate, because the future of all of us is dependent on that. But how can we co-operate? How can we do something for the future of South Africa if we have a Government that deliberately closes its eyes to the truth, if we have a Government that ignores the realities in South Africa for the sake of shibboleths and slogans and obsolete philosophies and obsolete propaganda maxims, and does not really want to tell us what is going to be done in order to meet the requirements of the economy of South Africa so that we may proceed to make of South Africa a country with a rising standard of living which will constantly yield richer harvests for its people?</p>

<p>In order to draw specific attention to this overriding problem facing the S.A. Railways, I should like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House refuses to pass the Second Reading of the Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill unless and until the Government gives satisfactory assurances that the excessive overtime worked by the staff of the South African Railways and Harbours and Airways and the strains to which that staff are subjected because of the chronic shortage of manpower will not injure their health and impair their wellbeing, and that the shortage will not lead to continued inefficient services to various sectors of the South African economy&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I should like at the outset to associate myself whole-heartedly with the tribute which the hon. the Minister paid here to the memory of the late Mr. Johan Hugo, our former General Manager. The memory and the message of this outstanding and capable personality will remain a source of great strength and inspiration to us who had the privilege of getting to know him personally and at first hand. I should also like to confirm the friendly words of welcome and best wishes to his successor, Mr. Kruger. My wishes to him are also strength and prosperity on the road ahead, also to those who, together with him, were promoted to high positions.</p>

<p>We listened here this afternoon to a tirade which poured forth from the lips of the main critic of the Opposition, a tirade so disjointed and compiled to such an extent from bits and pieces of inconsequential sub-divisions of the Estimates as I have never heard in my life before. This compels one to describe the hon.<span class="col_2187-2188" refersTo="page_1116"/> member with two adjectives and one noun, namely the &#x201C;dramatic, nonsensical orator&#x201D; of the United Party. This hon. member is still standing on a political platform to address, according to his own norms (between parenthesis) an uninformed political audience, and hence the blatant anomalies, misplaced deductions, and unrelated particulars which we heard here this afternoon. Let me now refer to a few of them. On 9th March, 1964, the hon. member had the following to say, according to Hansard (Vol. 10) column 2650)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a period which is still very fresh in our memories and during which, because of lack of vision &#x2026;</block>

<p>We heard the same tirade here this afternoon, I can even hum it to myself as I stroll through the Botanical Gardens here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; because of a tendency to ridicule the plans of the preceding United Party Government, the Government failed to allow the Railways to develop as fast as one might have expected in an expanding economy during a period of prosperity.</block>

<p>We heard it again this afternoon. The hon. member went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We find only too frequently that Railway development does not keep pace with the development of this country.</block>

<p>These are old left-overs which were dished up again here this afternoon. He then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Railways never keep ahead of that development.</block>

<p>Please note, the Railways must keep ahead of the development in this country. In other words, there must be thousands of waggons and locomotives and scores of Boeings standing unutilized. The harbours have to work at half capacity in a time of manpower shortage. Now I am saying to the intelligent United Party voters in this country: &#x201C;Just imagine! This is the main critic on Railway matters of that Party in this House.&#x201D; What the hon. member said in 1959 is also interesting, particularly when seen against the background of his statement made five years previously. This is what he then had to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every year the Minister of Finance deliberately over-taxes the population of South Africa, as it has recently done, to the tune of approximately R50 million in one year, principally to supply the capital requirements of the Railways.</block>

<p>On the one hand the Railways have too many capital requirements and cannot adapt to changing circumstances, and on the other hand the Government is being reproached because it dares to make it possible for the Administration to meet these requirements. There you have it. This hon. member wants the South African Railways to keep ahead of development, but without tariff increases and capital provision from other sources. Believe me, Sir, he wastes the time of this House when he expects a Minister of the State to react to his requests and in particular to his nonsensical remarks. It is this same main critic who said of the figures and the Estimates of the hon. the Minister that they were uncalculable, that nobody could depend on them and that they were not worth the trouble of submitting to this House. This was also the main critic who had the new unexpected pension concessions for Railway officials announced by his mouthpiece, the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> in the following way: &#x201C;Why be petty to pensioners?&#x201D; Why be petty to pensioners? The increased bonus and concessions were not the most important thing, he said, the main thing was the time limit of 20 years. That is all he had to say about that. He is negative and wants to be destructive. He wants to sow suspicion. He wants to detract from the value of that concession. That is his motive. Both the announcement of improved pensions as well as the estimates in the Budget are &#x201C;petty&#x201D; and &#x201C;minor&#x201D;, according to the hon. member, but these are put between quotation marks. What do other authorities say about both these matters, and this time without the quotation marks? Mr. Manchip, chairman of the Railway Pensioners Association, was quoted as follows in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 6th March&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The chairman and executive committee of the S.A. Railways Pensioners Association expressed appreciation to the Minister of Transport, Mr. Schoeman, and the General Manager of Railways, Mr. J. Kruger, for the improvements in railwaymen&#x2019;s pensions which the Minister announced in his Budget Speech yesterday.</block>

<p>Professor Verburgh of the Rand Afrikaans University states (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although the Railways Budget is introduced independently of the General Budget, it can be said that this year the Railway Budget fits in exceptionally well with the general national policy of combating inflation &#x2026; interesting news was the fact that specially equipped trains were going to be built for the transportation of motor vehicles. The Minister also mentioned that a market research organization had been established in the Railways Administration.</block>

<p>To me these sound like adjustments, and quite modern ones at that.</p>

<block name="quote">All in all a budget which justifies the confidence that the Railways will also in the coming year, have to keep the wheels of the South African economy running smoothly.</block>

<p>These persons are authorities in this field, and not people with a laymen&#x2019;s insight. <i>The Argus</i><span class="col_2189-2190" refersTo="page_1117"/> of 6th March, 1969, another mouthpiece of the hon. member, stated in its leader article&#x2014;</p>

<p>Wait a minute. It continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a reassuring sign that the Minister of Transport&#x2019;s annual Budget, like most of his trains, runs smoothly, safely and with regularity. Mr. Schoeman is to be congratulated too for being a good administrator. He has streamlined his organization to a point where more work is being done by fewer men.</block>

<p>He is hopeless! He is the man who must state where he is going to get the manpower from! We learn here that he has succeeded, during the past decade when we were hearing more such Jeremiads here, in building up a streamlined organization&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Best of all about the Minister&#x2019;s Budget, however, is the granting of increased pensions to employees and ex-Railwaymen.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, here we have the opinions of people who can be regarded as authorities in this field, and besides these opinions there are many more. According to the survey which we made, a disquieting one for the United Party, there is a great deal more criticism and expressions of praise out of their own ranks in periodicals and newspapers. We want to add here that only one out of 45 of these comments which we went into was negative. You see, therefore, Mr. Speaker, how uninformed the leaders of this party in this House are, and how they are still labouring under an illusion about their strength as a party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, coming to this &#x201C;pettiness&#x201D; of the Administration to the pensioners, I should like to emphasize the following facts by means of figures. A senior clerk who retired on 31st March, 1949, received a gross annuity of R784.20. After 1st April, 1969, he will receive an annuity of R1,410.12. That is an increase of R625.82, and if he is a married person he still receives an additional special allowance of R35. This amount is almost double, and is now being termed a &#x201C;petty&#x201D; act, and an act, which according to the hon. member testifies to pettiness on the part of the hon. the Minister and his Administration. Mr. Speaker, so adverse is the commentary which we have heard in this connection and such a flagrant lack of recognition for what ought in general to be welcomed and is also being welcomed by pensioners and former officials of the Railways, that it is so cowardly that it calls for no further comment from me. Mr. Speaker, as far as the time limit of 20 years is concerned, about which such a fuss has been made, it is nevertheless a commonplace and general knowledge that the hon. Minister can, as in the past, amend such an arrangement at any time. In fact, he will have the right, if he wants to do so, to announce amendments in this connection in his reply to this Second-Reading debate. It is not, and will never be the main point, but what remains the main point is the benefits which pensioners are receiving as the result of this new accommodating arrangement by the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to proceed and make certain observations in regard to the so-called poor estimate by the hon. Minister. This is also an old tirade and one which we have to listen to year after year in this House. When it is not being made by the chief critic on that side of the House it is being made by his supporters. Before proceeding to this, however, I want to inform the House that in the business world outside it is generally accepted that a difference either way of 5 per cent on an annual estimate is accepted as excellent, whereas a difference of 2 per cent or less is regarded as a 100 per cent estimate. We had to learn here that it does not help us when the hon. the Minister submits his estimate and his Budget figures, since we cannot attach any value to them. But what are the facts in this connection? What is the real state of affairs as far as the Railways Budget is concerned? I hope and trust that we are going to settle, once and for all, this ten-year-old debating point, and that these amateur announcements by the Opposition in that regard will also cease for good. What do we find? Over a period of five years from 1963-&#x2019;64 up to the latest, the revenue estimates of the Minister and his Department have shown an average difference of only 3.29 per cent. The estimate of expenditure showed a difference of 3.038 per cent. This is much more than excellent, because it is much less than 5 per cent. On the joint estimate, i.e. of revenue and expenditure, which amounted to billions of rands, the difference was only 3.14 per cent. These people want to apply the norms which they apply to fish and chip shops to this national undertaking, and do so in the unfortunate and misplaced way they did this afternoon. In terms of the norms of the business world in general, the estimates of the Railways over the past five years have been acknowledged and confirmed as varying between excellent and 100 per cent. Nevertheless, the hon. member has the temerity to state here in the House that it is not even worth bothering about or considering it. I take it amiss of him for underestimating the intelligence of the members of this House, as well as those of his own supporters outside in such a flagrant way. I also want to tell him and his supporters that the days of the &#x201C;railway worker&#x201D; of the United Party ended almost a half-century ago and that this transport undertaking to-day is being managed by the finest and most efficient manpower South Africa has to offer. So, stop making these uncalled for and insulting suggestions.</p>

<p>This brings me to the argument in connection with overtime and the disgraceful suggestion<span class="col_2191-2192" refersTo="page_1118"/> of the mortal danger which it may imply for the public. As the hon. Minister has also stated on repeated occasions, it is generally accepted that the manpower position has become a long-term problem in this country. In order to deal with such possibilities, adjustments and precautions are being universally taken to prevent production from becoming unnecessarily entangled. The same applies to the Railways. Since it is a national problem one deplores the cynical and intimidating presentation thereof by hon. members on that side of the House. What do we find when we analyse the statistics in this regard? We find that during the past five years there have been two general wage increases, one of R35 million in 1965 and one of R33 million in 1968. These of course went hand in hand with a corresponding adjustment to the overtime scale. These facts the hon. member for Yeoville as well as the hon. member for Hillbrow, to whose article the former referred us and which he recommended we should read, conveniently omitted to mention.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if it is taken into account that the staff decreased in this same period of five years by plus-minus 3,000, then that is no indication of any abnormal disturbance. Now one must ask oneself the question as to whether the hon. member for Hillbrow does not perhaps need a refresher course in arithmetic. He has a mania, an obsession for such extramural courses, and I would recommend to both him and the hon. member for Yeoville to come forward at the very next opportunity with a motion to the effect that an elementary introductory course should be given to the members of the Opposition in regard to political criticism in this House&#x2014;the methodology of criticism, criticism which is constructive, criticism which contains positive suggestions, and criticism which, in particular does not prejudice the good name of the State and this Republic. I think that this can be exploited very beneficially by leaders on that side of the House. In regard to this dramatic presentation of overtime, the over-exertion of officials and the training courses, I read the following in an article by the hon. member for Hillbrow&#x2014;</p>

<p>They want the sluices in the Railways to be opened up for Bantu replacement labour. That is the sting&#x2014;now the hon. member can cry &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D; again&#x2014;and that is the concealed motive behind this entire debate. But of course this they cannot reveal. They want to hunt with the hounds and run with the hares. During the past decade the Administration has already made preparations, in regard to the staff shortages, for making certain provision and utilizing auxiliary measures. I am mentioning a few of them, <i>inter alia,</i> by means of automation, mechanization, by making use of O and M studies. By these means it is possible to do more work with less staff. In addition, computers are being used for accounting purposes&#x2014;such as the drawing up of pay-sheets, expenditure and calculations. These are also being used to make scientific calculations in regard to, for example, the determination of the running characteristics of passenger coaches, the rapid analysis of the operation of communication equipment and the utilization of mechanical equipment for the maintenance of railway lines. This has, apart from the advantage of economizing on staff, the added advantage that the work is being carried out more rapidly, more efficiently and with greater precision, which in its turn ensures an improved track surface. The present-day improved train control systems which are in operation on certain sections, and the centralized traffic control systems, ensures that the capacity of the sections concerned are being considerably increased. There have been covert references to trains in Cape Town and Durban running late, and the farmers complaining that their cattle are not being delivered in time or in good condition. What are the facts? Mr. Speaker, I object to this totally misleading remark. It is unfair and unjustified. The results of this centralized traffic control have already been measured as far as time saving is concerned. I am mentioning two examples to you. Here is a comparison which illustrates the running times of trains before and after the introduction of the centralized traffic control system. The running time of trains between Newcastle and Volksrust was two hours 29 minutes before the introduction of this service. This has been reduced to two hours and 11 minutes and subsequently to one hour and 47 minutes.</p>

<p>Sir, the same applies to the market garden trains from Johannesburg to Cape Town. I can mention other examples to you where time saving is taking place, examples of economizing in regard to time and costs. But it has been alleged here that the farmers are complaining that the trains are running late. Well, I would not dare to make such general statements if I could not adduce any proof of their veracity. Provision has been made for greater efficiency by modernizing supplies, by introducing more electric units. A hundred obsolete and unusable steam locomotives have been taken out of service. There has been an increase of 462 electric units and an increase of 142 diesel units. The carrying capacity of our various routes is being increased in different ways, and modern methods of train control are being applied. These are all matters and auxiliary means which are being applied by the Administration in order to solve this very important and serious problem. But, Sir, instead of thanks, instead of recognition, instead of the assistance which people have offered us in such fine<span class="col_2193-2194" refersTo="page_1119"/> words, what help did we get from the Opposition here? All help we got was cynical remarks, destructive criticism and utterances which could only arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am concluding with this observation. The Opposition&#x2019;s reaction to this brilliant Budget, this proof of an applied and a scientific approach to the problems facing the Railways, puts me in mind of an experience which I recently had in my office at Randburg. One of my voters came in &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; with clenched fists and said: &#x201C;We will fix them now; this kind of thing must stop.&#x201D; I then asked him what kind of thing must stop. His reply was: &#x201C;I am having trouble; I am a building contractor and I cannot get employees.&#x201D; I then asked him whether he had already tried to get them. He replied: &#x201C;Yes, I cannot get them.&#x201D; I then asked him: &#x201C;From what sources?&#x201D; He then indicated to me where he had tried to get employees and I then told him that he should go to the Randburg Bantu Commissioner and that man would help him. I then telephoned the Bantu Commissioner and told him that somebody had come to me to complain about employees. His reply was: &#x201C;Mr. Schoeman, yesterday I supplied a few building contractors with 100 legal Bantu employees.&#x201D; I then told the person in my office: &#x201C;Man, now I don&#x2019;t understand you at all.&#x201D; His reply to this was: &#x201C;Oom Hans, we are having great trouble.&#x201D; I then asked him what the trouble was; he replied: &#x201C;There near my work is a bluegum plantation. In that plantation there are idlers and every Friday when I pay my Bantu they try and take their weekly pay-packets from them.&#x201D; I then said to him: &#x201C;But that is a nasty business.&#x201D; To this he replied: &#x201C;Yes, it undermines the morale of our people and they are afraid.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, I hope that is not an unfair comparison, but we had a brilliant example of this to-day. On this day, which comes round once a year, the Budget day, the day on which the Minister gives an account of the Railways&#x2019; productivity and of the work which has been done over the past year, these &#x2018;&#x2018;bush idlers&#x201D; come here and they want to usurp the fruits of the labour of a very competent Minister and a very efficient staff.

I would like to associate myself with those remarks, as other members have done, and there my agreement with the hon. member for Randburg ends.

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>He made a speech, or thought he made a speech, but he made it in the wrong debate. The crux of the attack was that the Government was demanding too much of its workers, and we had no reply whatsoever to that charge. What did we have? We had a vague statement that this magnificent, brilliant Minister, had been able to meet the demands made on the Railways. I will deal with that in a moment. We had a quotation about its being an unremarkable Budget that ran smoothly like the trains, and then we had a complete misrepresentation of the statement made by the hon. member for Yeoville in connection with pettiness in regard to pensions. Sir, what the hon. member for Yeoville said was that it was petty to limit this increase to 20 years and that 20 years after retirement was the time when people needed the most help. The hon. member for Randburg got up and accused the hon. member for Yeoville of saying that the pensions were petty. He did not say anything of the sort, and if the hon. member had been listening he would have known that the hon. member for Yeoville said nothing of the sort. The hon. member for Randburg then proceeded to make the old and typical attempt to create the false impression, that the United Party&#x2019;s policy was to open the flood gates to the non-Whites. Sir, I throw that back at the hon. member with contempt. He knows our policy perfectly well, and if that is the only reply that he can make to the criticisms levelled from this side of the House then I would like to hear something better from his colleagues; otherwise this is not going to be much of a debate from the Government side.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to return to the quotation by the hon. member for Randburg that this was an unremarkable Budget. My description of it is that it is rather a pedestrian budget, except for one field. In the Brown Book on Airways there is evidence of some slight vision because provision is made for R101 million for aircraft purchases and associated matters although that<span class="col_2195-2196" refersTo="page_1120"/> provision is somewhat belated. I can still recall the stinging contempt with which the hon. the Minister accused me last year of not knowing what I was talking about when I warned him that he would have to place more orders for aircraft during the course of the year and when he contemptuously said, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know what you are talking about&#x201D;. But, Sir, what has happened this year? He has had to introduce additional estimates to make provision for the purchase of more aircraft. Except for that one bit of &#x201C;uitwaartse&#x201D; budgeting in making provision for more planes, he has failed completely to deal with the problem of the manpower needed to fly those planes. The hon. member for Yeoville dealt briefly with this question, and I want to refer to the Estimates. As far as pilots are concerned, we find that there is an apparently big increase from 68 to 105 in senior captains and an increase from six to eight in senior training captains while the number of captains remained at five but then we find that there is a drop of 38 in first officers. In other words, the total preparation for the whole of the next year, with all the new aircraft about which the hon. the Minister bragged in his Budget speech, will be a net increase of 11 pilots budgeted for over the whole year. He already has pilots on loan from Rhodesia and he is already farming out a flight to Trek. He already has a flying staff of pilots unable to cope with the demands made on them without excessive strain. Does the Minister not know that only 36 per cent of his pilots are reaching normal retirement age? But here we are asked to vote R101 million for aircraft, yet we find that when it comes to the pilots to fly them there is provision for only 11 more pilots. And when it comes to engineers, what is the position? We have an increase in the number of senior aeronautical engineers of two, and we have a decrease of two in the other grades, so we are back exactly where we started. There is no provision in this Budget for any real, significant increase in the personnel who are going to fly the greater number of planes and the greater number of flights. So even that little bit of vision in this Budget on the capital aspect is completely negatived when it comes to the personnel side. Instead we have a sombre picture, both in the Budget and in the General Manager&#x2019;s report, of staff shortages. What would happen to the S.A. Railways if we had an influenza epidemic amongst the staff? They would be brought to a standstill. This is typical of the attitude. When they want to be vaccinated against influenza, they have to pay R3.20 for the first person and then R2 for every subsequent person, and the medical aid scheme makes no contribution at all. But what would happen if they did not get themselves vaccinated and there was an influenza epidemic? The whole transport system of South Africa would stand still, because the Minister has reached the danger point where there is no margin with which to play at all. Now we are being asked in this Budget before us to approve the fact that 5,000 fewer workers over the coming year will have to carry an increased burden of 5 per cent or 6 per cent in traffic. Not only is the staff today overloaded, but we are being asked to increase that load by reducing the personnel by an additional 5,000.</p>

<p>But what is more serious is the criticism by the General Manager himself in his report in regard to the rapid turnover in recruits. It is no wonder that recruits do not stay in the Railways when you find the sort of atmosphere that exists. Despite the praise of the Chairman of the Railways Select Committee of this Budget. I say it is a budget without the vision which is called for at this time. It is a budget which fiddles with the problem. We would have expected something more imaginative from the Minister, real modernization and not playing around here and there with a few modern ideas. We would have expected a complete re-approach to the question of mechanization and modernization, an elimination of the old useless systems which are simply manpower consuming and unproductive. This is not the occasion, in this debate, to deal with the detail. We would have expected some vital announcement in regard to training programmes, and not a few bursaries here and a little bit of an increase there, but an imaginative scheme to try to improve the training basis of the railway personnel. We would have expected a streamlining of the whole staff position, to try to make a more attractive career for those who want to join the staff. What happens to-day to a matriculated youth who joins the Railways? He is thrown into the pool to stagnate and to become frustrated and after a while he gets fed up and goes into private enterprise. He does so because there is no atmosphere which makes it attractive to a person who comes in and wants to devote his life to the Railways. There is no atmosphere in that service to make him feel that here is a chance for him to work harder and to advance himself. When you talk to some pretty bright youngsters that have joined the Railways and you ask them why this is their attitude, they say: Why should I work any harder; I just have to go through the old procedure and do what I am told to do and in due course when I am old and grey, I will have gone up through the increment ladder, and I will probably be superseded anyway by somebody who is more pally with somebody higher up. You do not get the &#x201C;dryfkrag&#x201D; or determination amongst the youngsters or the desire to make a real career of it, and it is for this reason that I believe that there should be a total re-approach to the whole attitude towards staff and staff matters, to try to bring the Railways into line with a normal business concern to a far greater extent than is done today. I believe the late General Manager had some good ideas in this field and I hope his successor will follow up those ideas and not allow the staff of the Railways to become a more frustrated and a more dissatisfied group than they are.</p>

<p><span class="col_2197-2198" refersTo="page_1121"/>We have heard by way of interjection and by implication from the last speaker that there is no real dissatisfaction among the staff. Last year I moved a private member&#x2019;s motion pointing to the dissatisfaction in the Public and Railway Services, but it was pooh-poohed. Government members said this was absolute nonsense; there was no dissatisfaction. Admittedly, a little while later they increased the railway pay scales, but that was not the answer. Pay alone is not the problem. There is dissatisfaction to-day in the Railways as I believe there has never been, despite anything any hon. member opposite may say. Those complaints are growing and I think it is time that the hon. the Minister stopped hiding behind the trade unions and the staff association, and faced up to this issue. In the last year I have been into the sheds and I have talked to drivers and firemen and to ticket-examiners and conductors and to almost every grade, and it is the same story throughout.</p>

<p>There is rumbling and grumbling dissatisfaction at almost every level. Station masters, clerks, tally clerks, casuals, temporary staff&#x2014;I do not think there can be half-a-dozen people I have spoken to out of hundreds who have expressed anything but dissatisfaction with overall conditions. I want to test the Minister&#x2019;s complacency. I want to call upon him to institute an impartial investigation into the dissatisfaction on the Railways. I challenge him to appoint an impartial investigation body and to allow railwaymen to lay their complaints before that body. That is the test. If there is no dissatisfaction, the Minister could face such a test without anxiety. Then he would know that he could prove us wrong, that he could make monkeys out of us. I ask him to prove his claims that there is no dissatisfaction, and to prove it by an open, impartial inquiry available to all members of the Railways staff. The Minister tends to hide every year behind the staff associations and he says they are satisfied and therefore we are attacking them. I reject that claim in advance. The Minister will try to use it again; he uses it every year, but I reject it and say that even if he wants to call this an attack on the trade unions, this is the opportunity for him to prove that he is right and we are wrong. I have not the time available to deal with all the statements which have come to me over recent months and during the last year, but I have here a letter written by a lady saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a frustrated railwayman&#x2019;s wife, I am addressing this letter to you.

<p>No, by an ex-Railwayman. Here is another letter saying, &#x201C;A commission like this one is overdue already for many years&#x201D;. This followed my motion of last year calling for an inquiry. Mr. Speaker, wherever you go you find dissatisfaction, and the Minister hides behind the fact that we name individual issues. I have a thick file here of complaints. Many of these complaints I have taken to the Minister but not once have I been successful. And yet I am convinced that many of these are genuine and sincere complaints. Let me give you just a few examples, Mr. Speaker. Let me give you a few examples of the type of complaint there is amongst Railwaymen. Amongst the drivers and firemen it is basically a question of overtime, the long periods of overtime that have to be worked, and the fact that this although in theory not compulsory, is in practice compulsory, despite all the assurances of the hon. the Minister. I have equally strong assurances from drivers and firemen that if they claim their normal, legitimate rest periods, or refuse to work the overtime demanded of them, they are laid off and lose financially later on. It does not pay them, therefore, to refuse. I know of a case where a person worked 16 hours, then went off for a break but after 2&#x00BD; hours was called out again for an emergency. But he overslept and was ten minutes late. For that he was fined R12&#x2014;that is after only 21 hours at home, after 3&#x00BD; hours off duty. I know of another case where the person concerned was called out again after a four or five hours break after having worked a shift of 16 hours. He too overslept and was later than the other man. For that he was fined R18. Cases like this occur every day; hon. members can deny it as much as they like&#x2014;these cases do occur. The Minister asks why these people do not go to their respective trade unions. But these trade unions are a large organization. However, if these unions are not complaining to the Minister then, I submit, they are not doing their job, because these are real complaints and the unions have been informed about them. Drivers and firemen told me that they have submitted these complaints to their unions.</p>

<p>As I have said, I have got their names. I shall approach them and if they agree, I will let the Minister have their names. Similar complaints come from conductors and ticket examiners. Here is a complaint from supervisory staff, signed by 12 foremen supervisors and assistant-foremen. This is a complaint they submitted to their own association and in which they complain about the failure to get people to hold acting supervisory posts. They conclude&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, therefore, now appeal to you to bring this monstrosity to the notice of the powers that be for, surely, if action is not taken, the management must bear the consequences.</block>

<p>This I quote from a photostat copy of a complaint from the supervisory staff in one of the technical branches submitted to their own association. Here I have a wad of correspondence from casual, temporary and intermittent tally clerks. The hon. the Minister is aware of the complaints of these because I have been writing to him for two years. I am grateful for the improvement given recently, a week or two ago, to casual clerks. It is not as much as pensioners were given. In fact, it is a lot less than what a pensioner continuing work would get, but it is a concession to them. As far as I know, casual intermittent tally clerks have not received any benefit. I have here at least four or five letters from persons in that category.</p>

<p>There are complaints about housing. The total number of houses available to Railway personnel has dropped during the past year from 23,108 to 22,727 because of the writing off of unsuitable houses. In other words, after voting R6 million for housing there are to-day less houses available to Railwaymen than there were a year ago. In regard to loans, out of 3,864 applications only 643 were granted, the rest being turned down due to lack of money.</p>

<p>So I can go on from subject to subject. When it comes to promotion and appeals then you really get the grouses. Here I have a wad of papers dealing with only one appeal. Think of the hours and hours of manpower which have gone into the writing of all this. And then the Minister says he is quite satisfied with the system! Here is another wad of papers where, what appears to be a perfectly genuine case, was refused because the appeal was submitted too late. Here, again, the person was turned down on one occasion because of seniority and on the other occasion because of experience. In other words, one and the same person was refused promotion, each time for the opposite reason. Here is a case where, despite the Minister&#x2019;s assurances that no regulations are made retrospective, a person appealed. The reference number of the regulations relating to this person&#x2019;s case is S720K315/1. The regulation applicable at that time prescribed that he was to be told the reasons why he was regarded as unsuitable, not proficient. He then wrote and asked for the reasons but was stalled off until a new regulation was brought in and made retrospective. He was then told that in terms of this regulation he was not entitled to know the reason why he had been turned down as being unsuitable for promotion. This, then, is a case where, due to the retrospective application of a regulation this man was penalized. I took the matter up with the Minister but the Minister decided that he cannot uphold the complaint. So one can go on and quote dozens, hundreds and perhaps thousands of cases. I, for one, have certainly heard hundreds of complaints&#x2014;fines imposed on checkers. Let me stop at this point and pay tribute to those senior staff whom I have approached with individual complaints.</p>

<p>The system manager in Durban, for instance, has dealt with many matters of mine. Where I have gone to him with a problem he has investigated it, and very often he was able to assist an individual with personal problems. I pay tribute to him and to the head office. When one goes to them with an individual problem one receives courtesy and attention. All the complaints I am referring to are those<span class="col_2201-2202" refersTo="page_1123"/> that have been unsuccessful. In these cases I think it is the system that is wrong, not an individual instance. It is the system which I believe needs looking at, the system or promotions and appeal which at the moment creates a great deal of discontent. Let us look at the disciplinary system itself. Out of 464 cases 39 appeals were upheld, in 66 cases the punishment was reduced and in 11 increased. In 184 cases the board&#x2019;s finding was divided. That is out of 464 appeals during the year.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that the system is working properly, whether he is satisfied that in fact the present method of dealing with discipline and appeals against promotions is not open to a great deal of improvement. Other speakers will deal in more detail with matters which have so far been raised. Perhaps at the Committee Stage and during the Third Reading we will be able to deal with some other matters. I have here, for instance, a certain court case in which the man was found not guilty of fraud. He was prosecuted by the department because of an amount of 1-&#x00BD;-th cents which he was alleged to have fraudulently got from the Railway by saying that his train was on time when in fact it was 16 minutes early. This was a year ago. For 1-1&#x00BD;-th cents a man was tried in court and found not guilty, and it is estimated that the costs involved amounted to approximately R600, and that to try a man for an alleged fraud involving one cent. This report is not from a Sap newspaper, it is from <i>Die Beeld</i> of a year ago, or is it just as bad because it is a verligte paper? How ridiculous does this sort of thing not make the Railways look, how ridiculous does it not make the country look, when a driver of a train who was 16 minutes early fills in that he was on time, thereby implying he had worked 16 minutes more than he did in fact work, and he is then tried for fraud because he might, although he did not, defraud the Railways of 1-1&#x00BD;-th cents. Then there is an inventor threatening to sue the Government. There is also a case concerning the stop order ban of the mutual aid funds. That is also a long-standing dispute between members and the Government. These are the things that are building up and building up to create resentment. I hope more attention will be paid to these matters.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by asking the Minister, or challenging the Minister, to appoint an impartial investigation to see whether in fact we are cooking this up, whether in fact we are making a mountain out of a molehill, or whether in fact we are justified in saying that excessive demands made on the staff mean the Minister is being carried by overworked loyal members of the Railways personnel.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was enjoyable listening to the hon. member for Durban (Point), who has just resumed his seat. If I had brought along my correspondence from railway constituents, it would have made a much greater batch than his, and the letters all give evidence of gratitude. Strangely enough, all the letters from dissatisfied people are sent to that hon. member. However, I can understand that they perhaps seek out one another; perhaps he can try to unearth some problems here and there amongst people. As I said last year, the member of the House of Assembly is the barometer in terms of which one can measure whether people&#x2019;s complaints are increasing or decreasing. I have many railway people in my constituency; why do I not hear from them about those problems which the hon. member for Durban (Point) gets to hear about?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>I deal with every request I receive from a railwayman. I go either to the Minister, the General Manager or the System Manager, and I obtain satisfaction from them all.</p>

<p>The first part of the hon. member for Durban (Point&#x2019;s) speech was actually a repetition of what the hon. member for Yeoville had said. Except for the number of letters which he brought along, he did not prepare his speech and consequently merely had to do a lot of repetition. The hon. member is concerned about the pilots for the new aircraft which are on order and which only have to be delivered within a year or two. He is already concerned about that now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>But they already have to begin training now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>But the pilots are probably there already. Should the hon. member for Durban (Point) now be told that we already have 11 pilots ready? They are making tremendous fuss because there are no pilots, but what proof does the hon. member have that this is the case? No, one must never try to make a mountain out of a molehill. That is what the hon. members for Yeoville and Durban (Point) tried to do. They tried to make something out of nothing.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the point which the hon. member for Durban (Point) mentioned. He wanted to know what would happen if an influenza epidemic were to strike. I have already been here for 20 years, and there have already been influenza epidemics by the score, but there was never a single train which could not run. We do not deny that there is a staff shortage at present, but because our railway personnel are more efficient we can get along with fewer people. I shall come back to the question of overtime and Sunday time at a later stage.</p>

<p>I should like to come back for a moment to the hon. member for Yeoville. There is indeed a manpower shortage, as I have just said, and for the purposes of the record I just<span class="col_2203-2204" refersTo="page_1124"/> want to repeat these words: For such a progressive country as the Republic of South Africa, there must be a manpower shortage. It is an inevitable consequence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<p>Who says so?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. member asked, &#x201C;Who says so&#x201D;? That must of necessity be the case. If we had a United Party Government, we would have had unemployment, we all know that. Every possible kind of job is there and we have too few people to do the work. [Interjections.] I sat quietly when the hon. member spoke, and he must also give me an opportunity to speak. The hon. member is becoming irritable because he is now being corrected on the cardinal points. I repeat: In a country as prosperous as the Republic, there must be a labour shortage. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Hillbrow can stand up just now and speak as much as he wants to. If we had had too many employees, it would, in my opinion, have been a bad sign.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the farmers&#x2019; livestock reaching the markets too late. I wonder whether the hon. member knows anything about that. I would not like to mention my own case as an example, because it is perhaps not the proper thing to do, but I shall do so in this case. I send off many thousands of sheep every year, and I have not yet had a single complaint that the sheep arrived late in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban or Port Elizabeth. Why is the hon. member so unfortunate as to have all those things happen only to him?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>He has never sent off a sheep.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know that he has never sent off a sheep, but if one sits sucking one&#x2019;s thumb all day, one must eventually get something out of it.</p>

<p>As far as smaller delays are concerned, I want to ask the hon. member to mention one single train which has been cancelled as a result of a staff shortage. Then I shall concede that he is right. I know that he cannot do so. In spite of the staff shortage our trains run to time. I travel by train very frequently. At times I reach Cape Town a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes late, but this is normal. It is altogether normal for one to be delayed along the way by shunting, or as a result of the fact that the lines are closed. Hon. members would surely not want one train to collide with another as a result of trying to reach its destination on time. This is altogether normal.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about a letter from Mr. Ralph Botha. I know Mr. Ralph Botha well. He is supposed to have said that there were so many incompetent and inefficient persons working on the Railways. If the hon. member were to come to a railway constituency such as De Aar or Colesberg, would he repeat that statement?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>I maintain that it is not so. Mr. Ralph Botha must be wrong. I would never make such a statement, because I move among railway people and I know that they are competent to do their job. There are apprentices who are initially not so good at their work, but after six months or a year they are competent workers. The hon. member has already been in politics a long time and he is not competent yet.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about the so-called &#x201C;fruitless estimates&#x201D;. I wonder whether he knows how an estimate is drawn up. If a new railway line must be constructed or a line must be straightened to exclude turns, I wonder how the hon. member would draw up that estimate.</p>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>As a practical-minded person. I shall tell the hon. member. I do not merely sit in an office in a city all day. I move around in the country areas where those lines are being constructed. I recently saw a railway line which had to be diverted and which had to traverse a large dam belonging to a farmer. The dam was worth a lot of money and no provision had been made in the Budget to buy up that dam. Then there is perhaps a slope which appears to be a ridge of soft, brittle gravel, but which actually consists of dolerite. Instead of having to work on it for a week, one has to spend three months on it. That is what causes estimates to be out. It happens very easily. To-day the hon. member tried, and I give him every credit for it, to criticize the Railway Budget.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable that the hon. member should now object to the 20-year period in respect of pensions. In 20 years&#x2019; time he and I will perhaps no longer be here. We hope that we shall still be here. There is time enough for those who succeed us to deal with those cases individually. Why does the hon. member now want to criticize the Minister about that? Now is surely not the time to do so?</p>

<p>I now want to say something else. I want to begin with my good friend, the Minister of Transport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Thank him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Decent people do so, but others would not. I want to congratulate him on this Budget. It is a moderate Budget. We shall all admit as much. Many newspapers speculated that there would be tariff increases or decreases, but this has not been the case. We are completely satisfied about that. But our real requests, in connection with which we sent deputations to the Minister, were in respect of pensions. These requests have been granted. We are grateful for that. After all pensioners are surely persons who experienced difficulties as a result of the increasing cost of living, in that pensions did not increase proportionately.</p>

<p>As we could deduce from the previous Budget, a deficit of R30 million was estimated for. The Minister was fortunate in being able to reduce that deficit to far below that figure, as a result of efficient personnel. I do not want to make any predictions, because I would then be anticipating his Budget of next year, If I live that long. But I am almost sure that he is going to show a surplus next year, in spite of the manpower shortage.</p>

<p>But it is doing so. The proceeds from the oil pipeline which conveys the oil and the petrol, are applied to prevent the tariffs being increased in respect of the non-profitable traffic.</p>

<p>I now want to go quite a way back in time. From 1948 to the end of 1966 a round figure of R190 million was spent on wage increases for the railway people. In a period of 18 years R190 million was paid out. Under the United Party Government those people worked on the Railways for nothing, did they not? When I came to the House of Assembly those people were living in absolutely scandalous conditions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Who paid them 3s. 6d. a day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>The railway people lived in houses and hovels which were scandalous for a country such as this. Our non-Whites live better to-day than our railway people did in 1948. But that is not all. The Opposition will never mention that the Minister had a surplus of R44 million last year. He gave it back directly to the railway people to improve their position and to satisfy his personnel. He succeeded in doing so. There are complaints about the increasing cost of living. Wages must be adjusted accordingly, and the Minister has done so. From time to time, as the cost of living increases, wages are also adjusted. I have just said that from 1948 to 1966 there was an improvement of R190 million in railwaymen&#x2019;s wages. I am now going to mention a bigger figure. The total up to the end of 1968, over a period of 20 years, amounted to more than R250 million. That is a lot of money. I am glad that the money was spent in such a way that one could handle transportation in the country. Transportation has always been handled on a basis that we do not have to be ashamed of. There are times when a little waiting is necessary, but a train has never to my knowledge been cancelled. Mr. Speaker, I want to make a further analysis in connection with the staff. I found it strange that the main speaker on the Opposition side said nothing to-day about the staff, except that there was a shortage. He remained silent about the good things which have been done for them. I now want to quote what the average wages of all staff were throughout the years. The table is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<table>

<tr>

<td><p>1960-&#x2019;61,</p></td>

<td><p>R1,674.</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>1962-&#x2019;63,</p></td>

<td><p>R1,899.</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>1964-&#x2019;65,</p></td>

<td><p>R2,180.</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>1965-&#x2019;66.</p></td>

<td><p>R2,359.</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>1966-&#x2019;67,</p></td>

<td><p>R2.517.</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>1967-&#x2019;68,</p></td>

<td><p>R2.586.</p></td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>It might now be said that the cost of living has increased. However, just the other day we heard certain figures in connection with the increasing cost of living, and according to that the cost of living has not increased nearly as much as is indicated by the figures which I have mentioned here. The standard of living of our railway people has increased by between 200 and 300 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="col_2207-2208" refersTo="page_1126"/>I now want to deal with the question of overtime. Railway people work overtime and Sunday time.

They do not want to sit at home for the whole of Sunday, they want to go and work so that they can buy something or other for their wives. I could also have brought along such letters, but now a fuss is made here about certain people who write that they are working themselves to death. I have never yet heard of a single person in the Republic who has worked himself to death. However, when a person is tired and he feels that he cannot go on any longer, he can go to his superior and say that he is tired, that he has worked for so many consecutive hours and needs rest and he will get that rest.</p>

<p>That is precisely what you would do. Mr. Speaker, I have already made a few remarks about the cost of living. The cost of living has increased, as it must do. As wages increase, so the cost of living increases, because one cannot keep salaries at a high level and the prices of products at a low one. It is simply not reconcileable, and the prices of products must increase. The farmer&#x2019;s land which produces the products and which was valued at 10s. and &#x00A3;1 a morgen, is now valued at R20 and R30 a morgen. The farmer can, for example, no longer value a slaughter sheep at 50c and R1, he must now value it at R10 to R12. However, the necessary wage adjustments for this are made from time to time. This is not for me to calculate, but there are staff who calculate the wage adjustments. The hon. member for Durban (Point) read us a few of the &#x201C;batches&#x201D; of letters&#x2014;and I wish that he would also give me one. I believe that the letters are all from people who are dissatisfied with the working of overtime. I only brought along one letter written by a Mrs. S. A. Wakefield, also of Durban. In that letter&#x2014;it was probably translated into Afrikaans&#x2014;to an Afrikaans newspaper she wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hereby want to inform you of how proud I feel about the South African Railways and also about the salaries which our people receive if they want to work.</block>

<p>I shall give her address to the hon. member for Durban (Point) and then he can write to her. Her address is, c/o P.O. Box 49, Rossburgh, Durban.</p>

<p>Does it appear to you as if the letter was written to me? Mrs. Wakefield wrote the letter to a newspaper. I have already given her address and the hon. member for Yeoville can write to her and ask her whether she made a false statement to the Press.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about housing and said that there were fewer houses than there were last year. It is quite possible that there are fewer houses. I know that there are very small houses, I almost want to say one-roomed houses, alongside the railway lines, which are being demolished. I know that.</p>

<p>Only to that hon. member. He receives the complaints, but it is strange that the hon. the Minister does not receive them. Recently I paid a visit to a fairly large station, namely Rosmead station, and I heard only expressions of gratitude from the people for the houses which the hon. the Minister had built there for them. At Noupoort an altogether new town was established<span class="col_2209-2210" refersTo="page_1127"/> for Railway people, with beautiful gardens and fruit trees and an abundance of water supplied by the Railways. Those, then, are the people who are complaining about housing. I have here a list of houses, with their prices, which were built for these people by the State through the years. My time is virtually up, but I think that I should at least mention one figure. Houses are being built under three schemes, i.e. the house-ownership scheme, the assisted building society housing scheme and then also the Departmental housing scheme. Under these three schemes a total amount of R52,126,000 was spent by the State on houses for the period 1962 to 1967. That is a lot of money. I admit that building costs have increased and where one could earlier have built a house for R4,000 to R6,000, one now pays from R10,000 to R12,000 and more for a house. Workmanship has become more expensive, so has building material, but nevertheless decent houses are still being built for these people. The hon. the Minister has not been idle either. According to the annual report transport has steadily increased; transportation has not decreased as a result of the manpower shortage. In 1967-&#x2019;68, according to the annual report, the tonnage of revenue earning traffic increased by 6,300,000 tons, or 6.37 per cent. In the previous year it increased by 6.127 per cent. High-rated traffic increased 700,000 tons; low-rated traffic increased by 5,167,000 tons. In spite of the shortage of personnel, transportation on the Railways increased to a very large extent. Then I also want to mention another figure and that is the number of trucks in use. It is said here that the farmers cannot have their livestock transported as a result of the delay of trains. Sir, a few years ago there was a little complaint about the availability of trucks for the transportation of coal, but that was 10 years ago and we have subsequently never again heard of a shortage of trucks for the transportation of coal. I should like to quote you the figures: In 1967, 7,800,000 truck loads were transported and in 1968, 8,178,000, an increase of 3.55 per cent. What is the position as far as passengers are concerned? In spite of the fact that the number of motor cars on the roads has increased tenfold in the last few years, in spite of the fact that the motor vehicle traffic on our roads during December, January, February and to a large extent also November, was so dense that one could virtually not travel on the roads, the number of passengers in 1967-&#x2019;68 was 476 million as against 464 million in 1966-&#x2019;67, an increase of more than 12 million.</p>

<p>That makes no difference. They are all people who travel by train, and the Opposition is complaining that we do not have the necessary personnel to keep the trains going. Must there then be extra personnel for the Whites and extra personnel for the non-Whites? I sincerely hope that that is not the hon. member&#x2019;s mentality. No, in spite of the staff shortage no delays are being experienced on the Railways. The Railways were also not idle in respect of the purchase of rolling stock. In 1967-&#x2019;68, R153 million was spent on rolling stock and in 1968-&#x2019;69, R64 million. The hon. the Minister plans ahead. The hon. member said that there was no planning ahead. That is not the case. If there had been no planning ahead where would these amounts have come from? Sir, we sometimes hear that people cannot obtain seats on trains. Is is only during peak hours that people are not able to obtain seats on trains. It only happens during holiday periods when people are rushing to the coastal resorts. It is only in exceptional cases that people are not able to obtain seats.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to resume my seat, but I cannot neglect to thank the hon. the Minister, the General Manager, the System Managers, the heads of staff and all the Railway personnel, who assist the heads so faithfully, for the tremendous work which they have done during the past year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Colesberg has made a long speech in which he has dealt with a lot of matters, but before I come to those matters, I would like to pay my tribute to the late General Manager, Mr. Hugo, and also wish our new General Manager, Mr. Kruger, well in his term of office as General Manager.</p>

<p>The debate thus far, as far as members on the Government side are concerned, has consisted largely of expressions of praise for the Minister, who will have very little to reply to when he gets up because hon. members opposite have been taking all the chestnuts out of the fire for him and trying to explain away the various deficiencies in the Railway administration. Sir, the hon. member for Colesberg, in talking about the staff shortage, reminded us that while the United Party was in power there were people out of work. This Government has been in power for 21 years. I do not know of anybody who has been out of work since the war, but the hon. member cannot explain away the staff shortages as easily as that. I do not know whether he would like to see us going back to the black days of the depression. You cannot have prosperity and excess labour because prosperity naturally brings labour shortages with it. But in other parts of the world they have been able to overcome this problem. The hon. member referred to the conveyance of sheep on the railways and said that no difficulty was being experienced there. Other members on this side, who specialize in agricultural matters, will deal with that issue. He also mentioned the question of cancelled trains. Well, I do not think there have been any cancelled passenger trains. Notwithstanding the fact that members of the staff have been tired from overtime they have nevertheless got on with the job and no trains have been cancelled, although there have been delays. Quite a number of goods<span class="col_2211-2212" refersTo="page_1128"/> trains have possibly been cancelled as a result of the shortage of staff. Sir, I was amazed to hear the hon. member say that in his constituency, which includes Noupoort, there is no dissension at all among the railway workers. He has a lot of railwaymen in his constituency and he says there is no dissension there. Sir, that is remarkable because I have had letters from people working in the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency who have wanted a transfer to the cities not only in the interests of the education of their children but because they are thoroughly dissatisfied with the conditions under which they have to live there. The hon. member probably does not hear about this because he is on the Government side and railwaymen are always deeply afraid of discrimination.</p>

<p>The hon. member tried to find excuses for under-estimating the cost of building a line to Empangeni. He says that when you start building a line you may suddenly come up against a dam that you have to buy or a farm that you may have to buy. The hon. member said that he was an experienced person and he knows, of course, that that does not happen. Before any line is constructed, the whole area is surveyed; test holes are made and the whole terrain is examined very, very thoroughly. We get reports from time to time in this House telling us what earth has to be removed and what ground has to be expropriated and what it is going to cost; private tenderers may be asked to tender on the basis of those specifications. Sir, the Railways do not make errors like that. There must be a deficiency somewhere; something went wrong somewhere with the building of this line. As the hon. member for Yeoville has pointed out, there must be other reasons to account for these under-estimated costs.</p>

<p>Sir, I will deal with the question of overtime in the course of my speech. We must remember that the Railway Administration is one of the most important departments in South Africa. It is of so much importance that it is laid down in our Constitution that the Railways must be run on business lines for the benefit of the country. The Minister has told us that the prosperity of the country can always be gauged by the prosperity of the Railways. I agree with him to a certain extent, but when one looks at the deficit which he has announced for this year and one has regard to the fact that the Minister of Finance predicts a very substantial surplus, one wonders what has really gone wrong. The Minister expected a deficit last year of R24 million and this year he has been able to reduce the deficit to R13 million, but, of course, we still have another two months to go before the end of the financial year, and the chances are that the deficit will be very much less when we come to the end of March. We hope that the Minister will be able to tell us later on that the deficit is less than he at present anticipates.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as we expected and as we said last year, the hon. the Minister has used the Rates Equalization Fund this year in order to avoid increasing tariffs so as to meet his shortfall. One wonders what is going to happen in the future. The hon. the Minister talks about loss of revenue as the result of lower maize exports occasioned by the drought, and one wonders what he is going to do in this connection. When we look at the Green Book, we find that last year the Railways were run at a loss of R30,150,000; that the Harbours were run at a profit of R15,096,000; that the Airways made a profit of R3,860,000 and that the pipelines produced a profit of R19,767,392. This year we are expecting to lose R49 million on the Railways; we are expecting to make a profit of R18 million odd on Harbours; R8 million on Airways and R39 million on the pipelines. Sir, one wonders what has gone wrong. When one looks at these figures one realizes that the Railways themselves are the real bugbear and that that is where we have to look for the fault. We have made suggestions to the hon. the Minister over the years, some of which he has accepted. He appointed the Marais Commission. We have still not seen the report. I understand that it is at present being printed. We are at the disadvantage that we cannot debate this report because it is not in front of us. We have also had the Schumann Commission which made certain recommendations and put forward certain long-term remedies to overcome our difficulties, but we still go on producing hit-and-miss budgets. If things do not improve next year and the Minister finds that he is going to have another deficit, he may decide not to meet the shortfall out of the Rates Equalization Fund but to introduce higher rates. We know that he is in the habit of doing these things. We recall that some years ago he increased tariffs by 10 per cent without consulting industry or anybody else. Sir, I think we have to look further into this. The General Manager talks in this report about the better utilization of line capacities. What we should concentrate on, of course, is to make better use of the facilities that we have and try to reduce our losses on the railways. The General Manager talks in his report about longer trains, improved couplings, signalling systems and straightening of lines. We here in the Western Cape are rather disappointed when we find that year after year, although provision is made in the Brown Book for the deviation of the line from Cape Town to the north through the Hex River, the work is put off. The longer this project is delayed the more expensive it will become, so there is no real saving there. At the present time the line goes over the Hex River Pass. This long route could be shortened very considerably by building this deviation line. This is one way in which we can save and there must be dozens of other ways in which savings can be effected and the efficiency of the Railways improved and losses cut down. Sir, we were pleased to read in the General Manager&#x2019;s report that the Railways were becoming modern and businesslike in their outlook. They should have done this years ago, of course. We are<span class="col_2213-2214" refersTo="page_1129"/> pleased to see that a market research section has now been established in the Railway service. It is very essential to know exactly what your customers want, with this keen competition you have all over the world, and it is pleasing to know that the Railways are going to do something about it. When our marketing research section does get under way, we will not have the trouble we have had in regard to the conveyance of ore via Port Elizabeth. There you had the peculiar position that they work one shift and boats are waiting to load, which leads to high demurrage costs. It is only after the Japanese threatened us with the loss of their trade that the Government did something about it, but it took them a long time to wake up. It was only in October, 1968, that the Government decided to operate this very expensive ore loading plant on a 24-hour basis. With the marketing research unit, we will know what our customers want and maybe we will cut down expenditure and bring in much more revenue for the Railways. I want to tell the Minister that as far as the Airways are concerned, the marketing research is 100 per cent. Their contact with their customers is really first class and it must have brought a considerable amount of new business to the Airways. It is something which the Railways should introduce and they could do it with great profit to themselves.</p>

<p>We have heard about passenger traffic. The hon. member for Colesberg referred to it. When you look at the figures you find a steady increase in second and third-class passenger traffic over long distances, and you find a steady fall-off as far as first and second-class railway passengers are concerned. We take it that the Whites travel first and second class, and that the Bantu travel second class and third class. But what is the reason for this? When one travels by train, one realizes what the position is. We have two first-class trains in this country. There is the Blue Train, which is going to be replaced, but what I cannot understand is why we do not go all out, when we build first-class coaches, to air-condition them. We have the Trans-Karoo and the train from Johannesburg to Durban. Why do we build these first-class trains and forget about air-conditioning? We have such coaches on the Trans-Karoo and on the train between Johannesburg and Durban. Those coaches are very much better and more comfortable than those in the present Blue Train, but if you travel during the middle of summer you just about die of heat. The only blessing is that you have a shower on those trains. In winter you just about freeze, because you have these old-fashioned heaters in the compartments and they are either on or off, being connected up with the engine. If you want to attract passenger business to the Railways, you have to offer your passengers some comforts. You have to offer them a competitive fare and you have to offer them first-class service. I must say that notwithstanding the shortage of staff, you get first-class service on the passenger trains, but at least you must offer air-conditioning. I do not think it will cost a lot, but it is necessary. I think the coaches could be quite easily adapted to it. I was travelling on the Trans-Karoo and portion of the train was filled with package-tourists from overseas. In the middle of summer these people from Germany and Switzerland almost died of the heat and they could not understand why the train was not air-conditioned. They travel all over the world as tourists and even their buses are air-conditioned, and also their hotels, but here they found themselves in a train which was not air-conditioned. It is something we should look into if we are to go in for tourism. And not all tourists like to travel by air. There are many of these package tours to-day where they book a train and travel through the country on these trains, to the Game Reserve, etc. The Government should do something about it.</p>

<p>One of the points we have brought up in our amendment to-day is this serious staff shortage. Apparently the Government sees no solution in sight. It is one of these things that the Government has decided to live with. Like some people say that we must learn to live with inflation, so the Government has decided to live with staff shortages. They have mechanized to a high degree on the Railways, but that is still not the answer. If you look around, you find that in Durban Bantu are doing certain types of work, but in the Cape Town Docks Whites do the same kind of work. With the co-operation and the consent of the unions, there should be some revaluation of jobs. We heard the Minister say the other day that nobody wants to be a shunter and that the turnover of shunters is 100 per cent. Surely we must examine the position. We cannot operate without shunters. The revaluation of jobs is overdue. We have to make use of the labour available in this country; otherwise we cannot carry on.</p>

<p>Yes, all labour. All jobs should be revalued and an approach should be made to the unions and the position should be put to them. We cannot carry on as we are doing at present. I am fairly certain that we will find that the unions will be receptive to any suggestions. Outside, in the engineering industry, the unions have faced the fact that there must be a revaluation of all jobs and they have had to allow non-Whites to do certain jobs. [Interjections.] I know that the Government side is looking for propaganda and are saying that the United Party wants Blacks to fake the jobs of Whites, but that is so much rubbish. It is the only sensible approach to the problem. I do not know whether hon. members here have had anything to do with labour, but I see the hon. member for Krugersdorp is sitting there. What is happening on the Railways now was known in the old days as sweated labour, namely men<span class="col_2215-2216" refersTo="page_1130"/> working excessive hours. Then the unions got together and they had strikes and to-day you have regulated hours, 44 hours or 46 hours a week, whatever it may be. The Government decided that this was a good thing and they embodied that principle in the Factories Act, and overtime was controlled. But the Minister of Transport does what he likes and you have the position to-day where people are working excessive hours to the detriment of their health. We are building up what is called an overtime economy and that is something we will regret one of these days. We have been told here that the living standard has gone up by 300 per cent, but on what? It is an unhealthy overtime economy. No railwayman refuses to work normal overtime. He can do with the extra money to educate his family, notwithstanding the fact that he gets a fair wage. But the overtime these people are being asked to work is abnormal. I am like the hon. member for Durban (Point); I also have cases of people who have had to work excessive overtime and not being relieved, they have gone off the trains. I know of one case where the man could not stand any more because he was so tired and he left the train and was fined R25. These things happen. The Minister knows about it. This case has been handed to him. People have become tired and frustrated and they have had to leave the job. You can only do so much work. And you cannot tell me that people working excessive hours can apply themselves to the same extent as if they were fresh, having worked normal hours. Their home life suffers because they are never at home. This leads to the deterioration of home life. It may be that this is one of the causes of the high divorce rate we have. Some of the wives of railwaymen never see their husbands from day to day and from week to week, and we have had cases of many railwaymen becoming alcoholics because they are often away from home on split shifts, have got into bad company and they have started drinking. Your own welfare officers on the Railways will tell you this. This is an unhealthy state of affairs and it has to be stopped. With a growing economy such as ours, you cannot keep the Railways back; they must grow. If they do not grow, the country will break down because this is the primary means of transport. So the Government has to do something about it. They must face the fact that to keep the Railways going there must be a complete revaluation of jobs in conjunction with the unions, and we must make use of the best labour we have in the country.</p>

<p>Will job revaluation alone bring more white men to work on the Railways?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, possibly, because as you increase your staff you find more Whites being employed. As the Railways expand, more Whites must go in. If the hon. member looks at the figures before us, the non-Whites and the Whites on the Railways are just about 50-50. In 1968 there were 113,981 Whites and the non-Whites were 107,657. They are almost 50-50 at present, and as the Railways expand and more non-Whites are employed you must naturally have more Whites. But you cannot have Whites doing jobs which should not be done by them. You cannot have Whites in the Cape Town Docks working as berthing attendants and as tug crews, when in Durban you have Bantu doing that, and also in South-West Africa. You cannot have Whites doing these very menial tasks. Surely there is something a bit better for them. If the Government wishes to make capital out of this, they will be able to make very little capital out of it, because their own white workers on the Railways have asked us on this side of the House whether we cannot get them something better to do than they are doing at present.</p>

<p>In the few minutes I have left I would like to get back to the Cape Town Harbour. I was a bit disappointed in the Minister&#x2019;s reply to me the other day when he said he was not able to produce a plan or estimates in this House. Every year for every project we have had from the Railway Board plans have been put before the House showing exactly what is to be done and what the expenditure will be. I know I can get a plan in the Minister&#x2019;s office and I can also get a plan from the local newspaper, but I want to have it in this House. I do not want to go there. I think every member has the right to see such a plan. We are asked to vote the money and I should like to see the plan and also the report showing exactly what is happening about the Cape Town Harbour. We are not very happy about it. There has been a commission&#x2019;s report on it. This has been going on for years. First of all it was going to be Rietvlei, and then it was going to be Cape Town Docks, and then it was going to be Rietvlei again, and then again Cape Town Docks. I do not think the Minister has ever been in favour of Rietvlei and now they are going to build extensions in Cape Town Docks, and Rietvlei will be used for something else later. But at the same time we know full well that Rietvlei will have to be used in order to obtain the material to build the new docks, so I hope that the Minister, when he is thinking of further expansion, will take note of this, and if he has the excavations at Rietvlei he can then open it to the sea and build a dock there.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first part of his speech the hon. member for Salt River merely repeated arguments and accusations which had already been put forward by the two previous speakers on the Opposition side. They levelled these accusations at the Minister and at the Administration. He also mentioned a few general matters. Amongst other things he spoke of the absence of air-conditioning in railway coaches, and particularly in the case of long-distance passenger coaches. After all, the hon. member knows that if a person is so set on air-conditioning, he can make use of the Blue Train. Or has<span class="col_2217-2218" refersTo="page_1131"/> the hon. member never heard of a thing called the Blue Train? One wonders whether the tourists who are allegedly so set on this matter, have air-conditioning in all trains in their own countries.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his speech the hon. member also referred to the ratio between Whites and non-Whites in the South African Railways. The hon. member levelled these accusations a moment ago, and we have also heard them from other quarters. For the information of the hon. member, and for that of the outside world, I must point out that, despite a country-wide shortage of white manpower, the white staff on the Railways has always represented more than 50 per cent of those employed by the Railways. In 1967 the white staff on the Railways represented 52.3 per cent of the total number of people employed by the Railways. Let me tell the hon. member that in 1948 the white staff on the Railways represented 52.2 per cent of the total. In other words, over these years, i.e. from 1948 to 1967, there was no change in this set-up. This does not tally with what the hon. member has just said.</p>

<p>I should like to say something in regard to the speech made by the hon. member for Yeoville. I am sorry that the hon. member is leaving the Chamber now. At the start of his speech the hon. member referred to the motorists of a certain part of the country, i.e. of the Pretoria, Witwatersrand and Vereeniging areas. He said that they had to pay up for the profits that were being made on the oil pipeline. The question we should pose, is whether the motorists there are, in relation to the rest of the country, paying more for their petrol than they did when petrol was conveyed by train.</p>

<p>The second question I should like to ask the hon. member, is whether he would be able to isolate the pipeline from the Estimates as an independent item. To my knowledge the pipeline was in fact introduced to serve transport as a whole. It had to bring relief, as a result of the heavy demands made on the Railways. It is in fact because provision was made for a pipeline that more goods of a different kind can now be conveyed by our trains. Now I want to put this question to hon. members on the other side: From which other source do they want to derive the profits which are now being made as a result of the introduction of the pipeline? Would they like to raise the tariffs? Would they like to raise the tariffs for passengers? They must tell us where that money is to be found. We know that the Estimates deal with various items. They deal with passenger services, with goods and coal, with road transport services, with harbours, with oil pipelines and also with air services. The losses sustained on any one of these facets, must after all be recovered through profits made on the other facets. After all, this is a generally accepted business principle. Just as it is in the case of any business undertaking which has various branches, the losses on one branch have to be recouped by means of the profits made on another branch.</p>

<p>The hon. member moved an amendment, and complained about the following matters: The excessive overtime worked by Railway servants, the strains to which such servants are subjected, the chronic shortage of manpower (this has become a chronic argument), and the inefficiency of the Railway Administration to provide satisfactory services to the various sectors of the country&#x2019;s economy. The hon. member did not only level the latter accusation at the Minister and at the Administration, but also at all the workers. I want to repeat what he said. A previous speaker on this side of the House also mentioned this matter. The hon. member said that Railway workers were incompetent. It is essential for Railway workers to know what they are being accused of by the Opposition. They should know that they are being accused of being incompetent. Another matter which has already been ridden to death in this debate and in other debates, and which I suppose will still be raised by other speakers, is the argument in regard to excessive overtime. Now one wants to ask this question again: What is excessive overtime? It is a relative concept. Hon. members did not define it themselves. They cannot define it. There are no Railway servants who are obliged to work excessive overtime. These people work overtime because they are loyal to the Railway Administration. This is what I found in my constituency. Somebody told me that they want to do it because they believe that in doing so they are rendering a service to the Railways and to the country. The hon. member for Durban (Point) had a thick pile of letters of complaint here. I wonder how many of those letters were actually written by his voters. According to him that thick pile of letters contained complaints, but in not one of those letters could he quote to us that the writer had said that he was working excessive overtime, or that he had asked that he should not have to work any more overtime. In the past recess not one single person in my constituency&#x2014;and a very large percentage of my voters are Railway servants&#x2014;complained to me about working excessive overtime. On the contrary, I could even mention the names of persons who had asked me whether it would not be possible for them to work additional overtime.</p>

<p>It does not matter in what grades they are. They are working on the Railways in general. These arguments of hon. members are falling quite flat, flatter than a pancake. The hon. member for Durban (Point), who is now getting so boisterous, spoke of a &#x201C;pedestrian budget&#x201D;. If I had to translate this into Afrikaans, I do not know whether I would call it a &#x201C;voetgangerbegroting&#x201D; or a &#x201C;padloperbegroting&#x201D;. But, in any event, irrespective of which one it would be, to me it implies that the hon. member wants to suggest<span class="col_2219-2220" refersTo="page_1132"/> that there is no vision or imaginativeness in these Estimates. In a moment we shall point out in which way there is in fact vision and imaginativeness in these Estimates. A great deal was said here, and a great deal is being said in general, about the shortage of workers on the South African Railways. We know&#x2014;and this has been said here time and again&#x2014;that this is a phenomenon which is to be found in all sectors of the administration of our country. But one even finds a manpower shortage in private concerns, in spite of the very attractive salaries offered by these bodies. But, and I want to emphasize this, I prefer a manpower shortage to unemployment; in other words, if there is a shortage of work, it may result in a depression, such as we had in the past. The shortage of workers in South Africa is not only caused by insufficient numbers, or by the non-availability of workers, but also by a lack of quality on the part of a considerable percentage of workers or employees. Or to phrase it differently: the relatively low level of productivity is one of the most alarming aspects of a shortage of workers. In fact, the South African Railways has, particularly over the past few years, been concentrating on enhancing the productivity of its servants. On pages 87 and 88 of the Annual Report of the General Manager we find that this was phrased very well. On these pages we also find fine graphs reflecting the steady improvement in labour productivity achieved by members of the staff. The South African Railways may consider itself lucky that there is a steadily increasing percentage of workers who are concentrating on specific and specialized tasks on the Railways. They are interested in their work, and in that particular work they are rendering the best service to the Railways. They are not always looking for the so-called greener pastures on the other side of the fence. In other words, they are not being driven by frustration and dissatisfaction to find a so-called better means of livelihood. And Railway servants can achieve this increased productivity, specialization and better opportunities for promotion as a result of the sound scientific training which these servants receive, for instance, at the Railway College at Esselen Park, as well as the other training schemes which, in certain cases, are backed by attractive bursary schemes. Just as is the case with other employers, the Railways also finds that there are in fact servants who resign. In the case of the South African Railways, which is the biggest employer in our country, the annual number of resignations runs into thousands at times. Some resign for unavoidable reasons and others in order to look for better pastures, to which I referred. But experience has shown and history has proved that at a later stage more than 90 per cent of these persons return hat in hand to their good and fair former employer, i.e. the South African Railways.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>And now the hon. member will be well advised to listen. Apart from those people who applied for the first time for a position in the Railway Service, 16,199 applications for re-employment by the Railways were, for instance, received from former servants in 1967. During the period December 1967 to December, 1968, there were 16.846 Whites who resigned from the South African Railways. Now I shall perhaps hear the hon. member shouting: See there! I assure him that they did not resign as a result of working overtime. I want to make this very clear to you, Sir. Many of them are unemployed persons and even work-shy persons with whom the Railways is saddled. They form the unstable element in the Service. Some of them even applied twice or three times in the same year for re-admission to the Service.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>I do not have the statistics here. Apart from the question the hon. member has just put, this is the important point: they are asking to be re-employed. In 1968, for instance, 16,875 applied for re-employment. And this is in point of fact a larger number than the number of resignations. And this is happening in spite of the fact that servants who apply for re-employment must in actual fact start from scratch once again and be paid accordingly. One feels very sorry for these persons, especially in cases where there were circumstances over which they had no control. This picture of resignations and applications for re-employment has remained constant over the years. This is a phenomenon which will also crop up again in the future, perhaps to a lesser extent, because Railway servants are preparing themselves for a special task and because they themselves realize that they and their families are the ones who suffer when they resign and have to start from scratch once again.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville and other hon. members also referred to the so-called miscalculations in respect of the Estimates. In this part of his first speech the hon. member for Yeoville kicked up quite a fuss the other day about the incorrect estimates of expenditure and revenue in respect of the previous Estimates. I want to say that this is a pointless, nonsensical and also a very unfair charge against the Minister and the Management. The final picture in regard to the Estimates for l967-&#x2019;68 is as follows: The total revenue derived from all services was estimated at R798.230.000 and the final expenditure at R811,337.000. The year was ended with a deficit, as we already know, of R13.1 million, instead of the originally estimated amount of R24 million, as appropriated. If we do a simple calculation, we find that the miscalculation only amounted to R10.9 million. If one works out this calculation a little further, if one can work with decimals and fractions&#x2014;and I do not know whether the Opposition is always<span class="col_2221-2222" refersTo="page_1133"/> capable of doing so&#x2014;one finds that this is only .013 per cent of the actual total expenditure on all services. I say that this is an excellent and magnificent estimate on which the Minister and the Management should be congratulated. We on this side of the House, the Railway workers and the country as such are grateful for the fact that a Ben Schoeman together with his capable Management, and not a Marais Steyn, has to prepare the Railway Estimates. We are grateful for the fact that a person such as the Minister, who has years of experience, has to assist in preparing those Estimates, and not a person who cannot even risk an estimate as to the number of United Party members in the House of Assembly, not even for the coming year.</p>

<p>When the Opposition levels such criticism in regard to incorrect estimates of deficits, one wonders whether they are at all trying to inquire into or make inquiries about the tremendous amount of trouble&#x2014;and now I want hon. member to listen&#x2014;which is taken in order to make the Estimates as accurate and reliable as possible. Do hon. members realize that in addition to the thorough study which is being made of internal expenditure and possible revenue, many bodies representing the various sectors of our national economy are being approached. In order to prepare the present Estimates, which we have had before us, the Management approached no fewer than 78 bodies to make estimates for those sectors or spheres which are served by them or in regard to which they could furnish information. The South African Agricultural Union is an important institution that was approached for an estimate in regard to all sectors of the agricultural industry. And we know how difficult it is for them, because of changing climatic conditions, to make an estimate. But the Railways must also take that estimate into account. The Reserve Bank as well as all the other banking institutions were approached, as were the Afrikaanse Sakekamer, the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, the Associated Chambers of Commerce, the Federated Chamber of Industries, various motor-car fuel companies, Iscor, representatives of the motor-car industry, and the Industrial Development Corporation. Liaison was also maintained with the Departments of Commerce, Economics and Marketing, Defence and Industries. And, in conclusion, even the Stock Exchange was approached. Subsequent to that the planning and financial sections of the Railways met and considered all of these particulars, which cover our national economy. And, having taken their own internal needs into account, they prepared these Estimates. And now I ask whether this is not a very scientific basis on which these Estimates are prepared, i.e. after regard has been had to all the needs of the country as such. These Estimates are not brought to finality in a haphazard way, as hon. members seem to think. The Opposition is always talking about miscalculations in regard to Estimates. But when Mr. Hamilton Russell, the predecessor of the present main speaker of the Opposition, was a member here, he came off second-best as regards this kind of criticism and the so-called miscalculations. And I also expect that on this occasion this hon. member will come up against the Minister as regards the misplaced criticism he is continually expressing in regard to the Estimates and so-called miscalculations.</p>

<p>I should just like to refer very briefly to the fact that the hon. member for Durban (Point) said that there was no imaginativeness in these Estimates. As the hon. member also spoke about the South African Airways, I just want to refer him very briefly to the advance planning and the vision of which we have now seen the result in regard to the introduction of the direct Springbok Service between South Africa and New York. This is something which has seized the imagination of everybody who is interested in the South African Airways and the public outside. The significance of this break-through cannot be assessed highly enough. In practice this can be of incalculable significance to the Republic. It took the hon. the Minister, his helpers and the Management a long time to plan this route and to negotiate the right to introduce this air service. To me the introduction of this flight is once again ample proof of the thorough advance planning undertaken by the Minister and his Management. The Minister must be honoured as the founder of this service. The idea of this service was undoubtedly an inspiring challenge. A few moments ago the hon. member said that there were no challenges in these Estimates, but this is proof of an inspiring challenge. It required far-sightedness, initiative and sound judgment, and this air service will now, for the first time, provide South Africa with a direct link with the western hemisphere. As we know, this is the shortest air route between Johannesburg and New York, even though it goes via Rio de Janeiro. Of course, this influences the time-conscious business man who is in a hurry, but in addition it ought to be a tremendous added attraction for tourists and holiday-makers. Consequently it will also promote tourism. That his service will be very popular, has already been confirmed by the bookings for the first five flights. They are already heavily booked. We also hear that the bookings for the next five flights, extending into April and May, are already quite heavy. This new route will not only be used by the citizens of the Republic, but also by North and South Americans, Australians, Canadians, yes, and perhaps the Natalians will also prefer this route! In this way the S.A.A. is providing a link between South Africa and Australia; it is becoming an important link between these two great countries. In addition it is a symbol of the common interests of this part of the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with the following few words. I represent a large Railway constituency and I want to thank the hon. the Minister and his Management for the major concession which has been made in respect of pensioners.<span class="col_2223-2224" refersTo="page_1134"/> Our people are very happy about that, and we are therefore extending our very cordial thanks to the Administration.</p>

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I too should like to sympathize with the hon. the Minister and the Railways personnel in losing that very wonderful man, Mr. Hugo. He was a personal friend of mine, and I am sure many hon. members of this House were also friends of his. I think for many years to come we will continue to think of him. He was a very competent railwayman, but I think his greatest characteristic was the fact that he was a born gentleman. However, we say no man is indispensable, and with that I welcome Mr. Kruger as the new General Manager. We are indeed very glad that he has been appointed General Manager. He is well known to us; he has served in that capacity on several occasions; he is experienced, and I am sure he will let his weight be felt in further developing and improving our railway system.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort spoke about air conditioning in our trains. I was told recently that overseas tourist organizations, especially those in America, were very keen to tour our country. The other day we had a huge American passenger ship here in Cape Town which stayed here for a week, then sailed up the coast, and came back to Cape Town. Many passengers would have loved a tour through South Africa up to the game reserve by train, but apparently what put them against this tour was the fact that there was no air conditioning in this train that was to take them. I may also mention&#x2014;and I hope I am correct in this&#x2014;that they had great difficulty in booking such a train. Perhaps the Minister can clarify this position for us.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the price of petrol. He compared the cost of transporting it by train with that of conveying it by pipeline. Well, there is no comparison, and that is why the pipeline is showing this enormous profit. That is why we ask that it should be equalized&#x2014;all the people in South Africa should enjoy the benefits arising from this pipeline, everybody should pay the same price for petrol.</p>

<p>He also mentioned the various sections of transport. That is something we on this side have pressed for repeatedly. We feel each section of transport should be run on business lines and each one should show its own profit.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think anybody on this side, least of all the hon. member for Yeoville, said that the railway people were incompetent. We have always appreciated the services they render to the country, and I can assure you, Sir, that we will continue to do so. We have always looked after the interests of the railwayman.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned staff shortages. We have always said the position of the White man on the Railways should be elevated wherever possible. We say he should be placed in a higher echelon when circumstances permit. He should be taken away from the ordinary menial type of labour which any unskilled labourer can do. He said the staff were leaving to join the private sector. Why? Are conditions in the service not satisfactory? Is there sufficient pay in the various ranks?</p>

<p>He spoke about the hon. member for Yeoville having queried the budgeting of the Railways, the small amounts, and so on. That was not the case at all. He was querying the large amounts. He spoke about a railway line that cost R40 million and which five minutes later cost double that amount. That is the type of expenditure he queried.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the new flights between Johannesburg and New York via Rio de Janeiro. Of course we will get many passengers; of course the flights will be fully booked. It is a new route. Many people want to go direct to South America instead of via Europe and New York. Let us be honest: has anybody ever said the S.A.A. are not popular? I think they are one of the most popular lines in the world, on flights to America, Europe, Australia, wherever they fly; also on internal flights, they are very popular. The one or two setbacks they had were not their fault. It is indeed a very popular service.</p>

<p>I, too, wish to speak on a few staff matters. I wish to deal with the staff shortage and the question of overtime. I think we must admit that when overtime was originally introduced it happened only because there was an emergency. A man worked an extra shift on a Sunday; he was called out in an emergency because a driver did not turn up for duty or a train was delayed <i>en route,</i> or else he travelled on a return journey, as they call it, from point A to point B and then back to A which took more than the normal time of a man&#x2019;s duty shift. Those were the type of emergencies which caused overtime working. But when overtime payments increase to R68 million per year, surely it cannot be objected to if we on this side query this state of affairs? After all, we have the welfare of our railwaymen at heart. I ask once more: Are the salaries paid to our railwaymen sufficient to permit them to<span class="col_2225-2226" refersTo="page_1135"/> live decently without their having to work overtime? Must they specially work the overtime to give their families the ordinary comforts of life? Are the salaries attractive enough? Are the commencing salaries sufficient to attract their share of school-leavers every year? Is that not where the fault lies?</p>

<p>Then there are rumours about another matter. Last year I raised the question of equal pay for men and women. I heard that the hon. the Minister was now going to pay women the same salaries as men. Do I laud that wonderful statement! But I only hope that I am correct and that he is going to tell me that is just what he is going to do. I am quite certain that, judged by what I saw in the head office in Johannesburg, the women do exactly the same work as the men.</p>

<p>In the 1967-&#x2019;68 annual report that has been submitted, which is a very fine document, I notice that the Minister has been making increasing use of organization and method. On account of that, he has been able to do away with 672 posts. May I ask him whether he does not think that this is biting a little bit too deeply into the already vexed staff problem? He said they are introducing schedules and procedures, resulting in less staff and more work. Does that mean more overtime, which is what we on this side of the House are trying to avoid?</p>

<p>Then there is my old pet subject that I feel I must bring up every year. The Minister told me last year in reply to my query about legal representation that the associations are satisfied on this point. No association, no man, can deny an accused person legal representation, whether it is before an inquiry, the lower court or the High Court. After all, we now even have what they call a legal aid society. In the High Court we have <i>pro Deo</i> defence, if a person cannot afford the cost of being defended. I plead with the Minister to help me in this regard. This is one anomaly that he must remove from the regulations of the Railways. I ask members on that side, especially legal members and members representing railwaymen, to please help me on that point. I even look upwards and plead with the Press to assist me in this regard.</p>

<p>I wish to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has commended and rewarded certain railway officials for their special services to the Railways. I am talking about the designing, the manufacturing and putting into service of bulk ore trucks that they are using at the present time between Sishen and Port Elizabeth and between Sishen and Iscor. I believe they can now increase the load of an ore train to 3,300 tons, and that on account of these trucks that have been introduced, no less than 1,300 trains have been dispensed with, with a financial saving of R2.6 million. I am referring to the bogies, the BA, the AZ and the latest, the C type. With these short trains and heavier loads, it has also been unnecessary to lengthen crossing loops on the main lines. At the same time, this also applies to the Monocoque frameless tank wagons, which are conveying petroleum gas and ammonia, I think, from Louren&#x04AB;o Marques. Unless these designs have been acquired from other railway systems in the world, I think our men should get some <i>ex gratia</i> payment in view of what they have done.</p>

<p>I also want to compliment the Minister on the new type of trucks conveying motor cars in view of the thousands of motor vehicles that are being conveyed by rail every year. I think it is a pleasure to know that one&#x2019;s car now can be railed without being bashed against the sides of the trucks.</p>

<p>Then I also want, on behalf of the railway pensioners, to thank the Minister for the pension grants. I think that has been a wonderful gesture which has long been outstanding. But here too, I must support the hon. member for Yeoville and say that I do not think, with regard to the few old people that will be remaining after 20 years, that that increase of two per cent should stop at the 20 year limit.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the petrol pipelines. But I do want to ask the Minister a few questions with regard to conveying gases. Is it going to be conveyed by means of the existing pipeline, or are there going to be new pipelines for that purpose? How deep are they going to be under earth? Which type of gas is going to be conveyed? Because I always think of old Piet van der Merwe who, when speaking about gas, said: &#x201C;Dis blerrie gevaarlik.&#x201D; I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I am probably not allowed to use that word, but it is still dangerous. [Laughter.] I can never forget the gas explosion which occurred 30 years ago in a mine in the Eastern Transvaal. I saw heavy machinery, huge fly wheels, embedded in the roof of the mine by that explosion. Dozens of miners were killed. I believe they had a mass funeral at Ermelo. May I ask whether these pipelines will by-pass the built-up areas? Will they be perfectly safe? Are they not going to blot out a whole section of the community if an explosion does occur? Even the fire in the oil pipeline at Pietermaritzburg was more than dangerous; it was quite frightening.</p>

<p>I notice also in the report, the new, improved technique with regard to loading air freight on what they call roller bearing floors, with prepacked pallets on scissor operating lift platforms, which expedite the loading and unloading of aeroplanes. We can well imagine how useful that will be in unloading the planes at various ports of entry and how it will expedite the clearance of the passengers, especially in view of the introduction of these enormous aeroplanes that will be in use in the near future. It is also very pleasing to note that reservations are now being computerized for all flights. I think this is really a major step forward.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I would like to speak on harbours. To me it does not seem very long ago, although I expect it does seem long ago to most members, when we were put in a basket<span class="col_2227-2228" refersTo="page_1136"/> on a mail ship in the roadstead at East London and Port Elizabeth, hoisted through the air and dumped on the deck of a tug that was careering around on a terrific swell. We then had to be taken over the bar, as they called it, especially at East London, into the harbour. Including myself 50 per cent of the passengers on the tug were seasick. Mr. Speaker, those are things of the past. New extensions were made at Port Elizabeth and these large vessels could then come in and be berthed. I recall the terrific explosion which was set off at East London by the Minister, if I am not mistaken, to widen the turning basin in Buffalo Harbour. The explosion was so terrific that at that moment I thought that half of East London was going to be dumped into the Buffalo River. Those vessels then came in and turned in the turning basin. Sir, those things only live in our memories now and these harbours are now entirely inadequate. Even Durban, which is the biggest harbour and which handles about 55 per cent of all the traffic in our harbours in South Africa, is completely out of date. Since the last war, vessels have increased rapidly in size and since the closing of the Suez Canal we have these enormous tankers, the tonnages of which increase by the thousand. These tankers cannot enter our harbours; they have to by-pass us. Our harbours can no longer handle that type of traffic. I believe the Minister said that here in Cape Town he is not in a position to give us a passenger terminal because the figures show that approximately 2,000 fewer passengers were embarking and re-embarking in the harbour, and yet the 1967-&#x2019;68 figures show that no fewer than 56.682 passengers embarked and that 85.573 disembarked in all the harbours. Sir, oversea passenger traffic is rapidly increasing. I have a cutting here from the <i>Natal Witness</i> of 7th March, 1969, a few days ago. I do not want to weary the House by quoting the whole of this cutting but I do want to quote this portion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The <i>Oriana</i> has been at sea since November. visiting the United States, the Far East and Australia. Together with another P &amp; O liner, <i>Orcades,</i> also in Durban yesterday, the <i>Oriana</i> brought more than 3,000 tourists to South Africa. P &amp; O lines owns 11 passenger ships&#x2014;the largest passenger operating fleet in the world. It has now entered the South Africa/U.K. trade. The estimate is that in terms of promotion, stores, fuel, port charges and tourism P &amp; O lines will spend about R1,723,000 in the Republic during 1969.</block>

<p>And the Minister tells us that Cape Town does not justify a passenger terminal!</p>

<p>Then there is another matter which was mentioned by the hon. member for Salt River, and that is that the Administration has accepted the majority report to extend the Cape Town harbour and not to go on with the Rietvlei harbour. We were shown this latter harbour in Pretoria at the offices of the C.S.I.R. I believe it took a very long time to investigate this project. It must have cost a lot of money and I understand that they recommended it. Do we now go against the recommendations of Departments like the C.S.I.R. and make their work futile, apart from the waste of money? Sir, then I would like to ask whether the time has not come for the harbours to be separated from the railways and treated as an autonomous administration. I see in the Press that the Natal University has made a very thorough investigation into the Durban harbour and probably all the harbours of South Africa. They must have done a very thorough job. They are all highly educated people and it took them eight years to finish this investigation. I should like to mention some of the more salient features mentioned by them. They say that progress and change are the same and that progressive people should rise to the occasion and accept this. The British transport authorities during 1965 split the whole system into independent undertakings. The ports should be similar to the post office, which has now become autonomous. There is no reason why the Railways should control the ports merely because they cart the goods. All arguments point the other way. Port traffic is irregular, subject to unexpected fluctuations and operated by independent owners. The port captain has to deal with many complex problems: berthing, sizes of ships, and cargoes of all descriptions. His customers are international and weather is his biggest worry. He requires skill and experience in shipping and the highest degree of managerial ability. All that is required is liaison between the Railways and the Provincial and Government authorities, especially Defence as far as the safety of the State is concerned. This co-operation has been achieved in all major ports in Europe, America, the Far East, Australia and New Zealand. Separation would require re-allocation but I cannot see that it would pose any problem whatsoever. The profit of the Durban harbour has been R15 million during the two years 1967 and 1968. Under independent management, all this revenue could have been ploughed back instead of only one-third as is the case to-day. Sir, port revenue must be used for expansion to keep up with progress. If this had been done in the past, we would not have been in this pickle at the present time. The exporters, the importers, the passengers, the tourists and the businessmen are the people who make the contribution to the national revenue. The more goods the ports can handle and the quicker they can handle it, the more revenue can be earned in the inland areas. This matter is so serious that the Durban Chamber of Commerce, normally a very silent body on this vital subject, has come forward with a challenge. We must remember that the development of the Richard&#x2019;s Bay harbour must be bold, but it must also be remembered that it is not the be all and end all; the other harbours must and will have to play their part.</p>

<p>I listened attentively to the previous speaker, and I jotted down a few notes here, but it would seem to me as though there are not many problems on his side. Amongst other things he spoke of the inadequate facilities on the Blue Train, but we know that the hon. the Minister has announced that ample provision will be made in the future by making additional Blue Trains available. The second question he raised, was that of the staff shortage. His charge was actually that excessive overtime had to be worked in order to perform essential services. The Opposition objects to the tremendous amount of money which has to be paid out annually in respect of overtime.</p>

<p>I must say that in my constituency I have not come across a single person who has the least objection to working overtime. Nor is there such a thing as a member of staff being obliged to work excessive overtime. Then the hon. member for Yeoville said that this excessive overtime overtaxed the staff, the result being that accidents occurred which could have been prevented. I just want to quote a few figures to prove that this statement is not correct either. In 1958 the number of passengers killed was 25; in 1967 it was 21, and that was out of a total of 4,670,000 passengers. Expressed as a percentage, 0.045 passengers were killed in 1967, as against 0.094 in 1958. These figures show that there has been a tremendous drop in the number of accidents. Therefore the hon. member&#x2019;s argument in this respect no longer holds good at all.</p>

<p>Then I just want to mention the following figure to show what a huge undertaking the Railways is. The total works programme of the Railways for next year amounts to R1,429 million. From this it is obvious that the Railways is the largest single undertaking in the country. The Railway Estimates are virtually three-quarters of our country&#x2019;s total Estimates. The effect of the working results of this national transport undertaking should not be underestimated. The business activities of the Railways has an effect on the whole economy of the country. The disinflationary measures taken by the State, particularly in respect of the decrease in imports, have, of course, also had a retarding effect on the economy of the Railways. Right at the beginning I want to express my joy at the improved pension benefits for Railway workers. The increased minimum amounts which have been introduced in respect of Railway pensioners, namely R100 for a married person and R50 for an unmarried person, are tremendous concessions. In this respect I call to mind something which I was told by an old gentleman, Mr. Flip van Coller, from my constituency&#x2014;recently I held a report-back meeting there. He is an ex-Railway worker who retired on pension in 1947 and only earned &#x00A3;5 3s. in those days. To-day that R10.30 has been increased to a minimum of R100 for him and his wife. These people are sincerely grateful for this tremendous increase, and also for the 10 per cent increase in the net annuities paid to pensioners who retired prior to 1968, and the subsequent 5 per cent. These increases mean a great deal, but I think the most important increase is the 2 per cent per year which a pensioner receives for a maximum period of 20 years. We all realize that these people have had to struggle in order to keep pace with the increased cost of living, and that is why we are sincerely grateful for these concessions that have been made, and also for the calculation of pensions which will now be made over the last three years as against the previous terminal period of four years. This has also brought about a great deal of improvement. One has no alternative but to express sincere thanks and appreciation to the Minister and his staff for having made these things possible. In particular I want to say that the interests of those pensioners who have already retired from the service, are being looked after in this Budget. We know that those people built the Railways. They terminated their contract of service and are receiving their due, but this increase which has been introduced now, is extra, and I believe that I am speaking on their behalf when I thank the Minister for this generous manner in which assistance has been granted. This is a very great improvement, particularly with a view to future pensioners as well.</p>

<p>The other question about which there was also a great deal of discussion here, was the shortage of staff. I want to say that I am glad that we are in a fortunate position, especially as members of the House of Assembly. I remember that years ago times were difficult and that people struggled to find employment; sometimes they formed a queue in front of one&#x2019;s office. To-day we are in the position that we have a labour shortage. To me this is preferable to unemployment. This shortage of staff is to be found in virtually every sector of our economic life, and we have been experiencing this for the past few years. In countries where a boom cycle prevails, a manpower shortage is a very common phenomenon. Since we believe in the future of our country and since we believe that we have tremendous potential here and that our riches both below and above-ground have not been exploited fully, we also believe that we are on the eve of a new phase of development, and in this respect transport plays a very important role. The manpower shortage will, of course, remain a pressing and an actual problem in the future, and that is why the national transport undertaking has taken the lead with positive and judicious planning and constructive, purposeful and fast transport. In addition modern training centres have been established where every official in the service is trained to become an expert. I believe that this effective training of the staff is one of the most important measures that has been taken to combat the manpower shortage. The provision of these training facilities,<span class="col_2231-2232" refersTo="page_1138"/> the thorough in-service training for members of the staff, has enhanced the productivity of the Railways. This improvement of their qualifications has improved the services they may render to the Railways, but it has also improved their own position to such an extent that they have been justified in claiming promotion and better remuneration, which has in turn greatly improved their own position.</p>

<p>Mechanization and organization, thorough investigations and work studies, the application of scientific methods and mechanical and technological working improvements, necessitated major capital expenditure over the past few years, such as in respect of the purchase of adequate rolling stock. In 1958 the total investment amounted to R559 million; 10 years later it had increased to R1,978 million, virtually four times as much. This has helped to save manpower. I want to show&#x2014;and this is the point I want to emphasize here&#x2014;that with virtually the same staff establishment the Railways did double the amount of work and was able to function effectively.</p>

<p>I should like to mention these figures: In 1958 our white labour force numbered 110,000; the non-white labour force numbered 122,000, i.e. a total of 232,000. In 1968 there were 114,000 Whites and 108,000 non-Whites, or 10,000 fewer. I want to point out that in spite of this decrease the Railways doubled its efficiency. But a point I want to make merely in passing, is that the number of non-Whites employed showed a decrease of 14,000, whereas the white staff showed an increase of 4,000. Accusations were made in respect of the employment of non-Whites. In this country it is traditional policy for us to believe in job reservation and protecting the white workers. The barb in the great fuss which is being made of the staff shortage, is that the United Party&#x2019;s policy of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; is one of the things with which they are trying to drive in the thin end of the wedge. They want to try to point at the manpower shortage so that we must, as a result, remove the colour bar. If they had been in power to-day, I wonder whether they would not have done the same as was done by ex-Minister Jagger, who dismissed 17,000 white Railway workers and employed non-Whites.</p>

<p>I want to go further by showing that the tonnage of traffic conveyed by the Railways in 1958 was 77 million tons, and 10 years later it was 116.75 million tons, i.e. it was virtually doubled. The number of passengers conveyed in 1958 was 266.75 million, and in 1968 it was 476.5 million. It is very clear from this that the Railways has not stood still and that the amount of work performed has virtually been doubled. These results could not have been achieved if it had not been for the staff that had worked harder, and if it had not been for the steps that had been taken in order to improve the working conditions of the staff. But all of this would have been of no avail if the staff had not been prepared to make their contribution as well, and the National Party guaranteed that. We know that the existing relationship between the Railway staff and the Minister and the Management is of the best. Year after year this has always improved because the seven staff associations of the Railways together with the officials, the General Manager and the Minister have round-table conferences, where they discuss and iron out problems. The fact that we do not have any labour unrest is of no use to us, and the necessary wage increases and adjustments were made from time to time. In 1958, 10 years ago, wages amounted to R208.75 million in all. In 1968 it was R347.75 million. The wage increases over the past 20 years alone, amounted to R250 million. This virtual doubling of salaries and the improvement in pension benefits have afforded Railway officials the opportunity of making the necessary adjustments from time to time in order that they may make a decent living, and it has helped to bring about a better relationship and to make the people realize that they are shareholders in that gigantic organization, i.e. the Railways, and that by working harder they will receive dividends from that organization.</p>

<p>Housing facilities constitute another very important factor. As we believe that the railway servant has to be a happy worker, everything possible has been done to improve the facilities and conditions of service for these people but above all, to improve their housing; for we believe that if one provides the railway servant with proper housing, he will, when he returns from his work, be able to have a happy family life. By doing this we believe that the cradle will be filled and that the railway staff will be afforded the opportunity of realizing themselves. A great deal is being done in this respect. If we look at the amounts of money spent over these past five years under the house-ownership scheme, the assisted building society housing scheme and on departmental housing, we see that over these five years R30,990,000 was spent under the house-ownership scheme, R7,940,000 under the assisted building society housing scheme, and R15,017,152 on departmental housing for Whites. These housing facilities that have been provided, have also made a very significant contribution towards making the railway staff happy and contented. But in addition to that, I believe that the most significant single factor which has helped us to develop the efficiency of the Railways in this manner, has been the contentedness of railway servants. For that reason we must congratulate the hon. the Minister and his officials, in view of the fact that they, together with these staff associations, succeeded in solving these problems, these points of friction and the claims that had arisen in the past. We hope and trust that in the future they will also succeed in maintaining and developing this labour peace which we are experiencing now. In that way the efficiency of the Railways will be enhanced from time to time. I want to extend to the hon. the Minister my hearty congratulations on these<span class="col_2233-2234" refersTo="page_1139"/> outstanding Estimates which he has presented. We are proud of him.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down, thanked and congratulated the Minister on several occasions during the course of his speech. He spoke about the satisfaction of the Railways staff. However, it is interesting to look at some figures, particularly in regard to the last three years. If we study these figures, we find that resignations alone accounted for 26,017 workers over the last three years. 22,814 workers absconded. This means that a total of 48,831 white employees either absconded or resigned during the last three years. A total of 60,000 white employees left the service during those three years, Sir. As I have said, of those 60,000 nearly 50,000 resigned or absconded. I believe that, if there is such great satisfaction in the Railways, surely these figures demand some sort of explanation and investigation. If we study the figures for the last three years, we find that they are rather alarming as far as the position of the Railways is concerned. In 1966 18,698 white employees terminated their services in the Railways. There were 19,050 new employees. This means that there was a net gain of 352. In 1967 20,595 left the service, and there were 20,352 new employees. This means that there was a net loss of 243 white employees. The hon. the Minister has given us figures for 1968 which show that there was a net gain of 1,947 workers during that year. Sir, if our railway service is to continue to expand and to grow, and to meet the demands and the needs of a growing economy, surely we require a greater inflow of white employees in the railway services.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Deputy Ministers of Transport have changed from time to time, but whether for the good or not, we do not know at this stage. However, the position for the last three years is that over 60,000 workers have left the service.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have heard a great deal about pension benefits. Here I believe the Minister has taken an important step forward in the modernization of his system in regard to the Superannuation Fund and Railway pensioners in general. I should like to compliment his inter-departmental committee, which has obviously made important recommendations which the Minister has accepted in part in many cases. If you look at the position last year, Sir, you soon realize that very little was really done for the pensioner in 1968. Last year provision was made for the temporary allowance means test to be abolished. But how many people did this really affect? In March, 1968, there were 25,434 railway pensioners and 10,349 railway widow pensioners. This meant a total of 35,783. But at that time 31,225 were already receiving the temporary allowance, Therefore the benefits which were derived from last year&#x2019;s announcement of the 1st October, 1968, really only benefited 4,558 people who were not receiving the temporary allowance. I believe that the improvements which have been made could go a step further, particularly in regard to the temporary allowance. The hon. the Minister, in the course of his speech, mentioned that they were awaiting the actuarial report for the five-year period and that no further recommendation had been made concerning the temporary allowance. But it would appear that it would be to the great advantage of the railway pensioner if this temporary allowance, or cost-of-living allowance, as some people have named it, were incorporated and consolidated in the railway pensions. It would appear that the temporary allowance has become accepted and that it has become a permanent allowance. There is no means test in regard to its application. There is no possibility, as far as one can see, of the cost of living decreasing. In fact, the Government has accepted that fact, and will be instituting a scheme from the 1st April, where the pension will be increased by 2 per cent per annum compounded. This is a step in the right direction when one considers the modern concept of pension schemes.</p>

<p>In recent times we have seen that group pension schemes have made tremendous strides in this particular regard. Taking into account the decreasing purchasing power of money, it has become increasingly necessary to review the pension schemes in the private sector as well as in the Government or public sector. We know that, in terms of present pension schemes, and especially equity-linked group pension schemes, people receive an increase in their pensions either at five-yearly or three-yearly intervals. The Superannuation Fund of the Durban Corporation has a scheme whereby the cost of living allowance, as they call it, is increased by 2 per cent every five years. The hon. the Minister has accepted a figure of 2 per cent. However, there are many who estimate the rate of inflation at something like 3 per cent per year. It would appear, therefore, that the Minister has accepted a figure which is slightly lower than that which is accepted to be the normal rate of inflation during normal times, namely approximately 3 per cent per year. This is, however, a step in the right direction towards modernizing our present Superannuation Fund Pension Scheme. We know that there are assets totalling some R500 million in investments, which are held by the Superannuation Fund. We know that the Superannuation Fund, according to the latest available figures, should quite easily be able to absorb the increased amounts which will be paid from that fund, in terms of the general increase in pensions.</p>

<p>However, the interesting point here is to analyse, as far as one can from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech, what the effect will be on the actual pension paid. There is no doubt that in some instances pensioners will receive considerable<span class="col_2235-2236" refersTo="page_1140"/> increments. However, there is one group which will have to be satisfied with an increase of only R6 per month in the case of a married person, and R3 per month, in the case of a single person. Here I refer to the older pensioner, the man who has perhaps already been on pension for a period of 20 years. In his particular case, his basic pension is extremely low. I have taken the trouble, in several cases, to calculate the increase in pensions. I have found that this is one particular group which will have to be satisfied with the small increase of only R6 per month in the case of a married pensioner. Let us take the case of the older pensioner. If he is receiving a basic pension of approximately R30 per month, it means that, together with his temporary allowance, his increase of 2 per cent compounded over a 20-year period, which will amount to an average of 48.4 per cent, and his 10 per cent increase, his basic pension will be increased by R17.51 per month. This amount, however, plus his temporary allowance and the supplementary allowance of just over R17, will give him the minimum figure of R100 per month. So in actual fact the increase in his basic pension does not really result in any direct increase to him, apart from an increase of R6 per month, because of the supplementary allowance. The hon. the Minister, in the course of his Budget Speech, referred to the implications of this increment, together with the supplementary allowance, as it affects those persons receiving the minimum pensions. These people will therefore not enjoy any further increase until such time as the Government decides that they can grant a larger amount than the minimum pension received. If a person has already been on pension for 20 years, he will not receive the extra 2 per cent compounded which others who have not yet been on pension for a period of 20 years, will receive. So this particular group, in terms of the system outlined by the hon. the Minister, really will have to wait until the hon. the Minister, in his wisdom, from time to time increases the minimum pension payable in that particular case.</p>

<p>Then there is the position of the Railway pensioner who as a married man receiving R100 per month can by prudent living manage to exist on that income. One often finds that when a person becomes a single person due to becoming a widow or widower, such a person immediately has his or her income halved. I believe that the hon. the Minister should give some consideration to this particular aspect. It is obviously difficult for a person who suddenly has his income halved from R100 per month to R50 per month to exist on that amount. The single person without dependants receiving R50 per month, will find it extremely difficult to be able to readjust his living costs and living expenses to exist on only R50 per month. I should therefore like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should give it consideration that the minimum pension payable in the case of a single person without dependants should not be 50 per cent of the rate payable to a married man, but 66 &#x2154;rds per cent. This, I believe, would assist that person because in terms of accommodation and such like it is easier for them to live as a couple on R100 per month than it is for the surviving spouse to have to live on 50 per cent of what they were previously receiving.</p>

<p>There is another aspect regarding which I believe the hon. the Minister can do a service towards railway pensioners and that is for him to approach the Minister of Finance to see whether any steps can be taken to assist as far as taxation paid on pensions is concerned. Many railwaymen find it extremely difficult as it is, and when they are called upon also to pay income tax, their troubles are further increased.</p>

<p>I have mentioned earlier the question of the large number of resignations in the Railways. I believe this presents a very real problem not only in regard to the running and the efficient administration of the Railways when there is such a tremendous turnover in staff, but also in regard to the present system concerning the payment of pension moneys on resignation. The Cilliers Committee of Inquiry on Pension Fund Matters which was set up by the hon. the Minister of Finance, certainly made very strong recommendations in regard to the preservation of pension rights. I would like to suggest that the hon. the Minister should refer the recommendations of this committee to this interdepartmental subcommittee which has been investigating the whole question of the pension schemes of the Railways together with the superannuation fund pension scheme. It is important that the preservation of pension rights should be maintained if it is at all possible. Other suggestions have been made from time to time by other persons connected with pension funds which I believe could also receive the consideration of the hon. the Minister and his subcommittee. These suggestions are in respect of a non-contributory scheme concerning staff which would obviate the tremendous difficulty that arises where a person resigns merely to obtain immediate monetary gain. If a system of non-contributory pension for those employed by the Railway for at least the first ten years of their service is adopted, it would mean that some of those persons who have resigned merely for the purpose of obtaining their pension benefits would be discouraged from doing so as there would be no immediate lump sum payment being made to them. I believe that this would to a certain extent discourage people who are keen to resign merely to obtain benefits which have been added to and put aside for the purposes of retirement and not for any immediate cash lump sum investment.</p>

<p>Whilst dealing with this question of the resignations and the effect on the fund as well, I would also like the hon. the Minister to give an explanation in regard to the number of absconders as far as the Railway staff is concerned and also its effect on the Superannuation<span class="col_2237-2238" refersTo="page_1141"/> Fund. Could the hon. the Minister explain to us the position of a person who is listed as an absconder and who is no longer in the service in regard to payments concerning the Superannuation Fund and benefits that might have accrued to him during that time? If we look at the figures, we will see that there is an increasing number as far as absconders are concerned. In 1966 there were 7,006, in 1967 there were 7,522 and in 1968 it reached a new height of 8,286. I believe that the hon. the Minister could give some explanation as to the reason why there should be such a high number of absconders.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of improving the pension scheme of the Railways the hon. the Minister said that it would also assist in the recruitment of staff. Here I believe the hon. the Minister is taking a step which could bring about such a situation. We know that the Railways can offer a good deal to people who wish to make a career in the Railways. It can offer security and advancement to a certain extent. The fringe benefits will be further enhanced by the modernization of the present pension scheme in terms of the Superannuation Fund. I think that there are some other benefits or other aspects that one should look at as well. Here I believe the hon. the Minister could give attention to providing a more suitable uniform as far as the running staff are concerned. When one looks at the Railway uniforms of guards and ticket examiners and so forth, particularly during the hot summer months, one can only sympathize with them for having to wear such a hot serge uniform. I believe that if the hon. the Minister followed the example of the South African Police where a far more comfortable summer uniform has been designed, it would assist too in the general efficiency of his Railway staff if they are more comfortably attired in a summer uniform rather than a uniform which is extremely hot to endure during hot summer months.</p>

<p>The Railway undertaking is the largest undertaking in the Republic. We realize that the developments that take place to a great extent depend on the efficiency of the Railways. We know that there are certain sectors of the economy which have complained about inefficiency from time to time. However, we believe that an important new approach to the recruitment of staff is necessary, and I believe that it would be advisable for the hon. the Minister to devise a modern system of recruitment to attract people to the Railway service so that they can really feel that they have a future and a career before them when joining the Railway service. Unfortunately in some respects&#x2014;I know it is the case as far as various juvenile affairs boards and vocational guidance courses are concerned&#x2014;people have adopted an attitude that if one cannot get a job anywhere one might as well go to the Railways and work there. This I believe is an unfortunate attitude and is one which I believe has to be rectified wherever possible so as to ensure that a career on the Railways will be a well worthwhile career.</p>

<p>I would like to deal with another aspect which also is related to development and advancement. That is in regard to the proposed oil tanker off-loading terminal or buoy which has been applied for and which I believe has been accepted in principle by the hon. the Ministers of Agriculture, Transport and Economic Affairs. According to a reply that was given in the House to a question that I put to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture on Tuesday the 4th March, the hon. the Minister indicated that this had been approved in principle but details were still to be worked out by the departments concerned for final consideration by the Government. Mr. Speaker, as far as advancement is concerned, we realize that this is a step forward with regard to the problem of dealing with oil tankers, particularly the large oil tankers of 100,000 to 200,000 tons which can now be off-loaded at sea by means of an off-shore terminal. I believe that there are some 15 such terminals in existence in various parts of the world. The concern is, however, that there are certain dangers involved in regard to this means of discharging the oil, the danger of leakage or seepage and also the danger in regard to the coupling of the flexible pipe joining a pipeline at sea. Then there is also the question of the currents. We know that the currents, particularly on the Natal coast, move inshore and if there should be any leakage or seepage, it could do a tremendous amount of damage in the form of the pollution of the Natal coast. We know that the Natal coast is regarded as the premier holiday resort for the entire Republic and it would bring about a loss of many millions of rand, should anything occur which could pollute the beaches in such a manner. However, I believe that certain investigations have been carried out so as to ensure that no such leakages can occur or can be reduced to an absolute minimum, should they occur. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister if he would perhaps, during the course of his reply to this debate, be able to make a statement in regard to this off-shore oil terminal, which is a cause of a great deal of concern and consternation amongst many people living in Natal and, indeed, consternation amongst the people living in the country as a whole. There is the question of the development of Richard&#x2019;s Bay as a premier harbour, and I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has given due consideration to suggestions that this terminal should be situated in the vicinity of Richard&#x2019;s Bay. We know that the pipeline at Richard&#x2019;s Bay will be nearing completion in the not too distant future. It would be possible to establish such an off-shore terminal at Richard&#x2019;s Bay and this would perhaps fit in with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s previous statements that Richard&#x2019;s Bay is to be developed as a premier harbour in South Africa. If this off-shore terminal is to be established in the Durban area, it would certainly appear that the long-term establishments of Richard&#x2019;s Bay, as a premier port, could not be included as far as the offshore<span class="col_2239-2240" refersTo="page_1142"/> terminal is concerned. The dangers mentioned would obviously also exist at Richard&#x2019;s Bay, as they would exist at the off-shore terminal in the Isipingo vicinity. However, I would be pleased if the hon. the Minister could give some indication by way of a statement in regard to this matter when he replies to the debate, since this possibility that pollution could occur along the Natal South Coast, is a matter of serious public concern.</p>

<p>The overall development of our harbours is obviously of great importance. We know that the closing of the Suez Canal has brought about a great increase in the revenue as far as our harbours are concerned. The position as far as the future development of Durban Harbour is concerned, is that numerous statements have been made and that a thorough survey has also been conducted by the Durban Chamber of Commerce and the University of Natal, dealing with this question. As far as the maintaining of its position as premier port of South Africa is concerned, it would appear that the Durban Harbour will lag behind in certain respects unless vast improvements are carried out. We have seen that large vessels such as the <i>United States,</i> which was able to visit Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, has been unable to call at Durban Harbour because of the narrowness of the entrance.</p>

<p>The development of South Africa is of great importance. This hon. Minister has the authority and responsibility to keep abreast of the development that is taking place. We as the Opposition believe that it is our duty to point out to the hon. the Minister and to this House the various shortcomings which we believe should be rectified. Therefore we hope that the suggestions which come from this side of the House will receive the due consideration of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Umbilo must excuse me for not following up on what he has said immediately, but I will return in a few moments to the argument which was raised by the United Party.</p>

<p>On behalf of my voters I should like to convey my sincere gratitude and appreciation to the hon. the Minister and the General Management for the concessions which have been made in respect of the Railway pensioners. I am not offering any excuse for doing so, because I represent a great majority of them in the House, and that is why I want to convey my gratitude and appreciation to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I should like to bring a staff matter to the attention of the Minister, which is that the procedure in connection with the employment of staff can be amended to a certain extent. I just want to suggest something. I am referring to applicants who were formerly employed by the Administration and whose service records are from time to time requested by other centres as soon as the application forms are handed in at the relevant employment offices. This procedure results in unavoidable delays lasting from one to two months. In many cases the applicants have to wait out this period before they are notified as to whether they have qualified for employment. In most cases these people are former married officials with dependants. I should like to ask whether it is not possible that the service records of such people be requested per telephone, so that the applicant can be notified of the Administration&#x2019;s decision as rapidly as possible. If this suggestion of mine is impracticable, is there not a possibility that that applicant, particularly in view of the fact that there is a pressing shortage of manpower, can be employed immediately in an existing vacancy, provided there is a vacancy, and possibly also kept on in a casual capacity while the Administration is waiting for the service record? When the service record turns up, and it appears that the person is not acceptable, his services can be terminated. If he can in fact be employed, he is then employed with effect from the day on which the Administration made use of his services for the first time. Then he has a productive period of service behind him, which is to his advantage and also to the advantage of the Administration. This suggestion of mine will also, in my humble opinion, contribute to a possible alleviation to a certain extent of the shortage of staff. It will also, in my opinion, result in more recruits being drawn, even though they are former officials who rendered very good service in the past to the Railways. A former official who turns to the Administration again regrets what he did in the past, when he possibly did the wrong thing, and the mere fact that he has returned is further proof that he is evincing, on his part, an honest attempt to rehabilitate himself in some respect or other. The actions of such an applicant redound, in my opinion, to the credit of the Administration, because it is further proof that that particular person resigned to find some other means of subsistence and that he did not succeed in doing so. Quite possibly he found a poorer means of subsistence than the service of the Administration offered him. It is an irrefutable fact that most former officials who apply for re-employment deserve a chance to be rehabilitated and in this way to supplement to a certain extent the shortage of staff. There are some of them who resigned in order to get their pensions, others resigned because disciplinary action had been taken against them, others again were dismissed because of misbehaviour or their services were terminated owing to a poor health record, and there are also hopeless cases. My experience has been that most cases are persons who apply for re-employment belong to that group where the pressing shortage exists at present, i. e. station foremen, conductors, shunters, stokers and to a lesser extent checkers and railworkers. I would appreciate it very much if the hon. the Minister will keep this suggestion, which I am offering him in all honesty in mind and ask the Management whether a <span class="col_2241-2242" refersTo="page_1143"/>solution cannot possibly be found in order to simplify that employment process.</p>

<p>Before I return to the arguments which were raised by the United Party I must tell you that I listened very attentively to the arguments of the members on the opposite side of the House. It immediately put me in mind of the speech which the hon. member for Walmer made in his constituency during November of last year on the occasion of a &#x201C;United Party dinner&#x201D; where 80 people were present. There the hon. member said&#x2014;I am surprised that the hon. member is still sitting on the United Party side of the House&#x2014;that the United Party was a slumbering party, I sat listening to them, and I must tell you that as far as Railway matters are concerned, they are a slumbering party, from the hon. member for Yeoville down.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Can the hon. member give any proof of that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#swiegers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. G. SWIEGERS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says I must give proof of that. I do not want to go into that any further. It was reported in the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> of 8th November, 1968, and he believes every word which is written in that newspaper. I have the clipping here. In spite of the pressing staff shortage it is informative to look up the annual report of the General Manager. That we did not get from the side of the United Party this afternoon. I do not have the time to submit all the facts contained in the report to you, but we find that in spite of the pressing shortage the Railways Administration has in many respects accomplished a great deal. I do not have the time this evening to elaborate on that. The report is available and everyone can read it for themselves.</p>

<p>I should like to receive a clear reply from the United Party in regard to the question of the pressing shortage which they have such a great deal to say about. The hon. member for Yeoville and numerous other speakers on that side spoke about it here this afternoon, but the hon. member for Yeoville did not come forward this afternoon with the same solution with which he came forward last year. He merely said that the hon. the Minister was trying to eliminate the pressing shortage on the Railways by means of excessive overtime and Sunday time. Let me repeat this afternoon what has already been said here. I must do this because Uitenhage is an important railway centre. Do you know what my greatest difficulty is? It is to get former officials reemployed, and to get men working in sections where overtime and Sunday time is not worked, into posts where they can work overtime and Sunday time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Then the basic salary is inadequate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#swiegers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. G. SWIEGERS</person>:</from>

<p>We hear the hon. member saying that the salary is inadequate. We can accept everything, but we cannot accept that the staff are complaining about overtime and Sunday time. If that is in fact acceptable, then I find it very strange that the staff associations which, as the hon. Minister said, are very competent watchdogs, have not up to this stage complained about this matter. What are the facts? The staff associations are requesting the management from time to time to increase Sunday time and overtime scales. They have never asked for overtime and Sunday time to be abolished; never have they made complaints in this respect. However, what did we hear to-day? Complaints in this connection were put in by the hon. member for Durban (Point) and a few other hon. members opposite who still have a few railway voters left in their constituency. Not a single member on this side stated that there were complaints in this regard. I maintain that those complaints simply do not exist Thousands of railway officials are not working overtime. The United Party does not have the courage of its convictions to request that overtime should be curtailed, to say nothing of abolished! I challenge them to request the Minister to curtail overtime and Sunday time. They will not do so, they dare not do so.</p>

<p>Another matter I want to deal with is what we must do to alleviate the pressing manpower shortage on the Railways. What is the solution of the United Party? There I am in difficulties straight away because they have two solutions. The hon. member for Yeoville has one solution, and the hon. member for Karoo, who is a member of the United Party caucus, has another solution. What is the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2019;s solution? Let us see what he said on 20th March. 1968. I am quoting from Hansard, vol. 22. col. 2509. That was the solution at the time, but he did not mention that solution this afternoon. At the time he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Minister will recall that we discussed the same matter two years ago; at that stage I put it to him that he ought to negotiate with the trade unions and to enter into an agreement with them to open some of the lower-paid grades of employment to the non-Whites. I emphasized that he could only do so with the concurrence of the staff associations concerned.</block>

<p>He added that if the Minister could not negotiate with them the Minister should resign. Now I wonder which of the two, the hon. member for Yeoville or the hon. member for Durban (Point), is going to be Minister of Transport when the United Party comes into power. That is a matter which they must settle between them. If they come into power what are they going to do if the staff associations do not want to concur? I want to assert this afternoon that the staff associations will not be amenable to any negotiations in that respect, because the seven staff associations represent<span class="col_2243-2244" refersTo="page_1144"/> the white staff in the employ of the Administration, and that is their policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It has already happened under this Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#swiegers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. G. SWIEGERS</person>:</from>

<p>It may have happened, but all the negotiations which the Minister has held up to now have always produced good results, and that is more than the hon. member can say. What about the hon. member for Karoo? On 18th March, 1968, he made a speech in this connection. As far as the railway officials and myself are concerned it was an extremely important speech. Certain statements were made here which no white staff member of the Administration can accept. The hon. member for Karoo would not mention a single word about those in the lower wage brackets. I am quoting from Hansard, vol. 22, col. 2373&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All the top jobs, and the higher grades, with higher scales of pay on the Railways are filled exclusively by white people. I believe the hon. the Minister should tackle this.</block>

<p>What does he mean by that? Not only is he reproaching the Minister, but it is in addition a damning statement to make. He is saying by implication that those posts should be filled by Coloureds. That is so. The hon. member for Karoo went further and in col. 2374 he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am convinced that if Coloured men could enjoy bursaries and scholarships from the Railways to qualify, for instance in the engineering, they would not leave the service but would be so thankful and grateful that they would stay. Moreover the Minister would have good and loyal servants, people who would be interested in their work and carry out their duties efficiently.</block>

<p>What kind of insinuation does that contain? I know of no engineer who does not supervise white staff. If a Coloured were then to be appointed as engineer, as the hon. member for Karoo desires, that Coloured will have to supervise white workers. That is absolutely unacceptable to us. In the last phrase the hon. member intimated that the engineers who were in fact employed, did not comply with the requirements. That is the only logical deduction one can make. [Interjections.] I am not talking to the hon. member for Yeoville now; I am now dealing with the hon. member for Karoo, and it is a pity that he is not present here. The last statement made by the hon. member for Karoo is really an extreme one. I am quoting from the same Hansard, col. 2374&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact is that the Railways is a national project, an undertaking which concerns the entire country, and it should employ as many people as qualify for the vacancies, irrespective of the colour of their skins.</block>

<p>He did not say a single word about those in the lower-income brackets. He said nothing about the staff associations having to give their consent first. There was nothing of that nature.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal also made a speech in this House last year and he said precisely the same as the hon. member for Yeoville had said, except that he did not talk about those in the lower wage brackets. He made the same speech as that made by the hon. member for Karoo. I would just like to quote a few phrases from the speech made by the hon. member for Port Natal, as recorded in col. 2417, when he was talking about the increase in the number of passengers. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surely the increase in non-white passenger fares should result in an increasing number of Bantu workers in the service. But that does not seem to be the case.</block>

<p>According to him the criteria for the number of non-Whites which should be employed is the fact that passenger services are being expanded in that respect, and non-Whites must be employed regardless of whether there are Whites available or not.</p>

<p>But let me return to the hon. member for Karoo. He went further and in his speech of 18th March he stated that the stewards employed on the main-line passenger trains and on our aircraft and elsewhere should be replaced by non-Whites. That is then, according to him, the obvious solution. I now want to ask him whether an Airways steward, a senior flight steward, a chief flight steward, people whose salaries vary from R2,025 per annum to R2,850 per annum are people in the lower wage brackets? Then we have the stewardesses whose salaries vary from R1,575 per year to R1,800 per year. On the trains we have learner stewards, stewards, senior stewards and chief stewards, with salaries which vary from R79.50 to R195 per month. Are they among the lowest paid workers in the employ of the Administration? The time has now come when the opposite side should tell us who the persons in the lower wage brackets in the employ of the Administration are. They must tell us who these people are whom they want to replace.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville stated that if there are Whites who cannot be promoted then they must be provided with sheltered employment. But this is being done on the Railways every day. There are Whites, shunters and others, who are injured, and they then do sheltered employment. The speaker on that side of the House who is going to speak after me must tell us where we stand. He must tell us<span class="col_2245-2246" refersTo="page_1145"/> whether the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2019;s statement is the policy statement of the United Party, and whether the hon. member for Karoo&#x2019;s speech represents their policy. We must know that before the end of this debate.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who just sat down forgot to thank the hon. member who spoke just before him, namely the hon. member for Umbilo, for what I think was a very valuable contribution indeed to this debate. I think it was a very fine speech and a positive and valuable contribution to the debate. The hon. member for Uitenhage made a speech which, together with many others made on that side, I would call a purely political speech. If the hon. Minister could load his trains with political speeches made on that side, he would have full loads for many a long day to come. When he listens to some of the speeches made on his side of the House, I think he must regret the fact that they are not of such practical quality that they can be loaded into his trains&#x2014;they are just wasted into thin air &#x2026;</p>

<p>I should like to deal with a matter which arises from these Estimates, and that is the general principle of the maintenance of our narrow-gauge lines as part of our Railway system here in South Africa. They are a relic from days long past and I wonder whether the time has not come for something to be done about them. The hon. the Minister is fairly flush with money from the various departments which he administers, and I think he might have a fresh look at this whole question. Money is being spent at the present time on the re-sleeping and relaying of some of these lines, and heavy metals are being installed on some of the narrow-gauge lines to carry heavier loads, and so forth. They are an anachronism to-day. In the light of our economic development and the development facing us, which we cannot avoid, we must do something. Our industrial and economic development to-day are such that we must say, &#x201C;Surely these relics of a bygone age should be discarded.&#x201D; If a decision is taken to change over, it cannot be implemented within a year or two. The changeover from narrow-gauge to broad-gauge lines as a matter of policy must take quite an appreciable time before it is put into effect. In the meantime we are spending millions of rands on the maintenance of these narrow-gauge lines which can never bring interest on the capital invested.</p>
