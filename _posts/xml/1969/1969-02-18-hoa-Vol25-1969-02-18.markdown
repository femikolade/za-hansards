<heading>Non-Whites attending cinemas with Whites in country areas</heading>

<question by="#taylor" to="#minister_of_community_development">

<num>*4.</num>

<from>Mrs. C. D. TAYLOR</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Community Development:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether non-Whites have been prohibited from attending cinemas together with Whites in country areas; if so, (a) in how many cases and (b) in how many cases were separate seating arrangements in force;</li>

<li>(2) whether he intends taking similar action in further cases; if so, in how many cases;</li>

<li>(3) whether the Provincial Administration has in each case been consulted in terms of the Separate Amenities Ordinance;</li>

<li><span class="col_0891-0892" refersTo="page_0465"/>(4) whether any attempt is made to provide alternative entertainment for non-Whites;</li>

<li>(5) whether any representations have been made or are to be made to the Price Controller by his Department in regard to admission prices for Whites in consequence of the exclusion of non-Whites.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_community_development" to="#taylor">

<from>The MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) The Group Areas Act prohibits the attendance by disqualified persons of cinema shows in group areas unless authorized by a permit. An owner of a cinema who wishes to proceed with the admission of a mixed audience after the area in which the cinema is situated has been proclaimed as a group area, must therefore apply for a permit.<br/>The policy of my Department, which exercises permit control in group areas, is that where cinemas in Coloured and/or Indian areas already exist, permits are not granted for the attendance of those racial groups of cinemas in the White areas. In cases where White cinemas have traditionally been attended by disqualified persons and alternative cinema facilities in non-White areas do not yet exist, permit applications are sympathetically considered provided satisfactory separate seating and other facilities are effected. As soon as alternative cinemas are made available for those disqualified persons, the permits are withdrawn. The hon. member presumably refers to permits withdrawn in this manner.

<ol>

<li>(a) Only two permits in respect of mixed attendance of cinemas in rural White group areas have already been withdrawn.</li>

<li>(b) In both cases separate seating arrangements were in force.</li></ol></li>

<li>(2) As mentioned in f (1), permits are withdrawn as alternative cinema facilities become available in Coloured and Indian group areas.</li>

<li>(3) No.</li>

<li>(4) The Coloured group is encouraged by the Coloured Development Corporation which falls under another Minister, to establish, for instance, cinemas in its own areas with financial assistance from the Corporation, whilst the Indian group acts independently in this regard. Wherever possible, my Department encourages the provision by local authorities of separate recreational facilities for Coloureds and Indians in their own areas.</li>

<li>(5) No.</li>

</ol>

<p>For the information of the hon. member, I wish to mention that occupation by Bantu is controlled by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<li>(a) The Pella Moraviese Broederkerk (Coloured) applied for a permit to authorize the &#x201C;Sand Pipers&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Frankie Laine Show&#x201D; to perform in the Luxurama to Coloureds on two successive Sunday evenings, namely the 14th and 21st January, 1968.</li>

<li>(b) The Church wished to arrange the two functions with a view to the raising of funds for a building programme, which would have been in contravention of the law of the country relating to entertainment on Sundays. Furthermore, the permission of the City Council in terms of the Lord&#x2019;s Day Observance Act No. 19/1895 was also not submitted.</li></ol></li>

<p>asked the Minister of Transport:</p>

<p>Whether consideration has been given to the provision of telephone facilities in express trains operating in the Republic; if so, what conclusions have been reached; if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#wood">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<p>Yes; the question of providing a telephone service on trains to enable passengers to make calls through the Post Office network has been considered, but the feasibility of introducing such a service cannot be determined until a comprehensive radio network to receive the calls is available. In planning future communication facilities, however, the possibility of providing such a service will be borne in mind.</p>

<li>(2) (a) and (b) No conclusive proof has been found that diet deficiencies are contributory factors in dental decay and disease. Data indicate that dental decay is caused by unbalanced dietary patterns and health education is directed by the Department of Health and local authorities to combat it.</li>

<li>(3) (a) and <i>(b)</i> Yes. Free dental services are available to all school-going Coloured children. Free dental extraction services are rendered to indigents by district surgeons and dentists, and where necessary, they are also provided, free of charge, with dentures. In large cities such as Pretoria, Johannesburg, Cape Town and East London there are dental clinics which are supported by the Department of Health and the Provincial Administrations and local authorities concerned, which are rendering full dental services to persons in the lower income group.</li>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence:</p>

<p>How many national servicemen who have been allocated for training in the South African Navy and Air Force, respectively, during 1969 were so drafted on the grounds of (a) family tradition and/or (b) personal experience in (i) sailing, (ii) diving, (iii) flying or (iv) related activites.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#hughes">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<p>The information is not readily available as selection boards are not required to state the reasons for their recommendations. To obtain the information, several thousand files will have to be perused, and even then <span class="col_0895-0896" refersTo="page_0467"/>accurate information cannot be guaranteed because the recommendations of selection boards are not only based on personal preference or experience in one or other direction which has a connection with the military postings. Other factors such as educational qualifications, occupation, aptitude, etc., and the needs of the various arms of the service are also taken into account with the drafting of national servicemen to a specific arm of the service, corps and posting. The personal choices of national servicemen are acceded to as far as possible.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Sport and Recreation:</p>

<p>Whether he was aware of the Bloemfontein Municipality&#x2019;s attitude to non-White spectators and the lack of accommodation and sports facilities in Bloemfontein when it was decided to stage the South African Games there.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_sport_and_recreation" to="#hughes">

<from>The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION:</from>

<p>The decision to stage the next South African Games in Bloemfontein was reached shortly after similar games were held in Johannesburg during 1964. The request to hold these games in Bloemfontein was made at that time by the South African Olympic and National Games Association and was accepted by the Bloemfontein City Council before the establishment of this Ministry.</p>

<p>The policy of prohibiting non-White spectators from white sporting events in Bloemfontein originated some years before. The City Council is, however, apparently to consider certain representations to be made by the South African Games Committee in the relevant connection.</p>

<p>I am not aware of the lack of sports facilities or accommodation in Bloemfontein to stage this event and have had no complaint from the Olympic Committee or the South African Games Committee who are intimately connected with the organization of these games in this respect, and although I have seen references to these aspects of criticism in the Press, I have preferred to accept the official attitude conveyed to my Department by the Organizing Director of the Games, who is an Under-Secretary of the Department.</p>

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<p>In terms of section 44 of the Community Development Act, 1966, a Community Development Account in respect of an area or a group of areas to which the provisions of the Act have been applied, shall be established. Amounts expended or received in such an area or group of areas in respect of, <i>inter alia,</i> the purchase and sale of property or depreciation and appreciation contributions, are entered without regard to the racial group to or from whom the amounts are paid or received. The statistics asked for are therefore not readily available and whilst more than one thousand group areas have already been proclaimed, it will be appreciated that it would be a colossal task should reference have to be made to the records of each individual transaction since 1959 in order to Table the statistics as required. I regret, therefore, that I cannot reply to the question in the required form.</p>

<heading>TRAIN ACCIDENT AT LANGLAAGTE</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your leave I wish to make the following statement: I regret having to announce that a train accident resulting in loss of life and quite a number of injuries occurred on the Rand yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>At 3.30 p.m. on 17th February, 1969, during shunting operations on the down shunting neck on the Grosvenor side of Langlaagte Station, a shunting train, propelled by an electric unit, collided with a row of petrol tankers drawn by a steam locomotive, at the same time that a Bantu suburban passenger train was passing on the down slow line. The latter train collided with a number of the derailed tankers. Fire broke out and two petrol tankers as well as eight coaches of the suburban passenger train caught alight. Six of the coaches burnt out and two were damaged. Two tankers also burnt out.</p>

<p><span class="col_0917-0918" refersTo="page_0478"/>Overhead electrical equipment, signal equipment and the track were damaged, and no trains could pass through Langlaagte. The electric shunting unit burnt out and the steam locomotive was damaged. Signal equipment and the control panel will be repaired by about 6 p.m. to-day.</p>

<p>Passenger trains to the West Rand have been redirected via Germiston and the Rand mineral lines, and for the Bantu areas trains have been arranged from Faraday and Westgate. Overhead electrical power had been restored on the up slow line between Langlaagte and New Canada by 5.45 p.m. Trains could travel between Johannesburg and Maraisburg via the up main line by means of diesel traction by 6.05 p.m. By 11.00 p.m. the overhead electrical power on this line had been restored. The down main line was cleared at 9.10 p.m. without overhead electrical power. At 4.22 p.m. today the overhead electrical power on this line was switched on. The down slow line was cleared at 8.15 a.m. to-day. Suburban train services were disrupted.</p>

<p>According to the latest information casualties are as follows: 13 Bantu passengers were killed and 157 Bantu passengers were injured, of whom 139 were still being detained in three hospitals at 7 a.m. to-day. Of the railway staff who were injured, two ticket examiners sustained serious burns, while four had minor injuries and one is suffering from shock. A board consisting of senior officials has been appointed to investigate the accident.</p>

<p>I want to express my deepest sympathy with the next of kin of those who died in the accident, and I trust that those who have been injured will recover soon. I also want to exprees my sincere thanks to all who rendered such spontaneous and unselfish assistance at the scene of the accident.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House would like to associate ourselves with the expression of sympathy of the Minister and the good wishes to those who have been injured. At the same time I want to express the hope that the board constituted will find the real cause of the accident.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Kensington asked me earlier on what the financial position of these various funds was. The latest actuarial calculation is for the period ended on 31.3.&#x2019;67. At that date the assets of the various funds were as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Pension Fund, R55,062,000;</block>

<block name="quote">Transvaal Hospital Nurses&#x2019; Pension Fund, R4,834,000;</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_0919-0920" refersTo="page_0479"/>Transvaal Provincial Officials&#x2019; Pension Fund, R15,540,000;</block>

<block name="quote">Cape Teachers&#x2019; Pension Fund, R21,610,000;</block>

<block name="quote">Cape Provincial Officials&#x2019; Pension Fund, R10,495,000;</block>

<block name="quote">Natal Teachers&#x2019; Pension Fund, R13,773,000;</block>

<block name="quote">Natal Provincial Hospital and General Service Pension Fund, R5,266,000;</block>

<block name="quote">Orange Free State Teachers&#x2019; Pension Fund, R12,827,000;</block>

<block name="quote">Orange Free State Hospital Officials&#x2019; Pension Fund, R1,197,000;</block>

<block name="quote">South-West Africa Teachers&#x2019; Pension Fund, R2,739,000;</block>

<block name="quote">South-West Africa Employees&#x2019; Pension Fund, R1,092,000.</block>

<p>The total assets of these funds therefore amount to R144,435,000. But these funds also have liabilities. I do not have the liabilities for every individual fund, but only for each province as a whole. Transvaal has a deficit of R12,777,000 on its three funds, in spite of the assets of those funds; the Cape, R43,445,000; Natal, R2,966,000; and the O.F.S., R1,498,000. Over against these the funds of South-West Africa show a surplus of R511,000.</p>

<p>I hope this information satisfies the hon. member for Kensington.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, through you I want to thank the hon. the Minister for his frank and straightforward statement. I am only sorry that we did not have these figures available to us during the Second Reading debate. Personally I think the situation revealed by these figures warranted a White Paper. It seems that these funds have been conducted in a manner producing losses and that the members subscribing to these funds have had very little security. To me this puts forward a strong case for a non-contributory pension scheme for the Civil Service.</p>

<p>Order!</p>

</speech>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Because this scheme simply does not work on account of the depreciating value of money and, furthermore, the fact that our civil servants are living longer and thereby drawing more in pensions. However, I should like to extend my thanks to the hon. the Minister for assisting us in this way.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>When this Bill was debated during the Second Reading the Deputy Minister was asked by this side of the House why it was that Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation was excluded from this Bill. This clause provides that when damages are assessed for loss of support as the result of a person&#x2019;s death, the benefits accruing from an insurance policy, or from a friendly society or from a trade union, shall not be taken into account for that purpose. The principle is a very good one and we approve of it. It appears that an award under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is excluded&#x2014;in other words, it must be taken into account when assessing damages. We want to know on what basis it was being excluded. It seems to me that this exclusion is on the basis that it is a statutory payment&#x2014;therefore a compulsory payment and not a voluntary provision by the breadwinner concerned for the future. Could the hon. the Deputy Minister clarify this position for us to-day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Apparently the hon. member&#x2019;s objection rests on the provisions of section 40 of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. This section deals with the compensation payable in respect of a workman as a result of an accident causing his death. Well, the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is not affected at all by this legislation. This Bill deals with damages, and damages only. It only deals with the loss of maintenance by reason of the death of the breadwinner caused by the negligence of a third party. The Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act deals with compensation. In the case of <i>Table Bay Stevedores</i> v. <i>S.A. Railways and Harbours,</i> 1959, Appeal Judge Hoexter in interpreting section 8 of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What the workman recovers from his employer under the Act remains compensation and nothing but compensation. I find myself unable to say that an action for recovery of such compensation is an action for damages.</block>

<p>Here we are dealing with damages and damages only. We are not dealing with compensation. A workman will get that compensation in any case. In other words, if a workman institutes an action for damages on the ground of negligence he can recover such damages besides his compensation.</p>

<block name="quote">(a) to assist in promoting public health in the Republic.</block>

<p>I have suggested to the hon. the Minister that this wording be altered to read &#x201C;to assist in promoting the health of the people&#x201D;. I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree with me that when doctors speak about &#x201C;public health&#x201D;, what they have in mind is the health of a section of the people in a limited sphere. Such as infections, fevers or sanitation. It is the expression that is used where the Government has delegated its powers to local authorities and where those powers are exercised by the medical officer of health for the town or city. I move as an amendment therefore&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I deal now with the other paragraphs of clause 3? Generally speaking I feel that (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) are paragraphs which could easily be shortened without altering the context. It becomes difficult when you go through a long list of objects to see the difference between what is stated in the subsections and then to find what is virtually a repetition when we come to functions of the council. I wondered whether it would not be better to try and minimize the amount of reading and interpretation of this clause. I have prepared, and shown the department, the changes which I should like to see. It refers only to the wording of the clause; the content will mean the same but it will be shorter. I know it is difficult for the hon. the Minister to give a decision here now so I propose to read out my amendments and allow the Minister time to consider the matter. Perhaps in the Other Place he may think it wise to shorten the whole of clause 3. I move the following amendment in respect of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) and to substitute the following paragraphs:</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am quite prepared to look at the suggestions made by the hon. member for Rosettenville, but not with the undertaking that the clause might be shortened. It might well be that the clause is widened in scope or added to. I must confess I do not really find any difficulty reading the clause as it now stands. To me it is perfectly clear that this is a comprehensive survey of what the council&#x2019;s functions will be and the object is to make it as wide as possible in scope. If one reads the first few words of the paragraphs under discussion, one finds the following&#x2014;&#x201C;to undertake research &#x2026; to seek new knowledge &#x2026; to stimulate research &#x2026; to survey the broad objectives and possibilities of the medical and related sciences &#x2026; to promote co-operation in research &#x2026; to gather and collate scientific and technical information &#x2026; to foster and contribute financially &#x2026; to foster individual initiative fundamentally important to the advancement of science&#x201D;. As I say, I do not find much difficulty with this but I shall nevertheless look into the matter not necessarily with a view to shortening this clause but to ensure that everything possible is included which might fall within the scope of the council.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, here again I have tried to shorten clause 4 (1). There are 9<i>&#x00BD;</i> lines in this one sentence.

In the second place, the hon. member will be aware that this legislation is the outcome of many lengthy discussions and deliberations on the part of various scientists, committees, as well as the Scientific Advisory Council. It is as a result of those talks that these various matters do in fact appear in this Bill. I can give you the assurance. Sir, that my officials have looked <span class="col_0925-0926" refersTo="page_0482"/>at this and that this is the best we and our legal experts could do with it.

<speech by="#fisher">

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is a very important clause. Subsection (2) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">A member of the council, with the exception of the president and the vice-president, shall hold office for a period of three years but shall be eligible for re-appointment.</block>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will not reconsider this and substitute the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; for &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. I feel that the way it reads now means that everybody sitting on the council must stand for re-election again. What happens to those persons who do not want to stand for re-election? For this reason I say that the clause should read &#x201C;may be eligible&#x201D; if he so wishes. Do the words &#x201C;shall be eligible&#x201D; not mean that he must go forward? I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 7 (1) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The president shall be a medical practitioner registered in the Republic, shall be appointed for such period as the State President may determine, and shall preside at meetings of the council and the executive committee referred to in section 10 at which he is present.</block>

<p>This, in effect, means that any person who is appointed to become the president of this council must be a medical practitioner. During the Second Reading debate we explained that we do not think it is such a good idea to always make the president a medical practitioner. What is more important to me is the fact that his term of office is an undetermined period. I think that we must have some determination because we, in all good faith, may appoint somebody whom we may find, after two to three years, to be absolutely useless. We will then be stuck with this man as president of this very important council. For this reason I ask for the deletion of the words &#x201C;such period as the State President may determine&#x201D; and the insertion of the words &#x201C;a period of five years&#x201D;. This amendment will then give the hon. the Minister the opportunity of making a re-appointment every five years. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 23 and 24. to omit &#x201C;such period as the State President may determine&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;a period of five years&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, first of all I just want to say something about the hon. member&#x2019;s first point, i.e. that the president must in fact be a registered medical practitioner. I feel very strongly that the position must remain as it is. It will not only lend prestige to the council, which is a medical research council, but it will also bring about certainty in this regard. Therefore I am definitely of the opinion that the position must remain as it is.</p>

<p>I am prepared to accept the second point in regard to the five-year period, but perhaps not for the reason the hon. member for Rosettenville mentioned. I do not think it very likely that it will be found after five years that the person who was appointed is not worth his salt. In the case of all councils of this nature it is customary to make provision for a period of three or five years. I am glad that the hon. member did not insist on a period of three years, because I think that a period of five years would give rise to more stability. I am prepared to accept a period of five years.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to move an amendment to this clause on similar lines. Here again I should like to ask the Minister to accept an amendment which will limit the period of occupancy of the vice-president&#x2019;s position to the period of five years. Again, Sir, I think it is better to have an appointment which can be reviewed after a period of five years. The amendment reads as follows:</p>

<p>Clause 9:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, subsection (4) of clause 9 reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">A decision of the council shall be by a resolution of the majority of the members present at a meeting of the council, and, in the event of an equality of votes on any matter, the person presiding at the meeting in question shall have a casting vote in addition to his deliberative vote as a member of the council.</block>

<p>We have considered this clause very carefully and I think it would be very much better, and it would give a true reflection of the feelings of the persons at the meeting, if the subsection were to read as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">A decision of the council shall be by a resolution of the majority of the members present and voting &#x2026;</block>

<p>This means that the people who actually vote will determine whether a resolution will go forward or not. As the clause reads now, there may be quite a large number of people at the meeting who do not vote. What is meant by a &#x201C;majority&#x201D; in such a case? Does it mean a majority of the people present, but not voting? The people may be present in the Chamber. They may be listening to the arguments, but they do not vote. How does one determine the voting strength of those people who do not vote? Let us therefore provide for a majority of persons voting rather than a majority of persons who are merely present. I therefore move the following amendment:</p>

<block name="quote">In line 58, after &#x201C;present&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and voting&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr Chairman, I am sorry, but I really cannot accept this amendment. I shall explain why I cannot do so. As this clause reads at present, the procedure followed is the one which applies to all councils in South Africa. This has never given rise to problems. I should not like to create in the case of the Medical Research Council a situation where we would have to follow the UNO procedure with all its attendant problems. Hon. members know how matters are at UNO. There they follow the procedure which the hon. member is now proposing. It is important to me that the position remains as it is at present, for one would not like to place such a council in a situation where it would be stripped of its powers in that many of the members sit there and do not participate in the voting. We want this council to be a council which does in fact pass resolutions. In this legislation we do not want to create circumstances which will cause the council to be a powerless body as one so often sees in UNO.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not wish to move an amendment to this clause, but only to make a few remarks in this connection. It is a difficult clause to reconcile with the rest of the Bill. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The council shall exercise proper control over the use of human or animal material in experimentation in connection with any matter of which the council has charge.</block>

<p>I wonder whether it would not be a good idea to hold this matter over entirely until the Select Committee dealing with tissue transplants has presented its report.

<speech by="#minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>I have already considered that aspect. However, if this clause is omitted, we may be making the Bill less strict in this respect. There are several societies, such as societies for the protection of animals, that have very strong feelings in regard to this matter. This clause is in fact a step in the right direction, i.e. towards determining by way of legislation the necessary measures as regards the protection of and proper control over animal and human material. What the hon. member has in mind, is, of course, the Bill that was referred to the Select Committee. Irrespective of what is decided there, it could, at any rate, only strengthen this provision. I should like to leave this matter at that and not have to introduce an amendment to this legislation at a later stage.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the amendment standing in my name on page 100 of the Order Paper, which reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_0929-0930" refersTo="page_0484"/>In line 24, after &#x201C;persons&#x201D; to add &#x201C;or to any educational institution for <i>bona fide</i> educational or scientific purposes&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I understand the recent history of this particular clause, and I think the House will remember that a few years ago, a previous section of this particular section was under review. The question of the supply of alcohol and rectified spirits has always been left slightly in doubt as a result of the wording of the Act as it stood. The amendment of a few years ago made quite clear the conditions under which rectified spirits or absolute alcohol could be supplied to the public. It also lays down that a quantity of 8 ounces was the maximum that could be supplied for <i>bona fide</i> medicinal purposes. I understand that arising out of the implementation of this particular section of the Act, there was a difficulty because the normal suppliers of rectified spirit in quantities above 8 ounces, were wholesale chemists and druggists; and I understand that in terms of the law the police found it necessary to lay down that wholesale chemists and druggists, if they sold rectified spirits in quantities in excess of 8 ounces, would be required to take out a wholesale spirit licence, which would involve them in fairly high expenditure. I believe that in order to overcome this difficulty the present amendment was put forward. Now this amendment makes it quite clear that any chemist and druggist&#x2014;and that would therefore include retail and wholesale chemists and druggists&#x2014;is entitled to sell rectified spirits without any mention of the quantity. But when one comes to examine the bodies and the persons to whom they can sell rectified spirits, I find a glaring omission. It says quite clearly that the chemist and druggist may sell it to another chemist and druggist, to a veterinarian, to a dentist or a medical practitioner or person in charge of any hospital, home or institution solely for the medical treatment of sick persons. But what about the educational institutions which normally use rectified spirits or absolute alcohol for educational and scientific purposes? I have made it my business to find out in Cape Town what the normal procedure is when it comes to the purchase and supply of rectified spirit by educational institutions. As a result I have learnt that, for example, the Advanced College for Technical Education in Cape Town is in the habit of purchasing its rectified spirits supplies from a wholesale chemist and druggist. I made further inquiries and found that certain schools, in addition to private schools and other educational institutions, also adopt this practice of purchasing from a wholesale chemist and druggist. As I understand it, if this clause is allowed to pass as it stands, the purchase by these educational institutions would fall under the previous subsection and would be limited to a quantity of 8 ounces. I am sure it is not the intention to limit educational institutions to the purchase of a quantity of 8 ounces. I believe it is a reasonable request to enlarge the extent of this clause to provide for educational institutions. I do not think there is any possibility of abuse and I trust that the Minister will accept my amendment.</p>

<p>To me it is inconceivable that in a civilized community a leading citizen should advocate that schools should have wine-cellars and that students should be taught to drink. What we are anxious to do in our schools is to tell children and their parents what the dangers of alcoholic liquor are. There is no need to teach people how to drink. Drinking is not a virtue they have to acquire. It is something we have to warn children against. Drinking is like drugging. The Minister of Health has told us about the dangers of drugging. Nicotine is a drug and so is alcohol. It is surprising that we should have a leading citizen advocating the sale of wine to children.

On the face of it, <span class="col_0931-0932" refersTo="page_0485"/>para, (b) of subsection (1) of section 29 of the Act provides that any proceedings of the Licensing Board may be reviewed by any provincial or local division of the Supreme Court having jurisdiction, on the petition of any applicant or objector if it appears to the court that the conviction of an applicant which was before that board at the time of its decision has since been reversed or set aside on review or appeal, or that in respect of such conviction a free pardon has been granted. This has been in the Act for some time and it would seem, on the face of it, to be a relevant circumstance for an appeal or a review to the Supreme Court.

<p>In the past that was the only way in which this could take place. Let me put it as follows. In the past a licensing board did not have the right to restore a licence. In clause 5 (b) and (c) we are now giving the licensing board the right to restore a licence at an interim meeting, and seeing that this is much cheaper, we are now deleting section 29 (1) (b), which in the past gave the court the right to do this. In other words, this will now enable the licensing board to do this whereas it previously had to go to court.</p>

<p>Let us assume that after that event a free pardon is given, for example, because other circumstances have come to the knowledge of the Minister and he recommends a free pardon, this is now after the board has dealt with it. Is that not a circumstance which should be taken into account i.e. that if the board had known about it the board may well have taken a different decision, and should not that therefore be a ground on which he can take the matter on appeal or review?</p>

<p>The object of clause 29 is to enable the Minister to enforce uniform conditions and restrictions in respect of every class of liquor licence by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i> The amendment of subsection (3) enables licensing boards to impose additional conditions and restrictions in granting applications for the renewal of liquor licences.

<p>Very well, let us then come back to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation. The hon. the Minister referred to the new subsection (4) which he has introduced here. My colleague, the hon. member for Durban (North), asked the Minister what the object was of this amendment, of this additional subsection (4), in which, as the Minister has rightly pointed out, he is giving the chairman of the board the power to suspend any of these conditions for six months. But, Sir, we still have not heard what the object is. As I say, the hon. the Minister is taking powers unto himself throughout the whole Bill, and now suddenly he takes a power out of subsection (3) and then introduces it in favour of the chairman of the board in subsection (4).</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>In terms of clause 29 the Minister is obtaining the right to impose uniform conditions for the various classes of liquor licences. We have not yet come to clause 29, but the idea there is to prevent every liquor licensing area from imposing its own conditions. The object here is to arrive at and impose uniform conditions. In the case of two classes of licences, i.e. foreign liquor licences and wine farmers&#x2019; licences, which normally are not issued by the Minister on the recommendation of the National Liquor Board but by a magistrate, we are giving a magistrate the right to impose additional restrictions or conditions on his part over and above restrictions or conditions imposed by the Minister. That is what is happening here in clause 9 (4). A magistrate may also suspend the restrictions or conditions, but we are providing that he may only suspend them for a period not exceeding six months.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have a problem here. The Minister will know that last year I raised with him the question of the transfer of the sitting of an off-sales licence in East London, where a hotel had been classified and granted an off-sales licence and had applied to have their off-sales premises away from the hotel in an area alongside an established bottle store. I pointed out to the Minister then that the assurance had been given to me by the previous Minister of Justice, the present Prime Minister, on three occasions that in authorizing the siting of these off-sales premises he would not prejudice vested rights in any way. The Minister investigated that particular matter and decided to approve of what the officials had done in granting the licence in respect of those premises. It has been brought to my notice that having got the licence in those premises, the hotel disposed of its interests to a wholesaler. The hotel now wishes to give up its interests in those off-sales premises and the wholesaler has bought a bottle store and wishes to transfer the licence to the premises previously occupied by the hotel. Surely it was not intended that off-sales privileges should be used in this manner? I would like the hon. the Minister to give us an assurance now, while we are dealing with this section which deals with off-sales privileges, that it is not the intention to allow people to move bottle-store licences to premises previously used by a hotel for its off-sales business merely because the off-sales premises happen to be in that position. Sir, this is quite unfair. It lays itself open to the abuse that a hotel, because it has off-sales privileges, can apply for permission to have its premises far away from the hotel, it can be granted this facility and then, because a liquor business is being carried on on the premises, another bottle-store can use its licence to occupy those premises as well.</p>

The new provision seems to have been taken out of one part of the existing section and put <span class="col_0935-0936" refersTo="page_0487"/>into another part of the section which relates in a different way to the powers previously enjoyed by sports ground liquor licence holders. As this legislation is extremely complex, I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would enlighten us in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is true that this legislation is very complex. Clause 17 merely redrafts the old section 66. A few words are being omitted too. The new clause 17 (a) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">17. Section 66 of the principal Act is hereby amended&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) by the substitution for paragraph (a) of subsection (4) of the following paragraph:

<ol>

<li>(a) the holder of a bar licence, or a restaurant liquor licence, or an hotel liquor licence or a wine and malt liquor licence.</li></ol></li>

</ol>

<p>The words &#x201C;or a sports ground liquor licence&#x201D;, which appeared in the old section 66, are now being omitted. Sports ground liquor licences are used at rugby fields and horse races. These licences entitled the holders to sell liquor from the commencement of the game up to 30 minutes after the game. I just want to read to hon. members what preceeds this section in the principal Act. Hon. members should please be patient, because it is very difficult to fit these amendments into exactly their right places in the relevant sections. Section 66 of the principal Act deals with the qualifications of certain licensees. Subsection (4) of section 66 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">66. (4) Subject to the provisions of section 72 a temporary liquor licence shall only be granted to a person who is&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the holder of a bar licence, or a restaurant liquor licence, or an hotel liquor licence, or a wine and malt liquor licence, or a sports ground liquor licence.</li>

</ol>

<p>This provisions has been rewritten and provision has been made for sports ground liquor licences. Clause 17 (c) amends the old paragraph (d) of the principal Act. Clause 17 (c), if passed, will read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(d) the holder of a club liquor licence or a sports ground liquor licence who has satisfied the magistrate to whom application for the licence is made, that the temporary liquor licence is required for a <i>bona fide</i> public function on the premises or the playing fields of the club or on the sports ground in respect of which he is licensed.</block>

<p>In other words, a sports ground liquor licence can only be obtained in respect of the premises or at the club buildings in respect of which it is held. In that case a temporary liquor licence can be issued. A temporary liquor licence can only be granted to a sports ground licencee and a club licencee on the ground where the sports ground or the club is situated.</p>

It has happened that a provision has been laid down in connection with an article normally used in connection with some or other thing.

<p>The point I am trying to make is this. A hotel which has been granted an off-sales privilege and has applied to sell liquor for off-consumption at premises other than at the hotel site, that is elsewhere in the urban area, can then enter into a contract with a wholesaler and the wholesaler then in fact manages the off-sales department for that hotel. If the hotel wishes to get out of this contract then the contract is cancelled. But a licenced business has been carried on at that site. The wholesaler then buys a bottle store elsewhere and applies to transfer the bottle store licence to the site on which the liquor business had been carried on. When I raised the matter under clause 12 I wanted to ask the Minister whether he could take steps to stop a liquor licensing board approving the transfer of that licence where there has obviously been an abuse of a privilege which was granted to the hotel. That is what I want to know from the Minister, namely whether he has the power to intervene in a case like this where he feels there has been an abuse. As far as this clause 19 is concerned, I do not think this matter can be raised, because nothing in this clause prevents a bottle store from applying for a transfer of a licence to another site. Seeing the Minister said I should raise the matter under this clause, I shall be glad if he would give us an indication of the Government&#x2019;s policy with regard to these licences.</p>

Will the Minister explain to us what parts of what premises it is intended that children should be allowed to attend? If one lives at or visits a licensed hotel and one has a drink in the hotel lounge, is one allowed to have one&#x2019;s children under the prescribed age there with one? What is the present position?

<p>Mr. Chairman, at present there are more than one restricted portion in an hotel. The men&#x2019;s bar is a restricted portion and the so-called ladies&#x2019; bar is also a restricted portion. Children may not be present in the restricted portion of an hotel. Now it happens that an eating place is provided in the ladies&#x2019; bar. As a matter of fact, in my home town there is an hotel with a restaurant in the restricted portion whereas the bar, the counter with the liquor, is situated to one side. As the Act stands at present, a child may not enter that portion and a child who arrives there in the company of his parents may not eat there with his parents while the parents may have a drink with their meal. What this proposed amendment amounts to is that children will be allowed to have a meal there in the company of their parents, but they may not be served liquor. The amendment is being made to cover cases like these. In subsequent clauses of this Bill a similar amendment is being made in respect of clubs and restaurants as well.</p>

He said he was not going to go into &#x201C;vital statistics&#x201D; but he was going to screen them in other ways. Will every licensee have to apply to the Minister for approval before the barmaid is engaged or how is the Minister going to approve the use of barmaids in these restricted portions?

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member has in point of fact touched on two matters. The first is the question of barmaids in general. This question was settled as long ago as 1928, when this House decided not to allow them any more, except the few which were licencees. This principle is not under discussion now, nor is it my intention to restore barmaids generally at a later stage. What is under discussion now is that it may possibly be something good, particularly in view of the shortage of bartenders, to allow women to be bar-tenders in those portions restricted as ladies&#x2019; bars. In terms of the clause the minimum age will be 18 years. During the Second Reading debate yesterday I said I intended raising this considerably. The idea as far as general conditions in respect of classification are concerned, will probably be that a woman may also be employed as a bar-tender in those portions of the hotel set aside as ladies&#x2019; bars, if it is a classified hotel. However, this will be subject to conditions; for example, she may not be under 25 years of age.</p>

<p>This is the term which is used throughout the Act, i.e. &#x201C;children under the age of 18 years&#x201D;. Up to 18 years a person still is a child. The idea is, however, that this will be a condition of the privilege obtained as a result of classification. For example, such a person will now go to the local magistrate and say, &#x201C;I shoud like to employ a certain woman&#x201D;. The magistrate will then make inquiries with regard to her age and character. He will ask for testimonials. He will consult the police officer of the licensing district and take a decision. It will be within his discretion to decide whether or not he will allow that person to employ that particular woman. This, in brief, is the idea.</p>

<p>Yes, but may I ask the hon. the Minister why must they only be employed in a restricted portion, in ladies&#x2019; lounges, in these classified hotels? Why can they not be in the bars? That is the point I am raising with the Minister. It provides for their employment. Why will they only be employed in this one restricted area, namely the women&#x2019;s bar? Why not allow them to be employed in the men&#x2019;s bar? That is the point I am trying to make. One of the reasons the Minister gave to me in reply was that the matter was settled in 1928.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But the Minister has altered the provision from what it was in 1928. If he was not altering it, it would not have been necessary for him to introduce this provision in this Bill. The mere fact that he is introducing an amendment to the Act to allow it, shows that it is necessary. I do hope that the Minister is not going to erase the impression he has given to the whole country that he is one of the &#x201C;verligtes&#x201D;. I hope that he is not going to go back now and make us believe that he is really a &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D;. The Minister himself has departed from the principle of the 1928 legislation by bringing in this amendment. The reason he gives is because there is a shortage of manpower for service in these bars. If it is wrong for a woman to serve in a bar, it is just as wrong for her to serve because there are no men to employ as if there were lots of men to employ. If it is wrong morally for a woman to serve in a bar, then it does not justify it because there is a manpower shortage. I say that the employment of women in men&#x2019;s bars, especially in the classified hotels, can be justified, because in a classified hotel the management is not going to allow unruly behaviour in their bars. They are classified. They have a status to uphold. With regard to the employment of these barmaids, the law does not lay down that a magistrate must approve of the character of a barman before he is employed. Why should the magistrate have to go into all these details, police reports, etc., about a barmaid just because she happens to be a woman? I say it should be up to the management. We are only dealing with classified hotels. It is up to the management to pick a person whom they think will be suitable in their hotel. I submit that it is not necessary that the Minister lay down all these difficulties in the way of the management for employing a barmaid in a hotel.</p>

<p>If the hon. member is arguing the point and asking why women cannot also be employed as barmaids in men&#x2019;s bars in classified hotels as I am now allowing them to be employed in ladies&#x2019; bars in classified hotels, he has a point for discussion. My reply to that is as follows: I am not in favour of women in men&#x2019;s bars, just as my predecessor in this House in 1928 was not in favour of that either. I am not even in favour of that as far as classified hotels are concerned, not even in the light of what the hon. member told me with regard to the Transkei. What I am in favour of and what I see my way clear to propose in this House, is the employment of barmaids in ladies&#x2019; bars, where the atmosphere is different, where women mix freely, where there is a restaurant and where even children are allowed. I am trying this as an experiment. I do not know how it is going to work out. I hope and expect that it will work out well. I am prepared to propose this in respect of bars in the restricted portions of hotels set aside for women, but I am not prepared to go further than that.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, is the hon. the Minister really serious about this matter? I wonder whether he has in fact done any investigation outside this country as to the drinking habits of people, and men particularly, and their behaviour where there are barmaids. This is not a very great advance from 1928. The legislation of 1928 was in itself an experiment, in the days when everyone was experimenting with liquor. I hope that the hon. the Minister has not really closed his mind to this question altogether. One can take the U.S.A., for example. The U.S.A. has had a lot of marvellous experiments as to this question of drinking: of prohibition, complete prohibition, partial prohibition, of having men&#x2019;s bars and women&#x2019;s bars. I really cannot agree with the hon. the Minister when he suggests that this might produce some ill effect in those pubs. Far from it! It produces a very good effect. I want to support my hon. friend from the Transkeian Territories in saying that, when one goes into these places overseas, this is the atmosphere one finds, for the very reason that there is a woman serving behind the counter. This is quite the opposite of what the hon. the Minister says. I am not suggesting the hon. the Minister should send a commission around the world to have an international official pubcrawl. But I do feel that the hon. the Minister, before he closes his mind to the subject, should ask his Department to do some research on this matter. A lot of sociological research has been done. The Minister should also talk with hon. members who were away during the recess and I am sure that the hon. Minister will have much to cause him to reconsider this whole question. Let us get away and move a little bit forward from the year 1928.</p>

<p>In clause 19 (a) it is stated that the Minister may require information and documents &#x201C;pertaining to such accommodation establishment, including a description of the premises concerned and a plan thereof as he may deem fit&#x201D;. What exactly is meant by this? I can appreciate the hon. the Minister wanting a plan, but I cannot appreciate what the words &#x201C;description of the premises&#x201D; mean in this context. Subsection (7) (b) inserted by clause 19 (a) reads as follows: &#x201C;At any time amend or delete any such condition or restriction or attach any further condition or restriction to any such certificate as he may deem fit.&#x201D; I would have thought that the Minister has sufficient powers when the classification took place not to require a further power in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I shall first deal with the question of the additional restriction. I deem it necessary for the Minister to obtain this power, especially in connection with off-consumption privileges. I should like to grant off-consumption privileges to a particular person or hotel <span class="col_0943-0944" refersTo="page_0491"/>for particular premises for which he applies. On the recommendation of the National Liquor Board I may then be prepared to grant those privileges on condition that he may only sell to Whites on those premises and not to non-Whites. At the moment I do not have the power to restrict such a person to sell to Whites only, unless I receive a written undertaking from such a person that he will do so. Such cases do occur and it is to cover this type of case that the Minister is being empowered to impose a further restriction. This power did not exist under the original Act. As regards the plan and further particulars in connection with such plan which a proprietor or lessee may be required to furnish, the idea behind that is merely to do away with reclassification every three years, which entails unnecessary expenditure. However, they are required to furnish these particulars so as to enable the Minister and the Liquor Board to ascertain that the condition of the premises still is as it was when they were originally classified and that no alterations have been made. Coupled with the inspections which are carried out, one is then in a position to accommodate the people and to tell them that they may continue to enjoy their classification privileges without their having to apply for reclassification. This is the idea behind the proposed subsection.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause deals with the question of the supply of liquor on polling days and it makes certain exemptions. I do not have any quarrel with these exemptions, but there are a few points I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The first point is the question of the radius from a polling booth on election day, for there seems to be some doubt as to what radius means and there seem to be different ways of interpreting it. In the final analysis it seems to me as if the Police decide on what the radius is. The second aspect is that while you are barred from selling liquor on election days in a particular area, there is nothing to prohibit an outside bottle store from sending liquor into that area on election days. It seems to me that these are two matters that the hon. the Minister might give some attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before replying to the remarks of the hon. member. I should like to move the following amendment in respect of clause 21&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 9, page 28, after &#x201C;place&#x201D; to add &#x201C;or any person acting under his authority&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I just want to explain what the idea behind this amendment is. At present the magistrate of the district authorizes the supply of liquor to ships which are about to sail and which docked during the night. However, the chief magistrate is not always available, and for that reason provision is now being made for such permission to be granted by somebody acting under his authority.</p>

<p>As regards the distance from the polling booth which the hon. member mentioned, I want to point out to him that section 181 of the Electoral Act is also included in this, and that it is not applicable in respect of one population group or another. I want to say in all honesty that I am not clear about what the position is as regards bringing liquor into an area on polling day, as laid down by the Electoral Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, can the hon. the Minister explain why his policy now appears to be to prevent a further extension of wholesalers who can deal directly with the public? I am sure that it is a matter about which the public may well be concerned, considering the amount of money one saves by buying something wholesale. This appears to be a restriction of the future number of wholesalers who can deal directly with the public.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as long ago as in 1963 it was decided by this House&#x2014;and this is the policy&#x2014;that wholesalers should deal with the trade, with the exception of the few wholesalers who carried on business at that time and who, subject to certain conditions, could deal directly with the public. The retail trade would then deal with the public. The wholesalers continued to deal with the public, however. Time does not allow me to reply to the other questions put by the hon. members, but I shall do so at a later stage. I now move&#x2014;</p>

<heading>TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND TELEPHONE SHORTAGE</heading>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move the following motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that the steps taken by the Government to meet the telecommunication needs of the country <span class="col_0945-0946" refersTo="page_0492"/>and, in particular, to alleviate the telephone shortage are inadequate and unrealistic, and demands that the Government should consider the institution of an immediate full-scale programme to solve this problem.</block>

<p>This morning several of us had the privilege of attending a most impressive function at which the new cable between South Africa and Portugal was inaugurated. It was a signal occasion and I believe I speak on behalf of hon. members on both sides of the House when I say that we wish this new South Atlantic Cable Company well. We believe that something has been accomplished in the interests of South Africa, something which we were forced to accomplish after we became a Republic and were ousted from the old Commonwealth Cable Agreement. I trust, too, that it will be an example to the Government and to the hon. the Minister of how private enterprise and the technicians of our Post Office Department can work together for the benefit of the country and of the telecommunications services in our country. Indeed, Sir, I saw something remarkable to-day, something one does not see every day in South Africa. I saw our Postmaster-General dial a number on the telephone and you know, Sir, he got through immediately! That is indeed something that does not happen every day, nor, I believe, was this conversation, which came over very clearly, interrupted by conversations between Comrade Mao and Mr. Kosygin about their own little problems, as we so often have our own conversations interrupted.</p>

<p>But, seriously, Sir, I believe it is a sad reflection on this Government that it has become necessary to introduce a motion of this nature calling upon the Government, almost in desperation, to do something about the telephone shortage. I know of no other country in the world where it has been necessary during the past decade for an Opposition to come with a deliberate private motion of this nature. This telephone shortage is no longer a joke to us. It has developed from a joke into a nuisance, from a nuisance into a menace, and from a menace into a real crisis for the whole of our economy to-day. I am not alone in saying this. We have the Chamber of Commerce on our side, we have the Chambers of Industries on our side, and we have the Afrikaanse Sakekamers throughout the whole country on our side. The life of our nation depends on adequate communications. Without that our economy can stagnate and it might even collapse. We need a telecommunications system that is speedy, accurate and private. I believe that our present system of telephones does not come up to these standards in any respect whatsoever. It does not even remotely reflect those standards in the state of affairs we have to-day.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago a past president of the Federated Chambers of Industry, a responsible person who knew what he was talking about, said: &#x201C;South Africa&#x2019;s telephone system is the worst in any developed country.&#x201D; Strong words, but how can we gainsay him? Let us look at the evidence. I will confine the evidence to a few incidents which happened during the last few months, and I shall further confine myself to the area of the Witwatersrand, while my colleagues will speak about other areas in the country which are almost as bad, although it might be some satisfaction to hon. members opposite to know that there is some difference of opinion among us as to whether the Witwatersrand or Cape Town or Durban or Port Elizabeth or East London is the worst. You can open the newspapers or your correspondence every day and find things such as the following. You find a township of 1,000 houses on the Rand which has been without a single private telephone for a period of two years while there are only two public telephones to serve the area.</p>

<p>From businesses, from chambers of commerce, from the West Rand to the East Rand, from Boksburg, Benoni, Springs, Randfontein, Edenvale, and above all, <span class="col_0947-0948" refersTo="page_0493"/>from Johannesburg itself, we have had complaints. The Chairman of the Boksburg Industrial Association had to cry out in despair the other day that the service is shocking. He said that telephones are our lifeline and we cannot do business without them. The F.C.I. and other bodies have protested on local and on national level, but the position has become worse and worse. Does the Minister not realize that, unless we have adequate telecommunications, businesses can actually break down? Contracts cannot be negotiated. Orders cannot be placed. Staff cannot receive proper instructions. Plans cannot be co-ordinated. Does he not realize that as a result of all this we have delays, waste and frustration? Our telephone cableways are the highways of speech and to-day those highways are overloaded and chaotic conditions result. [Interjections.] Even the telex services, apart from the telephone services, have deteriorated to such an extent that there are twice as many applications for telex services outstanding today as there were two years ago. Let us remember that our news services, our Stock Exchange and many of our businesses depend on an adequate telex service.</p>

<p>What is going to happen to our defence in an amergency if our communication and telephone systems break down? Does the Minister not realize how absolutely essential it is for us to have those services? Does the Minister not realize how he is rejecting one of the finest sources of income by not building up the telephone service on business lines? But instead of trying to get more customers, he is chasing them away. Instead of getting the people to use the telephones to a greater extent, appeals go out that housewives should not speak on the telephone so often. In order to run a telephone service on business lines, I can show him what they do in America. They send out pamphlets to telephone subscribers encouraging them to use the telephone, and special services such as mobile telephone and overseas services. In the U.S.A. they exhort the subscribers to buy extension phones, wall phones and table phones, and so on. [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe the main sufferers are indeed the public. The telephone should keep us close to our families and to our friends. It should buy and sell our goods. It should make appointments for us to plan our work and our leisure. But what happens under this Government? This afternoon I heard the hon. the Minister say communications build goodwill and friendship, but that does not happen in South Africa, not with the telecommunications we have here. If ever anything caused frustration, it has been the lack of telephones in South Africa.</p>

<p>Is there a single person in this House who has not had the following experience dozens of times? Has any member ever picked up the phone and discovered there was no dialling tone whatever? In Boksburg there are instances of people waiting for 2&#x00BD; hours to get a dialling tone. Sometimes you wait half an hour in Johannesburg to get a dialling tone, for instance to Edenvale. Sometimes you do get a sound, but it is the one indicating that the number is no longer connected. You continue dialling because you know it is a business which can not be disconnected, and later you get the engaged signal, but the engaged sound does not really mean that the number is engaged. We were told, I think it was by the Postmaster-General or some other responsible official, that &#x201C;junction cables get clogged and people get the engaged signal when the subscriber is not in fact engaged&#x201D;. If the poor subscriber tries again, what happens is what I indicated some time ago, namely that he runs into some intriguing conversation by entirely unknown people on a topic foreign to him, and he hastily puts the phone down. If I had kept on listening on the occasions it happened to me, I could have got some very good racing or Stock Exchange tips. Indeed, when I was recently speaking on the phone to a colleague of mine, discussing the sins of the Nationalist Party, a voice suddenly came over the telephone, while I was conducting what I regarded as a private conversation, saying: &#x201C;Dit lieg jy.&#x201D; [Laughter.]</p>

<p>Even the Nationalist newspapers say that the position is getting out of hand. <i>Dagbree</i>k wrote that if you dial 50 to get a trunk call all you get is the nought. But the hon. the Minister himself admitted it in this House last year in June when he said: &#x201C;I want to admit openly that the quality of the telephone service is worsening all the time&#x201D;. How right he was, Sir, for once!</p>

<p>Now, Sir, these are the facts. Let us now look at the actual figures themselves, the statistics given by the hon. the Minister in reply to questions raised in Parliament. The first is this. The telephone shortage to-day is 72,000. As far as I know it has never been as big before in the history of South Africa, except once under this Government many years ago. Sir, do you know what the figure of 72,000 means? It means that in two years the shortage has more than doubled.</p>

<p>Sir, I never thought I would ever live to see the day when I had to <span class="col_0949-0950" refersTo="page_0494"/>admit things were better under the previous Minister of Posts and Telegraphs!</p>

<p>Sir, let us look at the Witwatersrand itself. On the Witwatersrand the shortage has doubled in two years&#x2019; time. To-day it is 29,000 compared to only 12,000 in 1966. More than 40 per cent of the shortages are on the Witwatersrand. The state of affairs has been chaotic at times, particularly during the recent change-over, when telephone books were issued ahead of time and numbers were unobtainable over a very long period. The worst news, Sir, came only two hours ago in a reply which the hon. the Minister so kindly gave me, and I thank him for his reply. I asked him first of all how many telephone exchanges in the whole of the country had been closed. A closed telephone exchange is one which can take no new lines except in cases of absolute emergency, namely telephones for the police, the fire brigade and so forth. Do you know, Sir, that there are no fewer than 82 such telephone exchanges completely closed in the whole of South Africa to-day? Of these 29 are in Johannesburg and on the Witwatersrand. I think it would be a good thing if I were to read out the names of these 29 exchanges and indicate the number waiting for telephones at each one of them.</p>

<p>Many of them sound like Nationalist constituencies and one wonders what their members have been doing for their constituents: Alberton, closed, 810 waiting for telephones; Benoni. closed 2,200 waiting for telephones; Edenvale, closed, 1,048 waiting for telephones; Kempton Park, closed, 2,313 waiting; Nigel, closed; Boksburg, closed; Germiston, closed; Isando, closed; North Rand, closed; Springs, closed, 1.464 waiting; Wadeville, closed, 704 waiting for telephones; Dunnottar, closed; Florida, closed; Muldersdrift, closed.</p>

<p>Then I come to Johannesburg itself: Bramley, closed, 906 waiting; Bryanston, closed, 950 waiting; Hillbrow, closed, 1,070 waiting; Jeppe, closed, 680 waiting; Johannesburg Central, closed, 1,300 waiting; Joubert Park, closed, 1,700 waiting; Kensington, closed, 1,465 waiting; Linden, closed, 2,127 waiting; Mayfair, closed. 1,000 waiting; Newlands, closed; Rose-bank, closed; Rossettenville, closed; Sandown, closed; Turffontein, closed, 1,422 waiting.</p>

<p>Sir, in the past when we have raised this matter the hon. the Minister has come here with figures of his own, as he will no doubt do again this afternoon. I want to analyse some of those figures in anticipation. First of all, the hon. the Minister will be telling us that last year or the year before that, no fewer than 120,000 or 130,000 new services were instituted. Sir, that sounds impressive. It is the story that is told at congresses of the F.C.I., at congresses of the Chambers of Commerce and at Nationalist Party congresses. Sir, do you know what that figure actually means? Do you know what the Minister actually does? In giving you that figure, he takes no account of the telephone services which have been closed down, which have been cut off and then given to other people. He takes no account of transfers. In fact, if a telephone is transferred from one exchange area to another exchange area, the Minister includes that in his figure of 122,000. How many such instances were there amongst the 122,000 last year? No fewer than 91,000 instances of services which had been suspended and also a large number of services which had been transferred&#x2014;so we have to be careful when the hon. the Minister quotes figures to us.</p>

<p>I am sure that this afternoon he will also tell us of the huge amount which will be devoted to capital expenditure during the next three or four years, an amount of probably over R200 million. When the hon. the Minister does that, I want him to say first of all how much of that capital has to be spent to replace out-dated equipment, to replace out-dated buildings, to replace things which have become wornout and to replace capital expenditure which in the past was incurred partly by the Public Works Department and partly by the Department of Transport. We want to know that, and once those figures have been given, I am sure you will agree with me, Sir, that the amount of new capital for telephone expansion during the next four or five years is very much less than adequate. The figures that the hon. the Minister gives us remind me very much of some of the shares on the Stock Exchange. The figures climb higher and higher, but the returns become less and less. Sir, it is no use the hon. the Minister mentioning the figures in other countries.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has done it so often that I am anticipating him. It is no use the hon. the Minister quoting the figures of other countries to us. His predecessor told us that there was a shortage of two million telephones in Japan, but do you know, Sir, what the facts are? In Japan actually they are installing two million new telephones every year, and apparently his predecessor thought that that indicated the shortage of telephones! I shall not quote to the hon. the Minister the case of the United States, where five million new telephones are installed every year&#x2014;14,000 every day. Let us rather compare South Africa with small nations with the same number of telephones that we have. Take Australia where every day 470 new telephones are installed. According to what I have been told, you can telephone the Telephone Department and within 24 hours you have a new telephone. Take Brazil, where 340 new telephones are installed every day. I mention Brazil because they have more or less the same number of telephones as we have. This also applies to Mexico where 300 new telephones are installed every day. In each of these cases they are doing two or more times better than we are doing in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_0951-0952" refersTo="page_0495"/>Sir, we also beg the hon. the Minister: Please do not come to us with false promises. In June, 1968, he told us: &#x201C;The backlog should be eliminated in five years barring unforeseen circumstances.&#x201D; Since then the position has worsened by 20 per cent, in nine months&#x2019; time. Have there been unforeseen circumstances? If so, what are they? Or are the figures simply an indication of a growth in the shortage that is still to come over the years? Can he tell us what the shortage will be in, say, March, 1970? Eighty thousand to a hundred thousand? Where will this calamity have brought us by that time?</p>

<p>Sir, I do not hesitate for one single moment in blaming the Government and no one but the Government for the shortage of telephones. There is a lack of interest in this matter in the ranks of the Cabinet. Where are the Cabinet Ministers this afternoon who should be taking an interest in this debate and who could solve these problems? Where is the Minister of Finance, who should grant the necessary money? Where is the Minister of the Interior, who is associated through the Public Service Act with the Post Office Department? Where is the Minister of Labour, who can solve the big manpower problem? Where is the Minister of Economic Affairs and, above all, where is the Minister of Planning? What have we? We have a Minister with a burden on his shoulders which is too heavy for him.</p>

<p>Sir, I am sure that this afternoon we will again hear a confession from the Minister, as we have had in the past, a confession that he admits that the state of affairs is not really good and that it might become worse before it becomes better. Sir, we are getting tired of these confessions. We do not want confessions; we want telephones. We do not want phoney arguments, we want telephones. In ancient Greece on Mount Olympus they had the god Mercury, who was the messenger of the gods of Olympus. Mercury had winged feet; he had wings on his helmet; What have we, Sir? We have the hon. the Ministers! Sir, we do not want a Mercury in clogs; we want a Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, I blame this Government for this shortage. I blame the Government for the staff shortages which have bedevilled all possible development during the past years. I blame the Government for not paying the Post Office staff a proper wage, thus causing a 12,000 annual turnover of staff. I blame it for the shortage of 360 and more qualified engineers, technicians and mechanics to-day in the Post Office. I thank heaven that there are dedicated men in the Post Office who are doing their duty and ten times more than their duty to keep our telecommunication system running. Our admiration for them knows no bounds; we thank them for what they are doing. They do not deserve a Government such as this.</p>

<p>Let it not be forgotten, Sir, that last year when the Post Office Re-adjustment Act was discussed in Parliament, we pleaded with the hon. the Minister to accept an amendment which asked him to include amongst &#x201C;business principles&#x201D; proper services to the public in regard to telecommunications and proper wages to the Post Office staff, and what happened? The hon. the Minister, the whole Cabinet, every single hon. member on that side, voted against that amendment. I blame the Government for having aggravated the shortage through half-baked measures in the past. Let it not be forgotten that we tried to give the hon. the Minister greater autonomy in the Post Office in an amendment last year. Again he turned it down; his Cabinet turned it down and the whole of the Government turned it down.</p>

<p>I blame this Government for not planning ahead. The hon. the Minister himself said in June last year that he had been &#x201C;obliged to replace effective long-term planning&#x201D; by short-term measures. What an admission of failure! Sir, I blame the Government for not supplying sufficient capital for the development of the Post Office. We had the remarkable sight yesterday of the hon. the Minister of Finance telling us, &#x201C;There is a surplus, an overflow, of money in this country,&#x201D; so much in fact that he went overseas and got more money from Switzerland and more money from Germany. Sir, cannot the hon. the Minister ask the Minister of Finance for a few extra rand for the Post Office? I blame the Government, the Cabinet as a whole, for having made an utter mess of the whole manpower situation in South Africa, and I say that unless the Minister and the Government can solve this manpower problem, this shortage of telephones will never be eliminated. To the hon. the Minister himself I say: We are not going to judge him by his statistics; we are going to judge him by his results. We are not going to judge him by whether we can dial directly to Timbuktu or to Reikjavik. All we want to dial is the next suburb. We are not impressed to hear that micro-waves will be carrying our telephone conversations from Hertzog Tower to Hertzog Tower. We, 72,000 citizens, want telephones.</p>

<p>Sir, I conclude by saying this: A Government is as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest link is undoubtedly to-day the telecommunication system under this Government, and judged by that, this is the worst Government that we have ever had in the country&#x2019;s history.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I believe it was worse than half-heartedly. He expressed his appreciation to the Postmaster-General and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the other people concerned for the fact that an overseas cable communication link of this kind has now been established. I am amazed therefore that after what he heard and saw there, he still had the courage to proceed in this House with a motion such as this in which he criticized, from beginning to end, the hon. the Minister and the officials of the Post Office. He spoke about one thing and one thing only, and that was the shortage of telephones. He tried to dramatize the matter, as he usually tries to do. But mindful of the recent no-confidence debate I remembered how the hon. member had exploited the fact that somebody had purchased an antique for R3,000. I am certain that that hon. member did not contribute a cent towards that amount. I am certain that he had nothing to do with it. I am certain that it has nothing to do with the House, and that it is merely a private matter. The fact that the hon. member could raise such a matter in this House shows how petty the hon. member can be.</p>

<p>He made a few statements here to which I want to react briefly before I proceed with my argument. He said that the tremendous achievement of laying the overseas cable was &#x201C;an example to the Government of co-operation between the private sector and the Government&#x201D;. One could almost say, from the way in which the hon. member spoke, that he was sick. This project was being planned for 12 years, and now that it is in operation, it is suddenly an example of planning and co-operation. That hon. member&#x2019;s brain does not move backwards or forwards. I think it remains quite stationary. In regard to the telephone services he stated, <i>inter alia,</i> and he quoted other persons to prove it, that &#x201C;The telephone system in South Africa is the worst of any civilized country&#x201D;. The hon. member travelled very far in order to be able to say that. But I want to prove the contrary by saying that we here in South Africa, with our small population and restricted means, have a telephone service which is as good as that of any developed country of South Africa&#x2019;s size.</p>

<p>He also made certain allegations in regard to our telex services. I want to say that if we were outside this House, I would be able to find a word to refute that. But, Mr. Speaker, I may not use the word here because you will immediately ask me to withdraw it. I shall therefore leave it to the hon. member&#x2019;s imagination. In this regard the hon. member mentioned a few local cases, i.e. those of Boksburg and Johannesburg. <i>Inter alia,</i> he spoke about the shortage of telephones there. Neither the former Minister of Posts and Telegraphs nor the present Minister has ever denied that there is in fact a shortage of telephones. But is it anything new? I want to take his mind back to the time when his party was in power. I want to say that in 1937, under the United Party Government, there was a shortage of 7,000 telephones. That shortage has never been alleviated. On the contrary, in 1947, that shortage increased from 7,000 to 65,000. In 1948 the National Party came into power, and in 1962, according to that member, there was a shortage of 11,000 telephones. According to my figures there was a shortage of 9,500 telephones. There was therefore a shortage of between 9,000 and 11,000 telephones in 1962. But everybody in South Africa knows that since 1962 phenomenal development has taken place in South Africa. As a result of essential capital expenditure on very important matters, owing to circumstances prior to 1962, it was wise of this Government to apply the brakes in regard to these matters.</p>

<p>I want to say that I am truly amazed to see that the hon. member was able to transport us to Hyde Park in London. Unfortunately all we did not see was the soap-box. It took my mind back to the arguments which take place there. An hon. member is alleging that the steps which were taken to alleviate the shortage were inadequate. He alleges that the steps which were taken are unrealistic and that they will not meet our telecommunication requirements. He requested that an immediate and comprehensive programme be considered. Is what hon. members saw to-day not proof of comprehensive programmes and planning? No, the hon. member&#x2019;s motion is an unrealistic one. I hope it is permissible if I say that I am of the opinion that it is even presumptuous. Only last year legislation was piloted through this House to make the Post Office independent as far as its finances was concerned. This was done approximately nine months ago. On 19th March the hon. the Minister will introduce his Budget. Can one subsequently criticize in advance the planning of the Post Office in regard to post and telecommunication services? That is the reason why I am saying that I regard this argument of the hon. member as being presumptuous. When those first estimates of the Department are introduced next month, we will be able to judge whether there are plans for better services, if the services can under the present circumstances be improved. We do in fact think that as far as telephones are concerned, there is in fact room for improvement, but there are good reasons why the situation up to now has been like this. I told hon. members that <span class="col_0955-0956" refersTo="page_0497"/>the position in respect of telephones was the same even when the United Party was in power.</p>

<p>This adjustment which makes the Post Office independent and places it on the basis of a business undertaking, is a realistic one. It represents positive planning and judicious action. I am amazed that the hon. member for Orange Grove did not first afford the hon. the Minister the opportunity of introducing his estimates. Then this House would have been able to see what the change had brought. We admit that this Department of Posts and Telegraphs has a great backlog to make up. I have just mentioned the figures in respect of the shortage of telephones. Owing to the phenomenal development of the country and the restrictions on capital spending in order to combat inflation, good service has already been rendered. Expansion has also taken place, but the hon. member denies this. To-day the Republic has a modern and comprehensive telecommunications system. Hon. members saw it themselves. We have long distance microwave links between our large cities, which we never had before in our country. The rented telex services also increased from 220 to 3,700. Is that deterioration or stagnation? The hon. member is requesting a comprehensive programme in respect of our tele communications system. After having listened to the hon. member&#x2019;s argument I am almost compelled to say to him: &#x201C;Good morning. Did you sleep well? You have been sleeping a long time&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Orange Grove has been sleeping a long time. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister have been engaged over the years in planning. It is difficult to plan if one has a limited amount of capital at one&#x2019;s disposal. That hon. member must admit that over the years this restriction has always been there, or does the hon. member propose that the Government should increase the tariffs or cut down in other spheres. Must we for example cut down on our defence expenditure? Is that what the hon. member suggests? Does the hon. member want salaries to be reduced so that more capital will be made available for telecommunication services? Is that what he wants? We hear nothing from that side; bombastic diatribes are all one hears. As a result of this thorough and timeous planning more than 80 per cent of all the requirements for the Post Office and its related services are being manufactured in South Africa. I am sorry to have to say this, but I am certain that that hon. member and the entire Opposition bitterly regret the fact that so much equipment is being manufactured in this country instead of 80 per cent and more of it being imported from overseas. I believe that they bitterly regret that. But I on the other hand appreciate the planning and the action by the Department in not only attracting industries to South Africa but also making it possible for them to develop. After the changeover of the automatic telex exchanges of East London and Kimberley, all our large cities will have been equipped with these automatic units. Is that not progress? It is planning, and it is the implementation of that planning. The telex exchange at Welkom is being closed, and that in Johannesburg included, and the result of that will be that telex subscribers in the Republic and South-West Africa will be able to communicate directly with one another without the services of manual operators having to be used. Is that not beneficial to the communication system and to our commerce and industry? It has been alleged here that things are going very badly with our telecommunication services, but are these facts not proof to the contrary? Early next year subscripers in South Africa and South-West Africa will be able to dial other countries directly. Does that not also amount to planning and improvement? What is happening to-day, does that not crown all these meritorious attempts on the part of this Department?</p>

<p>But development did not only take place in this direction; provision was also made and planning undertaken for the accommodation of these facilities. In the past between R2 and R3 million per year was made available for buildings, and it is expected that this amount will increase within the next year or three to R8 million per year. The capital value of all our telex services and apparatus and buildings increased from R58 million to R391 million, and that in the days when the Department was still so dependent upon the Treasury, and had to approach it with outstretched hands begging for alms. Alms were given because the Cabinet and the Treasury, in their wisdom, decided that they did not have more money available.</p>

<p>Sir, I asked whether that side advocated tariff increases, but we received no reply. The automatic exchanges increased to 148, the manual exchanges to 1,630. Will that side deny this? Will they deny that these improvements really took place, and that this amounted to expansion of the services. It is being planned to add 35 automatic exchanges with 104,000 lines during the next four years. At the 109 existing automatic exchanges an additional 98,592, lines will be made available. In view of the Post Office&#x2019;s limited funds and a manpower shortage to boot, every sensible person should be able to express appreciation to the hon. the Minister and the officials of our Posts. We must express our gratitude because they not only spent their time well in rendering good service to the country but they also worked overtime, as a unselfish sacrifice, in order to make those services available. We know that the shortage of capital was the restrictive factor in the past, but I have put forward sufficient reasons to explain why that situation existed.</p>

<p>I now want to ask the hon. Opposition a pertinent question, and I would be pleased if the next speaker on that side would give me a clear reply. Does that side want large amounts to be taken away from Defence and allocated to Posts? Do they want to cut down <span class="col_0957-0958" refersTo="page_0498"/>on salaries? Do they want to increase tariffs? I am asking these things again now, and I would be pleased if hon. members would furnish those replies. Where else will the hon. member and his Party find the funds to institute those so-called full-scale plans, as he put it here, into operation? They cannot be undertaken without money, the capital which must be found. I would therefore appreciate it if the replies can be furnished here. I want to say clearly that we on this side appreciate what has been done for South Africa, although a backlog did develop. But there is no place in South Africa where there is not a telephone service available.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly asked the Opposition certain questions, and I should very much like to have replies to them. If that side wants the amounts voted for Defence to be reduced considerably, then I would like to know why they desire that; they must not merely say that they will do it. If one has adequate funds at one&#x2019;s disposal then one can plan and spend on a lavish scale, and then one can also plan far in advance, but if the funds are lacking, one&#x2019;s hands are tied.</p>

<p>I now want to conclude and I want to ask the members to get done with this trivial criticism, criticism which is repeated every year. And what were the fruits of that criticism for that side of the House? They now have one member less in this House. The result of the actions of the hon. member, as well as those of his colleagues, are that the Party as such is steadily deteriorating. To the National Government I say that we sincerely appreciate the excellent service which this Department is rendering to our country. We will never forget the vast amount of overtime which has been worked, and is still being worked. Our country has an excellent telecommunications service, and only the National Party with its conservatism, its planning, and above all its thorough work, could effect this.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Harrismith admits that both the present Minister and his predecessor have acknowledged from time to time that there are considerable shortages in the supply of telephones, and he ascribes these shortages to the fact that there has been a lack of capital. However. I think the 72.000 people who are waiting for telephones will read with interest of the opening to-day of a certain international communication link whilst they are Still waiting for telephones in their homes and offices. He also says the Opposition should appreciate the Government&#x2019;s planning in this matter. I should like to ask him whether 21 years in office is not sufficient time for any government to plan its operations, and that applies also to the Post Office. Then he poses this question to the Opposition, would we wish with a view to providing the necessary capital, to cut defence expenditure and salaries? Our answer to that is very simple to quote what the previous Minister of Posts and Telegraphs said, as reported in <i>Die Burger</i> on 6th December, 1966, when he asked for an increase of 1 cent per local telephone call, which would provide him with between R10 and R14 million per annum. This is what he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Elke sent van die inkomste wat die Poskantoor uit die verhoging kry, sal gebruik word om die telefoonstelsel te verbeter. Die Staat sal geen belasting daaruit kry nie. As ons nie daardie geld kry nie, sal 10,000 van u nie telefone kan kry nie, en diegene wat dit miskien sal kan kry, sal twee tot drie jaar daarvoor moet wag. Die oplossing vir die probleem is om die koste van plaaslike oproepe met 1 sent te verhoog. Dit sal ons in staat stel om binne drie tot vyf jaar al die telefone te kry wat ons nodig het en om &#x2019;n diens te kry gelyk aan die heel beste.</block>

<p>That was at the end of 1966. I would like to point out that at that stage, with the increase of 1 cent per local telephone call, South Africa&#x2019;s local telephone calls became the highest in the world. They became three and a half times as expensive as the local telephone calls in Holland, and two and a half times as expensive as those in Sweden. The cost for other countries are, by way of comparison:</p>

</table>

<p>That R10 to R14 million which the Minister assured us would be forthcoming as a result of the one cent increase on local telephone charges should provide the capital for the expansion of the telephone service.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove has indicated that on this side there will be speakers dealing with each of the provinces. I would like to confine my remarks, therefore, to the Cape Province, and I begin with the Peninsula. On the 2nd August, 1967, Mr. Loftus, the Telephone Manager in Cape Town, said that 31,000 telephones would be provided within three to five years for the Peninsula, and that there would be sufficient to catch up with the present applications. Shortly after that, on the 11th March, a letter appeared in the <i>Cape Argus,</i> which was answered by the Postmaster-General, Mr. Strauss, himself. The letter was from a certain Mr. Sandilands. The Postmaster-General replied that at present (March, 1968) there were 11,000 Peninsula applications in arrear. Then he ascribed the reason for the arrear applications as being:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026;reasons over which the Post Office had and still has no direct control, and certainly not because of the lack of foresight or in <span class="col_0959-0960" refersTo="page_0499"/>sufficient advance planning; it mainly concerns the question of adequate funds, but it is expected that this obstacle will shortly be removed.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Then he deals with the programme for the Peninsula and says that within five years a further 45,000 telephones, as opposed to Mr. Loftus&#x2019; figures of 31,000 telephones, would be provided. Thereafter in his statement he deals with a basis on which applications are dealt with, because there has been so much criticism as to who gets a telephone and who applies unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>Now I should like to examine some of the reasons given by the Postmaster-General for the backlog. He says that it mainly concerns the question of adequate funds. I have already quoted what the previous Minister had said two years before, namely that by increasing the cost of local telephone calls by one cent, sufficient capital, R10 to R14 million, would be available for the expansion of the telephone services. Therefore I feel that that argument falls away. Secondly, he makes the point that there will be 45,000 telephones provided in the Peninsula within the next five years. But the previous Minister of Posts and Telegraphs said in 1966 (two years before) that the backlog of telephones in the whole of South Africa would be met within five years from then. The Postmaster-General is more cautious, because in his statement he says further that it will be met within five years, and thereafter that the shortage will be gradually eliminated. He refers, and the hon. the Minister so often refers, to the backlog. But what about the natural growth of the population? What about the economic development in the various areas of the Peninsula? They will also require telephone services. The Afrikaanse Sakekamer at Paarl in March of last year was concerned with this matter, and appealed to the Department and the Minister to give urgent attention to the improving of telephone services in the Peninsula. And then, in his Second Reading speech on the Post Office Readjustment Bill, the Minister himself said that an extensive programme of expansion had been planned and that it would take five years to clear up the backlog, the same period the Postmaster expects it to last. Thereafter Mr. Loftus made a statement three or four months later, to be exact in September. He confirmed that there were 11,000 people waiting for telephones in the Peninsula, and ascribed the backlog mainly to the shortage of exchange equipment at certain exchanges and the lack of underground cables generally. That does not tie up with the explanations either from the Postmaster-General or from the Minister. He went on further and quoted the outstanding applications. These are a reflection on the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<p>He went on to say that equipment on order for new exchanges will provide 13,800 new telephones. He said that there was further equipment on order for the permanent extension to existing telephone exchanges, which will provide another 11.000. My point is that there is talk from the Minister; there are statements by the heads of Departments from time to time, but the people are still waiting for telephones. In the meantime, the outstanding applications for telephones in the Peninsula rose at the end of December of 1967 to 10,862. In 1966 it was 9,790. To-day it is 12,412.</p>

<p>Now briefly, what is the position of the other two large towns of the Cape Province? In East London in 1966 there were 466 outstanding applications. In 1967 there were 931, and at the end of last year the figure was 1.513, a steady increase in the numbers of those waiting for telephones. In Port Elizabeth in 1966, 250 applied for telephones; in 1967 there were 1,770; and in 1968 the figure was 2,831. So it seems that everywhere there is a backlog which is becoming steadily larger in all the main cities in the Cape Province.</p>

<p>Now I should like very briefly to deal with the quality of the existing services, and to ask whether the public is really receiving value for its money. After all, we are paying the highest for local calls anywhere in the world, and we are financing capital expansion of the Post Office by revenue. Look at the letters that appear from time to time in the newspapers, letters about shortages, complaints that business is being delayed that women and children are being left defenceless in their homes at night when their menfolk are away, complaints about the cost of the service, complaints that the costs of telephone calls are not assisting our policy of combating inflation, frequent complaints about the standard of service from call boxes, the fact that telephone receivers are not regularly replaced when they are destroyed, the fact that they are not regularly inspected, the fact that coin boxes very seldom work in public telephone boxes and that money is lost as a result of a subscriber having to make two or three attempts to get through and then gives up in disgust, filth and dirt to be found in the public telephone boxes and that they are not often enough inspected.</p>

<p>Lastly I think there is real substance for a complaint about the standard of the telephone directories. The lay out has been changed in the last issue and the standard and quality of paper that is used, give cause to widespread complaints as well. I think for all of these reasons the hon. member for Orange Grove has been completely justified in moving the motion he did, and I wish to second it.</p>

<from><span class="col_0961-0962" refersTo="page_0500"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to support the amendment to the motion as moved by the hon. member here on my right. That motion really consists of two things, the one is the gratitude and appreciation this House expresses to the Government, and secondly to the officials for what has been accomplished in this country in respect of the provision of telephones. Before going any further, however, I should like to return to two points raised by the hon. member for Orange Grove. The hon. member referred to Germiston and said that there were 214 persons who were waiting for telephones. He made this out to be something terrible. Does the hon. member know however that the population of Germiston is 86,314? That means that only .2 per cent of them are waiting for telephones. Throughout the world it is acknowledged that an unemployment figure of 2 per cent is normal. Here it is .2 per cent, and for that member it is abnormal.</p>

<p>The hon. member also stated that South Africa could be compared to Australia and that in Australia 470 telephones were being made per day. I now want to ask the hon. member why he does not give this House the correct information. Why does that hon. member make a statement in which he distorts the truth? The hon. member omitted to state that in this country there are only 3&#x00BD; million Whites who are manufacturing 240 telephones every day, as against a population of 11,761,000 in Australia, where 470 telephones are being installed per day. Australia has four times the white population of South Africa, and they are only making twice as many telephones per day. In other words, they are only half as productive and efficient as this National Government is. I think that the hon. member ought to thank this Government and these officials for that efficiency and the good service they are providing.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into the hon. member&#x2019;s argument any further, because I think that these two statements are sufficient to prove how that hon. member merely gropes around for something to say and never has anything positive and constructive to submit to the House. The hon. member always distorts the truth.</p>

<p>I should like to read an extract from the annual report of the Post Office for 1966-&#x2019;67 to the hon. member. It seems to me the hon. member has never read this annual report. With reference to this I shall go on to show what is being done in this country to make telephones available to the public. In the foreword the Postmaster-General states the following, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Details of the progress maintained in all directions appear elsewhere in the report and in the statistical tables. On the postal side, the number of postal articles again increased, but nevertheless the year ended in a financial loss. This is due in the main to higher operating and transport costs and the fact that the rates for certain postal services are not economical.</block>

<p>I would just like to say in passing here that that hon. member is fully aware of the fact that the Post Office transports postal articles daily which one could almost call trash and which is sent to the public. On these postal articles only a half cent or one cent postage is payable, and as a result of these postal articles, which are being transported at a loss, this Department had a deficit of R3 million. This Government did not increase postal tariffs as a result of that type of postal article. The Government&#x2019;s premise was that the postal service should become even more efficient in order that very inexpensive postal tariffs for South Africa could in that way be retained. Why did the hon. member not rather express his gratitude for that? Why does that hon. member only express contempt for the Post Office? Indirectly he is blaming our officials, running them down and accusing them of poor service. It is they who have to do the work, but there is nothing that that hon. member will say in their favour. The Postmaster-General went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the telecommunications side, no fewer than 59,933 additional telephone services were provided. The number of telephone trunk lines increased by 592 and the facilities for direct trunk dialling were extended considerably. Ten new automatic exchanges were brought into use and nine others were enlarged. More than 1,500 miles of farmline route were constructed, while good progress was made with the automation of the telegraph service.</block>

<p>All this was done in one year, but it appears as if that hon. member did not read this annual report, although he is supplied with a copy. The cash revenue rose to R121,216,204, an increase of R57,730,000 compared to the previous year. Then the Postmaster-General went on to state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In other directions the way has been paved for progress and greater efficiency, while in some respects practical results have already been achieved. A modern semi-automatic international telephone exchange has been planned for erection in Cape Town. It will be installed to be ready for service in conjunction with the new submarine cable between South Africa and Europe which is expected to be taken into use at the beginning of 1969.</block>

<p>I want to emphasize that this fantastic exchange was planned as long as two years ago. This cable is the longest in the world. The Government, with its Department commenced the planning two years ago. They stated that at the beginning of this year this submarine cable would be taken into use. It was done this morning. In this way I can quote passage after passage in regard to what this Government <span class="col_0963-0964" refersTo="page_0501"/> has undertaken to do and has done. I now challenge that hon. member to prove to us that where undertakings such as this fail, it cannot be ascribed to abnormal circumstances for which the Cabinet and the Department cannot be held responsible. One of the causes in this connection is inflation, but I shall come to that later.</p>

<p>I should now like to go further and discuss the finances of the Post Office. It is stated in the annual report that for the periods 1966-&#x2019;67 the postal section brought in R30,263,000. The telegraphs section brought in R12,229,000 and the telephones section R78,723,000. That is a total of R121,216,000. Does that hon. member know how many officials there are in this Department who have to handle such an enormous sum of money? Does that hon. member know that the turnover&#x2014;this is not only the Post Office&#x2019;s money, but also taxes collected for the State, savings bank money, pensions, and so on&#x2014;for that year was R787,000,000? Handling such an amount of money is no joke for those people. Since I want to confine myself in particular to the gratitude expressed to our Department in the second leg of the motion of the hon. member for Harrismith, I want to say that we must take a look at what these people are doing for South Africa.</p>

<p>How has the Post Office grown under National Party Government? I think that is a very good question. The turnover I referred to a moment ago was R168,000,000 in 1948, whereas in 1968 it was R834,000,000. In 1948 there were only 220 telex services, as opposed to 3,700 in 1968. The number of telephones in 1948 was 318,000, as opposed to 1,239,000 in 1968. In this way I can mention many other figures, and it will be found that everything has increased fourfold over the same period. During this time however the staff only increased from 25,800 to 49,800. Thus the staff only increased twofold and not fourfold. I now want to ask the hon. member, since the same number of people are now doing twice as much as was previously done, whether that is not productivity and something to be grateful for. I think the hon. member turns a blind eye to these things. Let us look at the planning which is being undertaken in this Department. There was a period 20 years ago which we can compare, but I would prefer to compare the achievements of the National Party with itself, because it is not possible to compare the United Party with the National Party. They are beginning to cross over to such an extent that one cannot draw comparisons any more. Twelve years ago, in 1957, the number of automatic telephone exchanges was 82. There are now 148. That is what this Government has achieved in 12 years. The number of manual telephone exchanges, i.e. 1.803 12 years ago, has been reduced to 1,630. Twelve years ago there were 1,803 manual exchanges, and we have so far reduced this number to 1,630. You know. Sir, that the planning of this Department and the work has made such progress that the manual exchanges are being replaced at a much faster rate than it was possible to do up to the present. We admit that there is a backlog as far as telephones are concerned, but we are grateful for the conditions which have caused this, i.e. the progress in this country. But that side of the House is annoyed if there is progress in South Africa. But those hon. members will sit in those benches forever. We have a backlog in telephone services which is attributable to the tremendous economic progress, and our country has the second highest real growth rate in the world. Is it to be deplored that we are developing so rapidly that we are falling behind? And what about efficiency? I want to return to that. During 1968 this Minister and this Government, in order to further efficiency, proceeded to appoint three deputy postmasters-general in the General Post Office, i.e. for finance and planning, staff and posts, and for telecommunications and technical services, for the sole purpose of furthering efficiency, so that there would be no duplication of work and in order to facilitate matters and render even better services than were already being rendered to the public. In January of this year a further reorganization came into effect, which meant that seven regional directors have now been appointed. With all these senior posts which are being created the staff have more opportunities of promotion. Is the hon. member opposed to that? Does he want the Government to create more senior posts, yes or no?</p>

<p>I am pleased, because since I came to this House, this is the first thing with which that hon. member has been satisfied. And from 1st April salary increases will be introduced, and the hon. member knows that. And, thanks to the former Minister of Posts, the Post Office is now independent. We know that the present Minister piloted through that change while the opposite side went along with it half-heartedly. We are now on the eve of the Post Office as a business undertaking which will produce results. That hon. member&#x2019;s exclusive purpose with this motion to-day is to enable him to say something at least before he watches us rectifying everything in South Africa as far as Posts are concerned. In a year&#x2019;s time all that hon. member will be able to do is to say thank you for everything he has received. That hon. member is so fond of complaining, but I wonder whether he has a telephone in his constituency so that his voters can get in touch with him.</p>

<p>I just want to mention a few figures. What are we spending in South Africa as far as the Government is concerned? In 1946 the white population of the country totalled 2,372.000 and the number of telephones during that time totalled 264.037. That means for every nine Whites in 1946 there was one telephone. That is the &#x201C;excellent&#x201D; service which South Africa bad been receiving from the Government of <span class="col_0965-0966" refersTo="page_0502"/>that side of the House. In 1960 our white population totalled 3,080,000, but then we had 858,124 telephones. That gives us a telephone for every 3.6 Whites, instead of every nine. In 1967, with 3,563,000 Whites, we had 1,179,000 telephones. That is to say, for every third white person in South Africa there was a telephone. Now I am asking that hon. member to mention one country in the world to me where every third person has a telephone.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Let us consider the economically active persons in South Africa, those people who work. Again I am only taking the Whites. In 1946 there were 887,800 of them, and for every 3.4 of them there was one telephone. In 1960, under this Government, there were 1,151,000 such persons, and there were 858,124 telephones, for every 1.3 economically active persons there was therefore a telephone, whereas it had been 3.4 under this Government. No, I think this Government has done its share. We admit that there is a shortage of telephones. In 1937 there was a shortage of 7,000, and in 1947 there was a shortage of 65,000. This Government reduced that figure, and in 1962 it was 9,500, but as a result of this fantastic development in South Africa, it shot up in 1968 to 62,750 and recently, on 31st December, 1968, it was 72,000. That is a drop in the bucket. If one takes the population and the economic growth into consideration, this is not such a great backlog which has to be made up. Once everything is in order, the National Party will simply rectify it one morning before breakfast. There are only 18 countries in the entire world which have more telephones than South Africa, and that in spite of the fact that there are only 3.5 million Whites in this country who have to take care of 18 million people, and in spite of the great distances we have in our country. We cannot compare Holland or Belgium with South Africa as far as telecommunications are concerned. I do not want to quote the figures used by the hon. member for Harrismith, but in conclusion I merely want to supply these figures, and these are connected with the estimates of this House, the revenue as well as the loan estimates during the past few years. In 1946-&#x2019;47 the total estimates amounted to R19,800,000, and for that population of 2,372.000 it worked out at R8.4 per white person. Taking it in the same way, it works out that in 1957-&#x2019;58 it was R24 per person. It increased from R8.4 amongst those people to R24 under this Government. In 1967-&#x2019;68 this Government was spending R37 per white person on telephone services, etc. And what is the figure now, since the Post Office has become independent, compared to last year? For the financial year ending 31st March, it has shot up to R48.10 per white person. That is what this Government is doing for our people to supply them with telephones.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that I support this amendment of the hon. member for Harrismith, and I want to express my thanks to the Government, and particularly to our officials, for what has been done in the past, for what they are doing now, and particularly for the thorough planning and the work which they have already set in motion to make up in two ticks the small backlog which South Africa has as far as telephones are concerned.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House have at no time criticized the personnel of the Post Office. We, as well as hon. members opposite, appreciate the services they are rendering to South Africa in difficult circumstances. Hon. members keep on mentioning the cable that came into operation this morning between South Africa and overseas. It is a laudable event and we appreciate it as well as anybody else, but the trouble is that we are referring to the demand for telephones and the shortage of telephones in South Africa. With that I would like to localize it to my own area in Pietermaritzburg.</p>

<p>We asked for an extension to our telephone exchange in Pietermaritzburg. In 1965 the Estimates showed an amount for this of R200,000. In 1967-&#x2019;68, in the Estimates, this amount was approved of, and during 1968-&#x2019;69 there was a revised Estimate, when it was increased to R280,000. The expenditure to 31st March, 1968, on this work was R49,000. The expenditure for 1968-&#x2019;69 was R160,000, leaving a balance of R59,000. When it was first mooted in 1965, it was then said that it was an urgent necessity, but three years later it had not been commenced with. It was only during 1967-&#x2019;68 that it was commenced with. On 23rd August, 1966, the then Minister, not this hon. Minister&#x2014;this Minister inherited all this&#x2014;informed me that it would be completed in the next few years. In a question across the floor I asked him what he meant by &#x201C;a few years&#x201D; and he said between 1&#x00BD; and 2 years. Pietermaritzburg is a border area, one of particular importance, according to the Minister of Community Development. The tempo of expansion is ceaseless, with the present industrial development. Thousands of flats and dwelling-houses and businesses are continuously rising, and telephones, needless to say, are of the utmost necessity. On 12th March, 1968, the Minister informed me that the new exchange would not be able to meet the backlog of telephones. On 5th June, 1967, the hon. the Minister informed the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) by letter, No. M.1/2/67, that the extension to the exchange under construction had been planned to make provision for approximately 17 years. I should like to read that letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the debate in Committee of Supply on the Post Office Vote in the House of Assembly on 1st May, 1967, you spoke about the telephone planning in respect of Pietermaritzburg. I am glad to be able to <span class="col_0967-0968" refersTo="page_0503"/>confirm that the extension to the automatic telephone exchange building which is at present under construction has been planned to make provision for telephone expansion for a period of approximately 17 years. The telephone equipment will, however, be installed in stages according to requirements. In this connection you will no doubt be interested to know that because of the exceptional development that is taking place in Pietermaritzburg, it has been decided to increase the proposed extension of 2,000 lines to approximately 3,800. Unfortunately it is not possible at this early stage to say when the additional lines will actually be available.</block>

<p>He states that there will be an increase of 2,000 lines, bringing it up to 3,800 lines. On the 7th February, 1969, the Minister informed me that the new exchange would now provide for 5,286 additional lines instead of 3,328 and that the exchange was expected to meet all requirements until mid-1973, based on present development. Sir, there is a slight difference between about four years and 17 years. To me this is now becoming a Chinese puzzle and the hon. the Minister must please elucidate and give me the correct position and the figures.</p>

<p>Sir, the next matter that worries me is the disparity in telephone charges between Durban and Pietermaritzburg and Pietermaritzburg and Durban. If a Pietermaritzburg subscriber has four calls, one each of three, six, nine and 12 minutes to Durban, it costs him 42 cents more for 30 minutes duration than the Durban man has to pay to Pietermaritzburg for the same time. On the 5th March, 1968, the Minister informed me that this was merely of a transitional nature and would be eliminated as fast as possible. Surely, Sir, this is now becoming a serious matter. We cannot continue fleecing the public for another two years in this way, according to the Minister&#x2019;s reply on the 19th March, 1968. I sincerely suggest to the hon. the Minister that arrangements be set in motion to equalize the charges between the two cities as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Sir, whilst we are on the question of exchanges, the Minister informed me that the question of the take-over of the Durban Corporation&#x2019;s private telephone system was under consideration. As a result, the following article appeared in the <i>Daily News</i> of the 14th February, 1969&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Key Phone Men to Quit: More than 50 key employees of the Durban Municipal Telephone Department are expected to resign before the Government take-over, scheduled for April, the 1st of this year, because of a dispute over leave. The resignations could seriously disrupt Durban&#x2019;s telephone system as most of the men are senior telephone technicians working on automatic exchanges. The resignation threat follows the City Council&#x2019;s refusal to grant the employees&#x2019; request to be paid out in full for accumulated leave. Mr. Barnsly, Secretary of the Durban Municipal Employees&#x2019; Society, said to-day: &#x201C;We have more or less reached agreement on all the other factors which will affect the employees but this question of leave is still a sore point. The men expected some sort of gratuity in the form of cash payment for accumulated leave but the Council have refused to agree to this &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>I think that the hon. the Minister should investigate this position very urgently and give it his immediate attention to avoid losing these irreplaceable senior telephone technicians.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to mention to the hon. the Minister a case of my own. On the 14th December, my wife telephoned and sent a phonogram to a wedding couple, friends of ours, at Sasolburg. She asked the exchange&#x2014;this was at about 10 o&#x2019;clock in the morning&#x2014;whether the phonogram would still be delivered because it was a Saturday. The operator said &#x201C;Yes, certainly&#x201D; and she took down the phonogram. About three or four days later I received a notification from the Post Office to the effect that this telegram had not been delivered because addressee left without leaving his address. Sir, I must congratulate this official on his sense of humour, because all newly married couples leave after their wedding without leaving an address. Sir, this does not assist the Department in giving service to the public. I shudder to think how many telegrams were not delivered to the town hall at Sasolburg on that particular day. We were assured that the telegram would reach Sasolburg in ample time. It was not delivered, most likely because it was a Saturday and they probably do not deliver telegrams on Saturday afternoons. If there is no provision for this vital service on Saturday afternoons then I wonder how many telegrams to young couples in South Africa who marry on Saturday afternoons&#x2014;and there must be hundreds&#x2014;remain undelivered. This particular wedding was a very big one. I believe over 500 guests attended the function in the town hall. There was really no excuse for not delivering that telegram.</p>

<p>Sir, talking about telephones, I wonder how many existing telephone subscribers cannot get through to main lines. A friend of mine in Johannesburg told me that it was a physical impossibility to get through to the Provincial Administration building in Pretoria. You are very lucky if you get through in five hours&#x2019; time. What is causing the trouble is that the exchange in the building is too small to handle the traffic. I merely want to put forward a suggestion to the hon. the Minister in this regard; I am not trying to criticize him. I wonder whether he cannot take control of these new buildings and see to it that before any telephone system <span class="col_0969-0970" refersTo="page_0504"/>is installed in the building the Postmaster-General approves of the system and is satisfied that the exchange can handle the traffic. My friend also tells me that it is hopeless dialling 900, a line to the Eastern Transvaal; you can never get through.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to associate myself with the appeals which the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) has addressed to the hon. the Minister, in regard to settling the problems concerning the employees of the Durban Municipal Telephone Department. I trust that he will sympathetically consider their just pleas.</p>

<p>Then, I would like to refer to some remarks made by the hon. member for Sunnyside. Sir, I am quite convinced that the hon. member for Sunnyside is safely esconced in his white ivory tower, and when he talks about a ratio of one telephone to nine persons, it is quite clear that he is only thinking of one section of the community. He forgets that we in South Africa live in&#x2014;call it what you will&#x2014;a multinational or a multi-racial community. He apparenty disregards the shortages which may exist in so far as a large section or our community is concerned. I want to quote just one figure to show that his ratio cannot be regarded as an accurate assessment of the overall position. If we take the non-white areas surrounding Durban&#x2014;a Bantu, an Indian and a Coloured residential area, one of each&#x2014;we find that in the last four years, from 1964 to 1967, 155 telephones were installed in these areas and that the number of applications which could not be met was 412. I estimate the population in these areas to be roughly 300,000, and I make the ratio of telephones to population one in two thousand! Sir, these are areas in which you are dealing with urbanized people who need telephones, who apply for telephones and cannot get them.</p>

<p>Then. Sir, I was interested in the remarks made by the Minister during the recess, when he gave certain details concerning the telephone position since 1948. He said that the business turnover of the telephone department since 1948 had increased five times. He spoke with pride of the fact that the number of actual telephones had increased four times. He was also proud to say that the number of staff had only doubled, and he said that this was &#x201C;evidence of the high measure of efficiency in the service&#x201D;. Sir, I think that remark is unjustified in view of the Department&#x2019;s failure to recruit and to keep the necessary technical staff and, secondly, in view of the attitude that they adopt in regard to the development of potential sources of labour in this country. I believe that their whole outlook, on that basis, is unrealistic. I believe that the position is grim and I think if we look at it from that unrealistic angle, we can describe the Minister&#x2019;s statement as Grimm&#x2019;s fairy tales.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to join hon. members who have taken part in this debate in paying sincere tribute to the existing staff. I believe they are doing a magnificent job under extremely difficult circumstances. I record with appreciation the courtesy and the helpfulness which have always been exhibited, particularly in cases of emergency. But, Sir, there is one &#x201C;but&#x201D;: Provided you can raise them on the telephone! There is such a shortage of staff that there are certain times of the day when one can sit on the telephone for minutes on end before getting through to the operator. I believe we are in a telephone crisis and I want to put what I believe to be a practical suggestion to the hon. the Minister. I believe that he should address an appeal to all telephone subscribers. I do not know whether other hon. members have had the experience which I have had. You may have had it, Mr. Speaker. When you pick up the telephone to make a social call you get a juvenile voice at the other end; you then say &#x201C;I would like to speak to mummy&#x201D;. The reply is: &#x201C;Mummy is out; she has gone to fetch daddy.&#x201D; When you ask, &#x201C;When is mummy due back?&#x201D; you get the reply, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know&#x201D;. Sir, I believe that this is happening day after day in thousands of telephone systems. I believe it is causing unnecessary congestion and I believe it is causing an unnecessary metering of calls. My suggestion to the hon. the Minister is that an appeal should be made to users to adopt a more realistic attitude towards telephones. I realize that it is necessary for people to contact their homes when they know that perhaps only their children or their servants are there, but I believe it would not take very much imagination or ingenuity to introduce a code call so that the servant or the child will know that when the telephone rings in a certain way they must answer the telephone and that otherwise they must ignore it. This will save subscribers a great deal of frustration. It will save them the irritation of making a telephone call only to be told that &#x201C;mummy is out&#x201D; and that nobody knows when she will be back. I believe that such a system could help to overcome the present crisis, particularly in the towns and built-up areas.</p>

<p>Other hon. members on our side of the House have dealt with the position on a provincial basis. I wish to deal primarily with the position in the Durban perimeter. I believe that we, in the Durban area, are in a unique position, because the main Durban business complex is still in the hands of the municipal telephone service, while the outer perimeter is mainly in the hands of the State. I do not say that the local municipal service is perfect, but I believe that it gives a better service than that which people in the perimeter areas of Durban are enjoying from the State. When it comes to the transfer of telephones from one home to another, when a person moves, this can be done reasonably simply in the Durban area. But this is not so easy in the surrounding area where the responsibility is that of the State. This problem which I, as a public representative have, is shared by some of my colleagues who, too, have parts of their constituency <span class="col_0971-0972" refersTo="page_0505"/>in the areas where subscribers are accommodated by municipal and by Government services. I want to give you an example. In my constituency in Berea, where in Glenmore/Howardene/Ridge Road/Sherwood area &#x2026; the telephone subscribers are attached to the Government exchanges in the government areas. It is from these areas that the complaints come. You might want to know what the complaints are and whether it is just about telephones that are needed for social calls. Most of the complaints which I receive are either for urgent business reasons or for matters of health. I believe that to-day we have to accept that the telephone is a vital necessity for modern living. I know that allocations are made on priority bases. I think that the very fact that we have to have this priority basis, highlights the bad planning that existed in the past. Here again I want to reiterate the courtesy of the management in trying to deal impartially and helpfully with these questions of priority. The difficulties of these managements have been created and aggravated by this Government.</p>

<p>There are some specific difficulties to which I wish to refer. Firstly, there is the question of &#x201C;stork telephones&#x201D;. This I believe is the common terminology for a telephone provided specifically for a woman who is about to have a baby. I understand that expectant mothers in certain areas in the Durban complex have no hope of getting a stork telephone, no matter how important it may be to them and to their immediate family. Unless there is doctor&#x2019;s priority in connection with a particular pregnancy, the &#x201C;stork telephone&#x201D; is just not provided.</p>

<p>Then we have the question of sickness and old age which also can be serious. I understand the situation and the position in regard to priorites, but I wonder how many disgruntled applicants are prepared to accept the refusal of telephones on the grounds that their priorities are not sufficiently urgent.</p>

<p>Then there is the difficult position where senior, and essential members of staff, of a business organization, who are on call at home during nights and week-ends, cannot be accommodated on the telephone exchange. They are unable to get shared-line service and are also unable to be contacted except physically by sending a person round to their homes. I wish to refer briefly to this shared-line service. I realize that in many instances it does provide a partial solution to a problem. Where subscribers are prepared to share the line, it is a useful service. Nevertheless, it does not answer all the problems. I want to mention some of these problems from my own experience; human problems which can be multiplied a thousand times every day and in every part of South Africa. Take the case of a piano tuner whose business was in his home. He needed no workshop for his equipment; he needed no office. All he needed was a fixed home address and a telephone, so that he could be called out to ply his business in the homes where the pianos were. What was the position? For months he tried to get a telephone on a business priority basis. He could not get a telephone and in the end he had to rely on getting messages from a well meaning person in a municipal zone, who had a telephone.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to another man who was in the municipal zone and had had a telephone for 39 years. He moved to another part of my constituency which was just outside the municipal zone, and therefore under Government control. He wished to start as an industrial specialist consultant. At this stage of his career he had no need for an office. He could not get his telephone on a priority basis when he wanted it. Here, I think, is an even more glaring case of a person who is desperate. I refer to the owner of an established firm. He decided to move from the central city to a more outlying area, the Mayville area, in my constituency. When, in 1968, he made arrangements about his new premises, there was a telephone on the premises. He planned his move for February, 1969. When he spoke to the previous lessee of the premises, this man went down to the telephone department in Pine Street and he was assured that there would be no problems. Then the telephone was removed. On 17th December, 1968, this businessman addressed an application indicating that he required a telephone from the 15th January, because he would be moving to his new premises shortly after that. On 14th January&#x2014;and I have the correspondence here&#x2014;he received a letter regretting that there was no spare lines. At this stage he appealed to me and I contacted the department. The department was most sympathetic, but their hands were tied. They confirmed that there were no spare lines. There was no possibility of a shared service, because all the lines in that particular area already had switchboards. So, it was physically impossible to have a shared service. When I asked the sixty-four-thousand dollar question, as to when a new cable would be available and when service could be given, I was told that there were no plans to instal a new cable. I now want to quote from this man&#x2019;s letter to me. It is a desperate letter; an appeal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are plus or minus 65,000 people in South Africa awaiting telephones and the engineers are overworked and had not had the time to see to my problem as yet.</block>

<block name="quote">You are well aware of the type of business which we do and will agree that without a telephone we might as well close our doors. I have worked some 10 years to make this business into what it is to-day and now I have the prospect of seeing it hammered by the Government&#x2019;s inability to keep up with the expansion of business in South Africa. How can they expect immigrants to come here, sink their money into business and then be stymied by the lack of a telephone, I just don&#x2019;t know.</block>

<p>What kind of a business? No, not a crayfish business, but a business built up by hard and honest work. In the same area, it happened that when a certain man, planning to put up a R200,000 property to transfer his business activities, heard of this difficulty, he immediately felt that he would have to reconsider the situation.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the Pinetown area. I feel very sorry for the hon. member for Pinetown. He inherited something from me. It is none of my making, but due to the delimitation, a certain section of the Westville area, which I had had the honour to serve, was transferred to Pinetown. All the troubles which I had had for years only became more and more aggravated, with the result that the hon. member for Pinetown is a most disgruntled person and a most dissatisfied member.</p>

<p>As far as the Westville position is concerned, I know that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor indicated that there were certain plans in hand for Westville. It was just plans which have not materialized yet. From what I gather from the hon. member there are no signs really of early relief. The position is that there are 800 waiting applicants in the Westville area. They may expect telephones towards the middle of 1969. Further relief for one of the rapidly growing residential areas in Durban, will have to wait for the 1971-&#x2019;72 programme. Completion of those plans will probably take place in 1972. What about Pinetown itself? I would say Pinetown is possibly one of the most rapidly growing industrial and residential areas in the Republic.</p>

<p>These are the Minister&#x2019;s figures, is that a reflection on your Minister? We have accepted these figures. I only read what is written, and as the hon. member for Orange Grove said, these are the exchanges which have been closed, and the figures I will now give indicate the number of applications which cannot be met. In Amanzimtoti there are 931, Durban (North)&#x2014;1,003, Fynnland&#x2014;279, Hillcrest&#x2014;294, Kloof&#x2014;298, Overport&#x2014;560, Pinetown&#x2014;1,259. One has to add to the hop. member for Pinetown&#x2019;s troubles, the question of Kloof and Hillcrest as well. In Rossburgh the shortage is 1,883, Wentworth&#x2014;1,268. I referred to La Lucia and the facts of La Lucia make very sad reading. I know that in desperation the residents of that area drew up a petition, a petition which I believe&#x2014;and the hon. member for Durban (North) can correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;bore the stamp of approval of the local authority, because they too were absolutely desperate and fully aware of the needs of the residents. As far as I could ascertain from a rough check this petition carries over 150 names, and 93 of these people said their telephones were required for business purposes, whilst the balance were required for business and personal reasons. Of the 150 signatories, 93 said that the lack of telephones at La Lucia hampered their businesses. Where is the priority? Now we find&#x2014;no doubt due to the efforts of the hon. member for Durban (North)&#x2014;that the position is a little more hopeful. The previous Minister indicated that equipment needed to meet this crisis would be ordered on the 1971-&#x2019;72 Estimates and thereafter some provision would be made, but now, in view of the crisis, of the emergency, the position has improved just a little. It is hoped there will be temporary exchange lines for 400 subscribers in 1970. That is another whole year.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to his Minister to do something about this situation. I know he has taken over a difficult portfolio. I know that many of his problems arise from the unrealistic attitude which was adopted by his predecessor. Moreover, I believe the whole Cabinet is to blame for this state of affairs. I believe the hon. the Minister has been given a difficult task. I do hope he does his best and makes the best of a bad job.</p>

<p>This afternoon the hon. member added this, because he knew that he was going to be taken to task for his statement. The worst situation in the history of South Africa, he said. This afternoon he said, &#x201C;the worst situation barring one previous instance&#x201D;. Why did he not say this to the Press as well? Why does he mislead the country outside where he cannot be called to account, and why does he come and state the position correctly here in this House?

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, not over 21 years. I shall now tell the hon. member why this telephone shortage has built up over the past number of years. The hon. member is obviously not aware of the comprehensive steps being taken at present. I am now going to return the compliment which the hon. member paid me this afternoon, i.e. that I am so wonderful that I should have rectified this position in the space of one year, and I am now going to discuss his motion which is before the House. I am not going to do as he did&#x2014;he did not speak about his motion.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s motion reads that this House is of the opinion that the steps taken by the Government are inadequate and unrealistic. Sir, did it strike you that the hon. member did not refer here to a single step taken by the Government and the Department as an inadequate and unrealistic one. He did not mention a single thing, but I am going to mention them for him. Before doing so, I first want to tell him what the reason is for the backlog which has built up during the past years.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that since Union in 1910 the Post Office experienced problems, under the Public Service system of financing and administration, in satisfying all the requirements of the public in all respects. In spite of the fact that one commission of inquiry after another recommended that the Post Office be placed on an independent basis, in spite of the fact that commerce and industry emphasized this all along over the years, no previous Government proceeded to grant independence to the Post Office. If blame must be apportioned, it must fall on all previous governments, but not on this Government, which finally said, &#x201C;Look, we are now going to grant independence to the Post Office.&#x201D; [Interjections.] That side opposed it all those years. The greatest single problem which contributed to the backlog was the fact that the Post Office could not utilize its funds like a business undertaking in order to meet the demand for its services. Under the Public Service system of financing the Post Office could never be sure in advance what capital it would be able to obtain from year to year for the development of its telephone services. This made long-term planning impossible, and the hon. member for Orange Grove knows that this is the position. In the years of steady economic growth long-term planning was possibly not so necessary and so essential for the Post Office, but in the years of unparalleled, tremendous economic growth long-term planning became an urgent necessity. This tremendous economic growth has as hon. members know, continued to take place at an extremely rapid rate in South Africa during the past seven, eight years, thanks to the wise financial policy and the vigorous action taken by this Government in the interests of South Africa. To a large extent this economic development is attributable to <span class="col_0977-0978" refersTo="page_0508"/>and has been stimulated by this Government. Unfortunately progress also brings its problems along with it. The Opposition understand absolutely nothing about this because they know nothing of progress, they only know retrogression, such as they experienced once again last week. The rapid economic growth led to the problem of inflation in South Africa, and as a result Government expenditure had to be curtailed. As a matter of fact, the Opposition have continually been urging this for the past number of years and have said that the Government should curtail its expenditure. Inflation has consequently entailed the curtailment of capital expenditure and the capital services of the Post Office. This had to be done at the very time when the Post Office had the most need of the capital for its development programme to meet the demand for its services in a rapidly developing country such as we have here in South Africa. Therein lies the real cause of the backlog in our telephone services, together with the fact that the Post Office only gained its independence on the 1st of July last year. It has nothing to do with poor administration, it has nothing to do with poor planning, it has nothing to do with inefficiency on the part of the staff, as the hon. member for Berea wanted to suggest. It has nothing at all to do with a Door Minister or a poor Government. It has everything to do with a good Government which has governed the country so excellently, which has unleashed such economic growth and development in recent years that bottle-necks have developed, and one of these bottle-necks is the matter under discussion this afternoon, i.e. telephone services. The Government does not shrink back in the face of these bottle-necks, and consequently active steps have already been taken to make up the backlog. As a result of the vigorous action taken by this Government in successfully combating the danger of inflation, more generous provision can fortunately be made once again and capital can be made available for the expansion programme in respect of our telecommunications service. I said last year, but it seems to me as though hon. members were not listening, that it would take time to make up the backlog in our telecommunications services. I takes up to three years before an automatic telephone exchange which has been planned, can be put into service. There must be the necessary buildings, and the necessary apparatus must be obtained and installed. In other words, the services which are expected this year, while I am Minister, and in the succeeding two years, are still those services which were planned under the previous uncertain system of capital provision.</p>

<p>Is the shortage therefore going to increase further? *</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think it would be better if the hon. member just listened carefully. The services planned since the Post Office obtained its independence are services which can only be expected to yield results in the period 1971 to 1972 at the earliest. [Interjections.] I said this last year as well. There is nothing new in this. The Minister of Posts and Telegraphs of those hon. members said in 1946 that the backlog would be made up by 1951. This must also be kept in mind, because 1971-&#x2019;72 will mark the beginning of the real elimination of the backlog in our telephone services.</p>

<p>I now come to the motion which the hon. member introduced but which he did not discuss. He did not demonstrate to the House and to the country outside that the &#x201C;steps taken by the Government &#x2026;&#x201D; are &#x2026; inadequate and unrealistic&#x201D;. He did not even refer to a single step taken in the past year since the Post Office obtained its independence. I am sure that if the hon. member was aware of it he would perhaps have waited until the Post Office Budget was presented, in a month&#x2019;s time. I can understand why the hon. member did not wait for the budget, because heaven knows the United Party needs propaganda as no party in South Africa has ever needed it. The hon. member wants to make as much propaganda as possible for his Party out of this shortage of telephones. The hon. member admits that the steps taken during the past year will only show their effect in a few years&#x2019; time. Since the effect of the steps taken in the past year since the Post Office gained its independence, will only be evident in two or three years&#x2019; time, how can the hon. member describe those steps in advance as inadequate and unrealistic? These are wild and irresponsible assertions which the hon. member has made. He cannot support them with facts and realities. I want to explain to the hon. member what efficient and comprehensive steps have been taken and have been planned to make up the shortage of telephones and to meet the demands of the public. The telecommunications capital programme consists basically of two things, i.e. increasing the capacity of and modernizing the telecommunications system, and, secondly, the utilization of the extra capacity to supply services to new applicants. While the modernization of the system, i.e. the replacement of manual exchanges by automatic exchanges and the introduction of automatic trunk dialling, is improving the quality of the service, extra capacity is also employed for the purpose of granting relief at overloaded exchanges, for example, it is only in the first part of the programme, i.e. the increasing of capacity and modernization, that planning according to specific projects is involved. The second part of the programme, i.e. the utilization of the capacity, is actually routine work. It consists of the annual installation of thousands upon thousands of telephones in houses and offices. It does require funds, it does require labour, but it does not require the kind of planning which the first part of the programme requires. For the execution of this capital expansion programme of the Post Office certain factors have to be present. The five most important requirements for the execution of the capital programme comprise the following: Firstly, the provision <span class="col_0979-0980" refersTo="page_0509"/>of sufficient funds with which to finance expansion programme; secondly, the availability of apparatus and equipment with which the work must be done; thirdly, the availability of manpower that can do the work; fourthly, efficient control and administration; and, fifthly, efficient planning, and efficient planning includes a thorough knowledge of the problem and of the bottle-necks so that the programme may be planned in such a way that the quickest relief can be provided for the largest possible number of bottle-necks. Obviously the planning must take future expansion into account, so that further bottle-necks will not develop and so that the requirements of a growing economy can be satisfied. In a period of backlog in respect of telephone services, there must obviously be a heavy demand for extra capacity and a growing demand for more services. The further requirement in respect of the execution of the capital programme is of necessity the speeding-up of that capital services programme. All possible steps are being taken to speed up the execution of the capital services programme so that the backlog can be made up and the demand for new services be satisfied, as far as possible. It is evidently these steps which the hon. member for Orange Grove found to be unsatisfactory and described in his motion as inadequate and unrealistic. The hon. member never got that far in his speech. I now want to mention the steps which have been taken since the Post Office gained its independence. Let us deal first with the provision of funds, the funds which are necessary to finance the expansion. I have already indicated how the new independent basis of the Post Office and the successful combating of inflation, made greater Government expenditure on capital services possible. On the Estimates for the present financial year, i.e. 1968-&#x2019;69, an amount of R35.5 million was voted for the capital expenditure of the Post Office. Do you know. Sir, this represents the largest single amount voted in any one year for the capital expenditure of the Post Office in the entire history office Post Office since 1910. I should specifically like to know from the hon. member for Orange Grove whether he considers this amount as being inadequate and unrealistic.</p>

Surely the hon. member knows this to be the case. [Interjections.] In other words, these steps are adequate and realistic.</p>

<p>Here the largest amount in the Post Office&#x2019;s history is being utilized in one year and the hon. members want to describe it as being inadequate and unrealistic! But do the Opposition no longer remember what their standpoint was over the past years in connection with Government expenditure? Their standpoint was that the Government was spending too much, that the Government was causing inflation. In other words, if the Government had listened to the Opposition, R35.5 million would not have been voted on the Estimates, but much less.</p>

<p>But that is what has been wrong with your thinking for a long time, i.e. that on the one hand you want the services, but on the other hand you want less money to be spent!</p>

<p>Secondly, let us look at the availability of the apparatus and equipment. Over a number of years it has been Post Office policy to give preference to locally manufactured apparatus and equipment. The Post Office was to a large extent the stimulus behind the growth of the telecommunications industry in South Africa; an industry which is to-day able to manufacture the major portion of the equipment locally; an industry which has made an important contribution to the economic growth and development of South Africa. Does the Opposition find fault with this? Does the Opposition find it unrealistic and inadequate? However, it takes the telecommunications equipment manufacturing industry a few years to execute orders for the majority of apparatus and equipment. Just as impossible as it was in the past for the Post Office to achieve long-term planning, just as difficult was it to place orders a long time in advance, because they did not know whether the capital would be available when the orders had to be executed. Consequently we will have to wait for the equipment, since it is not simply readily available. Although the position is constantly being watched. I am satisfied that there are no other suppliers who can deliver the equipment more rapidly. The equipment can only be manufactured on order and it takes time to execute those orders. I should like to know from the hon. member for Orange Grove whether he considers this as being inadequate and unrealistic?</p>

<p>No, wait a moment. I want to tell the hon. member that he can make a positive contribution here. He can now tell us what adequate and realistic action to take to speed up delivery of our apparatus and equipment. I would heartily welcome it if the hon. member could tell me how it could be delivered more rapidly. There can be just as much money as is needed; there can be just as much apparatus and equipment as are needed; it still does not help us if there is not sufficient manpower to do the work.</p>

<p>This brings me to the third requirement for the execution of the capital programme. This is in fact where, as in nearly every other field, one&#x2019;s ability to carry out an expansion programme rapidly is limited by a manpower shortage. In this respect the Post Office is no exception. Certain steps have already been taken to combat this problem; other steps will follow shortly. The hon. member must simply wait until the Budget is presented on the 19th March to hear what they are. But I want to mention two steps which have already been taken. In my opinion the most important step which has been taken in order to combat this problem, is the decision last year by the Government to separate the Post Office staff from the Public Service. I shall give notice tomorrow of legislation to separate the payment and service conditions of the Post Office altogether from the Public Service.</p>

<p>This is the most adequate and realistic step which the Post Office has yet taken. Sir, in order further to accelerate the rate at which telephone services are provided, and at the same time to combat the problem of a staff shortage to some extent, it has been decided to have the installation of certain automatic exchanges done on contract by the official suppliers of telecommunications equipment. The contractors will use only their own staff. This means that the Department&#x2019;s trained technical personnel will then be available for other essential installation work and maintenance services. This will mean a saving of personnel to the Post Office. I want to ask the hon. member: Is this an inadequate or unrealistic step?</p>

<p>If the position is as the hon. member suggests, and if we are doing everything they have allegedly told us to do, why does he introduce such a motion, i.e. that the steps which have been taken are inadequate and unrealistic? [Interjection.] No, that hon. member should not betray his ignorance in that way. He has been out of the country for a few months. For at least three months he was out of touch with what was happening here. However, the hon. member for Orange Grove was here. I concede that he did not, as has been his custom in the past, issue a statement to the <i>Sunday Times</i> each week during the recess in connection with anything about which he knows nothing, because his place has been taken up in that connection by the hon. member for Hillbrow.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sunnyside referred to the reorganization of the Post Office administration which has been brought about by means of a new classification. Three posts of deputy postmaster-general have been created. A specific task has been allotted to each of them. This was one of my first steps as Minister. I shall explain the purpose of this, and this brings me to efficient control and efficient administration. The three Deputy Postmasters-General together with the Postmaster-General will constitute the administration of the Department, and they will accept the major responsibilities in respect of the rapid expansion and improvement of Post Office services. Secondly, they will be collectively and individually responsible for efficient financial control and properly co-ordinated planning to ensure good service. Thirdly, they will ensure proper and adequate service, as well as effective utilization of manpower and increase of productivity. Again I want to know from the hon. member whether this is an unrealistic and inadequate step. I get no reply. The hon. member has no views on it. I have carried this organization through further, also to bring about efficient control and administration. A regional organization has been introduced for the Post Office. Instead of having 19 separate divisional heads throughout the country, as before, only seven regional organizations have now been created, each with a director at its head. There is a two-fold justification for this, i.e. firstly to co-ordinate the Department&#x2019;s decentralized executive activities at the respective centres, thereby bringing about greater efficiency as well as an overall saving, and secondly to reinforce the decentralized administration organization to such an extent that Head Office can be freed of routine duties <span class="col_0983-0984" refersTo="page_0511"/>by means of the delegation of authority. Specifically in respect of telecommunications services it was necessary for the executive technical services on the one hand and operational services on the other which are responsible to the public, to be combined under one head. This has now been done in the various regions. I now want to ask the hon. member for Orange Grove: Is this an inadequate or unrealistic step?</p>

<p>Why has the shortage increased?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member has a bee in his bonnet about the shortage. He should rather think about the shortage in his own party. Perhaps he will then be able to offer them a solution. I am now discussing the hon. member&#x2019;s motion. The motion declares that the steps which I as Minister have taken on behalf of the Government, are inadequate and unrealistic. I am discussing this now. But the hon. member is apparently obsessed with the shortage of members on that side of the House, which now has to work harder as a result of the fact that there are so few of them.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to go further. Effective planning is necessary. It is a requirement for the execution of an expansion programme. Only by means of effective planning can one ensure that the expansion of services satisfies needs where needs exist. I am purposely mentioning planning last of all, because before one can plan, all the other factors must be present. We must have the necessary capital, we must have the equipment, we must have manpower that can do the work, we must have efficient control and efficient administration. Only then, when one knows the problems that exist, can planning be undertaken.</p>

<p>Have you got a long-term plan yet? *</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I already had one last year. I mentioned it last year. The hon. member will find it in last year&#x2019;s Hansard. [Interjections.] For efficient planning efficient administration and control are a prerequisite. Planning is nothing new to the Post Office. We already planned as far as planning could be properly undertaken under the old dispensation. Because planning was undertaken under the old dispensation in the Post Office, a capital programme exists for the expansion of telephone services. I mentioned this last year. The hon. member may look it up. On this occasion I want to say that good progress is being made with the execution of this capital programme. This capital programme is not being carried out at a slower rate than was planned. In fact it is being carried out more rapidly. Does this satisfy the hon. member? He does not know about it, because the Estimates have not yet been presented, but at this stage already he moves a motion that the steps which have been taken are inadequate. He cannot even see the results yet. He has not yet seen the picture as a whole. [Interjection.] No, the hon. member has had enough time. He must keep quiet now. Give me a chance as well. The hon. member is condemning in advance the steps which have been taken. He is condemning, them before he has seen the whole picture. He allows himself to be misled by what hon. members tell him, for example about how they have occasional difficulties with a telephone call or a telegram. If I, as Minister, have to give my personal attention to every telegram and telephone difficulty, this shortage of telephones will never be eliminated. I must lay down the policy. This I am now doing, and now the hon. member for Orange Grove must listen to it.</p>

<p>Sir, what else has been done in connection with the capital programme? The question may justifiably be asked; How have we improved our planning machinery?</p>

<p>I am afraid I have no more time left, but I may just briefly mention what plans have been drawn up. A Division of Planning and Finance has been created. Liaison has been effected between that Division of Planning and Finance and the Advisory Planning Council of the Government by having the Deputy Postmaster-General (Finance and Planning) serve on that Council. Reorganization has been undertaken on a regional basis. The regional director accepts regional responsibility. Regional responsibility can no longer be evaded. Where the director accepts regional responsibility, he can enlighten us. Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should very much like to say that we are aware of each of these difficulties and bottle-necks which hon. members mentioned here this afternoon.</p>

Special steps are, for example, under consideration in connection with the position on the Witwatersrand. These will be announced at a later stage. We are fully aware of the position. These steps which have been taken, and which I have mentioned, are the steps which the hon. member described as inadequate and unrealistic. Sir, that hon. member moved a motion here, and then did not even consider it worthwhile to discuss his own motion. I think that the motion moved by the hon. member is an unrealistic and inadequate one.</p>

<li>(2) cope with the economic difficulties of the farming community and alleviate the disastrous consequences of the present drought directly on the agricultural industry and indirectly on the whole of the economy&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>The hon. the Minister on Monday afternoon said he was going to give us an account of the economic events at home and abroad. Well, Sir, allowing, as we do, for the coming Budget and the limitations placed upon the hon. the Minister by that fact, one is bound to say that he did not say a great deal about a number of subjects in regard to which a good deal of public concern is being expressed. The hon. the Minister referred to the international situation and his recent trip abroad. It appeared from his statement that the future of the international monetary situation remains as uncertain as it ever was and even more so, in fact, with the events of the latter half of last year in France and with the uncertainty of the new administration in Washington. The hon. the Minister, in dealing with these questions, is playing his cards very close to his chest. We understand the need for that and we do not take any exception to it. He is heavily engaged against very powerful opponents in trying to reinforce the position of gold as a medium of international exchange which he believes, a belief which we share, requires a reasonable and, he insists, an orderly increase in its price. Sir, we support him in that objective, and on the principle of not interfering with the man at the wheel we do not wish to say anything in this House which might embarrass him in his efforts. As I see it, Sir, he has two objectives; firstly, to seek an increase in the price of gold, as he says, not as the result of international financial collapse, but in an orderly way by general agreement. He believes that circumstances will bring that about. Presumably his faith is sustained by facts and by information which he does not feel at liberty to disclose and we therefore have to leave it at that. All we can say is that <span class="col_0987-0988" refersTo="page_0513"/>we hope that that faith will be justified in due course.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his second objective is to make satisfactory arrangements with other important countries for the marketing of our gold without playing into the hands of his opponents who would very much like to see the free gold market flooded. When the Minister speaks of monetary authorities, as he does, I take it he is referring to central banks other than the so-called group of ten, whose proposals at the recent I.M.F. meeting he was unable to accept. He was unable to accept them because they did not allow for the four principles which he quoted here on Monday afternoon, principles which we think were quite right. Here again therefore we can only agree that his attitude in this respect was the right one in our opinion, and express the hope that his negotiations with other countries which he said he was hopeful about will succeed in achieving what he wants, namely a method of marketing our gold at the official price without disturbing the free market.</p>

<p>That more or less covers I think what the hon. the Minister had to say in regard to the international position. He has succeeded in establishing himself on the European capital market by negotiating Swiss loans for a period of 15 years, something which we on this side encouraged him to do, as we encouraged his predecessors for a very long time. Therefore we think that is a step in the right direction. Apart from the fact that he has established himself in that market, it is not quite clear why he found it necessary to get that loan. But I think the very fact that he succeeded in establishing himself as a long-term borrower is probably sufficient reason for doing so.</p>

<p>When we come from high finance down to earth, the Minister referred to domestic events. He claimed that the economy had remained reasonably stable during the last year, but he was clearly concerned with the continuing danger of inflation and all it means. He referred to the excessive liquidity as a potential danger, together with the shortage of skilled manpower, and the decline in the rate of industrial expansion. He referred to the Government&#x2019;s efforts in all three of those directions. Whilst one concedes that those efforts have achieved something, one cannot say as one looks at the position to-day that those efforts have been particularly successful. The excessive liquidity to which the Minister referred has been dramatically revealed in recent months by the frenzied activities on the Stock Exchange, about which the Minister has warned the country more than once. When we see that last week the Johannesburg Stock Exchange turnover amounted to something like 3 million shares a day&#x2014;they handled some 17 million shares during the week to the value of about R54.5 million&#x2014;when we read of brokers working from 7 o&#x2019;clock in the morning till 11 at night, closing their offices because they are tired and cannot handle the orders and cope with what business is offering, then one realizes the amount of money, or near money, and particularly credit, there seems to be available. I must say that I was surprised, having regard to circumstances as they are today, that the hon. the Minister did not issue a more urgent warning than he did in regard to the temporary insanity which seems to be afflicting the Stock Market at the present time, because the reaction to what is going on at the moment I think may be very serious to the country&#x2019;s economy. In fact, it looks to me that, after all the efforts by the hon. the Minister to drain off excessive liquidity from the economy, one would imagine at the present time that there is more excessive liquidity than there ever was before in the country.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to the manpower shortage and the fact that bottlenecks still exist in spite of the efforts of his Government to reduce them. I wonder if he realizes that the manpower shortage is going to get much worse if the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s colleagues continue in their policy of turning all the non-White industrial labour in the country into contract labour. I think we might ponder over that problem and try to understand how impossible it is going to be for industry to increase its productivity and maintain its efficiency, let alone increase it, if the whole of its non-White labour force is going to be made subject to contract labour, or holding a 12-month contract. The whole conception of that policy seems to me so unrealistic that I still cannot believe that the Government intends to continue with it. If they do, the country is going to pay a very high price for it. The rate of industrial expansion is another serious point the hon. the Minister mentioned. After maintaining up to 1967, an average rate of increase of about 9 per cent, for the first eight months of last year it dropped to about 3 per cent. That is a very serious drop. The industries have given a number of reasons for that. They stated the reasons in detail. I do not propose to repeat them this afternoon, but most of them concern the Government&#x2019;s policy. It is not only the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department, but that of several other Ministers as well. If the hon. the Minister wishes to see the rate of industrial development rise to what he would regard as a normal rate, I would advise him to examine those reasons which industry has given for the very substantial fall in the rate of fixed investments and expansion and consult his colleagues to see what can be done about the present state of affairs.</p>

<p>All the indications, I think, to be drawn from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech are that after a period of, I will not say stability, but a period of passivity anyway, the cost of living which is a sure indicator of inflation, has begun to rise again. The consumer price index rise for the period March, 1967 to March, 1968, was something round about 1 per cent. In the five months from March, 1968, to August it rose by 1.7 per cent. The hon. the Minister told us on Monday that the <span class="col_0989-0990" refersTo="page_0514"/>figure for 1968 was 2.7 per cent. The figures released yesterday by the Bureau of Statistics show that up to the end of January the consumer price index for all items rose from January to January by 3.4 per cent. The increase, therefore, for the financial year ending in March may very well be 4 per cent. This brings me to the subject of the amendment which I have laid before the House. The position seems to be that some people are getting rich, and that some, if all we hear is true, are getting very rich, whilst with every rise in the cost of living a large number of people are getting poorer. This is the point I think the House should take note of this afternoon.</p>

<p>I am now referring to the pensioner and the man who is living on a limited fixed income. I think there are three things one can observe in this regard. In the first place we find a large group of people who suffer from every increase in the cost of living and from every depreciation in the purchasing power of the rand. There are something like 120,000 social pensioners, 20,000 civil service pensioners and between 5,000 and 6,000 Railway pensioners. These are white pensioners, and when we include the non-white pensioners the figure will be much higher. If one should add to this figure the pensioners from the provincial services and the local authorities and the drawers of pensions from private pension funds one will arrive at a very substantial figure indeed of people who are living on a small fixed income and who will be affected by any increase in the cost of living. I also want to say that the Government continually prodded by the Opposition over the years, have not been unsympathetic to the position of these people. We have a Social Welfare Vote of something like R125,000,000, a great deal of which is used for pensions and allowances. But Parliament as a whole has never yet applied its mind to the question of the cost of living and the effect on the lower income groups. It has never applied its mind to the cost of living as a permanent problem. It has, surely, become obvious now that if the country is going to go on expanding at a substantial rate, as it is planned, there is going to be a steady increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>The third point is that the cost of living has been contained, restrained at any rate, compared with the rate of increase a few years ago. However, the cost of living has by no means been stabilized. In fact, at the present moment it is still rising. If you break down the figures of the Bureau of Statistics, a breakdown of the overall increase, you will notice that for the five months up to the end of August, when we had the last statement from the Bureau, food increased by 2.5 per cent, services by 3.6 per cent, medical services by 5.8 per cent, rents by 2.5 per cent. By the way, during the past nine years or so rent has, of course, increased by about 45 per cent altogether. Meanwhile, as you know, the cost of building is still rising and while that is going on rent will tend to increase as well. As we all know, the price of bread has been increased while in many parts of the country things like electricity, water and general rates have all gone up. There is one particular item I would like to refer to. This is not a major item in itself but yet is causing a good deal of annoyance to people. I refer to the prices of admission to cinemas, an item which is included in the statistics issued by the Bureau although I am not sure under what particular heading. Its weighted average is about 2.1 or 2.18. There is this tendency, particularly amongst suburban cinemas, to push the prices of admission up. In my own area there are four suburban cinemas. In recent years three of them have been refurnished, done up, refurbished and had their names changed. They are now called &#x201C;luxury&#x201D; cinemas. With that, the prices of admission have been substantially increased. In addition, whereas formerly films were changed at least once a week and the most expensive seats were in the vicinity of 60c or 70c, to-day the same film is being shown for months on end while the 60c to 70c seats have gone up to R1.25&#x2014;almost doubled. I find it difficult to believe that such a large increase is justified. On the face of it I cannot help feeling that a long suffering public is being exploited by what is a near monopoly, a monopoly serving quite a large number of people. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he might well ask his colleague the Minister of Economic Affairs to look into this matter and consult the Price Controller to see what exactly is happening.</p>

<p>The Government has accepted an estimated annual growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent for the gross domestic product for the next five years. Personally I have not seen that statement yet, which I consider to be a pity. It was issued to the Press last week, I think, by the Minister of Planning and all we have seen is a short summary thereof in the Press. Well, I think an important statement like this should be given to Parliament first, seeing that it was in Session, before it was given to the Press, or at least at the same time. Surely this statement is appropriate to this debate, and yet we have not seen it. The conclusions set out in that statement were, obviously, arrived at after considerable research. Furthermore, the statement no doubt contains arguments for and against. But, as I have said, we have not seen it yet and, consequently, we have not had time to formulate any conclusions as to the correctness or otherwise of it. I really think that such statements should be made available to Parliament at least at the same time as they are made available to the Press. We have had similar projections before, and all of them have proved to be rather on the conservative side. Perhaps the Minister considers that 5&#x00BD; per cent is a satisfactory rate of growth to aim at, but does he think that the Government will be able to maintain that rate and, if so, will maintain it at that level? Because I notice from the report I have seen that if the rate of growth increases to a level above 5&#x00BD; percent <span class="col_0991-0992" refersTo="page_0515"/>our economy might find itself in difficulties. We have been told in this House that whilst our economy is expanding normally an increase in the price structure of about 2 per cent should not be regarded as entirely unsatisfactory. However, our present circumstances are not normal. After all, if the cost of living goes up by 3 per cent, which is more realistic than 2 per cent under present circumstances, it means a 15 per cent decline in the purchasing power of money over five years. As I have said before, we must remember that we are dealing with a very large body of people living on a very strict budget, unlike the Government, unlike the hon. the Minister. He is not living according to a strict budget. Between 1960 and 1967 his budget so far from being strict, has increased by nearly 160 per cent. All he does is to milk the tax payer, which I am sure he is going to do once more in a few weeks&#x2019; time. But the ordinary man cannot do that. He must live according to a strict budget and it is clear to everyone that he is greatly affected by the continually rising cost of living. If we accept that a normal feature of our economic life is going to be a steady, although gradual, increase in the cost of living and a steady reduction of the purchasing power of money then, surely it is time that we accepted it as a normal feature and did something about it.</p>

<p>We have long urged from this side of the House that as far as the Government is concerned there should be some machinery, however it is devised. After all, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department is an extremely resourceful department. They invented P.A.Y.E., they invented decimalization and they are going to invent metrification, and it has all gone very smoothly, and no doubt if they were asked to devote their minds to this question some system could be devised whereby the people we are talking about could be protected against the serious decline in the value of their money. There should be some scale whereby for every increase of so many points in the cost of living their pensionable allowances could be adjusted accordingly. We have pressed for that for many years and we shall continue to do so, and in the light of past experience, if the Opposition continues to press long enough, the Government sooner or later will do something about it; it will come up with the bright idea and then say how clever they are.</p>

<p>The other half of my amendment refers to the drought. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, who is not here, just in passing, if he comes into this debate&#x2014;and I daresay he will&#x2014;whether he is in a position to give the House some more information as to how far he has got in settling the question of compensation to farmers for last year&#x2019;s crops in connection with the devaluation in Britain. This discussion has been going on for a year now and finality in many cases has not yet been reached. I think the Minister might tell us to what extent he has reached finality and give us details of the agreements he has made. But I do not have to tell this House that the drought is going to hit the agricultural industry directly, and very severely indeed. It may not have been generally realized outside the agricultural community that it is going to hit the whole economy indirectly as well. At the end of last month the president of the S.A. Agricultural Union, which may be regarded as a responsible authority, said that the drought could develop into the worst disaster for the agricultural community since the depression of 40 years ago. Some of us can remember the depression of 40 years ago and just what it meant to everybody. He also said that crop losses had already amounted to millions of rands, and millions more would be at stake unless it rained. He said it could mean a shortage of meat later in the season and a shortage of dairy products, that it might affect the balance of payments, and it would cause a piling up of farmers&#x2019; debts which are already considerable and crippling. He said that 50 per cent of the maize crop in the Free State, 20 million bags, had already been lost. The effects of the drought on agriculture will be dealt with by other speakers. But I am dealing now particularly with the people who are suffering as the result of the high cost of living. There is no doubt that this drought will affect them, too. All this means an increase in the cost of living plus possibly increased taxes which the community may have to pay in order to help the agricultural industry through the disaster which is threatening it. Perhaps you will remember, Mr. Speaker, that in the 1965 drought fruit prices alone went up by 6 per cent, and if there is going to be a prolonged food shortage, as suggested by the president of the Agricultural Union, prices must go up, which must affect the cost of living. So, Sir, from the point of view of the people on whose behalf I am speaking this afternoon the Government should not wait until all this has happened; it should not wait until the people are suffering. Knowing that it is going to be called upon to cope with the position, the Government should be prepared in advance to deal with it so as to be ready to help when the position arises, as in the case of the agricultural industry it has already arisen and is arising.</p>

<p>The purpose of my amendment, Sir, is to call attention to the necessity to take urgent action in regard to these matters. What we want from this Government is less ideological legislation and more action to meet the needs of the people.</p>

<p>As I intimated recently, and seeing that inquiries have been addressed to me from various quarters, I wish to make a statement on what is known as Hong Kong influenza. This disease has lately been causing epidemics in overseas countries, but so far our country has escaped <span class="col_0993-0994" refersTo="page_0516"/>it. Up to now there have only been seven confirmed cases in the Republic. However, these cases arrived from abroad and on their arrival they were placed in isolation until their recovery. As far as could be ascertained, they had not transmitted the disease to any other person in the Republic, and I should like to give the House the assurance that not one further case has been diagnosed out of all the specimens which have been sent for analysis to the South African Institute for Medical Research. The disease is nevertheless expected to occur in the Republic as well during the months of autumn. With the information at our disposal I can, however, put the minds of the public at ease as far as the nature and the seriousness of the disease are concerned. With the exception of a number of American cities where the occurrence of the disease coincided with extraordinarily cold weather, reports indicate that the disease is not a very serious one in the case of normal, healthy persons. The number of deaths attributable to the disease is extremely small. In densely populated areas in the East where epidemics occurred they abated after three weeks. This influenza affects the respiratory organs and is accompanied by fever, bodily pains and a sore throat. Its victims should rather remain at home, preferably in bed, for the sake of their own health, as a safeguard against possible complications and in order to avoid infecting other persons. However, as I have said, the disease is a fairly mild one and if the normal precautionary measures are taken it should present no serious dangers. Absence from work may, however, assume serious proportions and cause serious disruption.</p>

<p>Influenza occurs in various forms and in a variety of strains. Unfortunately there is no vaccine which gives immunity to all the various strains, and as a result a special vaccine has had to be prepared against this particular form.</p>

<p>The vaccine is at present being produced by the South African Institute for Medical Research. As it is expected that the Institute will not be able to have a sufficient supply ready in time, it has been decided also to import some. It is expected that adequate supplies of the vaccine will be available by the end of this month. The cost in respect of the imported product will possibly be lower than the cost in respect of the locally manufactured product. The imported product will, however, be of the same standard as the locally manufactured one. The necessary steps have also been taken to ensure that the vaccine is effective, and I am satisfied that it is indeed effective.</p>

<p>However, the effectiveness of the vaccine is limited, and the immunity provided by a single dose only lasts from four to six months. The vaccine is produced from eggs. Persons who are allergic to eggs or albumen should rather not make use of the vaccine, and persons who suffer from urticaria (papular urticaria), asthma, hay fever and other chest complaints and are sensitive to penicillin should inform their doctor, so that he may judge whether administering the vaccine would be warranted. It is advised that a single dose only should be administered. Reaction after immunization is usually minimal.</p>

<p>In order to prevent essential public services from being disrupted through the absence of employees as a result of a disease, it has been decided to immunise key staff free of charge. For this purpose the Department of Health has established an <i>ad hoc</i>-committee on which the Departments of Police and Defence, the Provincial Administrations and local authorities are represented, and which is to determine which groups are to receive preference in being immunized. These groups include all doctors and nurses, policemen, prison staff, members of Parliament and Parliamentary staff. The Department of Posts and the South African Railways and Harbours have been kept informed of developments and will make their own arrangements in collaboration with the Department of Health.</p>

<p>However, the vaccine will also be available through the ordinary commercial channels, and persons wanting to have themselves and their families immunized should please make their own arrangements with their private doctors. It is expected that the cost for the vaccine only will be about R1.20 per dose.</p>

<p>Members of Parliament, Senators, heads of State Departments, staff of members of the Cabinet and officials working in the House of Assembly and Senate will be vaccinated at the clinic in the Parliamentary buildings. All other Parliamentary staff will be vaccinated at the office of the local District Surgeon in the Thomas Boydell Building, corner of Parade and Barrack Streets. Further details of times and dates will be announced at a later stage.</p>

<p>Other persons throughout the country who are included in the preferential groups will be vaccinated by their local district surgeons and circulars in this regard will be issued soon.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister of Health has chosen to come into debate at this stage to make a statement. Might I suggest that the Minister might have taken another occasion to do so. He has made a very interesting statement indicating the steps being taken by his Department to prepare the necessary vaccine and to give the necessary protection against Hong Kong flu and to avoid the disease being any more serious than need be as a result of the special arrangements being made by his Department. However, had he chosen another occasion a little earlier, we might have had the opportunity of studying his statement and the Minister would also have had the opportunity to reply to the questions raised in the course of debate. He now denies himself the opportunity of taking part in this debate. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The Minister of Finance in his speech the other day indicated that he can give very little further explanation with regard to the position of gold. One can readily appreciate the necessity for this, because the Minister is in difficulties, and he has to maintain a certain measure of secrecy over the question of the negotiations in regard to the gold price. We share the Minister&#x2019;s sense of responsibility and we will not embarrass him in that regard. We can only wish him well in his negotiations.</p>

<p>The Western world has embarked on the &#x201C;paper gold&#x201D; system, the two-tier system, which we discussed last year during the Budget debate. The Minister told us about the two-tier system and his difficulties in maintaining that system. But then we were faced with the position that America had a deficit on her balance of payments, and South Africa was striving not only for an increased gold price, but for the right to sell her gold on the free market as well as to international bankers at a fixed price.</p>

<p>But times have changed. Last September the French franc was in a position to endanger the dollar. The attitude of France in buying gold threatened the American dollar. But since last September the picture has changed once again, and we find that, far from America having a deficit on her balance of payments, for the first time in 11 years America has a balance of payments surplus. We find that in South Africa there is an inflow of money, with increased liquidity and an increase in the Minister&#x2019;s problems. We are entitled to ask the Minister whether he cannot tell us yet whether he sees the two-tier system remaining a permanent part of the gold position.</p>

<p>I would like to put two questions to the Minister. I would like to ask him whether America has yet agreed with his contention that the member countries are bound to buy gold at 35 dollars an ounce, or whether any prospects of agreement are imminent; and whether he sees any risk of the price of gold being depressed below 35 dollars an ounce. The Minister is in a difficult position in that regard, because so far the free market price of gold has been in excess of 35 dollars an ounce. The Minister knows that if too much gold is put on to the free market, the price is going to be depressed. He has been having certain negotiations with the international bankers, hoping to reach an agreement on his contention that they are obliged to buy all the gold which South Africa may have to offer at 35 dollars an ounce. Does the Minister see any prospects of agreement in that regard?</p>

<p>There are tremendous pressures involved, not only political pressures, but also pressures due to speculative influences. There is no doubt that the Russian incursion into Czechoslovakia altered the picture as far as the American dollar is concerned. The Russian aggression in Czechoslovakia has had the effect of encouraging a flight to the dollar. I think the political pressure in that regard has had the effect of increasing the flight to the dollar and of strengthening the dollar, putting America in the favourable position she is now in. In that respect, is the change in the fortunes of the American dollar not putting the Minister in a more difficult position? The general impression we gained was that the Minister&#x2019;s position was improving. The general impression has been that he is optimistic and I wonder if he is entitled to be so optimistic as he suggests. It seems to me that if there is a flight to the dollar and there is a surplus the position will be likely to be that America will get more than ever confident in the dollar and will be less inclined to increase the price of gold and to agree to suggestions of an increase in the price of gold. Will the American effort not be to insist as far as possible on maintaining the price of gold at 35 dollars an ounce?</p>

<p>Is the hon. the Minister not less optimistic than he was last year? Last year all the signs pointed to an increased gold price, but the whole picture has changed in the last eight months. The position changed in September when the French effort failed. The position changed again when Russia walked into Czechoslovakia and we again had the flight to the dollar. Will America not feel more confident than ever that she can hold the present price of gold? I think the hon. the Minister should not be so optimistic as he suggests. I would like to suggest that the Minister should take a more conservative point of view. Over-optimism, or even ordinary optimism, encourages speculation. The headlines and photographs in the papers of Monday afternoon, while the Minister was making his speech, gave some inkling as to the extent to which the fever of speculation had gripped certain sections of the community. It is against this background of optimism and speculation that we must examine inflation. This speculative fever has encouraged and contributed towards inflation and towards some of the troubles which we have now. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that the dangers of inflation are still with us. In spite of all the steps that have been taken there is still the possibility that the flames of inflation can consume the standard of living which we are enjoying at present. If South Africa is to survive long-term as an economically active nation she must sell her products of her secondary industries on the world markets. She must prepare for the day when the gold mines are exhausted. For this reason it is essential that the cost structure of secondary industries be contained not only to ensure that the gold mines&#x2019; life is extended and will continue as long as possible, but also to ensure that there is an outlet for secondary industries when the gold mines have ceased.</p>

<p>We have seen some drastic changes of thinking over the last 12 months. Shares have increased in value giving less than 1 per cent return and yet they still go up. New shares come onto the market. There are mergers and <span class="col_0997-0998" refersTo="page_0518"/>take-over bids and, at the same time, startling failures. These are businessmen who have miscalculated and find themselves compromising with their creditors. The day of allotment is more important than the Day of the Covenant. Many young executives spend more time watching the market than watching productivity in their respective businesses. If you had any doubt on that point, Mr. Speaker, you need only have gone to the various stockbrokers&#x2019; offices in this city over the last two or three days to find ample evidence of that. You would not have been surprised if the Minister had gone down and seen one or two members of his own Government down there as well.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I was not down there, Mr. Speaker, but I have reliable information. I attend to my duties in the House; I do not go wandering around the streets speculating on the share market. [Interjections.] Some people do not deal on the stock market; they buy houses in the group areas.</p>

<p>The saying goes that you can make more money on the stock exchange in a month than you can make from your firm in a year. That is quite common talk amongst some young men. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister really does know of the fortunes which have been made over the past 12 months both in share dealing and property speculation. I wonder if the Minister is having a sufficiently diligent inquiry made into the amount of dealing that is going on both in properties and in shares. He has the power in terms of the statutes which he has before him at the moment. We can deal with that at a later stage, but I suggest that it is something to which the hon. the Minister should give attention. The Minister has enjoined us to save for prosperity. In fact, he emphasized this by saying: Save for your own future, save for your family&#x2019;s future, save for your country&#x2019;s future. He did not say that such saving would be in eroded rands. Only last year we pointed out to the Minister that, while he was encouraging saving, his colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, was apparently giving different advice, in that the Industrial Development Corporation had invested in mutual funds, and the National Growth Fund was inviting the public to invest their funds as a hedge against inflation. It was promising a far more productive return than that offered by the Minister of Finance. I am pleased to see that the warnings given by us have been heeded. The latest report of the Industrial Development Corporation indicates that the Corporation has withdrawn from the mutual fund movement. I should like to say that we welcome the fact that the Minister accepted our advice timeously.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. the Minister has given a general warning about speculation in shares and property. He has given this warning on more than one occasion. Leading members of the Stock Exchange have given similar warnings that the position is unhealthy. But, Sir, are warnings enough? Has the Minister been sufficiently severe in his warnings? Does he feel satisfied that the present stock exchange and property boom can continue? Is he satisfied that excessive credit has not been given to speculators? I know of a case where two or three young men&#x2014;obviously names cannot be mentioned&#x2014;together raised a bank overdraft of some R27,000 towards the end of last year. They tried to obtain certain shares which were being allotted. Eventually the number of shares they obtained was less than 1,000, but over R27,000 was borrowed from the bank, at interest paid on overdraft for a period of about six weeks. That kind of borrowing from the banks must be contrasted with another example of a young man who came from overseas with his family, his father and mother and his brother. They were all invited to come to South Africa after discussing the matter with one of the members of the Government side. This young man went to South Africa House and asked for advice. He was told that he would be welcome in South Africa. He was a young farmer. His family brought &#x00A3;100,000 to South Africa. A portion of that amount was given to the one brother, and a certain amount was used by the father. The young son, who had been farming successfully overseas, had some R30,000 of his own. He was able to obtain a farm costing R85,000 in the Natal Midlands. He went to the Land Bank, and the Land Bank gave him a very meagre loan of approximately R34,000. The value of the loan was far lower than he had expected when he first started negotiating for the loan. The matter was brought to my attention, but I was unable to succeed in obtaining a better Land Bank loan for him. I could not help but compare the efforts of this young man with the case I mentioned earlier. He came out here with a wife and three children. He is going to be a good South African citizen, and he is going on to the land to follow the same calling he followed in Scotland before he came to this country. He cannot obtain money for farming, which is productive, and yet a couple of young men who want to speculate, managed to obtain over R25,000 almost without asking.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, on the nod, as the hon. member says. When one hears first hand of conditions of that kind, one wonders whether we are living in a crazy world. While I respect the Minister&#x2019;s warning, and while I realize that the Minister is concerned about this matter, I suggest that this matter has not been sufficiently emphasized. It is in the interests of the country that this speculation should be contained far more than it is. It is going to have its effect on the economy as a whole. The Quarterly Bulletin of the South African Reserve Bank, which appeared in December, last year, states:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_0999-01000" refersTo="page_0519"/>During the third quarter the total of money and near money continued to grow faster &#x2026;</block>

<p>I should like to emphasize this point &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; than the production of goods and services, and the ratio of money and near money to the gross domestic product therefore increased still further. Fortunately, as indicated above, this high level of liquidity has not yet led to undue demands, on the supply of goods and services, but was confined mainly to the financial sphere, where share prices increased sharply to new record levels.</block>

<p>There is the fault, Sir. This is a statement which appeared in the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s Quarterly Bulletin. Similar conditions applied over 30 years ago when we experienced Black Friday. I hope that we are not going to experience another Black Friday, but if we do, to what extent is the Minister going to accept responsibility? With the present returns on share investments and the rate of development which has taken place in regard to properties, one wonders whether costs are a factor in calculations of any importance. And yet when one investigates the position of the ordinary civil servant, the white-collar worker, the old-age pensioner, and the person living on a fixed income, one finds one and all of them saying that they find great difficulty in making ends meet. The gap between rich and poor is widening. That is the point, and yet we have the incongruous position that while the gap is widening, people in the middle and higher income groups find that the taxation system is a disincentive to greater effort. The hon. member for Constantia has already pointed out that there has been a 2.7 per cent increase in the cost of living. The Minister himself agrees with this figure. He said that the retail price index had increased by 2.7 per cent. The increase in food prices over the past 12 months is 3.6 per cent. If we accept that the increase of 2.7 per cent per year will continue over the next five years, it will mean that a person having a fixed income of R200 per month will only be able to buy R173 worth of goods and services in five years time. One must remember that ordinary Civil Service pensioners and old-age pensioners have incomes of considerably less than R200 per month. The lower the scale of income, the harder they are hit by increased food prices. We pay for the lowering of standards of living ultimately by lower standards of health. That is the point. There is no point in increasing the number of hospitals, and then finding many of our non-European hospitals filled with people suffering from deficiency diseases, in many cases because they cannot afford to buy food, because the cost of food has gone up and their income has not gone up proportionately. To use the words of the ordinary man in the street, everything is coming up and nothing is coming down. However, in this Cadillac age that may not be understood. We find a shortage of staff everywhere, but particularly in the managerial field. And yet we find the tragedy of men who are retired before their economic life has ended. There are takeover bids, mergers take place and men in their early middle age are put on the scrap heap. It is a tragedy of the present system, which we see to-day, that men who could be gainfully employed are discarded. The recent fever of take-over bids has in many cases caused men to be put out to grass when they can still be gainfully employed. That is a factor which the Minister could bring to the attention of the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Social Welfare to see whether something cannot be done to use the abilities of these men while they still have many useful years before them. I had the opportunity recently of visiting Australia, New Zealand and the Far East. In every country I visited I found the emphasis placed on productivity, but in this country the emphasis is placed on ideology and productivity is forgotten. Unless we lay the emphasis on productivity and make a determined effort to reduce costs and place our industries on a competitive basis, we will find ourselves losing out in the competitive world. We will have to reduce our industrial costs if we want to compete. For far too long we have been talking about training our manpower and far too little time has been spent on getting on with the job. We need to train our manpower because we are in the middle of an economic war where victory only goes to the fittest. We find that our neighbouring countries are already giving concessions to encourage industries. In Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland industries are being invited to settle in those countries and they are being offered concessions to go there. Because of the conditions which apply in South Africa we may find ourselves in a competitive situation without realizing it. When I visited Japan last year I found industrialists concerned not with investing in South Africa, but in investing on the borders of South Africa, in Swaziland and Botswana, honing to establish industries which would give them an opportunity to trade in the South African market as well as in the African market as a whole. Those are factors which have to be considered, particularly in South Africa to-day where the inflationary spiral is such that costs are going up. You cannot have a situation where shares are returning less than 1 per cent without realizing that the day of reckoning must come, and when that day of reckoning comes, the ordinary investor will not be satisfied with 1 Per cent. They are satisfied with 1 per cent to-day because they rely on an increase in the capital value of the shares, and as the increase in the capital value of the shares is not taxable they are getting the benefit there. But eventually the time will come when the return on the share investment will count, and we will find ourselves in the position where not only will we endanger the position of the gold mines by having increased costs in our secondary industry but we will find ourselves in a difficult position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the outside world; and the outside world <span class="col_1001-1002" refersTo="page_0520"/>will be right on our borders, the countries to the north of us and countries like Lesotho which are within our borders. Unless we take note of this and realize that our first duty is to our own people, we will find ourselves in difficulties. We must contain the inflationary spiral and ensure that as many people as possible get work, that we do not have people who are idle, and that we do not have an imbalance in our labour market. Unless we do that we will be in trouble.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia has already pointed out the difficulties in regard to contract labour. We find in all our industries the difficulty of getting continuity of labour. We find that in our factories we build up a certain dexterity and experience among our non-white workers and then they go back to the Reserves and they find it difficult to get back again, so that we have lost their skill. They have difficulty in getting back because after they have left the factory and gone back to their homes the officials find that they belong to a different ethnic group and so they cannot get back again. On the other hand, we find able-bodied men in the white sector of South Africa being axed because of mergers and being unable to find work, whilst there are factories which could increase their productivity, but they have not got the trained men to do the job. The whole picture is a disorderly one, one which does not encourage us to feel that the Government has come to proper grips with the situation. We can expect in a month&#x2019;s time to have the Budget and another surplus, a record surplus of possibly over R50 million. My guess is as good as that of anybody else, but I do not suppose the Minister will tell us now what he expects the surplus to be. It would certainly be unique if he did, but I think this is an opportune time to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he gives some consideration to giving relief to those who need it most, and here I have a few suggestions to make: (1) Relief for the old-age pensioner; (2) the smoothing out of the bulge, particularly as it affects the middle-income groups who are inclined to ease off because of the lack of incentive: (3) further relief for married women who work; (4) allow farmers a better spread of their profits and losses over a period of years; (5) withdrawal of the discriminatory 1 cent tax on beer; (6) abolition of estate duty and gifts tax. I do not expect the Minister to give an indication of his Budget proposals at the end of this debate, because he will quite rightly keep them for the Budget, but I would remind him that his predecessor was given advice in the past. In Col. 1446 of Vol. 96 of Hansard, the hon. member for Constantia made a plea for the following: (1) The abolition of estate duty and gifts tax. We have not got that yet. (2) The averaging of the farmer&#x2019;s income for income-tax purposes over a period of three years. We have got that partially. (3) The exemption of a fixed amount of income from income-tax if invested in Government securities. The Government has accepted this advice, because it was good advice. (4) The exemption from income tax up to a specified limit of premiums paid by self-employed persons to secure retirement annuities. The Government has accepted that advice, too. If the Government goes on accepting the advice of the hon. member for Constantia and others on this side of the House, it will eventually get out of its troubles. As I say, we have given the Minister advice in the past and he and his predecessors have sometimes belatedly accepted it. We supported him in his efforts in regard to the gold price, but in the meantime we want to remind him that the country will not accept the state of affairs where the ordinary man in the street finds it more difficult to live while seeing his neighbours &#x201C;getting rich quick&#x201D; through speculation. The widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, between the &#x201C;haves&#x201D; and the &#x201C;have nots&#x201D;, creates a fertile bed for unrest. The Minister and the Cabinet must realize that both the townsman and the farmer expect and demand much more from the Government than they are getting now.</p>

<p>The amendment introduced by the hon. member for Constantia is in point of fact a good testimonial for the hon. the Minister of Finance. Almost nine months have elapsed since this House prorogued, and in those nine months members of the Opposition could find no reason for introducing an amendment to-day which really has a bearing on his Department. The two reasons for this amendment being introduced and for their not being prepared to approve the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Estimates, are concerned with other topics. The first one deals with pensions, which are important, and the other with farming, which is also important, but the amendment offers no criticism and advice as regards the work and the policy of the Minister of Finance. That is why I think that it is fitting for us on this side of the House to congratulate the Minister on the excellent work he has done over the past year.</p>

<p>I do not wish to say much about these two specific points as they come under another province, but by your leave, Sir, I want to say that no previous government would have been able to improve upon what this Government has done for the farmers. This is not a case of what has to be done; it is indeed being done. We have only to look at the list of concessions and benefits the hon. the Minister of Agriculture has been granting to the farmers and how, over the past five years during which we have been stricken by drought, he has come forward from time to time with new ideas and schemes for helping the badly hit farming community to the best of his ability. But it stands to reason that he himself cannot take over the farming industry. In this regard 1 also want to say that that side of the House offered no suggestions whatever as to ways in which the farmers should be assisted further.</p>

<p>But we have already had two speakers. The same applies to the pensioner. I can also say that this side of the House, the Government, is extremely sympathetic towards the problems of the pensioners. We are aware that there are problems of inflation. We are aware that their earnings, their pensions, are decreasing as the years go by. Hon. members on that side are aware that, in order to meet that problem, the Government has in fact increased pensions from time to time. If I am not mistaken, pensions were increased once again only last year.</p>

<p>A moment ago the hon. member for Constantia suggested that pensions should be related to the cost of living. Sir, that is not a new suggestion. The hon. member for Constantia knows very well that members on this side of the House also raised these problems on several select committees&#x2014;this has been recorded in black and white&#x2014;and said that the Government would be well advised to think along those lines and to have the matter investigated. The hon. member is aware that England is working on a scheme for relating pensions and earnings to a cost-of-living index. There are problems and it is not for me to say that this can be done. But this is an important matter towards which the Government has adopted a sympathetic attitude and to which attention is being given.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the question of cost of living about which so much has been said. It is true that the cost of living is rising continually, but throughout the world it is being accepted to-day that gradual increases in the cost of living are virtually inevitable. The Government must under no circumstances&#x2014;this has been the experience of other countries&#x2014;take such measures as would cause the cost of living to fall or remain constant. Germany wanted to do that. A few years ago she took drastic measures, and what was the result? She found herself in a serious recession and then she said&#x2014;this was her experience&#x2014;that no government should take such drastic measures as would curb cost-of-living increases entirely. This would have been ideal, but it does, in turn, create new problems and especially unemployment problems, which often hit the workers harder than an increase in the cost of living would have done.</p>

<p>Sir, what the hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Pinetown omitted to say, was that South Africa was still doing exceptionally well for itself. On several occasions in this House we have pointed out that as compared to other developed countries, South Africa has always come third from the top as regards combating cost-of-living increases. We regard this as an achievement, especially when this is seen in the light of the fact that South Africa has had one of the highest growth rates in the world, and this in itself is conducive to inflation. But, Sir, over the past year South Africa has improved its position. Hon. members on that side of the House would be well advised to look at international statistics every now and then; then they would be able to speak less critically and more highly of what the Government is doing and of its achievements. I have here the latest data since the previous Budget in March last year. These are the statistics up to August; it is the latest available information. Under the heading &#x201C;Changes in cost of living: Percentage change in 12 months&#x201D;, the following information is furnished: Whereas previously South Africa occupied the third position, it now shares the first position with Germany as far as this period is concerned. It is absolutely astonishing that under difficult circumstances South Africa was more successful in curbing the rise in the cost of living, which is a world problem, than was any other country except Germany. Sir, in actual fact South Africa did better than Germany, because Germany found itself in a recession; she had surplus capacity which South Africa did not have. Over this period the amount of money and near-money increased at a much faster rate than it did in Germany. There was a percentage increase of 13 per cent as against 8 per cent in Germany. We are, therefore, on firm ground when we say that although the Government would have liked to have been able to restrict cost-of-living increases to an even greater extent, there is, if one applies criteria for gauging South Africa&#x2019;s success, not one single country that has done better than South Africa has.</p>

<p>Without boasting we on this side of the House regard this as a considerable achievement&#x2014;a better achievement than that of the party opposite when they were in power. I have data here which shows how they did. From 1938 to 1948, under their regime, the average increase was 4.75 per cent per annum. From 1948 to 1967, under this Government, it was 4.3 per cent per annum; in other words, an improvement of 10 per cent on their achievement. They are so fond of giving advice. A moment ago the hon. member for Pinetown once again gave the Government a great deal of advice. Sir, this Government likes listening to good advice, but is it not strange that those who do not know how to solve their own problems, are so fond of giving advice to other people? As far as cost of living is concerned, it is being said that the people are having such a bad time. Recently a survey was made by <i>South African Industry and Trade</i>&#x2014;the results of which were published in <i>The Star</i> of 12th February, 1969&#x2014;of salary increases as against cost-of-living increases, for this is of fundamental importance. Now I want to read out to you, Sir, the conclusions that were arrived at&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Generally speaking, however, it appears that increases in salaries over the past four years have been more than adequate to meet increases in taxation and the rise in the cost-of-living index.</block>

<p><span class="col_1005-1006" refersTo="page_0522"/>&#x201C;More than adequate.&#x201D; In spite of inflation the workers did better for themselves. Over all the years under National Party regime their standard of living has risen, on an average, by 2.4 per cent. Over the past 20 years our standard of living has risen by 50 per cent. Our standard of living to-day is 50 per cent higher than it was in 1948 when this Government took over. We are aware that over the past few months the inflation trend has once again become slightly stronger, but the Government is giving this its careful attention and we can expect the Minister to take even stronger measures, if necessary, to control inflation.</p>

<p>A great deal has also been said about the question of liquidity. Mr. Speaker, South Africa is actually living in an ocean of liquidirty, it is true, but that ocean of liquidity is the result of prosperity; it is the result of too much money; it is the result of too much confidence in South Africa on the part of the outside world. This is by no means a bad position to be in. We are just as conscious of that problem as hon. members on that side are. May I ask whether they suggested methods for combating the problem? Yes, they suggested one. They said that we should integrate our non-white workers in the white areas economically, in the sphere of labour. Sir, we say that our non-Whites have every opportunity to develop. They can advance themselves in the border industries, and if that side of the House would support border area development and industrial decentralization and would encourage our industrialists to go to the border areas, then border area development could make more rapid progress. But this Government is under no circumstances prepared to permit the economic integration&#x2014;as we understand it and as it is defined in dictionaries&#x2014;of the Bantu in the white areas, for that would mean political suicide. Hon. members on that side know very well that political suicide does in fact mean economic suicide as well. The Government has taken other measures and is aware of the fact that we must attempt, as other countries are doing, to increase the productivity of our working community. That is why we established the Productivity Council, and that is why that Productivity Council is at the moment looking intently into what has to be done in order to accelerate the increasing of our productivity. As regards the question of liquidity, which is also a problem, the Government has tried to counteract this and to reduce its inflationary effect by means of its bank credit restrictions. At this stage the Government does not consider it necessary or desirable to intensify those measures any further, for those measures also give rise to other bottle-necks and problems, particularly in the banking system. Admittedly, the Government is watching the position carefully. I can only say that there are few other measures left which the Government can take. The Opposition is of the opinion that there are in fact further measures that can be taken, and I can also mention a few more. The Government can quite easily impose a tax on durable consumer goods, for one of the problems we are experiencing today, is the increasing consumption which is moving at a more rapid rate than is our national production. Sales tax is another possibility. I could mention other measures as well. However, one does not want to move too fast, especially not at this stage, because, as the hon. member for Constantia rightly said, seen from the economic angle our industrial production is moving at a relatively slow rate, namely 3 per cent. The hon. member for Constantia complained about that. The Government did in fact contemplate such a low rate with these measures, since the too rapid industrial development had brought about this problem of inflation. Naturally, this does not mean that this rate will remain as low as this. It will fluctuate and the Government hopes that within the foreseeable future it will rise again.</p>

<p>The hon. gentlemen opposite also spoke about the prices of shares and the Stock Exchange. It is true that authorities on this subject are of the opinion that the Stock Exchange has reached an unhealthy high and that this is dangerous. They think that non-authorities in particular will burn their fingers. The hon. the Minister acted correctly when he warned the public to be careful. South Africa is a capitalist state and not a socialist one. The Government cannot order a person to buy properties instead of shares. There is no connection between the instances in the example mentioned by the hon. member for Pinetown, i.e. that he could not obtain money to buy a farm, but that another person could in fact obtain money to buy shares. How does that hon. member know that the farm in question was an economic proposition, and how does he know that to buy shares at present is not an economic proposition? Surely, the State cannot interfere in this matter. You are aware of the legislation which will most probably be introduced in the course of the current Session, legislation in terms of which better control can be exercised over the Stock Exchange. We want to state very explicitly that the Stock Exchange is a private institution and not a Government institution. Although it is the duty of the Government and the hon. the Minister to lay down the rules and regulations in conjunction with that exchange so as to ensure that it operates on a sound basis as far as possible, it is, however, an exchange where private investors either risk or do not risk their money, and too much interference on the part of the Government can do more harm than good.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to refer to the question of gold, which has also been raised here. From the nature of the case the hon. member for Constantia is quite correct. It is true that we do not know about all these things and that we cannot or may not speak about all these things. However, there are many things we can in fact say. The hon. member for Pine-town said that he thought the hon. the Minister <span class="col_1007-1008" refersTo="page_0523"/>was over-optimistic. I should like to ask the hon. member what the effect would be if we were pessimistic. If one does not have confidence in the justness of one&#x2019;s case, then one has lost before one has started. As I shall now point out to you, Sir, the Minister&#x2019;s optimism is completely justified and there are many good reasons why the Minister can take as firm a stand as he has in fact taken. Before this problem can be grasped, I must furnish you with a few figures. There are four aspects which are important in this regard. Firstly, how extensive are the official gold reserves and where are they? Secondly, how extensive are the unofficial gold reserves and where are they? Thirdly, how big is the demand for industrial and jeweller&#x2019;s gold? Fourthly, what do other experts think of the justness of South Africa&#x2019;s case? I want to touch upon these points in brief. The total official gold supply amounted to $38.6 billion towards the middle of last year. The total unofficial gold supply (i.e. the accumulated supplies) amounted to $22.5 billion, i.e. the unofficial gold supply is equal to approximately 37 per cent of the total available gold supplies in the world. It is interesting to note that it is for the most part the United States itself and industrial Europe which are in possession of the greatest percentage of official gold. The United States and industrial Europe taken together are in possession of 76 per cent of the total official gold supply of the world. These are the ten countries about which so much has been written. The United States alone is in possession of approximately 25 per cent of the world&#x2019;s gold. Now I come to the point I should like to make, i.e., that the gold reserves amount to approximately 58 per cent of the world&#x2019;s total reserves. Gold is still the major reserve monetary unit and it enjoys the greatest measure of confidence in the world, especially that of financially strong countries such as France, Switzerland and Belgium, which hold high percentages of their total reserves in gold reserves. The U.S.A. holds 80 per cent of her reserves in the form of gold reserves, Switzerland 87 per cent and France 86 per cent, just to mention a few examples. It is worthy of note that the official gold supply has not increased since 1958. In 1958 the total gold supply amounted to $38 billion and in 1968 it was $38.6 billion. This is one of the major problems which has been held up by the hon. the Minister from time to time, namely that the international lack of liquidity is the result of a lack of sufficient gold. This is still the metal and the reserve monetary unit which enjoys the greatest measure of confidence in the whole world. As regards the unofficial gold, there is, as I have said, 22.5 billion dollars&#x2019; worth in the world, but over the past year this has risen by almost 14 per cent. In 1967 it was $19.7 billion and in 1968 it was $22.5 billion. These unofficial gold reserves are equal to the gold production for 15&#x00BD; years, taking the 1967 figures as a basis. The question now is where is the unofficial gold? We suspect that it is mainly in the oriental countries. It is true that the oriental countries, Asia, have more or less the same quantity of gold in supply as the rest of Europe has, i.e. excluding France; Asia has $4.8 billion in unofficial gold reserves, the Western Hemisphere has $4.4 billion, France has $4.8 billion and the rest of Europe has $4.3 billion. As you can see, Sir, the accumulated gold is once again more or less the same countries, the speculation gold as many people call it. Let me read out to you, Sir, something which is very interesting. This is what Dr. Pick, an American monetary expert, has to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Among the main buyers of gold during the past 12 months &#x2026;</block>

<p>i.e. 1968&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; were not, as generally advertised by Government propaganda, the wealthy oil princes of the Middle East, but thousands of rich and nouveau rich Americans who, in full defiance of official Government legislation, preferred monetary security &#x2026;</block>

<p>i.e. gold&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to Washington&#x2019;s relentless expropriation via the rising cost of living.</block>

<p>This is in America, which herself accumulated so much over the past year. This is an indication of the confidence in gold, in spite of all the propaganda that is made by the American government.</p>

<p>There is a last point at which I want to pause, i.e. how extensive is the industrial use of gold, including jewellery? The present estimate is that it is 40 per cent of the world&#x2019;s annual production of gold. This includes the Russian gold production. In regard to that country&#x2019;s production there is no definite information; the only information we have is their actual sales. If we take that as an approximate basis, as well as their production over a period of five years, it appears that the world&#x2019;s total gold yield is $1,442 million per annum. In 1966 the industrial use of gold amounted to $640 million. If we were to project the future, taking the past ten years as a basis, and if the consumption of industrial and jeweller&#x2019;s gold were to increase at the same rate, it would appear that in the year 1980 the demand for gold by industry alone would be equal to the total production of gold in that year. That means that in 11 years&#x2019; time the demand for industrial gold would be more or less equal to our production. That is why we can tell the whole world that we need not be afraid as regards the future of gold. Apart from the important role it plays as monetary gold, as gold for the central banks, there is the growing demand for industrial gold.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to quote a few passages dealing with the way in which the world views this problem, our case, the question of international liquidity as well as the role of gold. Let us listen to what Sir Gressing Vocham, <span class="col_1009-1010" refersTo="page_0524"/>chief of the Academy for Central Bankers in Europe, had to say recently. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While, however, affirming that the two-tier gold system was right, we central bankers are not prepared to see gold pushed off the stage so that life will be made easier for reserve currency countries.</block>

<p>According to this report he spoke these words &#x201C;amidst loud applause&#x201D;. On 17/10/1968 the Governor of the Bank of England said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For my part I find the tendency to attack the role of gold in the system somewhat ironic, when it is not gold which is the root cause of the present uneasiness but doubts about the alternative reserve assets.</block>

<p>Those are, of course, the dollar and sterling. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While admitting all the imperfections of gold as a monetary asset the enthusiasm for getting rid of it owes much to the fact that in this inflationary age currencies cannot stand comparison with it.</block>

<p>This was said by the Governor of the Bank of England. Let me also quote what was said in New York by the National City Bank of America, which indicates that even in America our case is now beginning to gain ground.</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the circumstances, it is evident that efforts to safeguard and improve the international monetary structure cannot be concluded successfully until the matter of an adequate gold supply is dealt with &#x2026; The most essential task to-day is to face the matters related to gold in an emotion-free atmosphere so as to avoid misunderstanding, mistrust and mishandling.</block>

<p>All these passages I have now quoted constitute adequate proof to the effect that the case put forward by the Government of South Africa is right, that the Minister&#x2019;s optimism is entirely justified, and that this is the road South Africa has to follow. We must not walk upon the road of pessimism or of less optimism. The present road is the road which we must follow and the one we must work on in order to achieve success. I repeat that it is only when one believes in the justness of one&#x2019;s case that one can expect success.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with these words: I do not know of any other period in our history where South Africa was financially and economically as well off as it is at present. Under difficult circumstances the Government has not only succeeded in gaining the full confidence of our foreign entrepreneurs, and that in spite of bad predictions and prophecies of doom from that side of the House, but also in gaining the confidence of the Western world as never before. This testifies to success and nothing but success.</p>

<p>I see I have to contend with the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation as well now. To go on, the hon. member for Florida has missed a further point, namely when we talk about protecting those who are dependent on fixed incomes, we are not only talking about pensioners and civil servants and people of that kind. We are also talking about the people whose money the Minister wants, namely the man and the woman he wants to invest in fixed interest securities. I will have something more to say about that a little later. What amazed me most this afternoon was to hear the hon. member for Florida, for whom I have a great deal of respect as an economist, stand up in this House as a protagonist of inflation. I do not think we have ever heard this in the House. The interesting thing is that thereafter he explained that although we have inflation, it has done little harm.</p>

<p>He said we must have inflation. He said that is the view of people throughout the world, and asked what had happened in countries where they decided they must contain inflation, where they had not inflation but deflation. He also dealt with the Stock Exchange and with gold. I will also have something to say about that in the course of what I have to say.</p>

<p>Now, this problem of excess liquidity is quite obviously causing the hon. the Minister concern, as it is causing serious concern to other people in this country.</p>

<p>In the statement that was released by the hon. the Prime Minister after the meeting of the Economic Advisory Council, held in August last, the Council expressed the opinion &#x201C;that official policy must henceforth distinguish very clearly between control over the domestic economy and the solution to the problem of liquidity&#x201D;. These views were underlined by the Minister of Economic Affairs in <span class="col_1011-1012" refersTo="page_0525"/>a speech he delivered to a symposium of the National Development and Management Foundation on business prospects for 1969, when he said that &#x201C;the objective of reducing excess funds in the economy would be given high priority in the Government&#x2019;s economic schedule for 1969&#x201D;. I agree that a distinction must be drawn between the domestic economy and the problem of liquidity, but I hope that we will not carry this distinction too far. These two questions are clearly inter-related in many respects. Excess liquidity, by its very nature, must have an impact on inflation. We are indeed fortunate, as the hon. the Minister has rightly said, that the inflation or the effect of liquidity has been mainly in the financial sector. But the hon. the Minister also very rightly said that there was a danger that the excess liquidity would spill over into the domestic economy. This is very true. I believe that it is already happening, and particularly, that at least part of the profits that are being made in the share market, through speculation, are already flowing over into the trading sector. The public is not reinvesting all the profits they are making back into the market. These profits have been abnormally high. In 1968 the market increased by no less than R6,000 million. These profits are finding their way into buying new motor cars, new furniture, new domestic appliances, new luxury goods and a higher standard of living. I think we can expect this process to continue.</p>

<p>In January the hon. the Minister announced that his immediate objective was to reduce liquidity by R250 million. This amounts to substantially less than the R400 million which the Minister of Economic Affairs mentioned in October of last year. Therefore, between October, 1968 and January, 1969, either the position has changed to the extent of R150 million, or the hon the Minister of Finance, in setting a more achievable target, is perhaps more of a realist than the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. It is strange, but this difference in figures has a familiar ring. We have noticed in the past in this House that hon. Ministers of Finance and hon. Ministers of Economic Affairs do not always speak with the same voice. Despite the more limited objective of the hon. the Minister of Finance, I do not think he is going to find his task an easy one. The sources from which he draws compulsory contributions to Government securities, such as insurance companies and mutual fends, are all experiencing very buoyant conditions and automatically contributions which these institutions are required to make by law, will flow to the Minister and will, no doubt, be substantial. But I have a feeling that the contributions from the voluntary sector may well present a very different picture. It has been said here, but one has to repeat it, because it is factual, that the public is riding high on the stock market, that they believe has no ceiling. The market is drawing off millions of rands which normally might well flow into the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s fixed interest bearing securities. But the rate of inflation rose again last year. We have had the figures already. The public is very deeply concerned with the continued erosion of their money. If we are to place any reliance on the economic surveys which we have had lately, there are very sound grounds for concern by the public. They have not been reassured by the figures the hon. the Minister gave us on Monday, which have been added to to-day by the hon. member for Constantia. The climate for fixed interest rate investments is not a good one at the moment, because the real basic problem is that the most conservative investor no longer enjoys a sense of security in fixed interest investments. There is no longer any peace of mind for him. There is no longer any certainty in investments bearing fixed returns on capital fully secured. The investor is in constant fear of a capital loss, in real terms, through money losing its value. Our problem is that hundreds and thousands of people would say, &#x201C;If my capital was to be secure, I would invest at fixed interest rates and have no worries&#x201D;. But they have worries. If they continue year after year to invest their money in fixed interest bonds, in building societies and so on, in 10, 15 or 20 years time, the capital is so eroded that they have done themselves and their dependants an injustice. This is the problem. I am a conservative. I would like nothing better than to take my few rand, and to say to the hon. the Minister, &#x201C;Take it and give me six per cent&#x201D;, if I knew that the value of that income and that capital would be constant.</p>

<p>No, I would not mind if it is not tax free; if I was assured that every time the capital depreciated, the hon. the Minister would make it up; because this is the fear of the investor. This is our problem. One sometimes wonders whether money as money is still the criterion of material wealth, or whether the yardstick to-day is not the assets one possesses, namely property, shares and businesses, the material worth of which is merely expressed in monetary terms. I think this is what is happening in the world; because we are living in a new era, an era of managed economies, an era which has been untouched by the spectre of a slump or a real depression in two decades, an era of a new generation, to whom the setbacks of the 20&#x2019;s and the 30&#x2019;s are merely history, a generation that scoffs at yields and talks only of growth. It is a generation to whom equities are gods, and money is merely the medium for their purchase. It is a generation on whom the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s warnings that the sharemarket is high, fall on deaf ears. The hon. the Minister, the most responsible Minister who can do so, has in this House warned the public on three occasions, that they are going to burn their fingers. What has happened? On each occasion the market has gone higher. There is no norm any more.</p>

<p>What do you suggest? [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps the market will collapse; perhaps the market will go higher. I often wonder who is going to be proved right: Those who say it is going higher, or those who say it is going lower.</p>

<p>We, who are a little older, have different views from these younger people with the new outlook. Perhaps we, who consider ourselves more mature and more experienced, carry too many old scars. We nurture too many inhibitions and we retain too many old prejudices. Perhaps over the course of time we have set up too many blockages to new concepts the penalty of the financial catastrophes that we have seen. While we are very busy postulating what ought to be, these young people who are full of energy, confidence, initiative, imagination and impatience, are confidently accepting what is. This is one of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s problems, and he knows it. He knew it when he introduced the first R.S.A. bonds which were to be tax free. He knew that to entice the public to invest in fixed interest securities, he had to offer special inducements. Quite correctly, he acted accordingly.</p>

<p>What is the hon. the Minister trying to do in regard to liquidity? First of all, he is endeavouring to repeat his successful R.S.A. bonds by issuing the new jubilee bonds. This bond differs in two respects. The first is the maximum family investment of R45,000 instead of previously R40,000. Secondly, the rate of interest is being dropped from 6 per cent to 5&#x00BD; per cent. It is true that, since the advent of the R.S.A. bond, the bank rate has been dropped by half a per cent and consequently general interest rates have dropped by half a per cent. I wonder if the hon. the Minister has not erred on the side of optimism by dropping his rate by half a per cent in conditions as we find them to-day.</p>

<p>I know that the cost to the country of tax free bonds is high, particularly if the capital sum is frozen, which I understand the hon. the Minister proposes to do. He said so on Monday. He was going to freeze some of this money. But it is so essential to reduce this liquidity that I think the hon. the Minister should have left the extra half per cent.</p>

<p>The second aspect of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s programme is his national savings certificate, where he will merely increase the permissible investment from R10,000 to R15,000. It is a step in the right direction. The third proposal is the Post Office savings scheme, where the hon. the Minister has made one change. One can now withdraw R30 on demand at four day intervals instead of previously R20.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister, if he seriously wants to use the Post office as a vehicle for encouraging savings, then he had better have a general look at the whole basis on which the Post Office savings account system operates.</p>

<p>Because what is the position? The present position is that each depositor can deposit up to a maximum of R4,000 in a Post Office savings account in any fiscal year. What does this mean? If I deposit R4,000 on the 1st April, the first day of the fiscal year, this year, and I withdraw it any time before the 31st March, 1970, the last day of the fiscal year, I am automatically debarred from again depositing any amount with the Post Office until the 1st April, 1970. Is this the way to get money from the public, by telling them that if they deposit it and then draw it out again, they cannot put it back again? Everybody else is spending fortunes on advertising, including the hon. the Minister on his bonds, but he will not allow anyone to put his money back. But worse is still to follow. If you deposit your money with the Post Office after the second day of the calendar month it will not earn interest until the beginning of the following month. The hon. the Minister does not pay you any interest for 29 days. And worse still, if you take it out before the last two days of the month, say for instance the third last day of the month, he does not pay you any interest for that month. Taking the case to the extreme, one finds that if you deposit money on the 4th of one month and draw it out on the 27th of the next month, the Post Office does not pay you any interest. It has had the money for two months, but pays no interest. This method of operation, and I say this with all sincerity, is unfair to the small investor, the little man who uses the Post Office as a means of saving. What is even worse is that I believe that the average depositor is unaware that this happens. I know the hon. the Minister will say to me that it is their own fault, that it appears in the Post Office regulations and at the back of the Post Office savings book. Like most members I have had a Post Office savings book since I was a little boy when my father gave me my first one and it was only a year ago that I noticed the regulations at the back of the book. I did not know that I was not receiving interest for my money for the full period that it was deposited with the Post Office. I hope that the hon. the Minister, in conjunction with his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, will do something about this. We are living in an era of intense competition for the public&#x2019;s money and this is not the way to get it. If the hon. the Minister wants to be competitive he had better put his house in order. He must not come to the House and say that he has not got the staff and that it cannot be done because of the clerical work. He should rather send a few people over to London to see what the Post Office is doing over there. They are paying your accounts and almost keeping you. He should investigate &#x201C;Giro&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The objective of the hon. the Minister to reduce the excess liquidity can of course be vastly helped by two other means. He could relax exchange control and he can give us another relaxation of import control. If we <span class="col_1015-1016" refersTo="page_0527"/>were able to use either of these two methods, the cost burden to South Africa will of course be very much less, because we will be getting a credit income from abroad instead of a debit for interest on frozen capital.</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is the gold reserves we are steadily accumulating and the solution of the gold sales problem. On the 31st January we had gold and foreign reserves of something well over R1,000 million. Of this amount the gold stocks were well over R900 million and our usable foreign exchange was about R100 million. The hon. the Minister has said from time to time, that to deplete our foreign exchange reserves further, by the relaxation of exchange control or import control would be hazardous. I agree with this. The 64,000 dollar then becomes: What about the conversion of our gold into usable foreign currency? The Minister has told us very frankly that he sold gold on both the free market and to the monetary authorities. Some sales were effected as late as the end of last year. We also know that the hon. the Minister is of the opinion&#x2014;and I do not know if it will help him, but I agree with him&#x2014;that in terms of the I.M.F. regulations they are bound to buy our gold at the price of 35 dollars an ounce in exchange for foreign currency. I agree with the Minister entirely. I am glad to hear from the hon. the Minister that he is supported in his views by the Managing Director and staff of the I.M.F. The problem is of course that the United States seem to take a different view. They did not even give us a chance to discuss the matter at the I.M.F. meeting, but cut the meeting short.</p>

<p>We also appreciate that the hon. the Minister is trying to find a solution to a very delicate problem. I am not going to promise not to embarrass him, but I am not going to embarrass him more than I have to and I certainly do not want to impede him in his task. On this front the hon. the Minister did not tell us an awful lot. He told us that he had discussions with &#x201C;the group of ten&#x201D;, but he did not tell us the proposals because it would not be in the interests of the country. This we accept. He then set out the four conditions, the basis on which, if I can use market language, he was prepared to deal. I agree with the hon. the Minister that if these conditions were accepted it will bring a more orderly process in attempting to find a solution to the world monetary problems. I believe that the conditions which the hon. the Minister laid down are fair and reasonable. I do not believe that the world can go on from one monetary crisis to another for much longer, unless, of course, we want to open the doors wide to Communism. I believe that events have shown that the hon. the Minister is right when he says that there is greater confidence in gold than in any currency. The question is, when are the other monetary authorities, of the Western world and the United States of America, going to accept these views? I do not ask the hon. the Minister to tell me. We are with him wholeheartedly in his endeavour to get these views accepted and we wish him nothing but success. I think, however, that in view of the situation we are entitled to ask the Minister for two assurances. The one is that he foresees no difficulty in South Africa obtaining the necessary foreign currency that she requires for her external payments. The second is that it will not be necessary to dispose of gold on the free market to the extent that we may depress the price below the official rate of 35 dollars an ounce. If we have these assurances from the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and I would not have asked these questions if I were not positive that he would be able to give us the answers&#x2014;all sides of the House stand firmly behind him in what he is trying to do for the benefit of South Africa.</p>

<p>These questions are particularly important at present, Mr. Speaker, because it would seem that our imports for 1969 are going to increase and that, because of the drought, our exports for 1969 are going to decrease. We are going to have a gap in our balance of payments position which, according to the Americans, we can only settle by foreign exchange.</p>

<p>Having said this, I, as had my colleague the hon. member for Pinetown, has done, want to anticipate the budget a little and just reinforce one or two matters. It has been said before, and I am making no apologies for saying it again, that in this lovely country of ours the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. While the rich are being given every opportunity for large investments far beyond the compass of the little man, tax-free investments for example, the burden of high taxation, soaring land prices, increased building costs and constant rises in the cost of living are hitting the lower and the middle income groups harder each day. The young man in the R4,000 to R8,000 income bracket, with his wife probably working, is finding it increasingly difficult to establish himself. I join the hon. member for Pinetown in hoping that there will be some relief from the bulge and for the working married woman particularly. I hope there will also be some further relief in respect of that item that can cause such a crushing blow, namely medical expenses. This has been asked for in this House over a period of years. I hope that the incremental rate in the higher income brackets will perhaps be adjusted, because it is crippling the professional men, the scientists and the chap we really want, the brains of the country. We cannot allow anything that will stultify incentive.</p>

<p>There is one last matter, and that is on the question of manpower. The Minister in his speech on Monday said that &#x201C;die tekort aan geskoolde arbeid nog steeds &#x2019;n knelpunt in ons ekonomie is&#x201D;. I could not agree with him more. Every time we discuss our economic position in this House we inevitably come face to face with one fundamental, namely that unless and until, while safeguarding the position of the white man, we are prepared not only <span class="col_1017-1018" refersTo="page_0528"/>to allow but to encourage all sections of the population to play their full part in our economic development, what are we going to live with? We are going to live with continuous and intermittent inflation, poor public services, and heaven knows some of them are poor enough, as we heard in the House yesterday afternoon, and constant measures which retard natural expansion. What is happening is, and this is the tragedy of South Africa, that the net result is a continuous brake on the optimum rise in the standard of living. Everybody should be better off, and we are not.</p>

<p>Sir, one day the public will realize, if it has not done so already, what might have been if our economy had not been hampered at every turn by Government ideology; what might have been if labour could be utilized to its full potential; what might have been if we had the rate for the job; what might have been if we had no Physical Planning Act. It might well have been the golden age that the hon. the Minister euphemistically spoke about last year, not a golden age for the few, not a golden age for the rich, but a golden age for all, a golden age in which the beginning would have been made to end poverty, a golden age in which every man could develop to his full potential, a golden age in which there would be a better life for each and every man and woman in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>It is not every day that one sits in this House and that a speaker on the other side gets up and says to our hon. Minister that he cannot agree more with what the Minister has done, or agrees with this aspect and approves of that aspect. We thank the hon. member for at least having thanked the Minister of Finance on behalf of his Party, and also for having indicated where they detected at least some good here. This is altogether different to what the hon. member for Pinetown said.</p>

<p>But I just want to return to a few small things which the hon. member for Parktown has just said. He asked two qeustions in connection with gold, whether it would be used for foreign loans and also whether gold would be sold. But I do not want to speak about gold. After all, the guidance which the hon. the Minister provided over the past year was clearly discernable in Press statements and explanations, i.e. that that is precisely what he is going to do. There is no doubt in anyone&#x2019;s mind about that, and therefore we hope that the hon. member will also accept that, i.e. that it is also the right thing to do and that as far as gold is concerned the whole House ought to congratulate the Minister on the very capable and skilful way in which our whole gold situation has been handled up to now; and I hope that those hon. member agree with one another.</p>

<p>Both hon. members on the other side spoke about inflation, which had soared, and said that things were still in a bad way, but surely the hon. members know that that is not so. There is a measure of inflation. I obtained the inflation rates for 1967 of all the Common Market countries as well as the EFTA countries, the U.S.A. and Canada. That is the last year for which figures are available, and there is only one country, West Germany, whose inflation rate was less than that of the Republic, i.e. 1.5. That of the Republic was 1.8 and all these other countries, all the Economic Common Market countries, the EFTA countries, America and Canada, had very much higher inflation rates. In Amercia it was 2.88 as against our 1.8. In Canada it was 3.5, in the Netherlands 3.4, in Italy 3.7, in the United Kingdom 2.5, and in this past year we are in an even better position. There must be a measure of inflation; 2 per cent is recognized as being normal. We are 1 per cent under that norm. This is surely excellent. What is all the noise about?</p>

<p>I want to say something about the Stock Exchange. The hon. members said that the Government is doing nothing and that the Minister&#x2019;s warnings are not good enough. It is true, as those hon. members have said, that the market value of the shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange increased by R6,000 million during 1968. This is almost as much as our national income. This is an unprecedented state of affairs and something must be done about it, but those hon. members did not offer a solution. I want to contend that this state of affairs which has developed, it partly attributable to the Opposition, but I shall come back to that. Let us just look at a few facts about the Stock Exchange. This tremendous increase in the market value is a record. We also found that last year there were 68 companies whose shares were quoted on the Exchange, also a record. It is estimated that about R2,000 million of new capital came onto the Johannesburg Stock Exchange last year, also an alltime record for us. The turnover in shares during 1968 was R423.9 million, and the value thereof was R1,203 million, with just a little over one million transactions. If this Stock Exchange goes on like that, South Africa runs the risk of encountering future set-backs. Some people are going to lose, and they are going to lose a great deal. It is my considered opinion that the time has now come, especially after a commission has been appointed to investigate income tax, to consider whether all transactions in shares should not be taxed, just like an ordinary commodity, just like clothes, etc., which are sold. In addition I want to put forward for consideration that if it were to be taxed as capital gain, we must only consider it in isolation, i.e. that if that gain in shares is to be taxed in the future, the losses incurred must be carried forward to be offset against gains in shares alone, and not against other income. This will assist in preventing our people from becoming so speculative. They are becoming reckless. Large sums of money are borrowed and gambled with. It is not healthy for a nation to go on like this. Therefore I feel that the time has come for these trans <span class="col_1019-1020" refersTo="page_0529"/>actions in shares to be taxed as ordinary commodities, subject to the conditions which I have imposed.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite asked why it is that these matters have got out of control. There are certain causative factors, and the most important is the tremendous prosperity which we have in South Africa. We know that in 1960 we had a tremendous recession and it was this Government itself which actually did everything to stimulate our economy, and it was done so well that to-day we are faced with prosperity problems.</p>

<p>On a previous occasion the question has also already been asked as to what we are doing on behalf of education in South Africa, and complaints were made that we are spending too little. Let us look at what is being spent on education. In the U.S.A. 10 per cent of the national income is spent on education, in the United Kingdom 7 per cent, in the Netherlands 6 per cent, and in South Africa 3 per cent. But I want to say that, of course, a large portion of this money goes directly to our universities and I think that the time has also come for us once more to give a little attention to the education at our universities. I want to express one thought here and that is that something must be done about the situation, observed over the past year at certain of our universities, where there are students who are wasting their time and the country&#x2019;s money and not studying as they ought to do. I think that in that respect we owe the Prime Minister a large debt of gratitude for his strong and firm action last year, which put these participants in &#x201C;sit-ins&#x201D; or loafers in their places. I think that at our universities in South Africa to-day the situation is such that the period in which students attend classes is altogether too short, and we must give attention to that. I think that the time has come for students to remain at university for longer during their period of studies. I see no necessity why the universities must only begin with classes in the middle of February and stop again in the middle of November. It was originally thought in earlier years that during this free period these people would devote themselves to specialization, but this is simply not done. It is my considered opinion that if the universities were to begin sooner and to continue for longer, so that the students remain at the university for a longer period to study, there would not be gadabouts and loafers, but that they would really work. We in South Africa cannot afford to waste one day of any man&#x2019;s work, and the more knowledge one can glean the better. The people must, of course, have their vacations, but too much of that is not a good thing either.</p>

<p>One of the barometers of prosperity is, of course, the number of motor cars in South Africa. We know that earlier a motor car was a luxury article, but to-day it is not a luxury article to everyone; it is also to-day an essential vehicle in many respects. Let us just look at the figures. We find that in 1967, 124,000 new motor cars were sold, as against 134,000 in 1968. This is an increase of 7.5 per cent. The new commercial vehicles totalled 38,000 in 1967, as against 42,000 in 1968, an increase of 9.2 per cent. As far as vehicles in South Africa are concerned, we know that attempts are being made to-day to establish our own motor industries here and that this is also being done on a large scale. We also know that there is a stipulation that there must be a certain percentage of locally manufactured components, and that the industries have an interval of five years to meet this requirement. But as a result of these encouragements we have too many makes of motor cars in the country and this entails unnecessarily high prices for motor cars, because each manufacturer competes with every other one to find a market for his own product. I also want to put forward for consideration the fact that the time has come for us to realize that it is not necessary to have 100 different kind of motor cars on the roads. Why can there not merely be 50 different kinds? This is something which must be investigated thoroughly and then one can see whether something can be done about it.</p>

<p>We have prosperity in this country, and another indication of this is the manner in which people advertise in order to do business. We in this country must be under no illusions; this prosperity is attributable to the actions and good government of the National Party. That is the case, and we are all thankful for it. During 1968 about R100 million was spent on advertising. It was spent in four ways, i.e. through the Press, radio, cinemas and in exhibitions. It is expected that the increase in these advertisements will be between 5 per cent and 10 per cent annually. As far as the Press in South Africa is concerned, we find that in 1968 about 70 per cent of this R100 million went to the Press. This is for advertisements placed in the Sunday papers at about R1.5 million a week and in the daily newspapers at about R1 million a day, plus all the rural newspapers and magazines which appear weekly, half-weekly, and monthly. As far as broadcasting is concerned, Springbok Radio has made tremendous efforts since its inauguration in May 1950 to obtain advertisements. Broadcasting even went further and in addition established four other advertising media, namely Radio Bantu, Radio Highveld, Radio Good Hope and Radio Port Natal. As far as advertisements are concerned, the radio is not as dangerous as the Press and the cinema. The hon. the Minister of the Interior recently warned the Press not to publish morally corrupting articles, to put their own houses in order, and that if they did not do so, legislation would follow. After the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s warning a great improvement fortunately took place and for that I want to thank the newspaper world. But as far as advertisements go, there is still tremendous room for improvement. If these newspapers do not put their houses in order where advertisements are <span class="col_1021-1022" refersTo="page_0530"/>concerned as well, I want to ask the hon. the Minister to put the matter right.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a great deal of criticism was levelled here to-day from the other side about the Government&#x2019;s activities, and the assertion was also made here that the white collar workers are not obtaining their rightful share of the country&#x2019;s prosperity. Sir, what can the Government do to bring about salary increases in the private sector without taking drastic action? As far as the Public Service, the Provincial Administrations and the local authorities are concerned, a great deal is indeed being done by the Government. I think it would be as well for us to review for a moment how many people there are in South Africa in the service of the State, by comparison with England and America. In South Africa, with a population of nearly 19 million, the Central Government has 276,000 workers, i.e. one out of every 72 of the total population. In Britain, with a population of 52 million, one out of every 52 is in the service of the State. In England there are one million workers in the service of the State. In England, where one out of every 52 of the population is in the service of the State, Government action can have much greater effect than in South Africa. We in South Africa believe in free initiative. We believe in maintaining capitalism intact here and in not inclining to socialism. Therefore we in South Africa cannot take too drastic action against the private sector. It is specifically in the private sector where our problem lies. The private sector pays much bigger salaries to its workers than are obtained by Public Servants and semi-Public Servants. We can surely not continually increase salaries because this will simply cause a spiraling effect. If salaries in one sector are increased, similar demands will emanate from workers in other sectors. There would be chaos. Therefore we must at least think before we request that salaries be increased. But let us compare South Africa with the United States of America because America&#x2019;s working conditions are more or less comparable to those of South Africa. In America, with 10 million workers in the service of the State, one out of every 19 of the population of 194 million is in the service of the State as against 72 in South Africa. In America it is therefore much easier for the State to regulate salaries as it wishes. Here in South Africa salary increases must be left to the initiative of the private sector. Let us also take a look at the Railways. The Railways have 221,000 employees of all races. The route mileage controlled by the Railways is 14,000. In England the British Railways have 400,000 employees and the length of their lines is only 16,000 miles, in other words, only 2,000 miles more than in South Africa while the number of employees is almost twice that in South Africa. And in spite of these figures members on the other side make the accusation that the productivity of our workers is not high enough! Are these positive indications not proof that our workers in South Africa do have a high measure of productivity? South Africa with an only 14 per cent smaller route mileage, needs 45 per cent less workmen to serve the Railways, and I think that we should thank our workers for such productivity on their part.</p>

<p>We must also take into consideration that Britain and the United States of America draw their workers from a population of well educated persons. In South Africa the position is altogether different. A tremendously large portion of our population is uneducated. About 50 per cent of the people in the service of the State and the Railways in South Africa are Bantu and then we are still much more productive than the workers in England and America. Why then do hon. members on that side come along with the insinuation that our people are not sufficiently productive.</p>

<p>No, Sir, we must at least give some analysis to the criticisms of the Opposition. The hon. member for Pinetown spoke about our industries. Let us just take a look at the position of our industries. In 1960 the total population of the Republic was 16 million. There were then 411,000 Whites and 737,000 non-Whites working in Johannesburg. If we add to this Vereeniging, Pretoria, Sasolburg and the cities of the Rand, we find that 75 per cent of the industrial production was concentrated in this small geographic area, in other words, also 75 per cent of our purchasing power. To-day I want to level the accusation at the Opposition that in spite of everything which this Government has done to decentralize industries, the Opposition has never co-operated. They cast suspicion on border industry development. The Opposition has thus far not made the slightest effort to assist the Government in encouraging our industrialists to establish their industries in other areas where cheaper production can be obtained and where they can supply our people with better facilities than in the urban complexes. Mr. Speaker, I shall return at a later stage to the question of our border industries.</p>

<p>I just want to say a few words about the Government&#x2019;s participation in our economic life. I do not want to mention my standpoint here; I want to furnish you with the opinion of Dr. Holsboer which appeared in the <i>F.C.I. Viewpoint</i> of January, 1969. Dr. Holsboer stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Apart from the mining house, the Government is the main representative of the capitalistic system in South Africa &#x2026;&#x201D; because &#x201C;&#x2026; of the total gross domestic investment, which amounted to R2,701 million, in 1967, R627 million or 23 per cent was accounted for by the business enterprises of the Government, including the Railways and the Public Corporations.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This Government therefore invested 23 per cent as against 67 per cent by the other sectors. Sir, if this Government had not made that investment, would South Africa have been so prosperous to-day? This 23 per cent was chiefly invested to establish the infra-structure of South Africa; to establish water facilities, railways <span class="col_1023-1024" refersTo="page_0531"/>power facilities, transport and telephone services, etc. I think that this figure of 23 per cent is not too high at all. The State, of course, wants to interfere as little as possible in the private field, but the State must also ensure that the necessary investments are made to stimulate our economy, because if the economy prospers, there are opportunities for work for the people. We have no unemployment in South Africa. As a result of this stimulation on the part of the Government all our people are to-day employed. Sir, I also want to furnish you with an additional figure; in 1960 the gross domestic investment by the private sector was R765 million as against R1,599 million in 1967. In 1960 the investments of our public corporations such as Iscor, Sasol, Amcor, Escom, etc., were only R63 million. In 1967 this figure shot up to R293 million. In other words, in 1960 investments by public corporations represented 8.3 per cent of the total investments by private industries, and in 1967 it was 18.3 per cent. I now want to put this question to the hon. member for Kensington whom I believe is going to follow up on what I am saying: is he satisfied with the fact that the Government invested so much through public corporations to establish the basic services, or does he regard it as having been too large a sum and that the Government should not have supplied these basic services? I put this question because the objections which were indirectly raised here, that the Government must first do certain other things before the Part Appropriation is approved, boils down to the fact that the Opposition does not want to ensure that these basic services are established. We find that the State specially applied itself to these four basic services. Iscor and Sasol are two of the corporations where the Government has made its contributions. I want to ask hon. members on that side where South Africa would have been to-day if the Iscor legislation had not been passed when a previous National Party was in power? If Sasol had not been founded, where would we have been to-day? Then there is another factor which is lost sight of and which I want to mention here, because we have heard that there is a major agricultural debate coming. The Land Bank must supply the necessary capital to the farmers. It is surely unreasonable to attack the Government about these matters which I have mentioned here and then still to complain that the farmers are not receiving sufficient assistance. Where will the capital which the farmers need come from unless the Land Bank advances it to them? Then there is also the I.D.C. A major attack was launched against the Government here last year in connection with the I.D.C., because the I.D.C. was supposedly becoming too large, expanding too much and had entered the domain of the share market. But if the I.D.C. does not advance money for the establishment of industries in the border areas, who will do so, because this Opposition does not want to propagate the establishment of border industries. They come along with the fine excuse that we should indeed allow white capital into the homelands, just 100 yards over the border, and they have not yet replied to the question I put to them last year, i.e. why those industries could not be established 100 yards to this side of the border. The I.D.C. is continually attacked because it encourages the establishment of border industries. We must remember that, by providing facilities for the establishment of border industries, the I.D.C. supplies work to the non-Whites in their own homelands. Would the hon. member for Transkei prefer to see the Bantu not obtaining opportunities for work in their own homelands, in border industries established with the help of the I.D.C.?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have the fortunate position in South Africa today that our commerce is sound and strong. We want to thank the Government again today for the foresight which it has already displayed for quite a few years in sending three special trade missions overseas. What were the results of those trade missions? In 1968 the following countries held exhibitions here in South Africa: Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, Spain, West Germany, Brazil, Japan, Rhodesia and Nationalist China. Belgium and the Netherlands held exhibitions here in previous years. Mr. Speaker, there is only one language the world knows and that is the language of pounds, shillings and pennies, rands and cents, dollars or whatever. By means of trade one builds up good contacts.</p>

<p>A further result of these trade missions which the Government sent overseas a few years ago, was that during recent years 13 different trade missions were sent to South Africa. The United Kingdom sent 12, Canada 1 and Australia 3, and the following countries each sent one trade mission to South Africa: New Zealand, the United States of America, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Iran, Malawi, Madagascar and Mauritius. We are grateful to those people who come here to make contact with South Africa and to extend our trade. We know a great deal is being done to promote our exports, but I should like to see even more done in this connection. Closely linked to this is the fact that we must <span class="col_1025-1026" refersTo="page_0532"/>promote tourism to South Africa. Only this morning we read a report in the newspapers that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about tourism last night at a function which he attended. We can entice many more tourists to South Africa. British tourists poured into South Africa during 1968. We do not have the final figures yet, but it is expected that the final figure for 1968 will be 50,000. Up to the 30th August of last year the figure was 30,972, an increase of 7,159, or 30 per cent, on the 23,813 for the same period of the previous year. In 1966 when the estimate was made, it was thought that 128 million people travelled outside of their own countries. They spend about nine thousand million rand. World tourism is increasing by about 12 per cent each year. We have seen that our own tourism has increased by 30 per cent. If we can succeed in increasing our tourism by 20 per cent, our revenue will double itself every four years. If we can succeed in doing this and in maintaining the position, we shall be receiving, within 15 years, as much from our tourists as we do from the Republic&#x2019;s gold production at present. Therefore I think that it would be a good, sound policy to promote that industry slowly. I emphasize the word slowly. One cannot attract great numbers of tourists overnight. More people will come to South Africa, but arrangements will have to be made to receive them here. We want to show them our beautiful country without subjecting them to any inconvenience or such-like difficulties. Tourism goes hand-in-hand with trade and to extend our trade we shall have to do certain things. We say frankly that we are doing a great deal and that that is almost enough, but we can still do more. That is what the Government is doing every day because no Government is ever satisfied with its own achievements; a Government always improves on previous achievements. We shall have to do more research in respect of certain things. In the U.S.A. 90 per cent of the industrial research and the development expenditure is concentrated in only five of the 19 sectors.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon member for Sunnyside has covered a very wide field. He has touched on so many subjects that I hope he will forgive me if I do not reply or give time to them all. He spoke about gold, the cost of living, the warnings about the operations on the Stock Exchange, education in South Africa, the rationalization of the motor industry, the radio and the Press, State employees and so on. He covered a very wide field but if he will forgive me I will just say a word or two about each of these subjects.</p>

<p>We had a dissertation this afternoon on the gold question from the hon. member for Florida. He gave us a very good lecture on the whole question of the price of gold. We have also had very valuable contributions from our side of the House. My view of the price of gold and our attitude in South Africa to the price of gold is a very simple one. I do not want to shoot the man at the piano, namely our Minister of Finance. Last year he gave us an assurance that he was in close touch with the gold producers in all that he was doing. If the hon. the Minister with his excellent financial staff and the gold producers of South Africa cannot work out a good strong plan, I am sure that I shall not be able to do so. I have read a great deal about the price of gold and I was interested in what both the hon. member for Florida and the hon. member for Sunnyside had to say but I am afraid that I cannot make any valuable contribution. The hon. the Minister cannot tell us everything. He might be able to discuss the whole matter confidentially with the hon. Leader of the Opposition but even then I am afraid that we cannot bruit it abroad what the hon. the Minister is doing. I therefore say that I am not prepared to shoot the man at the piano because he is playing as well as he can.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sunnyside also touched on the question of the cost of living. The hon. member for Florida said that we in this country had certain difficulties in this regard. I think we have fewer difficulties than other countries because we have such a large reservoir of cheap labour. That enables us to keep the cost of living down. I do not think we have difficulties. I think we have very real advantages. It should be easier for us to keep the cost of living down.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the question of the Stock Exchange. I am very glad to have as much information and as many tips as I can about the Stock Exchange. I sometimes feel that they are trying to teach grandmother to suck eggs. I know a little about the Stock Exchange. I understand that a Stock Exchange Control Amendment Bill will be introduced this Session. Hon. members will then have the opportunity to express their views about the Stock Exchange. The hon. member for Sunnyside also touched on the instruction given at our universities. I found his remarks in this regard most interesting but I cannot deal with that now. I do not know anything about the rationalization of the motor industry. There are expert people on this side of the House who know more about that. I was very interested in what the hon. member for Sunnyside said about the Press and the radio and the standard of their advertisements. I feel that the hon. member should start at home. How many Ministers of the Cabinet are directors of newspapers? He can raise this matter with them. The last time I looked into this matter I found that some Ministers were directors of Voortrekkerpers, Afrikaanse Pers and the verligte Press down here, namely Nasionale Pers. The Ministers of the Cabinet are directors of these newspapers and the hon. member should see them and tell them what he does not like about the newspapers. I have no complaints about any newspaper because I believe in the freedom of the Press. That was why I was so strongly opposed to the <span class="col_1027-1028" refersTo="page_0533"/>Government&#x2019;s interfering with our newspapers during the recess. Let us have freedom of the Press. If the hon. member for Sunnyside wants to deal with the Press he must start at home.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sunnyside also raised the question of our not helping the border industries. When the Tomlinson Report was published we told the Government quite frankly that without White capital in the reserves they would never be able to carry out the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission. We had to wait all these years for the light to dawn on those hon. members.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps they are now in the darkness before the dawn. I was very surprised to hear the hon. member for Florida talking about inflation. He seemed to suggest that inflation is inevitable and that we should relax and enjoy it. That was his attitude. I read to-day that someone in the Sakekamer asked the hon. the Minister not to be too strict in controlling inflation. He did not want too much control of inflation. They have got the bit in their teeth, as you can see on the Stock Exchange. Those people do not want any control because they are doing too well in the present circumstances.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the hon. the Minister. I think that my first duty is to congratulate him on the jubilee of the thrift movement. I think we all feel that a very fine job has been done not only by the hon. the Minister and his Department but also by those distinguished citizens who have served on our thrift committees. I think it has been a great year for them. My colleague the hon. member for Parktown has explained why to-day people are not interested in saving. The magic word has gone abroad not to save. The hon. the Minister told us to save for prosperity but that is not the word that is going around to-day. To-day the word is growth. If you say &#x201C;growth&#x201D; you can sell anything. Do not tell the investor that he will receive a good dividend; tell him that he will have growth and everyone will want what you offer. That is the bait. I want to give the hon. the Minister a suggestion to encourage people to invest under his ordinary thrift movement. I have set out my suggestion in a private motion. I suggested that the hon. the Minister should introduce premium bonds. Hon. members will know what premium bonds are. Premium bonds amount to this. A man invests his money; he does not draw interest but the interest is drawn for in prizes. When it was introduced in Britain the &#x201C;unco guid&#x201D; as they call them in Scotland, the very good people, objected, because they said what an hon. Deputy Minister said to me, namely it was &#x201C;dobbelary&#x201D;. He said it was gambling, premium bond is gambling. The poor little fellow who invests in premium bonds does it because he does not have a lot of money to invest, he wants to give it to the Minister and his thrift movement, and he wants some excitement out of it. The amount of interest does not interest him. He wants the excitement of looking in the newspaper at the end of the month to see whether he has come out in the draw and won R10 or R20 or R100, and I hope, perhaps, R5,000&#x2014;there should be one prize of R5,000. We talk about gambling, we the white people of South Africa who educate our children on the proceeds of gambling! Have hon. members never been to the race-course? Have they never examined the Expenditure and Revenue Accounts of our provinces, to see how much money is collected in taxation of gambling? The hon. the Minister came along, as the hon. member for Parktown pointed out, and said there would be a special 6 per cent loan free of income tax for the big man, who could invest up to R40,000 last year, which means R2,400 per year free of income tax. He was all right. Well, I am making a plea now for the small man, the fellow who puts his money into the Post Office and will also have a bit of premium bonds.</p>

<p>When I put forward the motion on premium bonds, the chairman of the British Thrift Committee happened to be visiting South Africa, that is Viscount Macintosh. He described their various investments but he said, &#x201C;Our best line is premium bonds, because the ordinary man, in addition to the Thrift Movement, in addition to his investments in the Post Office and so on, likes to have something in premium bonds. Perhaps bigger people do as well. However, that is my contribution on that.</p>

<p>I do not want to use the word which you will not allow here about what people think of gambling, so I want to say they are inconsistent when they object to premium bonds and allege it is a form of gambling. I may not use the word &#x201C;hypocrisy&#x201D;, but that is the word that was going through my mind!</p>

<p>This is the Part Appropriation debate and during the debate we each have to peg a claim and make suggestions to the Minister of what he should do in the budget. I am coming back to my old one which he is familiar with. One of his predecessors, the late Advocate Louw, when he was Minister of Finance, introduced the veterans&#x2019; pension for veterans of the Anglo-Boer war, the 1899-1902 war, and it was a great blessing for those people. There was to be no means test for those men; I think it was in 1955. Now I wish to make a plea for the veterans of the 1914-1918 war. Why should they not be treated in the same way? The period between the two wars, that is from 1902 to 1914, is 12 years. Much more time has elapsed since the then Minister of Finance gave the veterans a pension without a means test. I can appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty, but he could say the limit is 70 years; they will not qualify until they are over 70. They say &#x201C;old soldiers never die, they just fade away&#x201D;, but they are fading away very rapidly now. I put a question on the Order Paper and asked how many of the veterans of the Anglo-Boer war were still <span class="col_1029-1030" refersTo="page_0534"/>drawing a pension, and the reply was something round about 4,000. I find that in 12 months the number has decreased by 800. They do not have long to go now. Just add on the years, 67 years, to the age of the man at the end of the war. Therefore I make a plea that we should now give the same privilege to the veterans of the 1914-1918 war. Now I have pegged my claim and I am prepared to go on further.</p>

<p>The other thing I should like to mention in regard to pensions, seeing it is in our amendment, is this. We have just been considering the Provincial and the Territory Service Pension Bill and the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions assisted us by giving us the states of these provincial pension funds to-day. Well, most of them, almost all of them, are insolvent, and therefore I should like to repeat what I asked for here some time ago by way of a private motion and in debate. I want to ask the Minister to consider whether it is not possible to introduce a non-contributory scheme, instead of these schemes that require a big staff and, as we find, became insolvent, because, of course, of the erosion of money and because men are living longer than they used to.</p>

<p>I also want to talk about this share business. I remember what Job had to say, and the longer I sit here on the Opposition benches the more I feel like Job. Do you remember what Job said, Sir? He said &#x201C;Behold my desire is that mine adversary had written a book.&#x201D; If you can always get a man to write a book you might be able to contradict him. The Minister has warned us about the boom on the Stock Exchange, that people would burn their fingers. Now, we are all writing books in this House. Here is one of them, the Hansard of the debate last year. This is what the hon. the Minister had to say a year ago on the 14th February. I quote from Hansard (volume 22), column 498&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then, Mr. Speaker, I frankly find it difficult to see the justification for the level of certain share prices on the Stock Exchange. There seems to be an impression abroad that, now that we are winning the battle against inflation, the end of all restrictions is in sight and a new inflationary boom is just around the corner. There is no foundation for this belief. I repeat, there is no foundation for this belief.</block>

<p>Talk about &#x201C;just around the corner&#x201D;! It was not around the corner, it was at their feet. He said there was no foundation for this belief, whereas there was in fact a strong foundation for this belief. That was 12 months ago. The market index then was 100 and now it is 156. Let us just take the Minister&#x2019;s final words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those who base their actions on the expectation of a dramatic reversal of policy in the near future, will have only themselves to blame if they burn their fingers.</block>

<p>Well, they have not burnt their fingers, but if the Minister keeps on giving this warning every year, some day he will be right!</p>

<p>I want to know what the Minister is to do about this activity. The Americans say this state of economic development and financial investment is &#x201C;boom and bust&#x201D;. What should the Minister do? Well, I have a suggestion. I do not want to be a tipster, but this is my suggestion. The Minister controls big companies as well, and, instead or moralizing, he should get into the market. I told him last year, &#x201C;Get into the market&#x201D;. He has a great opportunity. I am now going to say how he can get into the market. The hon. member for Sunnyside gave me an opening. He asked us whether we agreed with the development of the Industrial Development Corporation, the I.D.C. Act 22 of 1940 and the amendment two years later contain section 3 (a) and section 3 (b). I do not want to talk about paragraph (a), that is what the hon. member for Sunnyside was talking about. That paragraph deals with investment by the Government. But the other kind of investment is the investment I should like to refer to. Section 3 (b) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) new industries and industrial undertakings; and</li>

<li>(ii) schemes for the expansion, better organization and modernization of and the more efficient carrying out of operations in existing industries and industrial undertakings &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, reference is made here to the assistance the I.D.C. was to give to young developing industries. We do not need to give them any assistance to-day. The industries are all developed. The hon. the Minister should pull out. Leave it to private enterprise. They are all developed now. They are forming amalgamations and there are take-over bids, so that those assets of the I.D.C. and the Minister are worth a lot of money. He will not need to tax people. I raised this last year. I gave the Minister the figures. Here is the Industrial Development Corporation, supposed to help these industries and then dispose of the shares, forming holding companies. They formed two holding companies last year, the Industrial Selections Company and the National Selections Company. I am very pleased to have a director here with me to confirm what I am saying. He is an ex-director, is that right?</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>He will confirm what I am saying. The opportunity now is to sell. One should go into the market as a seller. That is the idea. This is the time to do it. All the other companies are doing it. The hon. the Minister told us in his speech on Monday that foreign companies are coming here and <span class="col_1031-1032" refersTo="page_0535"/>investing in South Africa. All to the good. He also says that foreign companies are offering their shares to South Africans. I am glad they are. That was the movement in Australia many years ago. They were anxious to have an Australian holding. Well, Sir, that is being done.</p>

<p>Now I want to go on to the question of what is happening in the boom. Companies some years ago&#x2014;and still to-day&#x2014;have asked to be able to plough back profits. If a company has capital to the amount of R1 million, and they keep on ploughing back a million and put it into reserves, then the operating capital is not R1 million; it is R2 million. When they proudly proclaim that there is a dividend of 10 per cent, it is not 10 per cent on their holdings. It is five per cent. That is what has been happening. I am now quoting from a financial paper&#x2014;an Afrikaans paper, by the way&#x2014;which says that during the year the profit has decreased from 9.18 per cent to 6.39 per cent. The dividends decreased from 4.52 per cent to 3.45 per cent. The dividends are dropping. Of course they are still ploughing back. They are not declaring fair dividends. And the hon. the Minister of Finance is losing money. They do not declare dividends; they declare a part of their dividends. The profits are taxed, I quite agree. But if they declare dividends, then the dividends are taxed in the possession of the shareholder in South Africa, and the Minister is losing that. But there is one exception, namely the exception of the gold mining industry. In the present state of the market the gold mining industry is the orphan of the storm, the only one not being given a chance. I saw an announcement this morning in the paper about the West Driefontein Mine, about which the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Mines paid tribute to the magnificent engineering feat there. This is what the chairman said in a preliminary announcement&#x2014;I am not going to give the actual figures; I am going to give percentages&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of the profit this year, up to June, 55 per cent will go to the Government through the lease and Government taxation. Thirty five per cent will go to shareholders.</block>

<p>They are going to have reduced dividends, of course, because gold-mining taxation, as I have often described it in this country, is something unknown elsewhere in this world. It is something that should have been adjusted many years ago. May I ask the hon. the Minister if it is not possible to extend the rate of taxation to the old mines which has been offered to the new mines?</p>

<p>What?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The new mines have been given special concessions. When we asked that it should be extended to the whole industry, we were told that it could not be done; not by the hon. the Minister, but by his predecessor. I think that the industrial and commercial boom might have repercussions in this country, but they are all enjoying it. I want to know what the Minister is getting out of this boom in the way of taxation. How much is he getting? I do not agree with the hon. member for Sunnyside. I do not think one can operate a capital tax in South Africa. I know that people have considered the other possibility, undistributed dividend tax. I do not know about that either. I have not been able to go into the matter. I do not have the statistics for South Africa to be able to form a sound opinion about it. I should like to consider, undistributed profits&#x2019; taxation. Because the companies are saying: &#x201C;We have a profit, but we are not going to distribute it. We will distribute part of it, or very little of it.&#x201D; I am thinking of one company that has kept on doing that for years. Why did they do it? Because the big shareholders are rich men. The big shareholder says: &#x201C;If we declare these dividends, we have to pay income-tax on them.&#x201D; Therefore they do not declare them. The only exception where there is a straight declaration, is the gold mines; because the gold-mining companies do not plough back their profits. They have a certain allowance, of course, for capital development out of their profits. They must have that. Any company has it. But they cannot do what the industrial and commercial companies do. Therefore, I think, they deserve a little consideration from the Minister. But the practice with regard to these other companies, with rich people who direct the companies, is that they refuse to declare their dividends. They say: &#x201C;We shall pay our profits tax to the Government, but we are not going to declare dividends,&#x201D; because with their incomes and with the dividend income added, they have to pay again. I think the Minister is losing a lot of money that way. I know there was a cry some years ago that, if we are going to develop South African industry, we should give them the opportunity to plough back, because they could not get capital. Nobody can say that now. We have capital. Finally, I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question. We in South Africa some years ago made one exception in company taxation, namely the American South African Investment Trust Company. The Minister knows what I am referring to. This company did not have to have its profits taxed in the ordinary way. They would have certain privileges on the sale of gold and profits on that. They were given and gave a guarantee of five years. Now it is 11 years ago since that provision went through this House. I was shocked at the time it went through, but that is by the way. I was very much surprised. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, does that concession still hold good? I do not think that we should make that concession. I do not think there is any justification whatsoever for making an exception of any company. Why did we do it then? Because we said we could not get capital, and that if we could get American capital we should get it on these conditions. <span class="col_1033-1034" refersTo="page_0536"/>The chief condition is that no South African can be a shareholder. We give this concesssion to a company on the condition that it does not have a South African shareholder.</p>

<p>That is a surprising position. I think the hon. the Minister has an opportunity there to reconsider the extension of these facilities. I think now is the time when South Africans are prepared to buy shares in these companies. One cannot stop them from buying shares, as a matter of fact. Everybody is going public, because they are in that mood. I think it is an excellent opportunity for the hon. the Minister to say: &#x201C;We are making no exceptions. You will all be treated in the same way.&#x201D; My special plea is that gold-mining taxation should be revised as soon as possible.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Kensington touched on quite a few subjects, but I want to agree with him as regards one of his statements, i.e. when he said: &#x201C;Do not shoot the man at the piano,&#x201D; to use his own words. I think he was quite right as far as this is concerned. I say: &#x201C;Praise him!&#x201D; The hon. member for Kensington also said that he did not believe in the word &#x201C;grow&#x201D;. He still knew the word &#x201C;save&#x201D;. Ostensibly the word &#x201C;save&#x201D; has now become &#x201C;grow&#x201D;. I now want to tell the hon. member, seeing that he is such an experienced politician and strongly believes in the word &#x201C;save&#x201D;, that it seems to me that he can no longer learn about &#x201C;growth&#x201D; in the United Party, and that he should therefore try to teach it to save and to keep what it has, otherwise it may lose even more. The hon. member made a very interesting speech on shares and asked the Government to enter the market. I do not want to elaborate on this and I shall leave it to the hon. the Minister to reply to this request.</p>

<p>This amendment of the Opposition contains two motivations. They asked for this debate to be held over for two days. It seems to me had they asked for three days we would possibly have had three reasons. The two reasons are generally popular ones; the one concerns the pensioner and the other the farming industry. These are not financial reasons, but a roundabout way of launching an attack. These are reasons which may cover a wide field, and this reminds me of the anecdote of the Hollander who fired a shot with his eyes closed from behind a rock during the Boer War and said, &#x201C;Mog het troffe&#x201D; (&#x201C;May it strike home&#x201D;). Here it is the same case. The Opposition took two days to think up these two simple reasons for opposing this Appropriation Bill. I do not want to blame them for this, because I am not a nasty fellow and therefore I shall never call anybody stupid.</p>

<p>I want to say that it is because of the brilliant management of the hon. the Minister of Finance that the Opposition has found it so difficult to find proper financial reasons for opposing this Appropriation legislation. The two main United Party speakers on financial matters spent half their time on theorizing about the dollar and gold. The rest of their speeches they devoted to the share market. The hon. member for Pinetown did not speak about cinema tickets or farming. I believe that to them the gold question was a godsend from Heaven, because by discussing that it was not necessary for them to cross swords with the Minister about the really fundamental financial situation in this country. They spoke a great deal about the stock exchange, and particularly the hon. member for Pinetown asked the Minister to do something at this stage. I want to agree with the hon. member for Florida that it is very clear indeed that South Africa is a free capitalistic country. The hon. the Minister can do no more than he is doing, i.e. to issue warnings. Surely he cannot tell the people what to do with their money. Surely he cannot protect a person against his own greed and against his own ignorance. If there are people who want to run the risk of landing themselves in debt by speculating on the stock exchange, and those shares subsequently went down, they will have to suffer the consequences. The hon. the Minister cannot be blamed for that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia praised the Minister here for keeping South Africa stable on the European market. But then he suddenly said that that was United Party policy. But the Minister has always been doing this. It has always been the policy of this Government to keep South Africa stable on the European monetary market. The hon. member for Constantia made a suprising admission here. He said the time of stability had passed. Now all of a sudden there was inflation and the cost of living was increasing. It is true that he has not participated in the debates of this House for some time, but I did not know that he was so out of touch with everything that was happening. Has it slipped the memory of the hon. member what a fuss the hon. member for Pinetown and others were making during the last two years when they maintained that there was no stability in this country? Has it slipped his memory how they attacked us about the increasing cost of living? Now the hon. member admits, however, that the past two years have been a time of stability. The hon. member for Constantia also spoke about the agricultural industry and the drought.</p>

<p>It is clear, however, that he is also out of touch with what is happening in that field. I come from an area which has been experiencing a drought for seven years, but where there fortunately is grass this year. Does the hon. member realize how many millions of rands this Government has pumped into the agricultural industry? Does he realize what this <span class="col_1035-1036" refersTo="page_0537"/>Government has always been doing for the farmers and does he realize what has been happening in those drought-stricken areas? Now the drought has hit the largest part of the country and now all of a sudden the hon. members become concerned about the drought and the farmers. After all, this is a popular thing to do at present. They may hit home somewhere and gain a vote somewhere. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that this Government, without this amendment, will see to the interests of the farmers.</p>

<p>The hon. members also spoke about inflation and complained about the existing inflation. In the same breath, however, they advanced pleas for tax relief. Surely such tax relief would in its turn be inflationary. Now what is it they want? Are they never satisfied? The report given here in this House by the hon. the Minister on Monday was reassuring and very promising for the future. I believe that all other Ministers of Finance, without exception, are envious of him in his task. I should specially like to congratulate him on the very controlled and responsible, but also resolute, manner in which he has handled the whole question of the marketing of gold during the recess and up to now. South Africa is only a very small country, but it is nevertheless intimately concerned with the monetary storms and disturbances which occur in the international field. Although we do not sit round the conference tables with those large monetary countries, cognizance must definitely be taken of us because of the fact that we produce gold in such large quantities. In the days of the old gold standard monetary discipline was a matter of course in the domestic economy, but after countries had gone off the old commodity monetary systems and the economic systems of the world had become totally unbalanced, a much more sophisticated monetary system developed. In subsequent years it moved virtually to a dollar standard, which was also partially supported by gold. However, a revolution against and opposition to the domination of the dollar started developing slowly but surely. This was unavoidably heading for a clash between the dollar, which simply is a political monetary unit, on the one side, and gold, which is a neutral monetary commodity, on the other side.</p>

<p>Instead of co-operation between these two monetary factors, there was a clash and they moved further away from each other. South Africa was caught and dragged into this clash as if into a whirlpool, irrespective of her wishes. The conduct of this Government, and in particular that of the hon. the Minister, in this situation, was the very thing that caused the prestige of South Africa to reach unparalleled heights in the international monetary world recently. To-day it is not possible yet to measure the full extent of the respect South Africa has commanded. I believe that the future holds great possibilities because of the attitude adopted by the Government to reunite the dollar and gold as partners in the international monetary system. This can only be done by means of a revaluation of the dollar as against gold, in other words a higher gold price. The co-operation of these two is essential if international monetary arrangements and relations are to remain stable. I say our international prestige has been heightened because of the fact that the Government has not adopted the attitude of deriving petty political or financial benefit or any other form of cheap exploitation from the situation, and because of the strong principal attitude it has adopted on the basis of the four principles as explained here in this House by the hon. the Minister. On these a marketing agreement can be built which can lead to monetary relations and arrangements which will be to the advantage of the entire Western civilization and mankind. Confidence in the rand, our own monetary unit, has been strengthened to such an extent that in future the rand will become a more and more sought-after unit of foreign exchange. I am referring to the demand for the rand as well as to the flow of foreign capital to South Africa. Although part of that may be flight capital, I am sure that genuine investment capital will amount to a considerable sum. We all want to express the hope that the hon. the Minister will be successful in his negotiations regarding the marketing of gold. I believe the entire Southern Africa will rejoice with him if he can succeed in negotiating such an agreement.</p>

<p>The Sound position of our foreign exchange and gold reserves is due not only to the fact that we produce 75 per cent of the world&#x2019;s gold, but also basically to the fact that our domestic economy has remained sound to the core. It is a fact that a real rate of growth of approximately 6 per cent has been maintained, in spite of the fact that anti-inflationary measures have decreased the demand for goods and services. To me it is surprising that this high rate of growth has been maintained in the face of that, and to me this is a wonderful achievement. The other exceptional achievement is that inflation has been controlled and combatted so effectively by monetary and fiscal measures over the past few years that there has never been any sign of inflation possibly getting out of hand or running wild. On the other hand, these measures have been applied in such a way that there has not been any sign of serious recession, unemployment, etc., either. This fact is a fine testimonial to the planning of the Government and really is a feather in the cap of officials responsible for drawing up the national accounts. This shows that their details are really accurate and that their projections for determining the rate of growth and measuring the gross national product have a very scientific and realistic basis. This shows that the measures which were taken were timeous and not as the Opposition said in the past, in the time of stability to which the hon. member for Constantia referred, when they always maintained that those measures were taken too soon or too late. Their big complaint is that there is erosion of the rand, that there is a measure of inflation, but to the <span class="col_1037-1038" refersTo="page_0538"/>informed, this complaint is equally as unfounded as an accusation from them would be that this Government was responsible for the drought. Inflation is, as has often been repeated here in this House, one of the problems of the modern, sophisticated, unplanned, economic systems, i.e. systems outside the communistic bloc. Therefore inflation is a built-in factor in our economy. To-day we have to live with that as every other capitalistic country in the world has to do. This is the dilemma with which we have to live and this is the dilemma which the hon. member for Parktown raised here. This is the problem, but how does one solve the problem? No living economist has yet found the answer to this. The yardstick here is how successfully the rate of inflation is being controlled and whether it is being kept within safe limits. The hon. the Minister placed his finger on the pulse of the current economic problems and pointed out the excess liquidity which was to be found in this country at present. In the past these problems have been combatted and solved, and I believe and trust that timeous measures will ensure that this will happen again. Over-employment in the field of labour&#x2014;I mean skilled labour&#x2014;always is a difficult problem, because a large number of other factors have to be brought in to prevent wage inflation. The Opposition&#x2019;s only reply to this always is to bring in non-white labour. That is economic integration and that is the cardinal difference between this and that side of the House. [Interjections.] There is a big difference between economic co-operation and economic integration. If hon. members still do not know this I shall ask the hon. member for Florida to give them a lecture on this one of these days and to point out what the difference is. This is the cardinal difference.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown asked what would have happened had we done this or that, but had we done that, i.e. labour integration, years ago, we would not have been sitting here as we are to-day and the United Party would not have been living on the fruits and prosperity of the National Party Government as it is doing at present.</p>

<p>The major economic problems with which the Government has to cope therefore, are problems of prosperity and problems of that nature are always much more pleasant to deal with than problems of a recession or of a depression. In these modern times and in this economy in which we are living, we unfortunately have to fall back on measures of control such as credit control, import control, rate of interest control, exchange control, building control, etc., in order to control and solve these problems. Every measure of control chafes someone somewhere when it comes into conflict with his personal wishes or desires. But we shall have to learn to live with this too, as we have learned to live with the Opposition. We shall have to learn to live with that because of its greater importance to the country as a whole. Therefore I am pleased that the Government has never failed or hesitated to take any measure of control when it has been necessary to do so, no matter how unpopular, because what has carried most weight was what would be in the interests of our economic stability in the long run. We can look back at the Budgets of the past, one after the other, they all fit into the same pattern, i.e. that of long-term economic prosperity and stability, and not that of transient political advantage. For that reason it is possible for the hon. the Minister to appear before the nation with such a favourable report, this Part Appropriation Bill, shortly before the Budget. I can understand why the Opposition asked for the debate to be postponed for two days. They did not know where to attack this economic armour of the Government, and if this is the way things are with them already, I believe they are trembling with fear when they think of the Budget which is still to come. I want to tell them that when that time arrives, they will have to ask for the debate to be postponed and to be adjourned, possibly for an indefinite period. I believe that an equally exceptional, effective, far-reaching and good Budget as that of last year is awaiting us. All of us naturally have many expectations and conjectures as regards the possible new taxes the Minister may levy and measures he may impose, measures motivated by the report of the commission of inquiry which he has probably received.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, of all the discourteous speeches I have listened to. I think that of the hon. member who has just sat down, takes first prize. Here is an occasion when we are met together in a very pleasant atmosphere, dealing with a very pleasant Minister, to discuss the serious business of finance in the Republic, and the whole trend of the speech of the hon. member for Pietersburg was along the lines that it took the Opposition two days to think up some replies.</p>

<p>The actual financial aspects of the debate have been covered very effectively by four speakers preceding me, including the most erudite speech of the hon. member for Kensington. I do not propose going into details on that particular score, except to say, that the hon. the Minister, in speaking to us on Monday, told us, as was said before, very, very little. One must wonder whether what was accomplished, according to what he said, could not have been done by correspondence. Those of us who look deeply into these matters realize that the Minister is faced with some difficulties. We appreciate the difficulties, we sympathize with him, and if we can help we will do so. But I put it to you. Sir, that these hon. members opposite, who have been so quick with their motion of thanks, should realize that the hon. the Minister told us only the good news. There must be other news. So important a person as himself, would not have gone so far, so quickly, if there were not something far deeper to be considered and discussed. I believe that he will one day tell us that he has been successful, and I earnestly hope that that will be so. I think, however, <span class="col_1039-1040" refersTo="page_0539"/>that we should be sparing in our remarks in dealing with this particular matter, because gold is the lifeblood of our economy, and has been, ever since it was discovered in the Transvaal. It has been the making of the economy of the Republic as it stands to-day. Do not let us lose sight of these few simple facts. [Interjection.] My hon. friend reminds me that I must not forget diamonds. Of course you will appreciate, Sir, that from my point of view diamonds are the foundation on which the entire country was built, even Johannesburg, but one does not wish to lay claim to these things too often, because they are so obvious, and they are historical facts.</p>

<p>I should like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to one very serious matter affecting the building societies. The building societies, as is well known, have been in difficulties for some time in getting adequate funds, and I wonder whether the time has not come, when the restrictions upon the type of investments which they may accept should not be reviewed. I would go further and say I think he should have a word with the Minister of Community Development, and look into the terms and conditions of the 90 per cent loans, which are made by the Department of Community Development to the building societies. I think the conditions controlling such loans are a little out of date, and I think a review would help in no small degree, to get homes built, which is the earnest desire of everybody in the country.</p>

<p>The persons for whom I wish to plead, and to whom I would like to direct the Minister&#x2019;s attention, are those who are in the pensionable class and who receive very little and who have not had their pensions adjusted for many years. I refer to the persons who fall within the scope of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act and who receive pensions under that Act. Sir, these are the persons who have been overlooked, and I do hope the hon. the Minister will look into this matter, and make provision in his Budget for some suitable increase to be given to these people as soon as it is possible to do so. I go further, Sir, and plead for a review of the old-age and disability pensions paid to Bantu. I have in front of me a schedule, which was published in the Gazette of the 4th October, 1968, and this is what I find in the annexure: It will astonish you to know, Sir, that a Bantu who earns R42 gets no old-age pension, whereas if he earns nothing he gets R51. There is an anomaly that needs looking into rightaway. If a Bantu earns R42 and over he gets nil; if he earns nil up to R21 he gets R51. I put it to you, Sir, that these people are faced with the same problem of inflation, that faces you and me. They have to pay the same prices for whatever they want, as you and I have to do. Their pension works out at 14 cents per day. I say in all earnestness and seriousness, that this is not a proposition so far as these people are concerned, particularly when it is borne in mind, that the new policy of the Minister of Bantu Administration is to move all the aged out of the local authority areas, and to get them into the homelands or the Bantustans. When they are in an urban village or township, their neighbours and friends and relatives assist them. When these people are moved, as they are being moved because instructions have gone out to the local authorities that they must &#x201C;see to it&#x201D; that these people are moved to the homelands, you will realize what hardships fall upon them. I do ask the hon. the Minister, whether he will &#x201C;see to it&#x201D;, that they get a pension which is more in keeping with their needs and their wants. Sir, when I hear all this talk of inflation and money being made out of stocks and shares, and when I listen to the Minister using his favourite expression, namely, that he wishes to syphon off all the surplus cash, he puts me in mind of his predecessor, who used to style himself year after year either as a gardener or as a fisherman &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; or as a chef. I think the hon. the Minister could really class himself as a plumber, because he wants to syphon off the surplus funds. I make this appeal to him as a plumber knowing his trade: Do not syphon off from the top of the tank; do a proper job: drain it off from the bottom, by proper drain cocks, and drain it into the pockets of the poor people down at the bottom. That is the correct way. I believe that taxation, of which we have heard a little here this afternoon, is not the answer to this matter at all.</p>

<p>We have had the astonishing statement made by the hon. gentleman who has now left the Chamber, that the United Party Opposition wants to have integration with the non-Whites. You know, Sir, if it were not so serious, such a statement would be laughable, because they, the non-Whites, are with us already: they are running the show. Where does all this prosperity come from? Who are the people who are carrying the heat and burden of the day? None other than our black countrymen. This sort of statement, that economic co-operation is a very different thing from economic integration, is playing with words, because, from my experience of this country I would say that every factory that we have, and every mine that we have, would stand still to-morrow, if there was no black labour. There is nobody who thinks that it is a feasible proposition to talk about taking these people out of the urban areas. They are here, and they have been here for a long time. What we say is this: Make use of them; train them; have the proper safeguards; pay them proper wages and then this country would be able to emulate the tremendous advances made in the United States of America during the last century, and in the early part of this century. We have this tremendous asset, and if the hon. the Minister would consider the simple expedient of easing up on income-tax on the wage packet, we would begin to see a little more <span class="col_1041-1042" refersTo="page_0540"/>productivity. We have seen it in Britain, Sir, where the workman who received high wages, suddenly realized that he was working for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the same thing is happening in this country. Why should people exert themselves unduly? They are being well paid. Those of us who work with weekly pay packets, know that the P.A.Y.E. deductions represent rather a large proportion of a man&#x2019;s earnings. He may have a figure on his pay packet of R50 or R60 per week, but after you have taken off his trade union deductions and his P.A.Y.E. his pay packet does not look so good. I think this is the line along which the hon. the Minister should direct his attention. I agree with the hon. member for Parktown that the Minister has competent staff, and that that is the line and the direction, which they should pursue and investigate. I think the time is long overdue to have some reduction in taxation. The practice of estimating revenue low and expenditure high and then finding that the revenue exceeds the estimates by a large figure, and that the expenditure was over-estimated, with the result that there is a big surplus, is an expedient. It is an expedient which was resorted to in the days when the Government could not raise money outside the country. I think those days are over. I think the time has come when we should have some accurate budgetting, a budget which more or less balances at the end of the year. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will do just that; I hope that he will seriously consider bringing taxes down, so that those who want to work, can get some reward for their labour.</p>

<p>The final point I want to discuss, is not such a happy one. This deals with the report of the Auditor-General on Public Accounts. This was referred to in passing during the last session of Parliament. I refer to the Bantu Trust Account. I know that speakers are going to jump up and tell me that explanations have been offered, and that these matters have been put in true perspective. I want to say, quite frankly, that I do not accept any explanation for the gross inefficiency and incompetence shown in the administration of the funds given to the Bantu Trust to handle. The Auditor-General&#x2019;s report is the most astounding chronicle of slackness, and I can only say, that if the results achieved in any business of that size, were as described by the Auditor-General, the man in charge would be fired; he would get the bullet.</p>

<p>I would like to say that the hon. the Minister of Finance should have a very careful look at the way in which public funds are being handled under the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Sir, I have made careful inquiries into this matter. There are some people who want to gloss over the report, but do you know, Sir, that building material, motor trucks, tractors, and graders have been lying about in these Bantu townships for up to three years and in some cases up to 20 months, and, when the Auditor-General has complained, and asked for an explanation, it has taken nine months to get a reply. What sort of business is this? How can you operate this way? How do you know that our taxes are being spent in such a way that every cent counts? Here we have the sad story in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report. Then, of course, as far as the administrative side is concerned, he is scathing. He says what we have all said, that they are inept. The man who should take the responsibility is the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>The point is, that this is not what it is costing. If they spent the money it would be a fair cost, but this is not spending money, this is wasting money. I have a few headings here: Building material unused for up to 3&#x00BD; years, lying about in the veld; heavy equipment, road graders, tractors, trucks, idle or only partially used for up to two years; stores in the open and so badly rusted and deteriorated, as to be of no further use; Houses: hundreds unoccupied for up to 20 months. We accused the hon. the Minister last week of a lack of planning. How do you plan houses, when there is nobody to occupy them? Let me tell you, Sir, that many of these houses are unsuitable. They are not suitable to the climate; they are constructed of the wrong material and, what is more, in the middle of the construction of the project plans are being altered and items changed, and the whole thing has cost the State an enormous amount of money.</p>

<p>Well, we are the State. Then I come to one which tickles me pink because a fortnight ago we heard so much about the services that were not available at a certain place: No charges for service and water were levied in many townships because there was no adequate water supply. In other words, they had decided to charge the people for water but when they turn on the tap nothing happens. Sir, here is another reason given by the Auditor-General: A change of planning in the course of the erection of the houses. Sir, I have looked at the townships and I say quite frankly to the hon. the Minister that he should look into this Department with his financial staff, and that he should look into it with his eyes open. I am not going to say to him that he must forget the ideologies and so on; we are dealing with hard cash. I believe that these townships which are being built by the Department of Bantu Administration are a mess and, what is more, that no local authority would ever have been permitted to build some of the houses which have been built by the Department.</p>

It consisted of one room, about as big as three desks stuck together here, for him and his family. You can see daylight through the wooden slats and he told me that when the wind blows the dust and sand just go straight through and that the only time that the place is dry is one hour after the rain starts, when the wood swells. In a large township nearly 700 houses are standing vacant. They are going to do something about the water supply. There are no hospital facilities at all on the spot. This township was built so that people could be chased 90 miles away from the urban area where it was planned to build a hospital. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration said no, they were going to build a hospital 90 miles away for 46,000 people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I tried to follow the gist of all the details the hon. member for Karoo mentioned in regard to tractors, building material and goodness knows what else, but there was only one thing I could understand. That was his concept of economic integration. It is clear to me that the concept he has of it is quite wrong. By economic integration we do not mean that Coloured persons will work together with Whites, but what is meant by that is that, while they are working together, no differentiation will be made between them. Economic integration is when no differentiation is made between Whites and non-Whites in the economy, and a Native, for example, can become the manager of a business and be in charge of Whites. It is integration when a Native can be a manager in the same way as a white person can be a manager. It is a very simple thing to understand. That hon. members of the Opposition are not yet able to understand it is beyond comprehension.</p>

<p>There is one thing which neither we nor the Opposition can get away from. It is that the Government has achieved brilliant things in the economic sphere, as in other spheres and that our Minister of Finance deserves the tribute of this House and of the country for what he has done to date. In the short while he has been Minister of Finance he has already accomplished a monumental task.</p>

<p>I now want to proceed to something else. I am surprised that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, or other members of the Opposition, have not yet come forward with the attack they promised they would make on the hon. member for Umlazi. I now want to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for Umlazi with his brave deed in walking across from that insignificant party to the National Party, which is the embodiment of the national movement in South Africa, for having had the courage to do so. He did not do the wrong thing. He did not act in an unprincipled or opportunistic way, but did so on the grounds of two principles, which he stated quite clearly. The first principle on the grounds of which he walked across to the National Party is the principle of separate development; the principle of differentiation between White and non-White in South Africa. This is a scientific principle which he adheres to, because there are very deep-rooted differences between White, Black and Coloured. I do not want to go into those details. The fact that we cannot make one nation of White, Black and Coloured in South Africa is something we cannot get away from. That is precisely what the Opposition wants to do, in spite of their race federation.</p>

<p>The Opposition wants to draw a distinction in the nation <i>(volk),</i> in the <i>demos</i> of democracy. They acknowledge the scientific basis of the principle of distinction and apartheid. They acknowledge it in the nation, because there they want a race federation. There they want to separate them. In the government of the democracy, however, they want to integrate it. They are therefore contradicting themselves. What it amounts to therefore is that for them the nation of South Africa will nevertheless still remain all the colours in the country. For them it does not amount to whether the nation is differentiated or not. It remains the nation of the federal state which they want, a race federation, a State with a nation which consists of all the colours amongst which a distinction is in fact made, but they are nevertheless the nation. That is the unscientific policy of the Opposition. They have never realized in the past, and they do not yet realize to-day, that a nation cannot be a mere conglomeration of individuals or even of groups, but that a nation is based on a national sentiment, and that a nation must have a feeling of solidarity. To them sentiment, too, has always been an evil.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that the hon. member has asked this question. It is in fact a matter I now want to discuss. English-speaking persons have always been welcome in the National Party. I now want to give you the reason for that. A nation does not necessarily consist of one language group, and a characteristic of the nation of South Africa is that it has a love for this country as its only mother country. In the second place the nation of South Africa has always aspired, and is still aspiring to maintain its own independent state. It is the essential characteristic of a nation anywhere in the world that it has a feeling of solidarity, that it aspires to having its own state, and when it has that state, aspires to maintain it. It is of the utmost importance that we have a complete understanding of this matter, because it is on the difference in national concept that the political groupings in our history took place and are still taking place to-day. Who are the nation, of whom does the nation consist? On that point the political grouping in South Africa takes place. The National Party standpoint has always been that the nation consists of all the Whites in South Africa who accept this country as their only mother country. Now, it was the case from the beginning that the people who felt like this, the people who felt that South Africa was their only mother country and who at the same time aspired to the realization of their own state were for the most part the Afrikaans-speaking people. Almost all of them were Afrikaans-speaking. As far back as the days after the Second Anglo-Boer War, General Hertzog made this very clear when he used the following words in 1905 at Wepener&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Anyone who is willing to throw in his lot with the Dutch-speaking element, and gives pride of place to South African interests, should find a place among us.</block>

<p>I take it, and I am convinced, that that is what the hon. member for Umlazi is doing. He is throwing in his lot with the Afrikaans-speaking people of South Africa, not because they are Afrikaans-speaking, but because they are the people who, together with a number of other English-speaking people, regard this country as their only mother country, and because they want to build a white nation here. [Interjections.] I am still answering the question. Language is in fact important; it is one of the ties which bind a member of a nation to the nucleus of that nation; it is one of the most important ties. The language defines the identity of a nation where there is a cosmopolitan society. But language is not the only tie. Although it is a very important tie, there are other ties as well. However, it is not necessary that all the ties should be present in order to bind a person to the nation. It can in fact be the language tie, but it can also be the economic tie. It can also be the aesthetic tie because there may, for that person, not be a more beautiful country than South Africa. Perhaps a person does not have the language tie, but does have the other ties. There is also the political ties which binds him to the nucleus of the nation, and the nucleus of the nation is national Afrikanerdom. What I have mentioned now is not applicable only to South Africa, but is the essence of all nations in the world. If one asks what a nation is, then one must not ask why one nation differs from another. In the same way, if one asks what a person is, then one does not ask why one person differs from another. If you ask what a person is, then you are in fact asking why all the people are the same. Why do they differ, for example, from animals. If one asks what is a nation, then one asks why all nations are the same. And then it is not because they speak the Afrikaans language. One asks what it is that all nations have which other social groups do not have, and then the reply is this. Among all nations in the world there is a feeling of solidarity, with a desire for political independence. That is the fundamental characteristic of all nations, and on these grounds English-speaking people can also be part of, and they are in fact part of, the nation of South Africa if they have this desire in them, that feeling of solidarity with the rest of the nation of South Africa, and in addition most of them accept the Republic as well. There are in any case many of them with urge in them to maintain the independent state. I think I have now replied to the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

<p>I have stated that a nation has a national sentiment. That sentiment is nurtured by the past. We must not be afraid now of hurting the feelings of an English-speaking person when we mention the past history of our nation, because if he is a true South African he will not feel hurt. If you yourself are proud of the past history of your people, then you feel yourself much more at liberty to stretch out your hand to an English-speaking person, and he feels much more at liberty to grasp your hand&#x2014;when you yourself are not ashamed of your own past. And, Sir, we are proud of the past history of the people of South Africa, we are proud of the past history of our people who have gone through troublous times, who have achieved great victories, who have come up from under as a small nation and have grown into a strong South African nation, which does not consist of anything under the sun, but which consists of those people with their own state, because that is a nation. A nation is a people with a state of their own, and because a nation consists of a people with a state of their own, that is why the Coloured people in South Africa, the Coloureds as well as the Bantu, who are not part of those people, are not part of the nation either. Let us have a good understanding of this.</p>

Our policy is very clear, and it is for that reason that the hon. member for Umlazi is more prepared to support us than to support the United Party, which has no or a very obscure policy. It is of the utmost importance that we should have a clear national concept in South Africa, because there will then be a great deal less misunderstanding, and that clear national concept is the following. We have a solidarity. It does not matter whether it is Afrikaans or English speaking, but we have solidarity in our common patriotism, and in our aspiration to develop our nation, that is i.e. to develop the nation as far as the national aspect is concerned, particularly by assimilating more English-speaking people into the nation. They can feel very fortunate that they are part of the nation; we and they can both feel proud of this.</p>

I just want to say that by mixing children in one school, we will not make one nation of them if they are taught other things by their parents outside the school, things such as being told not to be one nation together with the rest of us. All the leaders in the national movement have always adopted the standpoint that the nation of South Africa included the English-speaking people as well, provided that they entertained this sentiment towards South Africa. We may as well begin with Onze Jan Hofmeyr, whose statue is standing outside here. He adopted that standpoint a long time ago. Let us begin with General Hertzog in this century.</p>

<p>What did we do to him? We regarded him as a hero, and we still regard him as a hero of nationalism in South Africa. But the question is, what did you do to him? You stabbed him in the back: that is what you did. I do not really want to elaborate on that. I want to say what I want to say, and that is that General Hertzog adopted that standpoint, and he was the founder of the National Party. After him Dr. Malan adopted the same standpoint. [Interjections.] General Hertzog called it the two stream policy, the two streams of the two cultural groups. In addition there is the English cultural group, the English language group, but with a South African national spirit, and General Hertzog welcomed that sector of the English-speaking people as part of the nation. Dr. Malan did the same. Let me quote what he said in this regard (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Afrikaans- and English-speaking Afrikaners must be closer to one another than any other nation; this is the road of the broad but genuine and sound South African nationalism.</block>

<p>Those are the words of Dr. Malan. It is very interesting to note how he drew a comparison with the Americans when he said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The inhabitants of America, even though they stem from a great variety of countries and races, are consolidated to form the powerful American nation. They became Americans, and nothing else, and this is what the inhabitants of South Africa must and will also do, taking into consideration their own particular circumstances. For the most part they are already, and are to an ever-increasing extent becoming, Afrikaners.</block>

I think we may as well talk about English-speaking Afrikaners, as our leaders in the past also did. I regard the hon. member for Umlazi as an English-speaking Afrikaner, and I welcome him as an English-speaking Afrikaner. How he is going to pronounce this word in English is his affair. We cannot call each other &#x201C;Africans&#x201D; because the Blacks have already claimed that name for themselves. In the time of Lord Charles Somerset, Greig was one of the people who stood for the freedom of the Press when Lord Charles Somerset wanted to suppress the Press. Then Greig, an English speaking journalist, wrote: We stand by South Africa because we are &#x201C;Africans&#x201D;. He said: We are &#x201C;Africans&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Yes, &#x201C;White Africans&#x201D;. He did not say that these people were &#x201C;White Africans&#x201D;. He simply called them &#x201C;Africans&#x201D;. In the time of Willem Adriaan van der <span class="col_1049-1050" refersTo="page_0546"/>Stel somebody said the same thing when that Governor also wanted to suppress the people here. That person was Hendrik Bibault. When the magistrate at Stellenbosch wanted to give him a thrashing, and he refused to run away, the magistrate asked him why he did not run away. Then this young man replied: &#x201C;I will not run away, because I am an Afrikaner.&#x201D; This happened at the beginning of the 18th century. It is remarkable that when one is faced by a threat one feels that one is an Afrikaner. Greig called our people &#x201C;Africans&#x201D;, but I want to suggest that we simply add a few letters. The letters are ERS or DERS so that the word becomes &#x201C;Africanders&#x201D;. In the past Afrikaners were in fact called this in English. I am thinking for example of a book by Molteno, i.e. &#x201C;The Dominion of Africanderdom&#x201D;. This is the Africanderdom which governs South Africa, and it is worthwhile being a member of this Africanderdom which is governing South Africa. This is the Africanderdom which has brought South Africa, humanly speaking, to where it is to-day. This is the Africanderdom which cherished the ideal of independent nationhood in South Africa. This is the Africanderdom which cherrished the ideal and the principle of a white nation in South Africa. It is worthwhile being an Africander.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down and the hon. member on that side of the House who spoke before him both mentioned that economic co-operation and economic integration were not the same thing. I should like to ask them where interdependence stops and where integration commences. As we are discussing financial matters here this afternoon, I should like at the outset to support the hon. member for Kensington in pleading for our veterans of the First World War. It is really time that the means test was no longer applicable to them. I should like to speak about the ordinary pensioner. The age still remains a problem, but this should not be the case. These people have served their country in their respective fields and we have a duty towards them and we must look after them. The previous hon. Minister was not too easy in assisting with funds for their accommodation requirements. It was his attitude that the wealthy persons should assist more in this direction. But there are many areas in South Africa which do not have people who have that type of money, but they nevertheless have old age pensioners. I believe, that the South African National Council for the Care of the Aged has asked that the subsidies on buildings should be increased. I understand that the organization named Tafta in Durban in asking for tenders to erect buildings for the aged, found that it costs no less than R2,000 at the present time for each bed on account of the terrific increase in building costs. This also applies to the grant of R90 to equip each bed, which is to-day entirely inadequate. It is time the hon. the Minister pleads with the Minister of Finance for higher subsidies and loans for the care of the aged. This would be an incentive for welfare oganizations to provide more accommodation. Industry creates a new way of life. There are smaller families, smaller houses and the high cost of living decreases the income platform, which in turn prevents young couples from looking after older relatives. To-day 70 per cent of the aged live alone, and very often in appalling circumstances. Less than 25 per cent of the aged live with relatives and only five per cent live in institutions. In socialistic countries the State accepts full responsibility for the aged. Is it not time that we also give the matter serious consideration? A substantial rise in pensions could avoid pensioners living in accommodation provided for the aged, making room for the more needy. The old age pensions which are paid to the various race groups, I say race groups, are totally inadequate, especially in view of the lower purchasing power of the rand. Many countries in the Western world set aside a percentage of all new homes in townships for the aged. Planning of services for the aged should automatically form part of the country&#x2019;s planning. In new townships, where the Government and provincial departments claim their endowment requirements, they should also claim suitable sites for old aged homes. Persons due for retirement should be retained in employment as long as possible. Not only are they then usefully employed, but do not become a burden on others. For them it contains the prospect of still belonging to society. In Pietermaritzburg the day centre, where pensioners meet socially, is proving a great success. Here they meet <i>in</i> the centre of the city, near the bus termini, near the bank, post office and shopping centre. They have a lunch costing approximately 15 cents and then they go home. It makes them feel that they still belong to society. The &#x201C;meals on wheels&#x201D; scheme which is also run by the same association, is an unqualified success, providing those who are no longer mobile with a daily hot meal. Here, I wish to compliment the Secretary for Social Welfare and Pensions for visiting Pietermaritzburg during the last recess, and seeing for himself what actually is taking place in Pietermaritzburg. I think, I can quite easily say on authority, that Pietermaritzburg leads in this field and others follow. I must convey our thanks to him for doing this. I sincerely hope that, as a result of his visit, he will ask the hon. the Minister for more funds for this service and that he will expand similar services in other towns throughout South Africa. A reasonably large home is being built in one of the suburbs to provide accommodation for the frail aged. I am still of the opinion that our cottage system, where single and double units are provided within a small garden complex, is the real answer for those elderly people who are still mobile and who are frightened by the thought of living in homes for the aged. This aspect should be considered, and the Minister should make more funds available <span class="col_1051-1052" refersTo="page_0547"/> for this type of accommodation. Another problem has now also reared its head and that is that the fixed income group of retired persons, persons with fixed investments, find that their income from interest has no longer the same purchasing power, because of the money being considerably devalued. It is time that their plight be investigated, with a view to assisting them before they become a burden to the State.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, referring to the I.D.C. a moment ago, the hon. member for Kensington expressed the opinion that we should do away with the provisions of section 3 (b). Section 3 (b) of Act No. 22 of 1940 provides that:</p>

<block name="quote">That objects of the corporation shall be to facilitate, promote, guide and assist in, the financing of&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) new industries and industrial undertakings; and</li>

<li>(b) schemes for the expansion, better organization and modernization of and the more efficient carrying out of operations in existing industries and industrial undertakings.</li>

</ol>

<p>This is a very important task and it is laid down in the Act. Since the I.D.C. was put into operation under this Act it has made a very great contribution to the industrial development of our country. Looking at the latest report of the I.D.C., we notice that since 1940 up to June, 1968, the I.D.C. has rendered assistance to no fewer than 945 industries. This gives an indication of the magnitude of the assistance which has been rendered. It also covers a very great variety of industries. The total amount of financial assistance rendered to industries is R688 million In the course of time some of that money has been repaid; more than R410 million has been repaid and reinvested in the course of time. The total invested in industry at the moment amounts to R278 million. But the hon. member said that South Africa is so prosperous that it is no longer necessary for the I.D.C. to render this form of assistance.</p>

<p>I think that if we look at the report of the I.D.C. again, we shall find that it contains enough reasons why we should not follow that advice. Although the I.D.C. reached its peak in respect of the rendering of assistance in 1966, there has been a decrease in the number of inquiries and applications. But this decrease is partly attributable to the Government&#x2019;s following a policy aimed at curtailing economic activity. The I.D.C. also accepted this as its policy. It began acting more rigorously and refused more applications. But in spite of that, although there were more than 900 inquiries in 1966, the number of inquiries in 1968 still amounted to 568. This is an indication of how many companies approached the I.D.C. for assistance. Of the 500 to 600, 151 did in fact make application. Sixty-two of these applications were granted. If it had therefore not been for this assistance it would have been a difficult position. An interesting fact is that a small industrial division was established a few years ago as a subdivision of the I.D.C. They assist smaller industries whose total investments do not exceed R250,000, and in such cases the I.D.C. contributes up to R50,000. Since November, 1962, when this small industrial division was established, 111 industries have been assisted to the extent of a total capital amount of approximately R2&#x00BD; million. It may be said that this is a small capital amount, but it shows to what an extent smaller industries are being assisted by the I.D.C. It is not always so easy for a smaller industry to obtain assistance. To a large extent it is dependent on banking institutions and other financial institutions, while many of the larger companies make use of inter-company loans, as we know. There are other companies which make very large profits. Out of their reserves they can then render financial assistance to other undertakings. But the I.D.C. performs a very important function. Although the allotted capital amount used by the I.D.C. in 1968 for assisting these undertakings was very small&#x2014;it amounted to R6 million&#x2014;the amount had been R30 million in 1966. In 1968 the amount was therefore much smaller, but the activities of the I.D.C. had decreased, because it had adapted itself to the economic pattern and the policy put forward by the Government. The fact that it adapted itself to that pattern does not detract from the fact that there is a very important reason why this section 3 (b) should remain, i.e. so that industries in South Africa can still go to the I.D.C. for assistance. That assistance will be granted readily. The I.D.C. insists on these categories of industries providing a large share of their capital themselves. I think that that policy is sound. The I.D.C has a special function to perform in South Africa, and it must remain. Mr. Speaker, in view of the time, I move&#x2014;</p>
