<p>Can the hon. the Deputy Minister tell us why it is that the new rules, or any amendments to the magistrate&#x2019;s court rules, should no longer be published in three consecutive issues of the <i>Government Gazette</i>? It would seem to have been an excellent practice, having regard especially to the fact that <i>Gazettes</i> are often hard to get and are quickly sold out, especially when they have a provision such as this in them. I wonder whether he will explain why it is that this provision is now being removed.</p>

It is a waste of money to do that printing, because it costs a good deal to print it in three consecutive issues of the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and in order to save that money, it has been decided to print it in one issue of the <i>Government Gazette</i> only, so as to bring the position into line with the practice in the Public Service in connection with all other matters. A full month is allowed before it takes effect and this affords people sufficient time to adapt themselves to the new amendment. This streamlines the entire position.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This amendment provides for an increase in the cost of a record when a person has been convicted and is considering an appeal to the Supreme Cout. The cost per folio is increased from 9d., or 7&#x00BD; cents, to 20 cents, which is much more than double. One appreciates that certain things have increased in cost, including obviously the price per folio of a record, but what I find rather disturbing about this is that so far as I am aware the Lubbe organization does almost all the recordings and transcriptions, in the courts. What I would like to know is whether this applies to those records which are recorded by the Lubbe organization, or whether it only applies to those records which are recorded by the magistrate himself, or does it apply to all transcriptions?</p>

<p>It applies to all transcriptions.

As the hon. member knows, in all <i>pro Deo</i> cases copies of records are provided free to the accused. It is only in the other cases that they will have to pay.</p>

<p>This clause deals with the proof of previous convictions, as does the previous clause, and it appears that the whole procedure is now being streamlined, but I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will indicate just what the significance of the repeal of these sections is, having regard to the other clauses in this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>A long procedure is now being eliminated because it is becoming unnecessary. When a preparatory examination is held, the prosecutor must, in terms of section 69 of the Criminal Procedure Act, send particulars of previous convictions to the Attorney-General as soon as the examination has been concluded. If the Attorney-General finds that those previous convictions must be proved, he must refer the matter back and then they again have to be proved in the magistrate&#x2019;s court, and then it goes back again. This has in fact been found to be quite unnecessary, because there are so many cases now where the accused are summarily tried, and the accelerated procedure is working quite well. When the accused is summarily charged in the Supreme Court, the Attorney-General cannot make use of the procedure under section 69, and the prosecutor must, in terms of section 302 of the Act, give the Supreme Court and the accused at least 72 hours&#x2019; notice that he intends to prove previous convictions against him. This is then done in the usual way at the trial. The object of section 69 appears to be of a twofold nature. In the first place it provides the Attorney-General with the necessary notification and in the second place, according to the procedure in terms of section 302, it notifies the accused that the State intends to prove the previous convictions against him. Upon investigation it has now appeared that the expenditure and the work in connection with the re-opening of preparatory examinations in terms of section 69 is not justified. According to statistics obtained by the S.A. Criminal Bureau there were only four cases out of approximately 3,248 accused in respect of which this procedure was followed during the period of one year from January, 1966, to January, 1967, in which they denied previous convictions. In other words, they were four cases out of 3,248, which is a clear indication to us that this procedure is in fact obsolete, and the intention is now rather to eliminate it and to follow the same procedure in the Supreme Court as has been followed in the magistrates&#x2019; courts.</p>

<p>Clause 10:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 50, to omit &#x201C;dealt with by or relating to&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;concerning the organization of&#x201D;.</block>

<p>If my amendment is accepted, subsection (2) (b) (ii) will read that &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; means any matter relating to the security of the Republic and includes any matter concerning the organization of the Bureau for State Security, etc. When we were discussing the Second Reading, and I criticized the application of this clause, I pointed out that any matter which the Security Police investigated would become a security matter. I gave examples of what the Security Police had already done, such as investigating the smear pamphlets, and the <span class="col_7963-7964" refersTo="page_1134"/>possession by the <i>Sunday Times</i> of Broeder-bond documents, etc. The Deputy Minister then interjected and said I must read this sub-paragraph with subsection (2) (a), and he suggested that it only became a secret matter if it was used for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or the interest of the Republic. I want to point out to him that in reading subsection (2) (a), the prohibition relates to any security matter, and &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; is defined. No matter what comes after the words &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; in subsection (2) (a), no matter what else is contained in subsection (2) (a), &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; is defined, and the definition includes, as the Bill now reads, any matter dealt with by or relating to the Bureau of State Security. &#x201C;Any matter dealt with&#x201D; means any matter which they handle. What else can it mean? It means any matter which the Security Police handle, and we have it from the Prime Minister himself that the Security Police will handle any matter, not necessarily dealing with security. They can deal with any crime. Therefore we say that as the Bill now reads it is very wide. We quite agree that there should be some security in regard to the organization of the Security Police, and if my amendment is accepted, it will have this effect that any matter dealing with the organization of the Police, with people in the organization of the Security Police, will become privileged. I do not see why the Minister cannot accept that, if in fact that is what is intended in this Bill. I submit that the Minister misreads subsection (2) (a) if he thinks it is confined only to security matters. I submit it is confined not only to security matters, because of the definition given of &#x201C;security matter&#x201D;, which is wider.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is quite correct in his premise when he says that it will include more than actual security matters only. Many matters may be investigated, but this is not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is that he has to read paragraph (b), which reads as follows: For the purposes of paragraph (a) &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; means this. It is only for the purposes of (2) (a) that that definition of a security matter is applicable and important. All the other things which are not important for the purposes of paragraph (a), have no significance. It is only for the purposes of (a) that that definition has any significance. &#x201C;For the purposes of paragraph (a)&#x201D; are the words which give finality in regard to the whole matter, because in (2) (a) an offence is being created. These are the words which are decisive in this regard: &#x201C;in any manner or for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the Republic&#x201D;. This is what the State has to prove in accusing any person of that offence. Therefore, even if this bureau were to investigate matters, but were unable to meet the requirements laid down in (a), it would have no effect, because that aspect only has significance when it comes to the implementation of (a). Therefore, the hon. member need not be concerned about the writers of the smear pamphlets and about their being convicted in terms of subsection (2) (a). I must also state that his amendment seeks to confine the whole question of security matters to the people within the bureau only, but these people within the bureau do in fact have to deal with many matters which are outside the bureau. If a person outside the bureau were to obtain information about matters within the bureau, we would, according to his amendment, not be able to take steps against those persons, the very outsiders against whom we want to take steps because they are going to interfere with bureau matters within the organization.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. the Deputy Minister has missed the point altogether. There are three aspects of this definition. Firstly &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; means any matter relating to the security of the Republic. The amendment moved by my hon. friend proposes to leave that as it is. Secondly, a &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; includes &#x201C;any matter dealt with by or relating to the Bureau for State Security&#x201D;. It is this part of the definition which is proposed to be substituted by other words. Thirdly, a &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; means any matter &#x201C;relating to the relationship subsisting between any person and the said bureau&#x201D;. Now the amendment does not propose to touch that aspect either. This amendment only proposes to deal with the middle part of this definition. Quite obviously, if you have such a bureau, the relationship existing between it and its agents, if I may use that expression, has to be protected. If we know that someone is an agent of B.O.S.S., we should obviously not disclose it, in the same way as the C.I.A. tries to preserve the secrecy of its agents. If this is not done, it obviously will not work. However, the hon. the Deputy Minister must not think that we are concerned about the writers of smear letters. That does not worry us at all. What we are concerned about are the writers of things other than smear letters. Every newspaper man in the country is going to be affected by this provision. We concede that B.O.S.S. has to be enclosed in a secret shroud, but how is one to know what it is dealing with? What B.O.S.S. deals with, no one must know about. What will be the case if one publishes an article, for instance, on a subject being dealt with by B.O.S.S.? If this article has the effect of prejudicing the interests of the State, one will be committing an offence. This provision is incredibly wide. How do you know when you are committing an offence? This is really the point. You do not know because you are not allowed to know what B.O.S.S. is dealing with, nor are you allowed to know whether the subject you are dealing with is something which relates to the bureau. You do not know. Nobody knows. Not even this House is allowed to know. I am not complaining about that aspect of the matter because, as we have indicated already, we agreed to the measure establishing this bureau. However, we did not <span class="col_7965-7966" refersTo="page_1135"/>agree to it in these circumstances. We do not agree that the discussion of a matter already being dealt with by B.O.S.S. should be treated as an offence when one does not know what B.O.S.S. is in fact dealing with. Surely the hon. the Deputy Minister concedes that this is so and that one can commit an offence without knowing it. If anyone writes a leading article in a newspaper criticizing a matter which happens to be under investigation by the bureau, he will be committing an offence without knowing it. If, in fact, the hon. the Minister does not like what is written in that leading article, he can prosecute the writer of the article in terms of this provision, or he can certainly take him in for investigation, on the grounds that he is investigating an offence under the Official Secrets Act. My hon. friend is quite right when he says that the bureau can deal with anything. The hon. the Prime Minister has already indicated what the Security Police have dealt with in the past. Is there any assurance that B.O.S.S. is not going to investigate or concern itself with, or deal with smear letters sent to members of the Nationalist Party, and which are published? We know that the Security Branch has investigated the theft of certain magazines from Durban Station. The magazine involved was a magazine called <i>Veg,</i> oddly enough. They investigate matters relating to the population register. They investigate matters concerning the group areas, kidnapping and all sorts of things. These are matters about which people have strong opinions, and about which they express strong criticism. Especially newspapers do so, as they are the medium through which one expresses publicly one&#x2019;s disapproval or one&#x2019;s thought on these subjects. This provision can place a curb on the writer of any leading article in any newspaper, because he will not know what B.O.S.S. is dealing with. The only way in which he can find out what B.O.S.S. is dealing with, is to ask the boss. But the boss is not allowed to tell him. This is the effect of this clause. This is how far it goes. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will accept this amendment. It is a reasonable amendment. As the hon. member for Transkei said, this clause should be limited to only the organization of B.O.S.S. That is fair. I hope that the Deputy Minister has reconsidered the position and that he will accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has not appreciated the precise point we are trying to make. In dealing with this clause a moment ago, he said that the effect of the amendment being introduced by this clause, will be to include any security matter. This is quite correct. This is the only amendment which is being made. But the definition of a &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; must then be looked at in order to appreciate exactly what it includes. The point made by the Deputy Minister was that, before there can be a conviction, there must be proof that the matter involved is a security matter and that the matter was communicated or published for any purpose prejudicial to the State. It would assist me, Sir, if I could see the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, we are trying to debate with the hon. the Deputy Minister. Is this the point which was made by the hon. the Deputy Minister? Was the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s point that, before there can be a conviction, there must be proof that there was a communication or a publication for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or the interests of the State?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I thought that was the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s point, but, with respect to him, he was not entirely correct, because of the words used in the new subsection (2) (a). If the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s argument were to apply, this subsection would have to read, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who has in his possession or under his control any &#x2026; information which relates to any security matter and who publishes it or directly or indirectly communicates it to any person in any manner prejudicial to the safety or the interests of the State, shall be guilty of an offence &#x2026;</block>

<p>Such information would then have to be communicated in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, even if it were not communicated for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State. This is an entirely different situation, because if it is an offence to communicate such information in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the State, the intention of the person would be quite irrelevant. In the example given by the Deputy Minister, the intention of the person is relevant, because it is a question of intention. The information would then have to be communicated for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or the interests of the State.</p>

<p>But that is not the only situation under which there can be a conviction. There can be a conviction simply if there is a communication or a publication in a manner prejudicial to the safety or the interests of the State. Sir, when you relate that to the definition of &#x201C;security matter&#x201D;, we submit that it becomes clear that an offence can be committed quite inadvertently and quite innocently, because &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; includes &#x201C;any matter dealt with by or relating to the Bureau for State Security&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I come now to the fact that one does not know what is being dealt with by the Bureau for State Security. Quite rightly, the bureau must keep what it is dealing with secret and we are not against that aspect of the matter. Obviously, if there is to be a Bureau for State <span class="col_7967-7968" refersTo="page_1136"/>Security, its actions and the matters with which it is dealing must be kept secret. If it is made an offence to communicate in a manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State a matter which is being dealt with by the Bureau for State Security, an offence can quite easily be committed innocently and inadvertently, because the person concerned may not know what the bureau is dealing with. This is why we suggest that the words &#x201C;dealt with by&#x201D; should be omitted so that the definition of &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; will then be limited when it refers to the Bureau for State Security. It will then be limited in such a way that it is reasonable for a person to be aware that a certain matter may affect the Bureau for State Security. We are trying to limit this provision to within reasonable limits. We suggest that because of the introduction of the words &#x201C;dealt with by&#x201D; in this definition, it is not reasonable. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Transkei suggests that these words should be substituted by the words &#x201C;concerning the organization of&#x201D;. The definition would then read: &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; means any matter concerning the organization of the Bureau for State Security.</p>

<p>We think that this will cover every kind of case which the hon. the Deputy Minister is seeking to protect by this amendment. In other words, the hon. the Deputy Minister is seeking to give the bureau adequate protection so that there will not be publication of what it is dealing with or of the persons who are acting as its agents, etc. This is reasonable, but it becomes unreasonable when it is extended and when the wording is so wide that it can result in persons being convicted although they acted quite innocently or inadvertently because they did not know exactly what was being dealt with by the bureau. We think that this amendment is reasonable. If, however, the hon. the Deputy Minister does not like the wording of our amendment, perhaps the problem could be met by simply deleting the words &#x201C;dealt with by&#x201D;. The definition will then read, &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; means any matter relating to the security of the Republic and includes any matter relating to the Bureau for State Security &#x2026; or relating to the relationship subsisting between any person and the said bureau&#x201D;. It seems to me that this would also be satisfactory because in the case of a matter relating to the bureau, there is a greater chance that the persons concerned may know that this is a matter with which the bureau is dealing. We therefore ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider these possibilities in the light of the problems which we have put to him.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in pursuance of what was said by the hon. member for Durban (North), I just want to point out that to a large extent the amendment moved by the hon. member for Transkei actually removes the core from the definition of a bureau matter. The hon. member must bear in mind that this Bureau co-ordinates various State information Departments. It also co-ordinates the security branch of both the police and the military authorities. This is information which the Bureau does not have at its disposal and which concerns these two bodies, but is nevertheless dealt with by it. For instance, the Bureau may deal with a security matter which in point of fact belongs under the military branch. Such a matter is beyond its organization, but it may, for instance, have been instructed by the military branch to investigate the matter. In that case the matter investigated would be a military one. The same applies to police matters which may perhaps result in the safety or interests of the State being affected. The police can refer such matters to the Bureau because it is a co-ordinating Department. Consequently we cannot accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Transkei, for in moving his amendment the hon. member narrows down the scope of the provision far too much and forgets that the whole object of this Department is to serve as a co-ordinating Department. I hope that the position is clear to the hon. member for Transkei now.</p>

<p>The matter raised by the hon. member for Musgrave is basically the same as the one raised by the hon. member for Durban (North). The hon. member for Musgrave advanced quite a plausible argument. I want to concede to him that he advanced a sound argument, and I should like to reply to it. He is in fact not so much opposed to the definition in paragraph (ii), but rather to the words &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D; in (2) (a). He has based his entire argument on the premise that these words exclude the intention which has to be proved. A person may be quite careless and unaware that he is dealing with such a matter. But, surely, this is not correct, for in the case of an offence in terms of subsection (2) (b) (ii) there has to be <i>mens rea.</i> There has to be intention before it can be proved.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Let us get this matter clear. This is a generally accepted principle, because there can be no offence without there being <i>mens rea.</i> This is the prerequisite for any offence. This is elementary law. No elementary element is being excluded here. Even in the case of a minor offence in terms of a road ordinance, for instance, there has to be a <i>mens rea.</i> This is an elementary matter and we shall not be able to argue about it either. It is true that in the case of any offence guilt has to be proved. However, the hon. member said that because of the wording of the definition, it might happen that a newspaper unwittingly published a certain matter which was being dealt with by the Bureau. But what does the State have to prove in such a case? The State has to prove that the publication thereof was prejudicial to the interests of the State. What person will not know that something which is published is not in the interests of the State? <span class="col_7969-7970" refersTo="page_1137"/>Surely, anybody who publishes anything, would know this. After all, all of us know what is in the interests of the State. Such a publication has to be prejudicial to the interests or the safety of the State, and this has to be proved. Any person who publishes something of this nature, would know whether or not it is prejudicial to the safety of the State. Such a person would also know whether it is prejudicial to the public interest. A newspaper does not simply publish articles blindly, without making sure of those possibilities. No person will publish it without making sure of those possibilities. If a person were to do that, he would be reckless and an element of guilt would definitely be involved in the matter. The words &#x201C;any manner&#x201D; will also give an indication of what the element of guilt is. If the &#x201C;manner&#x201D; is reckless and intentional, such a person would be guilty. What else? Therefore I do not see in these words the danger hon. members opposite see in them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has now certainly justified our fears of what the consequences of this Bill will be. He commenced by saying that this Security Branch will interest themselves in other matters. They will co-ordinate the investigations of different Departments. They may be asked to take up a military matter or to take over a police matter. The problem now is that when any person wishes to communicate any matter he will never know whether the Security Police has investigated the matter or not. As the law reads at present, it is laid down that if someone communicates any matter, namely any military or police matter, which may be prejudicial to the safety or the interests of the Republic, he will commit an offence. A &#x201C;police matter&#x201D; is defined as being &#x201C;any matter relating to the preservation of the internal security of the Republic or the maintenance of law and order by the South Africa Police&#x201D;. That is all that is covered in this Bill at the moment. If that applies to the Security Police we would have no objection either. This amendment now goes much further. I want to give an example of what might happen.</p>

<p>Let us take the case to which the hon. the Minister has referred as being against the interest of the State, namely when we discussed the death of prisoners in a police van. The hon. the Minister of Police said that the matter should not be raised because it was against the interests of the Republic. The hon. the Minister of Police said that by raising and discussing that matter in this House we were acting in a manner contrary to the interest of the Republic. It was not prejudicial to the safety of the Republic, but against the interests of the Republic. No steps could be taken against anybody who communicated on the police van incident, because it was a matter dealt with by the police and in any event a police matter did not cover a matter of that nature. A police matter as defined in existing law did not cover a matter of that nature. A &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; is now defined in this Bill as being &#x201C;any matter relating to the security of the Republic&#x201D;, to which we have no objection, &#x201C;and includes any matter dealt with &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Not only a military matter, but also a police or even a political matter. They have interfered in and investigated political matters. It goes much further than that. What one would expect is that the Security Police will only deal with security matters. The definition of a security matter should therefore merely read &#x201C;any matter relating to the security of the Republic and/or the organizations of the Security Police themselves&#x201D;. That would be reasonable. We cannot see why the hon. the Deputy Minister must include the words &#x201C;and includes any matter dealt with&#x201D;. What the hon. the Deputy Minister has said now has added to our consternation as to what will happen. I have given the hon. the Deputy Minister an example of what can happen.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister does not appear to have grasped our arguments at all. The point is that no one is supposed to know what B.O.S.S. does. No one is to know that, not even the Minister or this House. Let us start on that premise. What they are dealing with is. therefore, unknown to anyone except the people in that organization. If someone publishes something concerning a matter that is being dealt with by the Bureau in a manner which is prejudicial to the interests of the Republic, an offence is committed. Such an offence may be committed unwittingly. Anyone who writes anything, any criticism or anything of that sort, especially criticism in a newspaper on a matter which is being dealt with by this bureau, commits an offence if it is published in a manner which is calculated to be against the interests of the Republic. How can one then say, as the hon. the Deputy Minister says, that no mental element comes into it? Of course, it does come into it and should come into it. But here you commit an offence unwittingly, if we should <span class="col_7971-7972" refersTo="page_1138"/>pass this measure. The rule about <i>mens rea</i> as the hon. the Deputy Minister is aware, is that there is a strong presumption that <i>mens rea</i> is required. If the Statute makes it clear that it is not required, it is not required. This paragraph provides for both purpose and manner so that one can communicate in any manner and for any purpose which may be prejudicial to the safety or interests of the Republic. If one should communicate for a purpose then obviously there is <i>mens rea.</i> The mental attitude of mind to do something for a purpose, is required. In &#x201C;a manner which is prejudicial&#x201D; there is not necessarily that mental element. But, as I say, that begs the whole question, because no one knows what B.O.S.S. is dealing with. If someone should in fact publish something of this sort, as is going to happen every day about every controversial matter which this bureau deals with, what is this bureau going to do about it? The field seems to be getting wider and wider the more the hon. the Deputy Minister speaks. Where is the end of the bureau. Are they or are they not going to. The hon. the Deputy Minister cannot say. That is why this is so absurd. This hon. Deputy Minister, who wants us to pass this clause, cannot tell us what B.O.S.S. is going to deal with. He cannot tell anyone. He does not know.</p>

<p>That is so. The B.O.S.S. should be handling this Bill. He is the only one who will be able to tell us whether our fears are founded or whether they are not. Not that that would be sufficient, but we would at least like some such assurance. Even the B.O.S.S. would not be able to say what he is going to deal with. That is the point. If that is so the hon. the Deputy Minister should at least agree to the deletion of the words &#x201C;dealt with&#x201D;. He can&#x2019;t tell us what it is going to deal with. All that this Committee can go on, is its experience of what the security branch has dealt with before. And that includes all matters. Any matter that you can possibly think of it deals with. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will answer that point at any rate, even if he does not agree with it. The hon. the Deputy Minister should tell us what his feeling is about the &#x201C;dealing with&#x201D; part, and that one can communicate something about something they are dealing with without knowing it. We would be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister could give us the benefit of his thoughts.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has now made two points. I wish to reply quite clearly to both points. The first point deals with the words &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D; in subsection (2) (a). The part in question reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; any person in any manner or for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the Republic &#x2026;</block>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am very well aware of the &#x201C;or&#x201D;. Now hon. members want to argue about those words. All the arguments the hon. member has now advanced, he might just as well have advanced in regard to the wording of the existing Act, i.e. before this amendment was proposed. There are many things which a newspaper could have published unwittingly in regard to security matters. As the Act reads at present, it could unwittingly have done so in regard to security matters as the Act reads at present. As the Act reads at present, it could also have published such things unwittingly in regard to a police matter. I am now referring to a police matter relating to internal security. It could unwittingly have published certain things in regard to all those aspects. Where does the prosecution aspect come into the picture in those cases? As the section reads at present, i.e. before this amendment was moved, the words &#x201C;any person &#x2026; who publishes it or directly or indirectly communicates it to any person in any manner or for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or the interests of the Republic&#x201D; are just as valid in respect of all those matters. Therefore I need not elaborate on that matter any further. It is not correct, as hon. members are now saying, that the words &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D; exclude <i>mens rea</i> as it were. Practical experience over the past 10, 12 years has proved that this is not the case.</p>

<p>Now we come to the second point which deals with the words &#x201C;dealt with by&#x201D;. I have already made this point very clear. This Bureau is going to deal with many matters because it is a co-ordinating Bureau. The Bureau co-ordinates information from all State departments; not only from one department, but from all State departments. For instance, it co-ordinates information obtained from the information bureau. It may obtain information there which it would have to investigate as it might be prejudicial to the interests of safety of the State. It co-ordinates military intelligence. It obtains information in regard to military matters, and if the safety or interests of the State are prejudiced by such information, it will have to investigate those matters as well. It has to deal with them. I cannot omit those words, because to do so would in fact eliminate the whole function of the Bureau as a co-ordinating department. I really cannot take the matter any further.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give more consideration to this. I should like to put this matter to him in a different way in dealing with the points which he has made. <span class="col_7973-7974" refersTo="page_1139"/>Frankly, we are even more worried in view of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reiteration that the Bureau for State Security is going to have such very wide functions. I think that he as Deputy Minister of Justice ought likewise to be concerned with this provision in relation to a bureau with such wide powers. First of all, the hon. the Deputy Minister said that the position before this proposed amendment was introduced could likewise have resulted in somebody being prosecuted inadvertently because it related to military matters, Police matters and so forth. I should like to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that persons publishing information or communicating information relating to a Police or a military matter would know that they have to be particularly careful by the very nature of these two things. They would know that it is a Police matter and they would know that it is a military matter. They would therefore know that in relation to such matters they would have to be particularly careful. Our point is that there is no way for a person to know what is being dealt with by the Bureau for State Security. They can deal with so many things. The hon. the Deputy Minister has reiterated that they will be dealing with all sorts of matters. This is our very point. As the clause stands at the moment, that is without the proposed amendment, persons would know what a military matter is and that they would have to be particularly careful. But they would not know what the bureau was dealing with. An offence is created not only in respect of matters dealt with by the bureau and which are communicated in a manner prejudicial to the safety of the State. If the safety of the State is involved, then in most cases one would know whether or not something which is being published affects the safety of the State. The offence is created if a matter dealt with by the bureau is communicated in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the State. The words &#x201C;interests of the State&#x201D; and &#x201C;the security of the State&#x201D; are not synonymous. Something can affect the interests of the State while it does not at any stage affect the security of the State. In other words, the phrase &#x201C;interests of the State&#x201D; goes very much wider. As the hon. member for Transkei has pointed out, we have had thrown at us from the Government side of the House that by raising various matters that we are prejudicing the interests of the State. We do not agree with that for one moment. But the Government is making that contention. Similarly, it could be contended that some matter which is being raised by a newspaper or by an individual affects the interests of the State and therefore comes within the purview of this amendment because it is being dealt with by the bureau.</p>

<p>That is why we are pointing out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that with the use of the words &#x201C;dealt with by the Bureau&#x201D;, read in the context of subsection (2) (a) this proposed amendment goes very far indeed and unreasonably far, in a way which makes it quite impossible for a citizen to know whether he is or is not contravening this section.</p>

<p>Sir, this deals with one aspect. Then I would like to come back to the other point made by the hon. the Deputy Minister and that is in regard to <i>mens rea.</i> The hon. the Deputy Minister has countered the argument I have raised by saying that even if you are dealing with this portion of subsection (2) (a) which makes it an offence to communicate in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the State, <i>mens rea</i> will have to be proved in order to obtain a conviction. Sir, I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give more careful consideration to this and perhaps obtain the views of the department. Sir, could I just explain this to the Deputy Minister because this is really the crux of it. If the hon. the Deputy Minister is right, then obviously the position is not quite so bad as we contend because if <i>mens rea</i> has to be proved, if a clear intention to prejudice the safety or the interests of the State, has to be proved, in other words, if the hon. the Deputy Minister is right, then our fears are not well grounded. But, with respect to the Deputy Minister, I think he is quite wrong on this aspect, because, as the hon. member for Durban (North) has pointed out, whether or not <i>mens rea</i> is required for a conviction depends on the intention of the legislature as it appears from the section.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will concede that it is not for every conviction that <i>mens rea</i> or an intention is required. Some laws specifically exclude it, and in other cases it is excluded by reason of the wording of the legislation. In subsection (2) (a) we have two distinct situations which are different from each other; two types of offences are created, and I submit to the hon. the Deputy Minister that the courts would inevitably have to come to the conclusion that in one case the legislature intended <i>mens rea</i> and that in the other the legislature did not I suggest the position is that in the case of a charge of contravening subsection (2) (a) on the ground of communication for a purpose prejudicial to the State, the courts would have to say that the legislature clearly intended <i>mens rea;</i> that it clearly intended proof of an intention or of a purpose to prejudice. But in the case of a communication &#x201C;in a manner prejudicial&#x201D; the courts would inevitably have to say that the legislature has used the two different words, and that in the case of a charge of contravening the section by means of a manner prejudicial to the safety of the State, the legislature intended this to be different from &#x201C;a purpose prejudicial&#x201D; and that therefore <i>mens rea</i> would not be required.</p>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>I think my hon. friend was right when he said that the crux of the matter was whether <i>mens rea</i> would be found to be necessary or not. I submit on the other hand that <i>mens rea</i> would be necessary. I think my hon. friend will agree with me that the rule with regard to <i>mens rea</i> is that normally <i>mens rea</i> is a requirement of all offences except <span class="col_7975-7976" refersTo="page_1140"/>where the legislature clearly states that it is not or where the wording is such that you inevitably have to come to the conclusion that <i>mens rea</i> is not a requirement. What would be the position here? The position here would be that the accused communicates &#x201C;to any person in any manner or for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or the interests of the State.&#x201D; The words &#x201C;any purpose prejudicial&#x201D; are obviously intended to mean that <i>mens rea</i> is necessary. I submit that the courts will take that as an indication that the preceding words &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D; also imply that an intention is necessary.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>They may be two different expressions but the interpretation normally is that if there is an indication at all of <i>mens rea</i> in an offence it will apply to all the facets of the offence. If the court concludes that the offence was committed &#x201C;for a purpose prejudicial&#x201D; then it will also conclude that the words &#x201C;in a manner&#x201D; mean &#x201C;with an intention&#x201D;. In other words, the manner must be so careless as to amount to <i>mens rea.</i> I think my hon. friends have also missed this particular point.</p>

<p>If they look at this subsection carefully they will find that it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who has in his possession or under his control any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information which relates to munitions of war &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is some information that the person concerned has or of which he has knowledge. It relates to munitions of war or to a military or Police matter; that is quite simple; he knows that this thing has something to do with the Police or military or security matters and that he must not tell anybody about it. Normally the position is also quite easy as far as security is concerned. It must be something which is prejudicial to the interests of the State.</p>

<p>That is the difficulty. Let us take the example quoted by my hon. friend, namely a pamphlet which, on the face of it, appears to be innocent. The question is whether you can give information about this particular pamphlet; you do not know whether the Security Police have been dealing with it or not. If you do not know it at all, if you are completely innocent, I submit that because &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D; indicates <i>mens rea</i> you would be found not guilty. But if somebody had told you beforehand that that pamphlet may have a background of some offence against the State and in spite of that you convey that knowledge in a certain manner to someone else, then <i>mens rea</i> would come in and you would be guilty under this section.

Otherwise the legislature would have left it at &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; instead of putting in the word &#x201C;manner&#x201D;. Sir, quite apart from this question of <i>mens rea,</i> quite apart from what one would prove in court, this clause can have consequences, as a result of Police action, which would deprive people of their right to sue in the civil courts for wrongful arrest and detention, for example. This happens quite frequently: the hon. the Deputy Minister must not look shocked because it does happen. Let me say why I say this. If you are arrested and detained pending investigation on suspicion of having committed some offence, the matter is then investigated and the charge may be dropped and you are released. If your detention was unlawful, you can obviously sue the State.</p>

<p>How can wrongful arrest be brought under this section?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am about to explain it. It is very easy as a rule to show whether you have been wrongly arrested and unlawfully detained because you have to be arrested on suspicion of having committed some offence, and the facts of the offence are well known to you. Take the case of a person who is detained by the Security Police on suspicion that he has committed an offence under this section. He is arrested: investigations are made and then he is subsequently released; the charge, if one was brought against him, is dropped, or if no charge was brought against him, he is simply released. How does the person who was arrested ever prove that he was unlawfully arrested? How can he ever prove it? Because he has been arrested for publishing in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the State a matter being dealt <span class="col_7977-7978" refersTo="page_1141"/>with by B.O.S.S. He is never going to be able to find out or tell a court that in fact that is what is being dealt with by B.O.S.S.; that this is what he was being interrogated about; he will never know whether in fact there was any foundation for his arrest and for his subsequent detention. How can he ever know? Sir, that is a consequence of this provision and, if I may say so, it is in just those circumstances that you can read this clause with clause 29, so the effect of this provision is felt outside of the Court as well as within it. Within the court, Sir, the matter is very wide but the court would deal with it and deal with the circumstances of it if they find him guilty. But in the operation of the members or agents of B.O.S.S., outside of the courts, as I have indicated with just one example, this can have the most ghastly consequences for someone who is in fact detained pending investigation.</p>

<p>There is one other point which the hon. the Minister dealt with when he last spoke in this debate. He said that he could not agree to the deletion of the words &#x201C;dealt with by or&#x201D; in the definition of &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; because the Bureau of State Security would be dealing with all sorts of things and would be a type of co-ordinating body. I think the answer to the hon. the Deputy Minister on this point is that if it is a matter relating to the security of the Republic, then this is covered specifically by the first part of the definition of &#x201C;security matter&#x201D;, so whether or not it is being dealt with by the Bureau of State Security is irrelevant, because it is specifically covered by this first part of this definition. So it is only other matters dealt with by the Bureau with which we need to be concerned, and those are specifically the ones we are concerned about, because if it is a security matter then one has some chance of knowing what it is about. The person who is about to communicate or publish knows that he must be careful because it is a security matter.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Then I will not take this any further. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister has seen the point which I make and I would ask him to consider it in that light.</p>

<p>The other aspect which worries me very much is still this question of <i>mens rea.</i> The hon. member for Prinshof has argued that because the word &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; implies <i>mens rea</i> the court would automatically infer that in regard to the words &#x201C;any manner&#x201D; which appeared before, <i>mens rea</i> was likewise intended. I think as an advocate the hon. member for Prinshof will concede that one of the cardinal principles of interpretation, particularly in regard to <i>mens rea,</i> is that if two words are used with the word &#x201C;or&#x201D; in between, in other words, two specific types of situations are made offences, where one word necessarily implies an intention and the other word does not imply an intention, one of the cardinal principles of interpretation is that the court will say that the Legislature intended that in the one case there must be <i>mens rea</i> for a conviction, and in the other there need not be, particularly where the word implying intention comes second and not first in order, as is the case here. Here we have the word &#x201C;manner&#x201D;, which does not imply an intention; in fact, it clearly indicates that an intention is not necessary. That comes first and then comes the word which implies an intention. In such a context I think the hon. member for Prinshof will agree with me, on further reflection, that in such instances the courts have invariably held that if two types of convictions are envisaged, one not requiring <i>mens rea</i> and the other requiring it &#x2026; This is so important in view of the words &#x201C;dealt with by or&#x201D; in the definition of &#x201C;security matter&#x201D; that there should be no doubt at all, and if the Deputy Minister intends that convictions under this section should require proof of an intention I think this ought to be clearly inserted in the Act.</p>

<p>But there is perhaps a more important aspect to this question of <i>mens rea,</i> and that is section 8 of the principal Act, which places the onus on the accused. Section 8 does away with the normal onus and places it on the accused. So, if there is any doubt on the lines suggested by the Deputy Minister, that doubt is removed by section 8. The Crown does not have to prove <i>mens rea</i> because in terms of section 8 the onus is placed on the accused. Perhaps the Deputy Minister would consider that aspect of it. In view of all these problems, I would like to move, as an alternative amendment to that moved by the hon. member for Transkei, the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 50, to omit &#x201C;dealt with by or&#x201D;.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>As regards the last point, namely that the onus is now being transferred in terms of section 8, it is probably so much easier for the accused to prove that he did not have any <i>mens rea.</i> The fact that the onus is being transferred, will by no means eliminate the element and the offence of <i>mens rea.</i> Surely, hon. members are well aware of this. The offence still has to be proved, no matter on whom the onus falls. The onus does not exclude the element of the offence. It is simply a matter of his being able to declare that he is not guilty of such an offence because this was not his intention; it was not his intention; he did not do it with that intention. He then denies any guilt and then the onus falls on the State again to prove that there was, in fact, such an intention. But that this is a requirement of the offence, is as clear as a pikestaff. I do not think I need go into this matter any further. This is simply a repetition of all the arguments we have had up to now.</p>

<p>With respect, I have been listening to most of the argument. I admit that I have been called out on occasions, but I have been here for most of the argument. The Deputy Minister is dealing now with the question of <i>mens rea</i> and earlier, when he was talking, he read from this clause. He read the English copy, and he repeatedly read in line 36 &#x201C;in a manner&#x201D;. I think this is the crux of the difficulty which the Deputy Minister sees in our argument. I will admit that when this is read in the manner in which the Deputy Minister read it, as being &#x201C;in a manner prejudicial to the safety of the State&#x201D;, a degree of <i>mens rea</i> is required. But I want to put it to the Deputy Minister that there are in fact four offences created in this section. This reads that any person who has a document and who publishes it &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D;, alternatively any person who has a document and who &#x201C;directly or indirectly communicates&#x201D; it &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D;, and any person who has a document and who publishes it &#x201C;for any purpose prejudicial to the safety of the State&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

<p>And the fourth one is that any person who has a document and who &#x201C;directly or indirectly communicates&#x201D; it &#x201C;for any purpose&#x201D; prejudicial to the State. Sir, in the four instances I have given I submit that charges 2 and 4 require a degree of <i>mens rea,</i> but that charges 1 and 3 definitely do not, or that in certain circumstances they need not, and that the interpretation of the courts when they look at &#x201C;who publishes in any manner&#x201D;, does away with the requirement of <i>mens rea</i> because &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D; can be accidental or unwitting, and then there is no <i>mens rea.</i> Then it may be negligence, but that is a different thing altogether. Negligence is not the same as <i>mens rea.</i> I cannot understand the reasoning of the Minister and I ask him to reconsider, particularly from the point of view of reading that clause &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D;, not &#x201C;in a manner&#x201D;. I want to agree with him that if it reads &#x201C;in a manner&#x201D; it denotes a degree of <i>mens rea,</i> or requires a degree of <i>mens rea,</i> but not &#x201C;in any manner&#x201D;.</p>

<p>While we are on this point, I wonder whether the Deputy Minister could clarify one point which has been worrying me from the start, and which I expected him to clarify during the debate. What is the intention of the phrase &#x201C;indirectly communicates&#x201D;? How does he anticipate that anyone &#x201C;indirectly communicates&#x201D;? This is just beyond me.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to raise certain matters with the hon. the Minister upon which I hope he will elaborate. They refer to the new paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (5) of section 73 of the Prisons Act, 1959. I do know that the hon. the Minister in introducing this measure did make some general reference to this particular clause. But the reference he made certainly does not justify the wide form in which this clause has apparently been drafted. Paragraph (a) of the new subsection (5) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Any convicted person who has been sentenced to imprisonment and is still liable to serve the sentence imposed, may on the authority of the Commissioner be removed from the prison wherein such person is detained to any place of detention established for convicted persons so sentenced in the territory of South-West Africa, including the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel.</block>

<p>The first question I want to ask the hon. the Minister in that regard is whether there is any intention of establishing some place of detention in the Caprivi Strip. One might imagine a sort of summer Siberia being established for the detention of certain types of prisoners. I think it is important that we should hear from the hon. the Minister whether it is the intention to utilize any portion of the South-West African Territory or the Caprivi Strip for the detention of prisoners who are at present being detained in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It is all very well for the hon. member to say that I should be ashamed of myself, but I am talking on the legislation which is before us. If the hon. the Minister wants to provide legislation for the purposes he indicated at the Second Reading, this clause should not be worded in this way. The clause should then simply be worded so that a prisoner who is serving sentence in the Republic and is required to stand trial in South-West Africa, can be removed to South-West Africa for the purposes of that trial and the period he spends in South-West Africa shall be deemed to be part of his serving of his sentence. That is not what this clause says. The clause says that any person detained in South Africa can be removed and detained for <span class="col_7983-7984" refersTo="page_1144"/>the rest of his detention period in South-West Africa. I ask this because the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation is not in accordance with the words of the Bill before us. I hope he will clarify the position and give an assurance that this clause is only to be used for the purposes he outlined in his Second Reading speech.</p>

<p>I now refer to a second matter. We should like to get clarity in regard to this matter. In paragraph (b) it is provided that a convicted prisoner who is so removed to South-West Africa or to the Caprivi Strip &#x201C;&#x2026; shall be treated and be subject to the same laws and regulations in every respect as if he were undergoing the sentence of a competent court of the said Territory&#x201D;. There again I think it is necessary that we should place on record the hon. Minister&#x2019;s view in this regard. The laws and regulations referred to here which are applicable in South-West and those which are applicable to a South African convicted prisoner are identical, as far as I know. I believe that is the position. I should like the hon. the Minister to clarify whether it is so that the laws and regulations applicable to detained prisoners in South-West Africa are identical to the laws and regulations which are applicable within the Republic.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I may declare in the most outspoken terms that it is not the intention at all to create a &#x201C;Siberia&#x201D; in any part of South-West Africa or in the Caprivi Zipfel. This new subsection is merely being inserted in the Act in order to make a concession to prisoners. As the Act reads at present, a person who has been convicted in South-West Africa and who must serve his sentence of imprisonment there, can be removed to South Africa. If he is awaiting trial, the period during which he is awaiting trial will count as part of the sentence he is serving. However, there is no similar provision as regards a prisoner who was convicted here and has to stand trial in South-West. The position at present is that if he is taken to South-West Africa, the period during which he is awaiting trial does not come off his sentence. This amendment to the Act is therefore being effected in order to make a concession to the prisoners concerned. The period during which such a prisoner is awaiting trial in South-West Africa will now be included in the serving of his sentence that was imposed upon him in the Republic.</p>

<p>In connection with the second matter he raised, I may just tell the hon. member that the regulations are the same. No differentiation is made.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause is to amend section 63 of the Children&#x2019;s Act, 1960, which deals with the question of contribution orders. I am referring to Chapter VI of the Children&#x2019;s Act. This is an aspect which causes a great deal of concern when it comes to the carrying into effect of such contribution orders. If one looks at section 63 one sees that there are three subsections dealing with the effect of such contribution orders. Subsection (3), which is to be deleted, reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">A contribution order shall be deemed to be such an order as is referred to in section One Hundred and Ten of the General Law Amendment Act, 1935 (Act No. 46 of 1935).</block>

<p>If one refers to that Act one notices that it deals with the steps which can be taken where there is a failure to comply with the maintenance order made by the court. The Minister now proposes to delete section 63 (3) of the Children&#x2019;s Act of 1960. I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister could give us an indication of the reasons why this subsection has to be deleted and whether he is satisfied that the position can be met in carrying into effect the contribution order where the person is not carrying out the contribution order which has been ordered against him in terms of a court order.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the position is very clear. Section 63 (3) of the Children&#x2019;s Act of 1960 provides that a contribution order may be made in terms of that section, and shall be deemed to be an order referred to in section 110 of the General Law Amendment Act, 1935. In terms of section 110 it was an offence to fail to comply with an order made by the Supreme Court. But then the Maintenance Act, Act. No. 23 of 1963, was passed. This Act repealed section 110. The Maintenance Act of 1963 now regulates that matter itself, and therefore makes section 63 (3) of the Children&#x2019;s Act redundant. That is why it is proposed that it be deleted.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause which deals with the delegation of powers is a clause which will replace section 91 of the Children&#x2019;s Act, which is a far more restricted section than the clause which is now proposed in terms of the Bill before us. The power to delegate further powers is now being extended, particularly where it refers to &#x201C;the Minister may delegate to the Secretary or to any other senior officer&#x201D; certain powers, save the power to make regulations. Section 91 (2) deals also with these powers. If one refers to the principal Act, the delegation of powers is not as wide as is proposed in this Bill.

<p>Mr. Chairman, section 91 of the Children&#x2019;s Act has now empowered the Minister to delegate certain powers. This is in fact possible, but there is doubt as to whether he can delegate it to an officer of another department. There are other departments which also deal with matters in connection with other races. Take the case of the Chinese. They fall under the Department of the Interior. In order to be able to exercise these powers, as embodied in the Children&#x2019;s Act, it is necessary for the Minister, for example, to be able to delegate the powers in respect of those Chinese to the officers of the Department of the Interior.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for the explanation which he gave. But really, I am wondering whether this is altogether a wise step which the hon. the Minister is now taking. Here we have the Children&#x2019;s Act which is administered by the officials of a particular department. I am sure that this committee is entitled to assume that those officials are fully <i>au fait</i> with that particular Act and with the administration of it. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister is empowering the Minister concerned to delegate the powers and the functions under that Act to officials of another department. This is the import of the matter. These officials may not be fully <i>an fait</i> with the administration of the Children&#x2019;s Act. Really, is this now a desirable principle to introduce into our legislation that, where you have a department and officials who are geared and fully conversant with the administration of a particular measure, the Minister in charge should be allowed to delegate the powers, administration and the authority conferred upon him and those officials so qualified, to officials of another department who are not so qualified, or who may not be quite so qualified and who may not be able to administer it in the manner in which it was intended? I am wondering about the wisdom of this. I should like to hear from the hon. the Deputy Minister what his views are on this point.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think we will need to dwell on this a long time. The hon. the Minister will not delegate his powers to officers who do not know what their functions in that connection will be. I do not know why the hon. member raised this. It is necessary for these powers to be delegated to other departments as well, such as the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. It would be necessary for the hon. the Minister to delegate those powers to those Departments as well. I do not know how the hon. member can speak of the incompetence of the officers. Must the hon. the Minister, before delegating powers to them, have each officer write an examination in order to determine whether he is conversant with the powers being delegated to him? I think this is unheard of.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Deputy Minister started off by implying that he had completely missed the point I made. However, towards the end of his little speech, he showed that he had fully appreciated the point I had made. Sir, he has begged the question. It is not a matter of going to test officials at all. Here we have an Act which is administered by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. It is administered for the protection of children, those people who need protection. These officials are specially geared to that. Now the Deputy Minister wants to hand this matter over to officials of the Department of the Interior, who really have no interest in those children, and who really have no interest in the administration of this Act. He wants to hand over to them the power to administer that Act as far as the Chinese are concerned. Of course, the same thing is going to apply in the case of other population groups such as the Indians and the Bantu. Actually, I should leave the Bantu out here, because they have their own Act. However, this will apply to other people as well. I cannot accept that this is a good principle. The hon. the Deputy Minister has not convinced me yet that this is a good principle and that it is a principle which we should accept.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to convice that hon. member is almost impossible, because he is so talkative precisely because he wants to be convinced of being able to be even more talkative. This is in fact what it boils down to. We know him like this. Surely he knows that the Children&#x2019;s Act applies to all the races of South Africa. The Children&#x2019;s Act applies to the Bantu, the Indians, the Coloured people, the Whites, therefore to all the various races. For example, the Children&#x2019;s Act is administered in respect of the Bantu by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. But it is necessary for him to delegate certain powers. If he does not have a Bantu Affairs Commissioner at a certain place, he must delegate the powers to the magistrate of the district concerned. These amendments will also rectify such cases. In this way I could give examples in respect of all the other race groups. I do not know, therefore, why the hon. member is making such an issue of it. It is to be able to administer the Children&#x2019;s Act more effectively that we want to delegate these powers to the people concerned who deal with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is the clause which amends that section of the Constitution Act which deals with offices of profit under the Crown, or under the Sash, or whatever it is called these days. Section 55 of the Constitution provides that no person shall be capable of being elected or nominated or of sitting as a member of the Senate or the <span class="col_7987-7988" refersTo="page_1146"/>House of Assembly if he holds any office of profit under the Republic. However, there is a proviso which states that certain persons shall not be deemed to hold an office of profit. In terms of section 55 (d) (vi), &#x201C;a member of any council, committee, board or similar body established by or under any law who receives no payment in respect of his services on such council, committee, board or body in excess of an allowance at a rate not exceeding R11 for each day on which he renders such services, together with the reimbursement of any travelling expenses incurred by him in the course of such services&#x201D;, is for example not deemed to hold an office of profit. It is now proposed to extend this proviso even further. Such a person may now also receive &#x201C;an allowance in respect of entertaining by him in connection with such services&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it happens that certain members of Parliament are also members of certain statutory boards, for example, the Wool Board, the Mealie Board or the Tobacco Board. When they are members of such boards, it is provided that they may receive their sustenance allowance without such an allowance, as remuneration from the State, affecting their membership of Parliament. I think there are two members of Parliament who are chairmen of such boards at the moment. On occasion, in their capacity as chairmen, they have had to do entertaining on behalf of those boards. Take, for example, the case of the hon. member for Ladybrand, of which I have personal knowledge. He visited America in connection with Mealie Board matters. He also visited Japan. It was necessary for him to entertain certain officials of those states. He had to pay for such entertainment out of his own pocket, because if he did not do so, he might have offended against this in that he received remuneration from the State, which might have disqualified him. Surely the size of the entertainment allowance is a matter for the board concerned. As hon. members know, the Controller and Auditor-General audits the accounts of these boards, and their statements are also scrutinized by the Select Committee on Public Accounts. Therefore hon. members need not have any fear that the amounts of these entertainment <span class="col_7989-7990" refersTo="page_1147"/>allowances will be excessive. Therefore the sole object of this amendment is to remove any doubt in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I read clause 20 (2) to you. That part of the clause from line 36 is entirely new and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(2) The provisions of subparagraph (vi) of paragraph (d) of section 55 of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961, in relation to the receipt by a member of any council, committee, board or similar body established by or under any law, of an allowance in respect of entertaining by him in connection with the services on such council, committee, board or body, shall apply also in relation to such receipt of such allowance at any time prior to the commencement of this section.</block>

<p>I do not want him to mention names, but the hon. the Minister did indicate that it appears that these allowances must have been paid and that for this reason we are now asked to enact that this provision shall have retrospective effect. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is quite satisfied that if there are hon. members who are concerned on account of the fact that they receive these allowances, this provision does effectively put right what may have been a difficulty in the intervening period. One can quite understand without having the wrong motivation at all that an hon. member who is the chairman of one of these boards may have received an entertainment allowance. If this Bill is passed, it will put the position right. I should like to know whether the hon. the Minister is satisfied that the Bill will in fact put right any transgressions which took place in the intervening period?</p>

The sole reason for introducing this amendment is to remove completely any doubt which existed before. This does not mean that this could not have happened in the past.

<p>Mr. Chairman, would the hon. the Deputy Minister just explain something. He mentioned the case of the chairman of the Mealie Board. Surely, if there is any entertainment to be done by the chairman of the Mealie Board in his capacity as such, the Mealie Board pays for it. They do not have to give him an allowance to do it do they? The hon. the Deputy Minister gave the example of a cocktail party. Surely, the Mealie Board would merely pay for that cocktail party?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have just explained the case of such a person being abroad on his own while he is undertaking a trip in the interests of the Mealie Board. Suppose he has to entertain people abroad. It is obvious that the Mealie Board does not do the entertaining. He does the entertaining because he is the one who is undertaking the trip. He personally, as chairman of the Mealie Board, does the entertaining as he represents the Mealie Board. They give him an allowance for that purpose. That is what this clause covers. The distinction which the hon. member wants to draw between the Board and the chairman of the Board is somewhat academic. He says it should not be made specifically to the chairman of the Board but always to the Mealie Board itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that the chairman has certain duties and that he has to go around the country and entertain people in his capacity as chairman of the board. Surely however, as my hon. friend said, that is reimbursable expenditure. He entertains on behalf of the board and when he presents his chits they pay him out, or whatever method they follow. This is precisely what he can do and it is not necessary for him to have an entertainment allowance if this is reimbursable expenditure. Surely, that is correct because otherwise there is no limit to the entertainment allowance one can receive. That would circumvent the provisions of this clause which lays down that members of Parliament should not have offices of profit which can be obtained at the behest of the State. This is the whole point of the clause. One understands that they should have an allowance for their normal expenditure, which is defined as being R11 a day plus their travelling expenses, but now they are to receive an unlimited amount by way of an entertainment allowance. One must appreciate that the object of this provision is to make members of Parliament independent of the State in all its various ramifications. <span class="col_7991-7992" refersTo="page_1148"/>It is perhaps a little historical, but this provision was nevertheless in the law of Great Britain from which this provision was taken. It also ensured that the Crown did not buy the members in those days. That was the object of the provision because it was an office of profit under the Crown which controlled the whole matter. That is a very good principle. This is going to destroy that principle, if it is entirely without any limit. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister sees my point. He gave the example of the chairman of the Mealie Board who can claim from the Mealie Board for whatever his expenses were. In terms of this clause he can claim an unlimited amount and he need not entertain. Is that not an office of profit under the State?</p>

<block name="quote">In line 33, to omit &#x201C;an&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;a reimbursive&#x201D;.</block>

<p>As the clause now reads there is no limit to the allowance which can be paid for entertainment. There is also no condition laid down that that allowance must be spent on entertainment. A person may be granted an allowance of R3,000 or R4,000 a year which is called an entertainment allowance but it has no limit as far as an amount is concerned or a condition to the effect that it must be spent on entertainment. If this is made a reimbursive allowance, then the provision will state clearly that he will only be getting back what in fact he spent in the interests of his job. In other words, when one of these people spends money on entertainment in the pursuance of the duties of his post, the amount concerned can be reimbursed to him. He cannot, however, be paid a flat allowance without a limit as far as an amount is concerned or a condition as to whether it need be spent at all. I therefore suggest that this be made a reimbursive allowance.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to point out at once that I am quite unable to accept this amendment, as it goes completely beyond the amendment which is now being proposed. I must point out to hon. members that such a person receives an allowance of R11 per day in the form of a sustenance allowance. This is not reimbursable. He receives this allowance while he is absent. It is a remuneration which he receives on a daily basis.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is limited to R11 per day. In terms of the amendment proposed by the hon. member, I now have to make provision for the person to pay this himself and for him to be reimbursed at a later stage. That proposal goes completely beyond the provisions of this amendment. In point of fact, hon. members are being somewhat petty now as they want to limit the provision which will have the effect that only the rich will be able to afford being a member of these boards. Take the case of expenditure on entertainment. If this is to be reimbursable then that person will first have to pay the amount out of his own pocket. He does not know what that amount is going to be. He will possibly have to pay R200 or R300 or R400 or R500 out of his own pocket, depending on the entertaining he does, and he simply cannot afford to do so. Consequently he will not be able to do any entertaining, but if he receives that allowance he will be able to do so. Do hon. members opposite want only the rich to serve on these boards, as the hon. member for Durban (North) argued by implication? Surely that is not what they want. Surely these people can be trusted. All of them are distinguished people. I do not believe they will regard these allowances as remuneration; they will spend the allowance for the purpose for which the allowance is paid to them. I think one should at least accept the integrity of these people.</p>

<p>Here the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to give a blank cheque to the officials, chairmen and members of boards by paying them a sustenance allowance in respect of which there will be no accountability on their part. The amendment of the hon. member for Durban (Point) seeks to make expenditure on entertainment reimbursive. The reason advanced by the Deputy Minister, i.e. that the person cannot afford to pay expenditure on entertainment out of his own pocket and to claim a refund at a later stage, is senseless. All the boards have fidelity insurance policies, and they may insure for any amount they wish to insure, R1,000 or R5,000. Now the Deputy Minister asks why a member or the chairman of a board has to pay entertainment expenses out of his own pocket. When the chairman or a member or an official of a board undertakes an overseas trip, the board allows him an amount for entertainment, and on his return, he has to give an account of how he has spent that money. This is the usual method and the only method one can apply. One cannot simply allow a man to spend money and to say afterwards that he has spent that money on entertainment. The hon. member for Houghton moved the insertion of the word &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; but what is a reasonable amount? In one case R500 may be reasonable and in another case R5,000. We know that we have had cases in this House where in our opinion an unreasonable amount has been spent on entertainment. It is the easiest thing in the world to verify entertainment expenses. Any person who wants to be reimbursed for entertainment expenses has to keep a proper account of his expenses. The person concerned may reclaim this amount, or a certain amount may be made available to him before he undertakes his trip. When a person is allowed a certain amount for entertainment, the amount he spends is not subject to auditing. Up to now the hon. the Deputy Minister has not advanced a single convincing argument why he is unable to accept the amendment, and I want to make a serious appeal to him to accept the amendment, because in this provision he is leaving a loophole and he is casting suspicion on innocent people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) is, of course, a man who knows a great deal about entertainment allowances on account of his experience as chairman of the Wool Board! I just want to point out that if hon. members who spoke on this matter, had consulted the reports of the Auditor-General on control boards, reports which have been tabled here, they would have discovered that virtually all these control boards made provision for entertainment allowances for their chairmen, not colossal amounts, but nominal amounts, and that it was the general practice of all these control boards to grant their chairmen an allowance for covering unforeseen entertainment expenses and that amounts granted to them for such purposes were mentioned by the Auditor-General in his reports on these control boards. The Select Committee on Public Accounts is in a position to go into the matter and to express serious criticism, if necessary. Therefore this is not unlimited; it is under the supervision of the Select Committee on Public Accounts and the board concerned has to vote this amount in its estimates. Now it is being said here that this <span class="col_7995-7996" refersTo="page_1150"/>should be a reimbursive allowance. Sir, I want to put the following question to hon. members in all fairness. If the chairman of a board meets a number of producers at a certain place to explain certain things to them and he invites them to enjoy a drink with him, should he subsequently run after the barman and ask him to give him a certified receipt for the amount spent by him on cool drinks for those people? Surely it is <i>infra dig</i> to expect of these people to hand in &#x201C;chits&#x201D;, as they have been called, in support of a reimbursive allowance. To vote an entertainment allowance for their chairmen is a general practice. Throughout the years this has been the practice followed by all the boards. It has not been found illegal. There has merely been doubt whether specific provision should not be made for that, and this provision is intended to remove any such doubt.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to defend the hon. the Deputy Minister against the attack made on him by the hon. member for Odendaalsrus. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus says it is <i>infra dig,</i> beneath the dignity, of a person to have to apply to be reimbursed. But when I look at page 186 of the Estimates before us, I find under the Justice Vote an item for Deputy Minister, and under this there is a scale of salary and then there are allowances amounting to R3,740, with a footnote indicating that R2,000 is reimbursive and that R1,740 is a tax-free allowance in lieu of an official residence. In other words, the Prime Minister apparently does not trust the hon. the Deputy Minister, because when he gives him an allowance he makes it reimbursive. He places a limit on it, firstly, and then he makes it reimbursive. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus says that is <i>infra dig.</i> I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he thinks it is <i>infra dig</i> to be paid a R2,000 reimbursive allowance? Is it below his dignity? Does he feel, every time he has to claim this back, that this is some terrible burden placed upon him and that this is really lowering his dignity, or will he get up and repudiate the hon. member for Odendaalsrus and say that he does not regard it as <i>infra dig</i>?</p>

<p>I want to go further and say that if the hon. the Prime Minister does not trust his own Ministers and Deputy Ministers, and makes them account for their allowances, being reimbursive, does he then mean to say that the members of the hundreds of boards in South Africa are then more trustworthy than a Cabinet Minister or a Deputy Minister? Are Ministers and Deputy Ministers then to be trusted less than a member of the Rooibos Tea Board or the Banana Board or the Chicory Board, or any other board? Are those members who are appointed to these hundreds of boards all more honourable men than the Deputy Minister, whom, I take to be an honourable man who can be trusted and who does not regard it as <i>infra dig</i> to claim his allowance of R2,000? The hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs is looking so smug, but he has an allowance of R3,000, and the footnote to it says that it is reimbursive. It is not only the Deputy Minister; it is also the Ministers themselves. That argument is utter nonsense, and to say that a member of a board cannot afford first to pay and then to claim shows a complete lack of knowledge. Does the Minister never get an account sent to him for an entertainment? Does he have to count out R1 notes when he has a party? When he entertains people, does he pull out his bundle of R1 notes to pay for it and then reclaim? Of course he does not. Is there no such thing as an imprest account from which a person who has such an allowance can draw? There are half a dozen ways in which any businessman could run an allowance of this sort, but no businessman would make it an unlimited allowance with no ceiling. And despite what the hon. member for Odendaalsrus said about control by the Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee, in practice, of course, the question of an entertainment allowance for these hundreds of boards is not going to be studied by Parliament. It is not going to come before us. This proposal as it is, is going to make any board free, at its own whim, to give any of its members any allowance it likes.</p>

<p>The other point which the Deputy Minister made was that my proposal means that the R11 per day which was allowed would also have to be reimbursed. That is also incorrect. My amendment refers solely to the new amendment, which is an addition, stating &#x201C;and an allowance in respect of entertaining&#x201D;. My amendment substitutes &#x201C;and a reimbursive allowance&#x201D;. In other words, it does not affect the R11, and the Minister was completely wrong when he said that. This is absolutely reasonable. We are asking for no more than the limitations placed upon the Deputy Minister himself, and if he refuses this amendment we must seek some other reason than those he has given here, because the reasons given here are not valid reasons; and the only other reason I can think of is that the hon. the Minister is too proud to admit that we have come with a good suggestion. Because I do not believe that he wanted to cast any reflection to the members of the board, and neither do we. All we want is to regularize the situation, and if the Minister refuses the amendment it can only be because of his obstinacy.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister does refuse the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (Point), because I think that is as unlimited as in fact the existing clause in the Bill is. To allow anyone just to come along and reclaim what he spent, without placing any limit at all on what he spends, is a very dangerous thing indeed. I hope the Minister does not accept that amendment and rather accepts my amendment. It is reasonable. Why I differ from the hon. member for Durban (Point) is because I have a feminine imagination and what I see is a member of the Banana Board, shall we say, going overseas to Paris, to sell our bananas, and he just goes mad. I mean, he is suddenly swept up in a round of entertainment and <span class="col_7997-7998" refersTo="page_1151"/>gaiety and he spends thousands and thousands of francs, and then he comes back. The point is that he is out of the usual verkrampte environment in South Africa and he suddenly finds himself indulging in a Continental splurge, and this can be very expensive to the taxpayer. Under this clause he can reclaim for expenses. It does not even say that it must be reasonable expenses. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I do not know how many Members of Parliament are chairmen of boards, but I should think there are quite a number of them, and I do not know that these hon. members, when they get out of the House, have the same sort of sober and circumspect attitude outside the House that they display inside the House, and I am worried. Sir, I am a housewife and I have to budget and it is just as well to know how much one is allowed to spend. [Interjections.] Yes, I have to budget, and sometimes I am even in the red! I think it is very bad to give all these members of boards free for all at the expense of the taxpayers, and I do not like the suggestion of the hon. member for Durban (Point) one bit because of this. I also see a sort of competitive spirit springing up between, say, the chairman of the Banana Board and the chairman of the Chicory Board. The one goes overseas and learns when he gets there that his colleague has had an enormous party at the Ritz and he reckons it is <i>infra dig</i> for the Chicory Board if it does not do the same sort of thing, so he has a party at the Savoy, and these parties come out very expensive indeed. I think we should be very careful and very wary indeed of the suggestion of the hon. member for Durban (Point). Instead, the Minister should accept the amendment I have moved.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister was about to reply to the remark made by the hon. member for Durban (Point) about allowances made to Deputy Minister, namely reimbursive allowances. We want to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister why he must receive reimbursive allowances and yet the chairman or representatives of other bodies do not have to ask for reimbursive allowances. What is the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s objection to having a reimbursive allowance for the members of the different boards, where Deputy Ministers themselves can get reimbursive allowances?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot express my gratitude to the hon. member by accepting her amendment, because I find it equally impractical. What is unreasonable to one man, may be very reasonable to another, and this is not a good criterion. For this reason I cannot accept that hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<p>I do not want to elaborate on this matter any further. If hon. members opposite want to quarrel about this allowance which the chairmen of boards receive, I think they should take up the matter with the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. It is at their request that this clause is being inserted so that they may also receive an entertainment allowance. I am of the opinion that this is quite in order.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of reimbursable allowances. I do not know what the hon. member means by that. If by &#x201C;reimbursable&#x201D; the hon. member means only the money which they actually spend, he is actually making a mistake, because that is not the meaning of &#x201C;reimbursable&#x201D; which the hon. member quoted, i.e. in respect of allowances to Deputy Ministers. It actually means tax free, in other words, a lump sum which is tax free. In this case it is also a lump sum. I want to tell the hon. member at once that it is not the hon. the Prime Minister who is treating us like this, but that it is as a result of the Opposition that we are being treated like this.</p>

<p>No. This reimbursable allowance is a lump sum and I do not have to prove that I spent that amount. That is not the intention at all. It only means that it is not taxable.

Hon. members opposite know very well that it would be impractical for them to account for all their expenditure <span class="col_7999-8000" refersTo="page_1152"/>in connection with these allowances.

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I still find it difficult to agree with the remarks made here by the hon. the Deputy Minister. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus also claimed here that an entertainment allowance is being granted to the chairmen of virtually all the boards. I challenge the hon. member to show me where any of the chairmen of the 22 control boards is receiving more than R500 as an entertainment and representative&#x2019;s allowance. This only relates to entertainment in South Africa. The intention of the amendment is that if a person must entertain on a large scale at any place, an allowance must be made available to him to meet those entertainment costs. In other words, if such a person goes to Europe and wants to entertain 25 or 50 businessmen, and the members of their families, and the costs amount to between R500 and R600, does the hon. the Deputy Minister want to claim that that person must not submit an invoice of the costs of that entertainment, as befits any businessman? Some of these persons have to go overseas as frequently as six times a year in order to represent their boards, or whatever. They must receive an entertainment allowance which would enable them to entertain on three or four occasions during each visit.</p>

<p>Do hon. members realize that this entertainment allowance can amount to thousands of rands? If such a person is not compensated for what he spends, he must pay for it out of his own pocket. If one wants to keep a complete record of this expenditure, one cannot do otherwise than to have these people declare that, for example, they gave a cocktail party at the Savoy Hotel or Claridges, and that a certain number of guests were present, and then have them submit the account for it. This is surely how the Controller and Auditor-General and this House ask that the taxpayers&#x2019; money be accounted for. However, the hon. the Deputy Minister says that a person need not furnish a statement of the expenditure, since the amount is untaxable. I would like to see methods, other than those which the hon. the Deputy Minister has designed, which are more conducive to abuse. The persons who do not want to abuse this eventually also fall under suspicion. The entertainment allowance of a person who must do a lot of travelling, and must travel abroad a great deal, does not amount to hundreds of rands, but probably thousands. Such a person comes under suspicion, whereas this should never happen. For his protection, for the protection of this House and for the services which the Controller and Auditor-General must furnish, it is better for that invoice to be submitted, no matter how this is paid, or with what funds the payment is made. I agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister that a man does not carry sufficient money in travellers&#x2019; cheques on his person so that he can simply, on any occasion, settle an account of, for example, up to R500. Even a small reception abroad easily costs this much. I would like to see the man who goes from here to America and entertains 70 people there. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister knows what it would cost him?</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Most certainly. Even if I were in a position to have spent thousands of rands there, I was still always subject to the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s audit. This also applies to the present chairman of the Board, and, as far as I know, it ought to and does apply to the chairmen of all other boards. When they entertain on a large scale, and they must surely do so, it is not expected of them to cover the costs from an entertainment allowance of R500 per year. The hon. the Deputy Minister ought not to place chairmen and board members in the position in which they come under suspicion because they are not called upon to account for the funds which are made available to them.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I raised this matter with the hon. the Deputy Minister with particular reference to the second portion of this clause, namely the retrospective effect of the provision which is now being introduced. I do not think the hon. the Deputy Minister has put the Committee in a position to be able to judge whether or not this retrospective provision should be adopted. He has not told us to what extent members, possibly of this House or of other councils, are involved in having allowances which are now being queried as to whether or not they should be allowances not regarded as profit in the service of the State. Perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister can be more explicit as to why this retrospective provision is required.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the main aspect of this particular clause, namely that an allowance in respect of entertaining in connection with such services should not be regarded as payment in respect of an office of profit for the purposes of disqualification. I think the discussion which we have had has raised several important points. The first one is that the nomenclature of a &#x201C;reimbursive allowance&#x201D; is perhaps a little inaccurate, in so far as the allowances payable to the hon. the Deputy Minister and others are concerned. The hon. the Deputy Minister says this is reimbursive but the disbursement does not in fact have to exist.</p>

<from><span class="col_8001-8002" refersTo="page_1153"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It was referred to in the Budget as a reimbursive allowance. I assume that the hon. the Minister with his usual hospitality has expended all that money. I do not question that that is so. What we have asked in the amendments that have been proposed, is that when it comes to persons holding office on the various boards&#x2014;and we know they are innumerable in number&#x2014;the allowances should first of all be reasonable. This is the suggestion of the hon. member for Houghton. Secondly, the disbursement should be a reimbursive one. In other words, the profit aspect should be removed and no holder of a position on one of these boards should have a surplus at the end of a financial year in respect of the allowance that was paid for entertainment over the amount that was in fact expended. The hon. the Deputy Minister has shown a reluctance to accept the word &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D;. He has also shown a reluctance to accept the word &#x201C;reimbursive&#x201D; on its own. I want to suggest to him that it would be a wise thing to do to combine both of these and that the wording of this particular clause should not be &#x201C;an allowance&#x201D; but &#x201C;a reasonable reimbursive allowance&#x201D;. In other words, one has the two tests. The one is that the amount is reasonable and, secondly, that it is reimbursive. I therefore move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

They have seen the comments of the Controller and Auditor-General in this respect. I would suggest that it is only reasonable that where money is to be defrayed from public funds and where the Controller and Auditor-General is responsible for certifying that those funds have been properly spent and where the Select Committee has the opportunity to examine those accounts, as reported in the report of the Auditor-General, such an amendment should be inserted to make this allowance reimbursive, and reimbursive only on adequate proof of expenditure.

I want to know more about the retrospective effect of these allowances. Does it mean that money that was expended in 1961 will now be refunded? Is that the meaning of this? If that is the meaning, then surely it should have happened from year to year and should have been approved or reported upon by the Controller and Auditor-General? If this means for the future only, i.e. from the date this Bill becomes law, I can understand it. If it means only that the debt is being charged to 1969 and that we are not concerned with any money that had been spent from 1961 to 1969, then that narrows the application and I can then support the amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am just getting up out of courtesy towards the hon. member who has just spoken. I think other hon. members are repeating themselves and prolonging this debate unnecessarily. In connection with this aspect of retrospectivity there is a measure of uncertainty. Let us first clarify this. There is a measure of uncertainty about whether the boards are entitled to vote entertainment allowances for their chairmen. Over the years an amount has always been placed on their estimates and they therefore voted an amount for entertainment allowances for their chairmen. Now, there are a few members of Parliament who are chairmen of such boards. However, there is no objection in respect of all the other chairmen for whom this is being done. It so happens that this affects another provision which states that if a person is remunerated by the State he cannot serve as a member of Parliament. Now there is uncertainty about the amount which was voted over the years, and there is also uncertainty about the position of members of this House who have acted as chairmen and received allowances. For that reason it is being made retrospective, so that they can continue with their practice. This is all the clause means and nothing more. All this other talk about &#x201C;reimbursive&#x201D; and &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D;, etc., is quite unnecessary. I can assure you of this. The Auditor-General examines those accounts very thoroughly and reports on them are submitted to this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, after listening to the hon. member for Green Point, I should like with the permission of the House to withdraw my amendments in favour of the amendment moved by the hon. member for <span class="col_8003-8004" refersTo="page_1154"/>Green Point. I think his amendment is a suitable compromise which meets both the amendments by myself and by the hon. member for Houghton. My amendment therefore becomes unnecessary. I would therefore not like to follow it up but to come back to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s latest statement. I wish to draw his attention to the Payment of Members of Parliament Act as published in the Standing Orders of the House of Assembly, on page 299. Here specifically, by an Act of Parliament, provision is made for allowances. Those allowances specifically exclude Ministers and Deputy Ministers in regard to this provision. It deals only with members of the Assembly other than Ministers and Deputy Ministers. Ministers and Deputy Ministers are provided with allowances on the Estimates which appear every year before this House and from which I quoted earlier in this debate. In section 2 (3) of this Act specific provision is made in regard to the allowance of members of Parliament, not as being reimbursive, but in terms of a statute of this House which deems such allowances to have been received by the person concerned from employment in the Public Service. I quote subsection (3) of section 2. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The amount of any allowance paid in terms of subsection (1) shall for the purpose of any law be deemed to have been received by the person concerned from employment in the public service and to represent a payment made to meet expenditure incurred by him in connection with the discharge of his official duties.</block>

<p>In other words, not by implication or by interpretation, but by specific statute of this House the allowance received by a member of Parliament is deemed to be an allowance received from employment in the Public Service. Here we are debating a provision of the General Law Amendment Bill which specifically and directly aims at creating the exact opposite situation. Its aim is that a person appointed to a board may be paid an allowance which the hon. Deputy Minister has equated to the allowances of a member of Parliament but which is deemed to be not regarded as employment or remuneration in the public service. Every one of us is specifically regarded by law as receiving remuneration from the State. Membership of this House is in other words an office of profit under the State which is specifically excluded by Statute. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister tries to equate the two positions. They are not synonymous; they are not equal in any sense. Here Parliament in its wisdom has seen fit to deem us to be holding an office of profit. The hon. the Minister wants other persons in the hundreds of boards which this Government controls at its gift, as part of the perks of government &#x2026;</p>

<p>But I am suggesting that an unlimited allowance for entertainment makes it an office of profit. I am not trying to equate this with crayfish concessions, diamond concessions or any other privileges. This is a specific issue. I would not suggest that a crayfish concession should be an office of profit. It may be an offer of profit but not an office of profit. Therefore, when we look at this clause, we find that members of boards are being privileged above Members of Parliament. The very sound and reasonable rule which applies to Members of Parliament is being negated. When it comes to the granting of office to members of boards, to friends of the Government, who receive R11 per day, plus the payment of expenses and then in addition, as is now proposed, an unlimited expense account, it is not an office of profit.</p>

<p>In other words, the members themselves decide what they shall be paid. According to the Government&#x2019;s own policy, these are Nationalist Party supporters, and they determine what they shall pay themselves as an allowance. They do not determine what they shall pay themselves as members of the board. That is laid down by Statute. Sitting as a board, they are entitled to decide themselves what additional perks they shall give themselves. As a board they can decide that they are people who because of their status should entertain heavily. They themselves take this decision, nobody else does. They themselves can decide that they are sociable types and therefore they are going to have lots of entertainment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Committee is grateful to the hon. the Deputy Minister because I think he has shown us a mistake we have all been making, including the Government, in regard to the meaning of words. The Deputy Minister used the word &#x201C;reimbursable&#x201D;. Of course the hon. the Minister is right; the word should be &#x201C;reimbursable&#x201D;, because there is no such word in the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> as the word &#x201C;reimbursive&#x201D; although it appears in our Estimates. I am also grateful that the hon. the Deputy Minister apparently attributed a meaning to a word which does not exist in the <i>Oxford Dictionary.</i> The meaning he attributed to the word is that if one is given a reimbursive allowance, one can receive the allowance without having to prove that one has spent that money. Sir, I wish these hon. Whips will talk somewhere else. The hon. Whip is standing in my way and I cannot see the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>No. Sir. I am indebted to the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Transkei for having put me onto the correct terminology so far as my amendment is concerned. I think we are agreed and I am sure the hon. members opposite are agreed that so far as this allowance is concerned, it should be a reimbursement of expenditure. It should not be an open allowance to the officials whether they be members or chairmen of councils, committees, boards or similar bodies. For that reason I feel that we have now reached the position where I am sure there is an agreement between both sides of the House, between the hon. the Deputy Minister and ourselves, because it does not mean and was never intended to mean that a member of this board should receive an allowance for entertainment which is not to be expended on entertainment. I am sure that that was never intended. The amendment which has now been moved states that it should be a reasonable reimbursable allowance, in other words, to reimburse what has reasonably been spent. I do not for one moment suggest that the flights of fancy of the hon. member for Houghton about Paris entertainments and the selling of bananas is quite what is contemplated. Now that we have reached an agreement of approach to this problem I would with the permission of the House, like to withdraw my amendment in favour of the amendment by the hon. member for Transkei.</p>

Is the hon. the Deputy Minister then considering accepting the amendment of the hon. member for Transkei? If not, we on this side of the House must assume that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not been convinced. If that is so, perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell us after he has consulted with his officials exactly what he means by this amendment? Mr. Chairman, it is a little difficult to get through to the hon. the Deputy Minister. Having consulted with his officials, we now have an interruption from another Government Whip moving between the Chair and the Deputy Minister. Now that the Whip has moved away I am prepared to carry on.</p>

<p>I think it is time the Deputy Minister told us precisely what he has in mind with this new subparagraph (vi) which makes provision for an allowance in respect of entertainment The longer this is going on. the more suspicious it is becoming.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my remarks. If the hon. the Deputy Minister will listen I should like to put a serious matter to him. His attention has been drawn to the fact that subsection (2) of this clause is retrospective to 1961. He has not given a satisfactory explanation to this House as to why that should be the case. Who are the people whose entertainment expenses are intended to be reimbursed retrospectively right back to 1961? That is the first thing this House is entitled to know. Who are the people concerned? The second thing this House is entitled to know before it should be expected to pass this subsection, is how much money is involved. What is the extent of the entertainment expenses which have been incurred retrospectively right back to 1961? This covers a period of eight years. Knowing how some of the Cabinet Ministers here can spend money when they are overseas, the amount of entertainment expenses incurred over a period of eight years by officials, who will now be covered by this amendment, could amount to a very large sum of money indeed. We have had no indication from the hon. the Deputy Minister as to how much money is involved here.</p>

<p>Clause 21:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir we have dealt with certain aspects of the Extradition Act in clause 16 which has already been approved by this Committee and which provides in essence that a person who has been convicted of an offence in South Africa and who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, may be extradited to a foreign country to face some charge in that country; he would then serve his sentence in the other country, would return to the Republic and would then continue to serve the remainder of the sentence in the Republic. That is what we have agreed to under clause 16 of this particular Bill. Sir, this particular clause deals with the time at which the surrender of a convicted person should take place. Under the Extradition Act section 14, it is provided at present that no order by the Minister under section 11 shall be executed&#x2014;I refer to subsection (d) of section 14&#x2014;&#x201C;in the case of a person charged or convicted of an offence in the Republic until the charge has been disposed of and any sentence which may have been imposed in respect of such offence has been executed&#x201D;. The problem which arises with this clause is that clause 16 of the Bill, of which the Committee has approved, amends the Prisons Act. In other words, it is purely an administrative power which is given to the Commissioner of Prisons. This amendment now deletes the compulsory aspect, i.e. that no extradition shall take place until the sentence has been served. I think I am correct in saying that. Sir, what is worrying me at the moment is this, and perhaps the Deputy Minister will be good enough to elaborate on this: There are circumstances at the present time under which one can understand that in order to preserve evidence it is desirable that the second trial in a foreign country should take place as soon as possible; in other words, that a person who has been sentenced to a long term of imprisonment in South Africa shall not be held for the full term of imprisonment before being submitted to the jurisdiction of a foreign country. But I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether this is a reciprocal arrangement with the countries with which we have extradition treaties, because it may well be that we would desire the same opportunity of bringing to justice a fugitive from South Africa, so that he can stand trial while the evidence is still readily available in this country. I raise this with the hon. the Deputy Minister so as to be assured that this is a provision which will be applied and administered in terms of clause 16 of the Bill when there is a reciprocal arrangement with the foreign country.</p>

<p>The hon. member is quite correct in his interpretation. According to our law we could not extradite a person until he had served his sentence here. We could only extradite him after that.

<p>That is why we are now repealing that section. This is a very satisfactory arrangement because, as the hon. member knows, the danger always exists that evidence and documentary evidence may be lost while the person concerned is serving his long term of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 23:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to object to subparagraph (iv), because it means that anybody who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the Suppression of Communism Act or the Terrorist Act shall be disfranchised for life unless the period of imprisonment has been wholly suspended. The hon. the Minister of the Interior was kind enough to clear up the ambiguity which I believe exists in the existing clause of this Bill and a previous clause of the same nature which we have already debated. [Interjection.] No, I was not the only one. It is not clearly put at all; in fact, I would say that the clause is very badly worded altogether because the word &#x201C;suspension&#x201D; is tautology; it is not necessary, because if it is wholly suspended, then it is wholly suspended. But in any case, the hon. the Minister has cleared up the ambiguity, and I accept that the hon. member for Durban (Point) was correct when he said that a person whose sentence has been wholly suspended&#x2014;and this is an important point&#x2014; does not have to be disfranchised. On the other hand when I gave an example of a minor infringement under the Suppression of Communism Act, like failure to report at a police station, and pointed out that the usual sentence, although not mandatory, is a year&#x2019;s imprisonment, all of which is suspended except for four days, the hon. member for Durban (Point) thought that such a person also was not to be disfranchised. I was no more wrong than he was.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, that is what my Hansard shows. However, I will accept that I misinterpreted that. I might say that this makes no difference to the principle that I am discussing: it does not make the slightest difference. The point is that a person who has been sentenced for any minor infringement of the Suppression of Communism Act, such as failure to report at a police station, being in possession of any article which links him to a banned organization, or quoting any banned or listed person, is liable to be sent to prison without the option of a fine, and unless the entire sentence is suspended, such a person, when he comes out of gaol, remains disfranchised for life.</p>

<p>This means that persons who have committed the crimes that I have mentioned&#x2014;they are crimes punishable in terms of the Act in the way that I have set out here&#x2014;are put on the same basis as a person who has been convicted of murder or of treason, They are placed in a worse position than a person who has been sent to gaol for the crime of robbery, rape or murder with extenuating circumstances, or culpable homicide or any crime of violence. They are put in a worse position than the people in the categories I have mentioned because when these people come out of gaol, having served their sentence, whether a portion of the sentence was remitted or not, they are immediately reinstated on the voters&#x2019; roll. Under the Bill it is no longer necessary for a person to wait an additional three years after serving his sentence. That is the position in respect of ordinary criminals, but in the case of people who have fallen foul of the Suppression of Communism Act or the Terrorism Act, even if the court have sentenced them to a few months in gaol or to a week in gaol or a day in gaol, they have served a sentence of imprisonment, and when they come out of gaol they are for ever deprived of the normal right of a citizen, which is the franchise right. I think this is an extreme form of punishment. Sir, it shows an extraordinary attitude in this country when one is prepared, as the discussion in the Select Committee showed, to be much more generous to criminals who have committed really serious crimes than to persons who happen to have fallen foul of the anti-Communist Act or the Terrorism Act.</p>

<p>Is this not serious?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>They might have been sentenced to one day&#x2019;s imprisonment and it need not therefore be serious at all. Sir, I want to point out that the anti-Communist Act is extremely wide and far-reaching. I want to point out that the very people I have mentioned, the people who fail to report at the police station, may be persons who are banned or listed because in the opinion of the Minister they were advancing the aims of Communism. A person may be listed or banned before he has ever appeared before the court. I cannot by any stretch of imagination see why this has to be so. I notice that this House, long ago, was much more lenient towards people who had been convicted of treason. The El&#x00E9;ctoral Laws were amended in order to permit persons who had been convicted of treason before 1950 to exercise the vote. We were prepared to be forgiving in that case.</p>

<p>We are prepared to give ordinary criminals, who have committed crimes of violence, the right to vote, but we are not prepared to restore the vote to persons who have fallen foul of these two particular Acts, the Suppression of Communism Act and the Terrorism Act, because these carry special connotations in South Africa. Everybody has now seized on these things and is frightened to tackle them because they have a special <span class="col_8015-8016" refersTo="page_1160"/>significance far beyond ordinary crimes of violence, and far beyond even the crime of treason before 1950. I can find no justification for this at all and therefore I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subparagraph (iv) of the proposed paragraph (a).</block>

<p>I want to point out that I am hoping very much here that I will get the support of the official Opposition. They have adopted a very tough line on other clauses of this Bill. They have taken a very strong line on clause 10, and I have no doubt that they will take a very strong line on clause 29, judging from their Second Reading speeches.</p>

<p>They approved of that clause in the Electoral Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That may be so, but now they have a chance to redeem themselves and disapprove of it here. I admit I made a mistake in interpreting the suspended sentence although it was not such a serious mistake, because one day in gaol is enough to bring the same penalties. But I think the hon. members should also admit that they have made a mistake in allowing that clause to go through in the Electoral Act as far as white persons are concerned. I do not know how many such white persons there are.</p>

<p>I can think of only one at the moment, and that is Helen Joseph, who I know was never convicted in a court of law and was never even listed as a communist, but in fact she is banned. In terms of that Act she is restricted and therefore that person, having on one occasion failed to report to a police station&#x2014;she has to report daily&#x2014;will lose her vote as the result of the earlier clause. I do not know how many Coloured people fall under this restriction and have failed to report and have never appeared in court other than for that one crime of failing to report at a police station. Now the hon. member for Durban (Point) is a fair-minded man. We disagree on many things. He is a &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; and I am a &#x201C;verligte&#x201D;. [Interjection.] Maybe he is a &#x201C;verkrimpte&#x201D;, the hon. member for Yeoville is a &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; and I am a &#x201C;verligte&#x201D;.</p>

The point is that this is a stringent provision and it is most unfair. It penalizes people. It draws into the net of disfranchisement people who by no stretch of the imagination should be punished for life by making them lose their voting rights if they have gone to gaol for one day under this Act and the other one, but particularly under the Suppression of Communism Act, because it excludes the courts altogether. I think the hon. member must admit that he has made a mistake.</p>

<p>Clause 29:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This is the worst clause in the whole Bill. [Interjections.] Did I hear someone say something? I hope that some of the hon. members on that side, especially the lawyers over there, will take part in the debate on this clause. This is the clause which the Deputy Minister and hon. members opposite have said is designed merely to consolidate all the various laws there may be relating to privilege in court. If you look at the <span class="col_8017-8018" refersTo="page_1161"/>rubric you will see that it says &#x201C;privilege arising out of the interests of the State or public security&#x201D;. If there ever was a more misleading rubric to any clause of any Bill we have ever had here, I think this is it. All the cases that have been quoted, and all the authorities that have been relied upon, have all dealt with <b>secrets</b> and matters relating to State documents which in the nature of things and under the common law in any event have a privilege. It is provided here that the Prime Minister or his delegate, or any Minister, may issue a certificate which will provide that someone will not be permitted or ordered to give evidence in court. That is in the first instance, in court, but also in other places. It says: &#x201C;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law or the common law contained, no person shall be compellable and no person shall be permitted or ordered to give evidence,&#x201D; and the accent is on the words &#x201C;no person&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Just quote one of the provisions of the common law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>What this says makes any provision of the common law or of the statute law irrelevant. Why do you want it quoted? It says notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or the common law. In other words, let us start here <i>ab initio.</i> We have no other laws. We just have this clause. That is what it means. So all the other laws are in fact irrelevant. It says that notwithstanding the provisions of any law or the common law, no person shall be compellable and no person shall be permitted or ordered to give evidence or to furnish any information in any proceedings in any court of law, if a certificate purporting to have been signed by the Prime Minister or any person authorized thereto by him, or purporting to have been signed by any other Minister is produced to the court of law to the effect that the said fact, matter, thing, communication, book or document affects the interests of the State or public security. Subsection (2) says that this shall only apply in respect of matters which affect the interest of the State or public security, two different things. Now how do you determine whether the matter affects the interests of the State? The court will be obliged to rely not upon the evidence or the facts of the matter, but upon the certificate of the Minister that it affects the interests of the State and that it affects public security. This is framed in such a way that it can, and does in fact at the moment, give the Minister the power to produce a certificate in a case involving something which the Minister considers to affect the interests of the State or of public security, and to prevent by this certificate an accused person giving evidence in his own defence. That is what it says. It is no good saying that is not what is intended, or that is not what is meant. That is what this clause says. It gives this power to any Minister and we here, assembled in this place as the people&#x2019;s representatives&#x2014;and I address myself particularly to my hon. friends opposite&#x2014; whose main function is to come here and to protect those people whom we represent against intrusions on their liberties and their rights by the Executive &#x2026;</p>

<p>It may be farfetched, but he concedes that it is a possibility, and surely that is enough for us in this House. If it is a possibility, we are not going to give those powers to any Minister, in the interest of the people we represent in this House and in the interest of our own image in this world. I want to say that the Government has done an awful lot to spoil our image. If there is one thing which has helped to keep our image good&#x2014;and hon. members like the hon. member for Prinshof who have been overseas will bear me out here&#x2014;and which has rescued us from some of the accusations made against us, it is the system of law that we have and the standards of justice we have and the calibre of the judges we have. It is very significant that the Deputy Minister has now conceded that it is a possibility that an accused person could be prevented from giving evidence on his own behalf in a court, although he says it is a far-fetched possibility.</p>

<p>We should not legislate for hypothetical cases, but the Minister has conceded that it is a possibility. Let me develop this a little further. This is also a possibility. If you are a plaintiff in a matter which might affect the interests of the State or public security, as for example if you are taken in by the Security Police and questioned and assaulted and you have your leg broken, you would be allowed to bring an action, but you could only found your action on evidence. As plaintiff in that action, you would have to go into court and give evidence of the facts upon which you base your claim. In terms of this clause, if the Minister thought it was a matter affecting the interests of the State or a matter of public security, and presumably he would if the Security Police was involved, it is a possibility that he would issue a certificate preventing that person from giving evidence about the facts on which his claim is based.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I abide by your ruling. I want, however, to say that the hon. the Deputy Minister has clearly said in answer to my question that it is permissible in terms of the law as it is to-day for an accused person to be prevented by the Prime Minister or a Minister of this Government from giving evidence in his own defence in a criminal case or giving evidence in his own interests in a civil case. He has said that that is possible in terms of the law as it is to-day and I challenge the hon. the Deputy Minister to refer this House to the provision <span class="col_8021-8022" refersTo="page_1163"/>of the law which makes that permissible and possible. I challenge him to do so. I should like to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that in terms of the amendment that he is introducing by means of clause 29, this is not only possible or hypothetical, but factual, if the words of this clause are to be given any meaning whatsoever. The significant words are&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law or the common law contained, no person shall be permitted &#x2026; to furnish any information in any proceedings in any court of law or before any body or institution established &#x2026; if a certificate purporting to have been signed by the Prime Minister &#x2026; to the effect that the said fact, matter, thing, communication, book or document affects the interests of the State or public security,</block>

<p>has been furnished. We had a long debate with the hon. the Deputy Minister this morning in regard to the difference between what affects the security of the State on the one hand, and what affects the interests of the State on the other hand. We pointed out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that almost anything affects the interests of the State, even though it may have nothing to do with security. This is how far this section goes and in the very words of this section &#x201C;no person shall be permitted &#x2026; to give evidence&#x201D; in these cases, if there is a certificate from the Prime Minister or another Minister of State. We would like to hear from the hon. the Minister, firstly, in terms of what legal provision, either common law or statutory law, this is possible under the law as it exists to-day, and, secondly, how he can say that these words I have read out from clause 29, being the proposed amendment contained in this Bill, merely introduce a hypothetical situation when in fact the words are so clear. This is a clause which we cannot possibly accept. To try to justify this clause, as the hon. the Deputy Minister did in the Second Reading debate, by saying that it goes no further than the existing law, is just not correct. As a Deputy Minister of Justice, he must know that it is not correct. It goes much further than the law as it stands to-day. In fact, all I need do is refer to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s own references from legal text books and cases which show the limits in the law as it exists to-day and the extent to which clause 29 goes.

If the hon. member knows anything about this Criminal Procedure Act section 228 of this Act, the heading &#x201C;Privileges of Accused when giving Evidence&#x201D; must at some time or other have caught his eye. Hon. members should remember that when an accused person goes to the witness-box, he ceases to be an accused person and is merely a witness in that case.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. Deputy Minister a question?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member can ask his questions presently when it is his turn to speak again. The privileges of an accused person when giving evidence in his own case, are clearly defined in this section. However, I should like to read section 233 of this same Act to the hon. member. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No witness shall &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member must bear in mind now that, for the purposes of this section, the accused is the witness. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; except as in this Act is provided, be compellable or permitted &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here is the word &#x201C;permitted&#x201D; to which the hon. member took such great exception. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to give evidence in any criminal proceedings as to any fact, matter or thing, or as to any communication made to or by such witness as to which such witness would be on the 30th day of May, 1961, not have been compellable or permitted to give evidence, by reason that such fact, matter or thing, or communication, on grounds of public policy and from regard to public interest, ought not to be disclosed and is privileged from disclosure.</block>

<p>Therefore, even when an accused gives evidence in a case which is privileged and in the public interest, he is debarred, under this section, from giving such evidence. As a so-called advocate that hon. member ought to know this. I want to go further. The hon. member said that it never existed in the existing law. I want to show him now that it most definitely did exist. I want to refer the hon. member now to the book called &#x201C;South African Law of Evidence&#x201D; by Hoffman. The following is said on page 266, which is also why I said it was a &#x201C;hypothetical case&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no English or South African case in which a Minister has claimed the right to withhold an item of evidence essential to the defence in a criminal trial, but presumably <span class="col_8023-8024" refersTo="page_1164"/>if he were to do so the court would not consider itself bound by his decision.</block>

<p>I shall now tell hon. members why. I want to mention a case <i>Rex versus Schniders</i> of 1944. It is not a South African, but an English case. This case is discussed on page 265 of Hoffman&#x2019;s book. It says the following there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Presumably, if the objection was upheld &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is to say if the court felt itself bound by this section&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the accused will have to be acquitted since the Court could not say beyond reasonable doubt that the missing evidence might not have established his innocence.</block>

<p>Does this satisfy the hon. gentlemen? This is the existing law I have just quoted to hon. members. I suppose hon. members were not aware of this and since they know it now, I hope they will cease these unnecessary objections, because they have no grounds for them. What is the meaning of all this? In the first place, when an accused goes to the witness-box he is, according to our Criminal Procedure Act, not allowed to give evidence as a witness in the same way as any other witness who is privileged. This provision already exists in existing law. According to Hoffman, there is not one single English or South African case, where this has occurred. But if this hypothetical case does in fact occur, it will imply, if the court rules that that evidence cannot be used, in other words, if it upholds the Minister&#x2019;s certificate, that the accused should be acquitted because the court cannot declare beyond a reasonable doubt that that evidence which was not given, could not have been to his advantage. Is this clear to hon. members now? What is the danger of having such a witness now? And why so many objections from hon. members? If hon. members had taken the trouble to make a study of the legal aspect of this point, we would not have had this quarrel. I want to ask hon. members on the other side to have another look at it.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has proved our very point for us in his quotation from Hoffman. He is trying to tell us that this clause 29 goes no further than the existing position and he reads out from Hoffman to the effect that in terms of the Common Law as it exists to-day there is no English or South African case in which a certificate of a Minister has been given to prevent an accused from giving evidence in his own defence. He then went on to say that if such a certificate were to be given in terms of the law as it exists to-day, the Common Law, the court would not regard itself as being bound by it. This is the very point. The court, in terms of the law as it exists to-day, could not regard itself as being bound by a certificate from a Minister which prevents an accused person giving evidence in his own defence. This is exactly what we are saying. The Common Law as it exists to-day is quite different. But in terms of clause 29, as the hon. the Deputy Minister proposes to amend it, it is specifically provided, in very clear terms, that no person shall be permitted to give evidence if a certificate is produced in the terms which are set out in the clause. This is the first point I make, in other words, that the hon. the Deputy Minister has proved the very point which I mentioned, namely that the laws that exist to-day are not such that the courts would accept a certificate from a Minister prohibiting an accused from giving evidence in his own defence even in these circumstances.</p>

<p>The second matter that I want to point out is that the section in the Criminal Procedure Act, to which the hon. the Deputy Minister has referred, namely section 228, deals specifically with the privileges of an accused when giving evidence. The section concerned likewise deals with privileges. But this goes a great deal further than that. It enables a Minister of State, including the Prime Minister, or anybody designated by him, to prevent a person from giving evidence in his own defence. I again reiterate that the very quotation which the hon. the Deputy Minister has given us from Hoffman, supports my contention. It states quite clearly that under the law as it exists to-day a court would not regard itself as being bound by such a certificate, if one were to be submitted, whereas clause 29 compels the court to accept such a certificate. It is perfectly clear that this clause goes a great deal further than the law as it exists to-day. Until such time as the hon. the Deputy Minister is able to meet the challenge from this side of the House, we cannot possibly accept the clause in these wide terms.</p>

<p>While I am up I want to deal with other aspects of this clause which are referred to in the amendment which I have already moved but with which I have not dealt specifically. I want to draw the attention of this House to the fact that in terms of clause 29 the certificate which is envisaged may be signed by the Prime Minister or any person authorized thereto by him. The clause also refers to any certificate purporting to have been signed by any other Minister. In a case of this sort, which goes as far as this, in the sense that it deals with any matter which affects the interests of the State, it is our intention that no Minister other than the Prime Minister or the Minister appointed to administer the Bureau for State Security, should have the right to issue such a certificate. We are against this clause for the reasons that we have mentioned. If despite our objections, the Government with its majority insists on going ahead and passing this clause, then we think it ought at least to modify the implications of this clause by limiting the right to issue the certificate to the Prime Minister himself or to the Minister appointed to administer the Bureau <span class="col_8025-8026" refersTo="page_1165"/>for State Security. It is quite unreasonable that such far reaching powers should be given to any person authorized by the Prime Minister or to any other Minister. I know that the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell the House that the Prime Minister in authorizing someone to do this will authorize a responsible person. This is not the point. The point is that it is the Prime Minister himself who ought to bring his mind to bear on whether or not a certificate which has such far reaching effects in terms of clause 29 should or should not be issued. It is only the Prime Minister or the Minister who administers the Bureau for State Security who can have all the facts relating to the interests of the State and the State security at his command. If this Government insists on going ahead with this clause, then at least they should limit the right to issue a certificate to one or other of these two persons. It is quite unreasonable to extend it to any other Minister because other Ministers do not have at their fingertips all the implications of State security and interests of the State which we presume the hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister administering the Bureau for State Security will have. This is the reason why I have moved the deletion of the words &#x201C;or any person authorized thereto by him&#x201D; in line 3 and &#x201C;any other Minister&#x201D; in line 4 and to substitute &#x201C;the Minister appointed to administer the Bureau for State Security&#x201D;. I have also moved the omission of the words &#x201C;affects the interests of the State&#x201D;. We debated this at length this morning and I do not wish to go into a long explanation on it. We made our position quite clear, namely that the words &#x201C;interests of the State&#x201D; and &#x201C;security of the State&#x201D;, are not synonymous by any means. In fact the hon. the Deputy Minister and members on the Government side used the two words to mean entirely different things. One can therefore accept that even they do not regard the two words as synonymous. If the Government insists on passing this clause and giving these Ministers these far reaching powers, at least it ought to be limited to cases which involve public security. It should not under any circumstances be extended to include matters which affect the interests of the State, which can be terribly wide. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Quite apart from the fact that there has been an absence of debate, I think this hon. Deputy Minister said in this debate to-day one of the most disgraceful things that I have ever heard said by any one who represents the Minister of Justice. I think that with this statement he will do us more harm overseas and in this country and will do our selfrespect more harm than anything else could possibly do. He said in terms of the law as it exists to-day, this great system of law we have, it is possible for an accused or a plaintiff to be prevented from giving evidence by a certificate from the Minister, on his own behalf, and the person can be prevented from giving evidence to produce the facts on which his case is based. What absolute arrant nonsense! My hon. friend from Musgrave has dealt with that and I think he has sufficiently demolished this point. However, there are some aspects I should also like to deal with. He mentioned sections 228 and 233 <span class="col_8027-8028" refersTo="page_1166"/>of the Criminal Procedure Act. All of this comes under the heading of &#x201C;privileges of witnesses&#x201D;. The accused is dealt with differently. The Act deals with a witness and with an accused. The accused person is dealt with in a separate section. He is there dealt with on the basis that he has certain privileges. Section 228 deals with the privileges of the accused in giving evidence. It says when he is called as a witness upon his own application he shall not be asked certain things. Those things relate to whether he has committed an offence, his character, etc. That is then what section 228 says. Therefore, this section is not only relevant, but it strengthens the case we are making and undermines the case the hon. the Minister is making. Section 233 deals with the privilege from disclosure of facts on the grounds of public policy. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">No witness shall &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is a witness, not an accused and it is dealt with under a completely different section.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; except as in this Act is provided &#x2026;</block>

<p>In this Act it is provided that the accused may make no statement at all. He may make an unsworn statement or he may testify in the witness-box and give evidence on oath. He may do it. Then he is a witness. If the witness is an accused person, he therefore has certain rights. Section 233 deals with witnesses and provides that &#x201C;no witness shall, except as in this Act is provided &#x2026;&#x201D;. In this Act it is also provided that the accused has certain rights so far as giving evidence, not giving evidence or giving a statement is concerned. In exactly the same way, if that is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument, there is a clause in the Criminal Procedure Act which says that once you have pleaded you are entitled, subject to the provisions of this Act, to a verdict one way or another. But, of course, this Act also provides for the prospect of an adjournment. If the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument is right I can rely on that one section and say that it says once I have pleaded I am entitled to a verdict of &#x201C;guilty&#x201D; or &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D;. I may say that this actually happened. I once inadvertently misled a court in this regard, because no one realized that in the Act it actually provided for an adjournment. My point is just simply that if this is what the hon. the Minister relies upon, if he says that the law already says that a Minister may produce a certificate and prevent an accused from giving evidence on his own behalf in any of our courts, he is talking nonsense and he, as Deputy Minister of Justice, ought to know it! The hon. the Minister ought to know that prospects he might have, if he tries to persuade any court or any judge of this country that that is the law in this country. He is talking nonsense. Section 292 of the same Act provides for cases not otherwise provided for. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The law as to admissibility of evidence and as to the competency, examination and cross-examination of witnesses which was in force in respect of criminal proceedings on the 30th day of May, 1961, shall apply in any case not expressly provided for by this Act or any other law.</block>

<p>There are no cases. The cases which have been quoted in the time when hon. members on that side did speak in the debate on this Bill, although they are not allowed to now, dealt with the question of State secrets, i.e. a State document which may not be disclosed in the public interest. They did not deal with the person himself and his right to give evidence or his right not to give evidence if he is the person concerned with those proceedings. I may say that this is much wider in any event. The courts always have an inherent discretion in these matters. By this Bill it is taken away from them in any event. These powers may be applied by various Ministers in any matter affecting, a-f-f-e-c-t-i-n-g, the interest of the State. What are the matters that affect the interests of the State? Look at the Order Paper which is before us. Consider all the Bills we have considered this session. Consider all the administrative matters which are dealt with by this Government. Is there anything which affects an individual from the cradle to the grave which does not affect the interests of the State? That is the scope of the field in which this is to be applied. Subsection (2) appears, on the face of it, to restrict the operation of subsection (1). The restriction is to matters affecting the interests of the State or public security. That is its scope. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister, now that he has heard some answers and argument on the points he has raised, on the most scandalous statement which he has made saying that this is law already and always has been law &#x2026;</p>

He has also relied on Hoffman. I have addressed this House pointing out that this is not so. The hon. member for Durban (North) has addressed this House pointing out that this is not so. The point I wish to make is that it is an extraordinary situation that we have not heard from the hon. the Deputy Minister to justify his contention. I move as a further amendment:</p>

<block name="quote">In line 58, to omit &#x201C;and no person shall be permitted&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I will hand this to you, if I may, just before my time expires. While I have still time available I wish to deal with certain other matters. One of the main points made by the hon. the Deputy Minister in replying to the debate in the Second Reading, was to refer to the existing position and to suggest that it was the same as under clause 29. Amongst other things he referred to Gardiner and Lansdown. I should like to quote back this quotation to him because it makes it perfectly clear in what respect the present law limits situations of this type. The passage which the hon. the Deputy Minister quoted from Gardiner and Lansdown reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Secrets of State, confidential State documents and communications between the Government and its opposites, if it be made to appear to the court that important interests of State would be prejudiced by their publication by means of evidence, will not be ordered to be disclosed.</block>

<p>This is a very different situation. It is perfectly clear that what is referred to here are the three situations, namely secrets of State, confidential State documents and communications between the Government and its opposites which could affect the interests of the State. But clause 29 goes a great deal further. There is no limit to clause 29 whatsoever. The Prime Minister and other Ministers of the Cabinet can prevent evidence being given in respect of anything which in their opinion affects the interests of the State.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I naturally abide by your ruling. In the little time that is available to me, I wish to pass on to other matters. I want to point out that section 228, which was relied upon by the hon. the Deputy Minister is in entirely different terms to clause 29. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">An accused called as a witness upon his own application, shall not be asked and if asked shall not be required to answer any question tending to show that he has committed or has been convicted of or has been charged with any offence.</block>

<p>In other words, it gives him the privilege to refuse to answer questions which may incriminate him. But clause 29 is not limited to incriminating evidence. Clause 29 refers to any matter which affects the interests of the State. It is very much wider and is not comparable at all. In respect to clause 23, the hon. member for Durban (North) has dealt with that. I do not wish to elaborate, other than to say that the relevant words are &#x201C;no witness shall except as in this Act is provided&#x201D;. Those are the relevant words. In the Criminal Procedure Act it is clearly provided that if an accused person wishes to give certain evidence which he considers to be material in his own defence, cannot be prevented from doing so either by the Prime Minister, a Minister of State, or by anybody else. To rely on these two sections to justify clause 29 and to suggest that because of the existence of these two sections clause 29 goes no further than the existing law, is not correct. Therefore, we cannot possibly support this clause. In addition to the amendments to this clause which I have already moved, I move this further amendment.</p>

I cannot see any justification for including other Ministers. I should like to know what they have in mind and why all Ministers should be included. I can understand that the one Minister in charge of the securities of the State should be included, and there can be an excuse for giving the Prime Minister the power, but there is certainly no excuse for giving all the other Ministers the power.

<p>Mr. Chairman, in reply to this last amendment, i.e. the omission of the reference to interests of the State, I just want to repeat what I have already said, i.e. that this Bureau of State Security is a co-ordinating bureau. It co-ordinates State security. This is being done by other Departments as well. This Department is not a super department which is going to take all matters in regard to the security of the State out of the hands of the other Departments. It is, for example, not going to deprive the military of the state security aspect and bring it exclusively under its own roof. It is going to act in a co-ordinating way, in the same way as the Department of Planning acts in a co-ordinating way for all the other Departments and the State. I want to give the hon. member another reason why I cannot accept his amendment. Let me remind him of what happened in the Duncan case, to which I referred here yesterday, which was decided by the House of Lords. The matter concerned the <i>Thetis,</i> a submarine which went down. A civil action was then instituted. The charge was that there had been negligence with the construction of the <i>Thetis.</i> The Minister then issued a certificate indicating that information in regard to the machinery, etc. of the <i>Thetis</i> could not be disclosed because it would not be in the public interest. What would the position be if the amendment which the hon. member for Musgrave moved were accepted? His motion that only the Prime Minister and the Minister dealing with the Bureau should be allowed to issue such a certificate excludes the Minister of Defence. The Minister of Defence has information concerning the nature of his weapons. This is a matter with which the Bureau will have nothing to do, or which it would not have investigated and knows nothing about. There are certain aspects of the construction of those weapons which have to be kept secret, and consequently he should also be able to issue a certificate to the effect that, in the public interest, evidence in this connection may not be given. I then come to the Police. The Police also have certain functions which they have to fulfil in the interests of the internal security of the State. There may be certain communications made by the Police affecting the security of the State, and if I were to accept the member&#x2019;s amendment that only the Ministers he mentioned may issue such a certificate, it would exclude the Minister of Police. The Minister of Police would then have to go to another Minister, the Prime Minister or to the Minister in charge of State security, and ask him to issue the necessary certificate. Consequently I cannot accept that amendment. There is also a further reason why I cannot accept the amendment, i.e. because the amendment goes much further than the existing law. Apparently hon. members on that side do not realize that our law of evidence as far as this matter is concerned, is the same as that of the English law. If hon. members were to make a study of the various decisions of the English courts in regard to this matter, they would see that what I have said here is quite correct, but it does not seem as if they want to accept that our law of evidence in this regard is the same as the English law of evidence.</p>

<p>According to the existing law of evidence in England, as applied in the Privy Council, in the House of Lords as well as in the English courts, it need not be only a Minister who issues such a certificate, but the head of any department. We are not going as far as the English law of evidence does at the moment, because they grant this power to the head of every department while we are limiting this power. to a person delegated by the Prime Minister and other Ministers. We are already placing a restriction on the implementation of this power, but the hon. member wants to go even further now; he wants to introduce a general restriction which would be going much too far under these circumstances.</p>

<p>They are very relevant.</p>

<p>I come then to the other amendment which was proposed here. Subsection (1) as printed, reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law or the common law contained, no person shall be compellable and no person shall be permitted or ordered to give evidence &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member now wants a person to be allowed to give evidence, by the omission of &#x201C;and no person shall be permitted&#x201D;. But what would that mean? He cannot be compelled, but he will in fact be allowed to give evidence. Suppose a person wanted to give such evidence and that it was not in the interest of the State. If those words are omitted, how must the courts allow him to give evidence? One really cannot force him to do so, but now the hon. member wants to allow him to do so. That is precisely what we do not want; we do not want him to be allowed to publish such evidence. That would destroy the whole essence of the clause. You cannot allow him to give evidence which is privileged, whether it is a criminal or a civil case.</p>

<p>I then come to the amendment by the hon. member for Durban (North), who wants the following proviso to be added at the end of the subsection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that the provisions of this section shall not apply to the evidence of the plaintiff in a civil action or the accused in a criminal court.</block>

<p>Let me say at once, Mr. Prime Minister &#x2026; [Laughter.] Sir, hon. members on that side are emitting this hollow laughter because they have nothing better to do. It is a case of &#x201C;small things amuse small minds&#x201D;. Mr. Chairman, I just want to show you how clever the hon. member is. He wants to amend subsection (2). What specific subsection (2)? Did the hon. member ever look at it? Subsection (2) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The provisions of subsection (1) shall not derogate from the provisions of any law or of the common law which do not compel or permit any person to give evidence or to furnish any information in any proceedings in any court of law or before any body or institution established by or under any law as to any fact, matter or thing or as to any communication made to or by such person, or to produce any book or document, in connection with any matter other than that affecting the interest of the State or public security.</block>

<p>The hon. member now wants to add to that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that the provisions of this section shall not apply to the evidence of a plaintiff in a civil action or the accused in a criminal court.</block>

<p>If that is the case, what can such a person put forward there, because these are precisely all the things which according to this clause are excluded, which are not privileged? Subsection (2) therefore excludes all the cases which are not privileged. He now wants to destroy that privilege by adding&#x2014;</p>

<p>May I ask a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not going to reply any further to nonsensical questions. The hon. member has been asking nonsensical questions all day. For <span class="col_8035-8036" refersTo="page_1170"/>that reason I maintain that I cannot accept a half-baked motion like this. It is quite impossible to do so. But I want to return to the hon. member for Musgrave, and I want to discuss with him again that matter which apparently, he cannot understand. Section 228 of our Criminal Procedure Act grants a few privileges to an accused person. When the accused goes to the witness stand he need not, in terms of section 228, furnish that reply because then he is a witness. As soon as he is a witness, he has that privilege. Section 233 state that he cannot plead one of those privileges unless the document which would be disclosed will prove his innocence. But hon. members are alleging that if he wants to give evidence to prove his innocence the Minister may say that he may not do so. If the Minister were to say that, then I have quoted here what Hoffman said in his book. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Presumably if the objection was upheld, the accused would have to be acquitted.</block>

<p>If the court found that that document or evidence could not be produced, &#x201C;if it is upheld&#x201D;, then this follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The accused would have to be acquitted. The court could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the missing evidence might not have established his innocence.</block>

<p>In other words, if the court were to uphold this certificate and say that it is privileged and that that evidence may not be given, then the accused must walk out a free man because all the evidence is not before the court Then there would be a doubt, and the accused must be given the benefit of the doubt. If the court admits that document, it can only admit it if it does not incriminate the accused, for the court may not allow any document which would incriminate the accused That is after all the ordinary criminal law which we are applying to-day in our courts. Now I cannot get the hon. members to understand that this is really the case and that we are going no further here than the law as it is at present. If hon. members would only look at it, they would see that it is not going further than the existing law.</p>

<p>I want to conclude. I think we have now approached this matter from all angles, and I cannot convince the hon. members opposite of the innocence of this legislation. They are making a terrible fuss over things which really do not exist. The dangers they see in this clause do not exist. The clause codifies the law as we have found it to-day, and that is all it does.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The Deputy Minister says our fears are of no account, because if the accused is not allowed to give evidence Hoffman says he will be acquitted. He read from Hoffman, and Hoffman said that presumably he would be acquitted. Hoffman is not relying on a judgment; he just gives his view, and says that presumably he would be acquitted.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>That is just the point. Why should we take that chance with the freedom of our citizens? The Deputy Minister himself admits that there is that chance that it may happen, but he says we must rely on the opinion expressed by Hoffman, who is not a judge of our courts, where he says that presumably the accused will be acquitted. I want to appeal to hon. members opposite. Surely this Committee cannot allow itself to be swayed by an opinion of a legal writer that an accused would presumably be acquitted. We must make sure that he will be given the chance to prove his innocence before the court. The Deputy Minister in his reply only relied on the fact that the amendment as worded by the hon. member for Durban (North) only applies to subsection (2). Otherwise he did not deal with the amendment as it affects the section as a whole. Now, if that is what is worrying him, I move a new subsection (4)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following subsection at the end of the Clause:</block>

<block name="quote">(4) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the evidence of a plaintiff in a civil action or the accused in a criminal court.</block>

<p>I cannot see what objection the Deputy Minister can have to an amendment of that nature if he wishes to protect the interests of an accused or of a plaintiff. He in fact has said that the accused would not be prejudiced by this clause, relying on what Hoffman said, but we want to make quite sure that the accused will not be prejudiced, and the Deputy Minister, by accepting this amendment, can, make sure of it. I want to point out that the Minister must bear in mind that by passing this clause we are in fact changing the law, irrespective of what Hoffman or anyone else may say, and I ask the Minister to accept my amendment. The only effect it will have is that the plaintiff in a civil action, or the accused in a criminal case, will be able to give evidence. Duly authorized by the hon. member for Durban (North), I withdraw his proviso.</p>

<p>I cannot accept that amendment either, because we will in that way really be changing the existing law. I want to refer hon. members to the cases <i>Redelinghuys</i> v. <i>Geidel</i> in 1963 (2), page 274, and I just want to read the note at the top. It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where the Minister of a Department claims privilege from disclosure on the ground of public policy, the principle of exclusion on that ground is that disclosure would entail too great a price to pay for the information which is sought. That the claim of privilege can cause hardship is <span class="col_8037-8038" refersTo="page_1171"/>obvious and it is expected that serious consideration is given to the claim before it is made. But the Court cannot take the decision out of the hands of the Department and will accept the statement of a Minister that production would be detrimental to the public interest, at any rate in the absence of proof that the refusal is frivolous or vexatious.</block>

<heading>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill is largely a result of the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s recommendation that a structural amendment, to the Republic&#x2019;s tax system had become necessary in order to prevent impediment to economic growth in the national economy. The commission suggested a decrease in the progression of direct taxes and a shift of emphasis to indirect taxes, and this was accepted by the Government.</p>

<p>After careful study of all the systems of indirect taxation, the commission came to the conclusion that a selective sales tax, collected at the source, would be most suitable system of this nature for South African conditions. The considerations which led the commission to this conclusion, are set down in its report and I therefore do not want to elaborate further on that.</p>

<p>What I do, in fact, want to point out is that there was no alternative source to compensate for the relief granted in respect of direct taxes and that the system of a selective sales tax was chosen on the recommendation of an expert commission of experts. Owing to international obligations and the policy of protection, no further revenue can be obtained from customs, while excise is on a very restricted basis and the scales are already very high. The commission recommended that the basis of the sales tax should be private domestic consumption, with the exception of food, clothing, footwear, housing costs, certain medical expenses and certain excisable goods. There still appears to be some misunderstanding about this matter, and therefore I want to elaborate on it for a while.</p>

<p>I want to make it very clear that, with the aforementioned exceptions, the quantity of goods which the Government could choose was limited. It would be very regrettable if the impression exists that the quantity was unlimited and it was therefore unreasonable to tax essential goods such as soap and razor blades. The sales duty is an internal tax on locally manufactured goods with a counter duty on imported goods of the same nature. The choice is therefore necessarily based on local production, and where goods are not manufactured locally, imports could not be included, for example photographic equipment and watches. The latest census for the manufacturing industry, i.e. that of the year 1965-&#x2019;66, only became available recently. It indicates a gross yield for the manufacturing industry of about R4,640 million, from which the goods for sales duty could be chosen. This figure is outdated and is merely being used as an indication of the extent. However, there are large groups of goods which could not be taken into consideration, for one reason or another, in the choice of the duty. Firstly, there were the following groups, food, clothing, footwear, housing and medical expenses, which had to be excluded, on the recommendation of the Franzsen Commission and according to the decision of the Government, to prevent the sales duty from becoming regressive. No precise figures are available, but manufactured goods to the value of more than R1,000 million are being excluded here.</p>

<p>There is another group for which separate figures were not calculated because those goods, owing to circumstances, were automatically excluded: (a) services, for example shoe repairs, panel beating and spray painting, blacksmithing, the repair of motor vehicles, boats, aircraft, etc.; (b) Capital goods, for example agricultural implements, industrial, mining and construction machinery, railway equipment, commercial vehicles, etc. This group represents a very high value; (c) Production materials, for example all kinds of packaging materials, steel, construction timber, wattle bark extract, explosives, fertilizers, basic industrial chemicals, bricks and tiles, glass, cement, building board, galvanized iron, building requirements, etc.; (d) The traditional excisable goods which in past have furnished the largest portion of the indirect taxes, and which represent a value of more than R600 million; (e) Goods which would have created particular administration problems, for example, agricultural products other than foodstuffs, textiles, etc.</p>

<p>This is the most important group of goods which had to be excluded. The calculated value of the remaining locally manufactured goods from which a choice could be made, only amounted to about R700 million. In the first place the essential goods were selected from the available goods. Subsequently all the durable goods were selected in ascending order of indispensibility. When the amount fell just short of the mark, intermediary production goods were sought that would not have an extensive effect on production costs, and items such as office machinery, stationery, paint, etc. were included to obviate the necessity of including too many essential consumer goods. When it was estimated that there was still a shortage, it is obvious that there was no other <span class="col_8041-8042" refersTo="page_1173"/>choice but to include some of the more essential goods, and even certain less essential items in the food and clothing groups had to be included, items such as sweets, chutney and leather clothing.</p>

<p>The fact is that a given amount had to be found, and it must be clearly realized that the only alternatives left, should there be an objection against the existing list, are essential foodstuffs, clothing and medicine. We are dealing here with taxation on private consumption and certain essential goods had to be included because, according to the available facts, there were insufficient non-essential goods available. All that remains are goods that are even more essential.</p>

<p>Immediately after the introduction of the sales duty, consultations were held with the various industries in order to find a procedure according to which each industry could operate. In this connection I cannot neglect to mention the positive assistance rendered by the Cape Chamber of Industries to the Department of Customs and Excise, particularly in the arrangement of meetings with the various industries. The co-operation of the Chamber and its staff is greatly appreciated. The department also has great praise for the co-operation of the industries, and other bodies, involved.</p>

<p>Although the majority of the industries have already been addressed, there are still a few matters and representations which are being considered and which must be subjected to further investigations before a decision can be reached. One of the matters concerns the question of the documentation and the procedure which must be followed in connection with the quarterly accounts. The department is investigating the matter and is holding consultations with the Federated Chambers of Industries. Applications have also been received for rebates. In many cases the applications were not motivated, while in respect of others there were insufficient facts on which to base a decision. These applications will be investigated and the necessary action decided upon. However, I want to issue a prefatory warning that rebates cannot be freely granted, because this would greatly complicate administration and could so infringe upon the tax source that rates would have to be increased or more goods involved.</p>

<p>In addition I also want to mention that there are one or two industries where the provisional procedure which was decided upon is unsatisfactory, and these cases will be investigated further. The legislation also makes provision for the decreasing or suspension of duties by notification where this is justified.</p>

<p>Except for the annual ratification of notices in respect of customs and excise, this Bill deals almost exclusively with the incorporation of provisions for the application of the sales duty. The list of goods subject to sales duty, is being incorporated as part 3 of schedule 1 in the Act and in the new schedule 7 provision is being made for rebates and refunds of sales duty. The existing schedule 7, in which the list of licences is set out, now becomes schedule 8, and the licence fee in respect of the sales duty is being set at a nominal amount of R1 per year. Over and above the amendments of the Customs and Excise Act in order to make provision for the sales duty, there are a few clauses in the amendment Bill to which the attention of hon. members is drawn.</p>

<p>The position of the seller and the purchaser, in the case of contracts concluded before the 26th March, but implemented after that date, is clearly stated. The purchaser shall not be able to refuse delivery of the goods merely on the grounds of the introduction of the sales duty, and he shall have to compensate the seller for any sales duty which had to be paid by the seller, unless the purchaser is indemnified by an explicit agreement in respect of the sales duty or an essentially comparable tax. This also applies to the hiring out and the use of goods in the furnishing of a service. In addition, there is a provision that the Minister can give retrospective effect to certain amendments introduced by notification, if he considers such action justified.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, this Bill principally deals with the new sales duty or purchase tax, as some people and also we on this side of the House would prefer to see it called. The hon. the Deputy Minister is quite right, because the rest of the Bill deals with the customary alterations to the customs tariffs which are all recommended by the Board of Trade or in conformity with the general agreement on trade and tariffs. Discussions on this Bill will therefore really be confined to this question of the sales duty.</p>

<p>At the start I would like to clear one point up, because during previous discussions on this subject, the hon. the Minister accused hon. members on this side of the House of trying to make political capital out of this proposal.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister did so several times, and I hear an hon. member on the other side repeating it. It is a very weak argument, one which it is not unusual to hear used by Ministers who are trying to defend the indefensible, but in this case I think it is particularly unjustified. We on this side of the House have agreed in principle to the levying of a sales tax, and to that extent we are <i>particeps criminis.</i> We agree in principle to the levying of a sales tax to take the place, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, of the reduction of indirect taxation which is contained in the Budget proposals. But, Sir, what we did do was to criticize the method of application. We were quite entitled to do so. In fact it was our duty to criticize the method of application if we thought we were justified in doing so. We not only criticized the method of application, but we proposed an alternative. The hon. the <span class="col_8043-8044" refersTo="page_1174"/>Deputy Minister in his speech said that there was no alternative to the method being adopted in this Bill. He admitted in his speech that in drafting the Bill and in preparing the Schedule, they had to depend very largely on estimates because they had no definite figures to go on. The things that were excluded at the start were confined to those things which had been recommended by the Franzsen Commission. The hon. the Minister in discussing this matter denied that he had said that the new sales duty was going to be imposed on luxury goods. That is also correct. He did not at the same time say that when he made his speech he also published a White Paper. The very first paragraph of that White Paper, for which the hon. the Minister is responsible, started off by saying that the sales duty was an indirect tax mainly on luxury, semi-luxury and durable goods. What the hon. the Minister did say, and he repeated it, was that this duty was to be a selective duty, not on basic essentials. When we put forward our alternative we were satisfied that it was a practical alternative. We stand by it. Everything that has happened since confirmed us in our view that the proposals and suggestions we made did contain practical proposals which would have been far more satisfactory than the ones we are now called upon to accept. In spite of the somewhat contemptuous way in which the hon. the Minister rejected our proposals, to quote a poet: &#x201C;My head is bloody but unbowed&#x201D;. We stand by them. We believe that in the future it will be proved that we were right.</p>

<p>Our criticism was twofold. We criticized the method of application, and we also criticized the Schedule itself. What has happened in the last two months, since the introduction of the Budget, has confirmed our views on the subject. It has become apparent that the hon. the Minister has laid a superhuman task on his department. I make no criticism of the department. I think they are struggling very manfully to make the new system work. That this is a tremendous task that has been laid on their shoulders is undoubted. I think it is also certain that the confusion almost amounting to despair, in some cases, which it has caused among the manufacturers who are going to pay the tax, in the first instance, is also undoubted.</p>

<p>The White Paper which the hon. the Minister laid upon the Table contained 32 pages. Every paragraph required careful study, by the people who were going to have to carry out this Act. After all, you have to remember that these people who are going to pay this tax at its source are going to have to find large sums of money. There are firms which say that their concern alone will be paying something like R500,000 in sales tax. It is quite obvious that any instructions issued by the department had to be worked out very carefully by the people who had to pay. I was glad to hear the hon. the Deputy Minister pay generous tribute to the way in which the manufacturers, the Chambers of Industry, have endeavoured to co-operate with the department and tried to help. But, of course, they are still struggling. In that White Paper mention was made that they were going to issue an explanatory guide to manufacturers, in order to enable the manufacturers to prepare themselves to put this duty into operation as from 1st May. The guide, when it did appear, contained 19 pages of instructions and 101 paragraphs, every one of which was full of detail and very complicated detail in many ways. There were also some 10 very complicated forms to fill in. The Budget was introduced on the 26th March, and the first White Paper was issued at the same time. The guide appeared in the <i>Gazette</i> on 21st April, nearly a month later. As I have said, this guide which contained 101 extremely complicated paragraphs was intended to enable the manufacturers to be ready to pay up by 1st May. In other words, they were given 10 days to work out the details before they could do so.</p>

<p>Sir, it was a completely impossible task, It indicates what I call, the super human task that is being laid on the shoulders of the department. Since then, of course, there has been a number of changes in the method of procedure, and the hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out that there is still a number of changes to be made in certain industries, which they have not yet been able to finalize. We know that in major industries, like the motorcar industry, in the case of tyres, cosmetics and jewellery, the methods of application have all been altered. It is quite clear that the whole matter is far more complicated and far more difficult than was ever contemplated with the initial introduction of the sales duty. Sir, when one realizes the magnitude of the task, one is surprised at the extremely wide powers taken in this Bill to amend the procedures, to exempt from the duty, to lower the duty, in fact to do almost anything to make the system work; but it all indicates what hopeless confusion can arise when plans are put into operation without proper forethought and proper consideration, as we shall show later on in the course of debating this question.</p>

<p>The second matter which we criticized, of course, is the Schedule. Sir, let us hear no more of this talk of making political capital out of it. We must have some kind of standard by which to examine the Schedule. The hon. the Deputy Minister has said that they are limited in the things which they can tax. He admits that the Estimates, based on the figures which they have been able to get, are not necessarily accurate. The only standard that we have to go by is the two remarks made by the hon. the Minister when he said that he was not going to place the duty on basic essentials and that, as stated in the White Paper, the majority of the taxes were on luxury, semi-luxury and durable goods. Sir, we have examined the Schedule very carefully. We have gone through it with a fine tooth-comb, a comb which, I may say, was bought before the sales duty was put upon it, so <span class="col_8045-8046" refersTo="page_1175"/>that it did not cost us any more. We find that there are many items in it which are either basic essentials, if words mean anything at all, or else they cannot be described as luxury, semi-luxury or durable goods. In the Committee Stage we shall move amendments to make our opinion quite clear on the subject, and we shall discuss the Schedule in some considerable detail. We are not going to oppose the Second Reading because, as I say, we have accepted the principle of a sales duty, but unless our reasonable objections, which are based on the statements made by the Minister himself in his speech and in his White Paper, are met in Committee, we shall have no option but to oppose the Third Reading because we cannot be a party to the Schedule as it stands at present. We do not think that it conforms to the principles enunciated by the hon. the Minister when he introduced the tax, and, furthermore, we are quite sure that after an examination of the Schedule in Committee, he will agree with us that in many respects it is placing a quite unnecessary burden on those people who are least able to bear it. the people who are deriving no benefit from the reduction in direct taxation but who are going to be burdened, in many directions, with extra taxation for which they are getting no compensation in the way of other reductions in their taxation. We shall not, as I have said, oppose the Second Reading but we shall discuss this matter in detail in the Committee Stage in an endeavour to get the Minister and the Deputy Minister to see reason and to conform more closely to the principles which were enunciated when this tax was introduced.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>In his speech the hon. member for Constantia concentrated mainly on telling us that although that side of the House supports the principle of the Bill, there is criticism at two levels and that if this side of the House does not take notice of their criticism during the Committee Stage they will oppose the Bill at the Third Reading. I do not want to deal with the two points of criticism which the hon. member raised now. To me the basis of his whole argument was summed up in one of his concluding sentences in which he said that this sales duty places &#x201C;an unnecessary burden on those people who are least able to bear it&#x201D;. Sir, I shall come back to this sentence during the course of my argument, because we have often heard this accusation in previous debates in this House this year. I should like this matter to be analysed properly, to the extent to which it lends itself to analysis with the knowledge at our disposal. The hon. member referred to the work which the Department has done in connection with this new sales duty which has to give expression to the necessary tax reform. The hon. member said that the Department had a &#x201C;super-human task&#x201D;; he referred to the fact that they produced a White Paper with 32 pages and that in addition to that they produced a guide which went to 19 pages and 101 or 104 paragraphs. I think he could have paid the Department a compliment for having been able to give so much assistance to industries in such a short time. Sir, I want to return to the first point of criticism raised by the hon. member. He said that he had criticism on two levels, firstly, the &#x201C;method of application&#x201D;, and secondly, the Schedule itself. The hon. member did not greatly amplify his point of criticism in respect of the method by means of which this sales duty was introduced, and I must therefore conclude that what he really meant by his first point of criticism was that the sales duty should not have come into operation on the date when it did in fact come into operation. In other words, what he wanted was that prior notice should have been given to the effect that the sales duty would only come into operation at a certain stage in the future, three or six months after the Budget speech on 26th March.</p>

<p>Twelve months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>My colleague here in front of me says twelve months. Sir, let us briefly look at what the consequences would have been if we were to have implemented that idea. It is, after all, quite clear that an undertaking with vast capital, if it had been given twelve months&#x2019; notice prior to the coming into operation of the sales duty, would have bought up the maximum available quantities of commodities and supplies before the sales duty was imposed. It would then have been in a position, with its far cheaper goods, to compete more favourably on the market with undertakings with less resources, because the undertakings with less resources would not have been able to get hold of the supplies beforehand, nor would they have been able to pay for them. Then they would have had to buy those supplies from the date on which the sales duty became applicable, that is, at considerably higher prices, and they would have been in a far weaker competitive position. That is what hon. members opposite wanted. It would only have meant that you would have had a greater imbalance because you would thereby have eliminated competition to a greater extent and have given an undertaking with more capital the advantage at the expense of an undertaking with less capital. It is the conviction of this side of the House and my own personal conviction that we could not have given prior notice of the introduction of a sales duty, because we would, if we had done that, have distorted the normal industrial pattern and that would have led to trade in South Africa being prejudiced.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the hon. member&#x2019;s statement that the other side of the House accents the principle contained in the Act. For the information of hon. members on that side of the House, I should like to quote from the mouthpiece of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, Assocom. I quote from the May edition of <i>Commercial Opinion.</i> The whole article deals with indirect taxation; it deals <span class="col_8047-8048" refersTo="page_1176"/>with this sales duty. In the first place the editor says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the sales duty we, namely the organized trade, apparently got what we asked for, in principle at any rate. In our representations to the Franzsen Commission we placed emphasis on the unfair and practical disadvantages of high-limit income tax rates, opinions which were largely endorsed by the Commission. However, it was clear that in the absence of a considerable decrease in State expenditure, a miracle for which we have so far been praying in vain, the revenue which is given up in direct taxation would have to be recovered somewhere else, and seeing that we, for good practical reasons, were opposed to the imposition of a tax on capital gains, an increase of direct taxation appeared inevitable.</block>

<p>Therefore hon. members never had any grounds for disputing the principle contained in this Act, because even the Federated Chambers of Industry supported the principle. Then in the same article the editor writes as follows on the operation of the sales duty&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What about the rates at which the sales duty is imposed? In the ideal set-up indirect taxation must take up a neutral position between any two articles or services, except in the few exceptional cases where public interest requires it to be otherwise, and that presupposes a low rate of taxation, which is applicable to all goods and services. Since South Africa has such great inequality in incomes such a solution would, however, be extremely unfair, and the Franzsen Commission accordingly recommended a selective levy. Unfortunately, the more selective a sales duty is, the higher must rates be in order to bring in a desired amount of revenue.</block>

<p>From this two things are apparent. The first is that the organized trade accepts a selective sales duty and that they admit that the rates must be high in order to bring in the desired amount of revenue. That implies, as the hon. the Minister said, that a choice has to be made between the goods which are the least necessary and those which one cannot do without, and that a higher tax must be levied on the goods which are regarded as luxury or as non-essential goods.</p>

<p>To continue. I want to come to the hidden sting in the tail of the concluding sentences of the hon. member for Constantia, in which he said that it was their contention that this sales duty places an unnecessary burden on those people who can least afford it, and I want to refer to a publication which the hon. member for Constantia has perhaps already glanced at. It is entitled &#x201C;An African Day&#x201D;. The hon. member would do well to listen now, because he can also learn from it. It is a study of the life in the south-western Bantu areas where 520,000 Bantu live, and in which many interesting details appear which may perhaps change the hon. member&#x2019;s opinion on this matter. From this it appears that, <i>inter alia</i> in connection with these statements which hon. members who were so anxious about the people who were supposedly living below the breadline, the inhabitants of Soweto, had a spending pattern of R39.1 per month in 1962, which rose to R66.9 per month in 1967, that is to say an increase of R27.8 per month or 71 per cent. If one considers this spending pattern as it appeared in 1962 and again in 1967, then it appears that while the total spending on food was 38 per cent in 1962 it was only 32 per cent in 1967, a decrease therefore of 6 per cent. Now I want to ask hon. members this: If these people were living below the breadline in 1962, and if they were earning 71 per cent more in 1967 than in 1962, why was there then, relatively speaking, a decrease in spending on food? After all, this directly contradicts that statement. If they were going hungry in 1962, if they could not buy enough food with their available money to enable them to live above the breadline, why then is the percentage spending on food less than in 1962 while they were spending nearly R28 per month more in 1967? But let us look at other commodities. In 1962 they spent 10 per cent on clothes; in 1967 it was 7 per cent. In 1962 they spent 12 per cent on housing; in 1967 it was only 8 per cent. But let us look at other commodities, for example Bantu beer. In 1962 they spent 1 per cent on Bantu beer: in 1967 it was 2 per cent, exactly double it, an increase of 100 per cent. But let us look at other kinds of liquor. In 1962 they spent 1 per cent on &#x201C;White liquor&#x201D;; in 1967 they spent 3 per cent. That is an increase of 200 per cent. In this way there are also other commodities which are not necessary to bring one above the breadline but on which the spending increased considerably in this period of five years. Let us look at what these people spend on liquor, and I now quote from a news report which appeared in <i>The Star</i> of 5th May&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although many non-Whites in Johannesburg townships are living below the breadline, there seems to be no shortage of money for liquor. In only seven months, from July, 1968, to January, 1969, municipal controlled bottle-stores in the non-White areas sold R2,447 million&#x2019;s worth of European liquor alone.</block>

<p>Hon. members must take note of this. The municipal controlled bottle-stores in the non-White areas alone brought in R2.447 million from the sale of White liquor. This figure is very important. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This sum was nearly R800,000 higher than the R1,654 million spent in the same months in 1967&#x2019;68.</block>

<p>It is an increase of nearly 50 per cent over a year in the money spent on White liquor alone. In addition this was only noted in respect of bottle-stores in non-White areas, which were owned by White municipalities. Now hon. members on that side say that this Bill is very unreasonable and unfair because it affects <span class="col_8049-8050" refersTo="page_1177"/>the people who are living below the breadline and who cannot afford it. Just in case they may say that <i>The Star</i> wrote nonsense, which it usually does, I should like to quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The figures are all contained in the report of the Manager of the City Council&#x2019;s non-European Affairs Department, Mr. T. W. A. Koller.</block>

<p>In other words, these figures which I quoted, which appeared in <i>The Star,</i> are taken from a report of the Johannesburg City Council. They cannot therefore be disputed.</p>

<p>Hon. members say that they support this Bill in principle but that they have certain objections because the Bill places an unnecessary burden on people who cannot afford this tax. Every time they tell us that it is the non-Whites who will be seriously affected. Earlier this year they said that it was a rich man&#x2019;s budget, because the poor man who lives below the breadline is penalized. During the Budget debate I mentioned the Whites who do not earn much. I tried to show that the Whites who fall into the lower income groups will benefit by the financial legislation of this session. I was then reproached because we were supposedly imposing a heavy penalty on and doing an injustice to the non-Whites living below the breadline. The hon. member for Constantia said again this afternoon by implication that that was their main objection to this legislation. Now I pointed out to hon. members that the spending of the non-Whites in Soweto increased as far as luxury, semi-luxury and unnecessary goods were concerned Hon. members may say that the information contained herein is not correct. I can only say that according to the evidence before me that argument falls away. What is more, on page 56 of the report on that investigation it appears that the average income of the average Soweto family is R70.1. In other words, if the average expenditure amounts to R66.9 there is still another R3.20 per month which is not spent on the necessities of life, or on any other items which are not classified as necessities of life.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that this same survey indicates on page 36 that as far as private transport in Soweto is concerned 7 per cent of the inhabitants owned bicycles in 1967 and that 12 per cent owned bicycles in 1962. But 11 per cent owned cars in 1967 as against only 4 per cent in 1962. The percentage of the population which spent money on luxury items therefore increased from 4 per cent to 11 per cent in 1967. Three per cent of them owned lorries in 1962, as against 4 per cent in 1967. One per cent of the population owned scooters in 1967, while in 1962 probably none of them owned scooters. I mention these statistics to disprove the accusation of that side of the House that this sales duty as embodied in this Bill severely affects the people living below the breadline. According to the information in front of me, which I shall loan to hon. members if they want it, that accusation is unfounded.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Wonderboom has produced statistics to show how well-to-do the Bantu are. I shall leave the people of South Africa to judge for themselves how rich they are. I shall leave the pensioner and the person living on a fixed income to answer the hon. member for Wonderboom when they start to pay this tax. One can prove anything with statistics, and I am not going to argue barren figures with him. I shall leave him to be judged by the public of South Africa, of all races.</p>

<p>However, two things I cannot ignore. The first is the way in which the hon. member for Wonderboom misrepresented the case of this side of the House as put by the hon. member for Constantia. At no time has any member on this side of the House suggested that a tax should be announced 12 months in advance, so that people are given a chance to stock up in the interim. That was never the suggestion of this side of the House. If the hon. member had been listening, he would have known that what we suggested was that an immediate tax on luxury items should now be imposed and that arrangements should be made for financing the shortfall, and that in a year&#x2019;s time the lists could be reviewed in the light of experience. That was the suggestion. Then the hon. member went on to quote, in his defence, from an article in <i>Commercial Opinion,</i> of May, 1969. I happen to have it here as well. He quoted up to the end of the first paragraph, and then stopped. He then went on to quote from the next page. But why did he stop there? The reason he stopped there was that the very next words are as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die toepassing van die verkoopreg het vele vraagstukke en teenstrydighede laat opduik. Sommige hiervan kon miskien vermy gewees het as daar meer tyd beskikbaar was vir Staatsbeplanning.</block>

<p>The article continues, and I now quote from the English translation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are, however, some longer-term aspects of the matter that cause concern.</block>

<p>The article goes on to mention the concern expressed by Mr. Harold Groom of the Durban Chamber of Commerce. Instead of quoting that, the hon. member avoided the section which deals with the problems and the difficulties. If that is the value of his quotation, I shall leave the House to judge it.</p>

<p>What is your point?</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>My point is that the article quoted proved exactly the opposite of what the hon. member tried to prove. What the article said was that industry welcomed the levelling out of the inequalities in taxation, but had found in the practical application that there were problems and difficulties which <span class="col_8051-8052" refersTo="page_1178"/>could have been avoided. That is exactly our case. The weakness is not in the principle. We accept that. The weakness lies in the application and in the scope of these measures, and both those points are made here.</p>

<p>This Bill deals with three different fields. It deals with customs; with excise; and with sales tax. I want to say just a word on customs before coming to the sales tax aspect. Last year we had a similar Customs Act Amendment Bill. We had a Bill which introduced far-reaching and what we then described as rushed, ill-conceived and radical provisions. A year has passed, and now we have the next instalment of amendments. The reason given last year for these amendments was that there were widespread swindles, dishonesty and evasion of customs duty. Figures of R34 million and R40 million were mentioned, creating the impression that the importers of South Africa were swindling the State on a vast scale. We took exception to that implication and reflection on commerce and the importers of South Africa. However, we were told: &#x201C;Just you watch. In terms of these amendments you are now going to see all sorts of legal actions and prosecutions against the people concerned.&#x201D; What are the facts, Sir? The mountain gave forth a mouse. There have been four convictions of fraud, with a total value of R2,381. There were only four convictions, after all the talk of millions of rand, and after the impression had been created of dishonesty in commerce on a vast scale.</p>

<p>The point is that in every walk of life you have convictions for fraud, week after week, month after month, for far more important matters and bigger amounts. That hon. member&#x2019;s profession would be very upset if, because a man was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for fraud this week, the impression was created that all accountants were frauds. The impression created was that this swindling was on such a vast scale that it implicated a vast section of commerce. It was not this hon. Deputy Minister who said it, but I think the hon. the Minister owes commerce an apology. The scope displayed by the prosecutions was so small that that could have been dealt with without all the panic. I hope that the hon. the Minister will do the right thing to commerce and apologize for the false impression which was created last year. Needless to say, in the administration of the Act, we were right in most of our arguments and very little has been applied, except to isolated imports.</p>

<p>I do not want to spend more time on the customs aspect because my time is very limited, neither do I want to spend my time on excise, except for saying that we intend to move an amendment in the Committee Stage in regard to the tax on beer as it is proposed to amend it. We feel that this is the wrong principle, and we shall deal with that in the Committee Stage. However, I want to give notice now that we shall move the removal of the sliding scale on beer. We shall also move for a flat rate on beer, which will enable it to take its proper tax-level, instead of, as at present, being the highest taxed, although the lowest drink in alcohol content on the South African market.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the sales tax. The hon. member for Constantia has put our point of view in broad principle. I want to deal in a little more detail with the method proposed for the application of this tax. I want to say that I believe that this is clumsy, unrealistic and impractical. We accept that there are wide discretionary powers and the very presence of those wide discretionary powers indicates that the hon. the Minister realizes that this measure, as proposed, is in fact impractical. If it is going to work he has to have almost unlimited powers to amend and change its application as he goes along. I believe the problem is that the method of application of this tax has been drawn up without a proper understanding or knowledge of the functioning of industry. It is estimated that between eight and ten thousand firms are going to be affected by this sales tax. In the jewellery industry alone I believe there are over 400 jewellers involved, and there are hundreds and hundreds of small factories. Has the hon. the Minister never been into these factories, the small partnership, the man and the wife factory which has hardly any, if any, clerical workers&#x2014;with only a few books which have to be kept at night in a dingy little corner? Has he never been to these factories where virtually the only paper work is the absolute essentials required for income tax? I know the hon. the Minister is going to say that at this stage he is exempting all firms with a turnover of under a R1,000 per year. That does not change the picture. Many of these firms in any case have a turnover of well over a R1,000 per year. Many of these factories are run by people who can hardly understand English or Afrikaans; they are immigrants. The method of collection and administration proposed&#x2014;which I submit will not and cannot work,&#x2014;is being imposed on them. I want to propose an alternative with which I want to deal in more detail later. The point I want to make at this stage is that these hundreds of small factories, with a minimal clerical staff, are all part of the production miracle of South Africa. They are all part of the production capacity of this country of ours and help produce what our people need. They are part of the machinery of production. They are an essential element. On this wide field, varying from major factories with modern accounting systems and computers down to the one-man or husband-and-<span class="col_8053-8054" refersTo="page_1179"/>wife partnership or little back-yard factories, the same system is planned for the collection of sales tax. In many of these factories, in fact in any efficient factory, the emphasis is on productivity and not on paper work. Every minute and every hour that is spent on the filling in of forms and papers, is time taken off the productivity of that plant.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I said a minimum of paper work. But now, let me see what this hon. member wants. Here I have the two memoranda to which my colleague referred, one of 33 pages and one of 23 pages. These memoranda set out how this tax is going to be applied. I do not want to repeat what was said by the hon. member for Constantia, but I want to refer to the procedure which must be followed. First of all, every factory must be licensed. Then, in addition to being licensed, they must license any warehouse divorced from the factory. If I remember rightly, the hon. the Minister, when he first mentioned this tax, said that there would be no fee payable for licensing. Did the hon. the Minister say that? It is on record anyway in one of the voluminous documents that there would be no fee for licensing. In fact, the Act lays down that a fee must be paid before a factory can be licensed. It cannot be licensed until the fee is paid. That is one of the provisions of the Bill. After the factory is licensed, it must establish a certificate of value for every item it produces. A certificate of value takes three pages, which show the item, the price per dozen, lb., or whatever it is, the price it is sold at to all the different possible markets it could be sold to, institutions, businesses, fulltime merchant wholesalers and appropriation for own use, etc. It shows the discount or commission and the estimated annual percentage of disposal. It goes on to deal with sales and to whom it was sold. It deals with any circumstances affecting the product, any installation charges, discounts, quantity discounts, trade discounts, cash discounts, etc. Then it also deals with delivery costs and in the end it contains the sworn declaration. That form must be filled in for every single sales tax item which a factory produces. That is what the Bill lays down. Of course, it is not being applied. We are being asked to pass a law which is not being applied, which cannot be applied. I have an example of one factory which produces 22 different brands of products. Every brand is divided into two classifications; one for industrial use and one for household use. There are 100 packs. Multiply that and it amounts to some 4,000 items. Another firm produces over 2,000 items. However, the Bill before us contemplates that a certificate of value must be established for each. What in practice is going to happen is already happening, namely firms are told that their selling price to the retailer will be accepted less 60 per cent, or whatever it may be. They are obliged to do that. But that is not what we are being asked to vote for. That is not what the hon. the Minister said the procedure would be. That is not what this explanatory notice lays down. It is only where the department gives a concession that that is avoided. But according to the laid-down procedure, this certificate of value must be completed for every item. Then, having established the value, having licensed your factory and your bonded store, you then come to your ingredients. There is another memorandum which lays down the accounting procedure. This procedure ends up with 10 forms, namely forms D.A.75 10 up to D.A.75 32A. What are these forms for? Incidentally, every manufacturer must have these foolscap page forms printed especially; they are not supplied. These forms deal with the components, with the ingredients, with rebates, with removals, with drawbacks, with removals ex warehouse, collection vouchers, in bond re warehousing. For every item that is moved out of a factory into a warehouse, out of one warehouse into another warehouse, a complicated form has to be filled in with costing, the price and certain other details which are being asked for. A large percentage of factories could not complete these records. The illusion is that each of these will be a bond store and that it will be possible to control the stock in these stores. Has the hon. the Minister not seen factories with stock piled up in the office, piled in the passages, accumulated in odd corners of the factory waiting for an especially busy delivery period? However, this will be a bond store and somehow in the vivid imagination of the Government there will be control over this uncontrollable stock. Every time an item is moved in or out of a store or a factory one of these forms will have to be filled in. Every time a bit of paint is put onto a toy you will have to calculate how much paint there is on the toy so that you can work out how much drawback you will receive under rebate for the component. That is what the law says; that is what the Bill before us says. The hon. the Minister can shake his head. The reason he has to shake his head is because this will not work. In practice he is already having to establish different procedures and different methods. But what we are being asked to vote for is a calculation on every item of the ingredients, how much is in it before filling in one of these complex forms. At the end of all these procedures, the accounting form, D.A. 75 must be filled in. This form will have to be <span class="col_8055-8056" refersTo="page_1180"/>completed by all these factories in quintuplet. It must have a 10 cent revenue stamp and must be accompanied by a bank guaranteed cheque. This is utter nonsense. These are established factories and if a cheque bounces they can take action the same as they would with income tax. But no; for every payment every month they must go to the bank to obtain a bank guaranteed cheque to accompany this form. D.A. 75, which 90 per cent of industrialists will find it impossible to maintain or to complete. That is what we are being asked to vote for. The hon. the Minister knows that industry has been to him and has explained that this is not practical. When you fill in all these accounts, all these forms, you also fill in &#x201C;A&#x201D; forms. Form 32A is to amend every mistake. Then when you send out samples with your traveller you have to charge those samples out and pay sales tax on them. When the salesman brings them back to the factory you fill in another form and can receive a rebate. How ridiculous can one get? Every box of samples that is sent out with a traveller has to be entered in the form as a sale from the factory. The cost must be worked out and sales tax must be paid on it. When the traveller brings these items back they will have to be rebated. But when these samples are sold eventually the full tax will be paid on the full price even though those samples are sold cheaply as they always are at the end of a season. They are shop soiled, handled by the customers and sold for a nominal amount. But because a certificate of value has been established, full tax will have to be paid on that. One can go on with aspect after aspect of this. Cash discounts are allowed, but no other discount. Repacking is a manufacturing process. If a firm buys in bulk and packs that into another packing, that becomes a manufacturing process and sales duty will have to be paid on the final price. Therefore, if you buy a bag of sugar for your store and pack that into half pound packets, you are manufacturing. You therefore have to pay sales duty on that sugar. Then you apply for a rebate on another of these forms so that you can get the sales tax repaid on the original item. Well, sugar is a bad example because there is no sales tax on it. However, this is the case with any item on which a sales tax has to be paid, for example sweets. If you buy a case of sweets and pack it into packets you will have to pay the sales duty on your final packet and apply for rebate on the duty paid on the original box. On every form, book or invoice printers will have to pay a sales duty. But what about the firms with their own printing works, printing their own forms and their own books? Who will pay for them? Will they have to work out the cost, establish a neutral value? We are being asked to place a tax on every book, receipt book, invoice book or whatever it may be. Will every firm that prints its own stationery, by whatever means, have to become a factory, license itself as a factory and pay sales tax on every bit of paper which it processes through its printing works, as well as paying tax on the paper of course? At least with imports the system is simple. There are two documents, namely a certified invoice and a bill of lading.</p>

<p>I want to propose to the hon. the Minister that he should listen to what industry has suggested to him. He should forget all this nonsensical and impossible documentation. He should have a simple sales tax based upon audited sales figures every quarter because every firm must have an auditor for its income tax. That auditor can give him a certified sales figure on taxable items every quarter. Once a quarter they can pay on that auditor&#x2019;s certificate instead of all this documentation, which is impossible. I want to suggest that the payment be 30 days and not 7 days afterwards. However, I do not have time to argue that. I also want to suggest that ingredients and components be rebated entirely when they are used in manufacturing processes because neither industry nor the Minister&#x2019;s department has the staff to control this. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department cannot control this. He does not have the staff to control what is being done now. We are simply creating a monstrous mechanism of paper filling which with those who are honest will lead merely to extra cost and trouble, while those who are dishonest will get away with it. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to simplify this and to do away with all this involved procedure. He should let us delete, as we will move in Committee, the essentials, the tax only on non-essentials&#x2014;on luxury goods&#x2014;applied on a much simpler basis.</p>

<p>There are also other matters, but I do not have time to deal with them now. There is only one I want to mention now. I have examples here of bills of entry where there is a nil duty, on labels for instance, supplied free with cloth. There is a sales duty in one case on estimated values of 75 cents and of 20 cents. There is no charge, but a form has to be filled in in quintuplet, all these procedures followed to collect a miserable duty of 10 cents at the end. That too could be done away with. It is absolute nonsense.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (Point) and the hon. member for Constantia very clearly stated the case of this side of the House in regard to our attitude concerning the Second Reading of this Bill which is to alter the application of the sales duty especially and the acceptance of that principle at this stage. I should like to address the House on a particular issue concerning the sales duty. Obviously this will be a duty adversely affecting a large number of people and therefore we will have to find ways and means of assisting them in some way. The question of providing rebates and refunds as far as the sales duty is concerned, is a most important issue. If one looks at Schedule No. 7 one will see that rebates and refunds of sales duty are permitted on goods for the use of the State, public hospitals and other institutions or bodies. I should like to suggest that <span class="col_8057-8058" refersTo="page_1181"/>the hon. the Minister should give consideration to extending the rebates to registered welfare organizations. We believe that these people deserve special consideration in view of the fact that they do receive a subsidy from the Government. However, the subsidy falls far short of many of the items they require for equipping these institutions. If the Government does not increase the subsidy to meet the extra sales duty that now has to be paid, it will still have to come from Revenue. Therefore, at the Committee Stage, I intend moving an amendment if the hon. the Minister does not indicate at this stage that he is prepared to give favourable consideration to the plea that these registered welfare organizations should receive rebates in regard to the sales duty.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether it is expected of me to reply to the debate now, before the adjournment of the House. I shall in any case probably have to reply further on Monday. We have just dealt with the Estimates of Expenditure this week. The Opposition did not move the amendment for the omission of one single amount from it. We had the Income Tax Act; the Opposition welcomed and accepted it without amendments. There is now an amount of money which has to be found. The hon. the Minister answered and dealt with these so-called alternative suggestions by the Opposition during the Budget debate. All that remains for me to do, is simply to reply to the alternative suggestion in so far as it relates to sales duty. The Opposition has not yet told us what it wants to suggest. So far we have only heard from them in the vaguest of terms that they want to levy a tax of perhaps 15 per cent to 20 per cent on luxury goods. The hon. member for Constantia as well as the hon. member for Durban (Point) both discussed luxury goods to-day. They have still made no effort to tell us what they mean by luxury goods. They have still not defined them. We still do not have the vaguest idea of what they plan to do.</p>

<p>We can now look forward to hearing in the Committee Stage what they mean by luxury goods and what the tariff is that they want to levy on those goods. Apart from that the Opposition wants to bring in a variety of other goods and make them subject to sales duty. They will also have to indicate to us in the Committee Stage precisely what they envisage in this connection.</p>

<p>The Opposition to-day made quite a point of the initial uncertainty with the introduction of the sales duty. I should like to make it very clear that this sales duty was not dreamt up overnight. As long ago as 1964 the Department had had a very thorough inquiry made into the introduction of a system of sales duty in South Africa. The proof of that lies in the fact that the Customs and Excise Act of 1964, the principal Act, was already worded by the Department at that time in such a way that a system of sales duty could be administered under it. We did not only recently discover it. The Act was drafted as long ago as 1964. In spite of what the hon. member for Durban (Point) said this Bill which we are now dealing with is really of a consequential nature.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, precisely. In order to show that it fits in and in order to show that it was expected, this Bill is actually a mere consequential one. I can count the clauses with a view to my reply to the House, but here are numerous clauses in which &#x201C;sales duty goods&#x201D; was added, or where &#x201C;excise duty&#x201D; was omitted and &#x201C;locally inserted goods&#x201D; inserted. It shows how well the system of the collection of sales duty fits into the Act which we already have. I shall go into greater detail on the intricacies of the Act which bother the hon. member for Durban (Point). It does not deal with clauses which we have only recently introduced into the Act. It deals with sections which already exist and are applied in connection with the collection of customs and excise duties.</p>

<p>There is one minor point which the hon. member raised towards the end of his speech and to which I should now like to reply. He maintained that we were occupying ourselves with trifles. The hon. member gave the example of office printing facilities. The hon. member wants offices which do their own printing to be exempted. What is then to become of the printing works which do printing as an occupation? Must they alone pay sales duty? Must all people in offices now withdraw their business from him and carry out their own printing to a certain extent in the offices and then not be subject to sales duty?</p>

<p>No, not duplicating machines. That is not the intention at all. The hon. member for Durban (Point) must not think that the Department will do anything silly with the introduction of this sales duty. We could not consult people before the introduction of sales duty. The Department could not consult persons, but the Department itself could investigate the matter. The hon. member for Durban (Point) must remember that there was no previous experience of this. What experience was there? This is something new in South Africa. I shall go into these guiding suggestions which were made. I shall go into the present negotiations which are there in order to facilitate these quarterly settlements. But to think that we started with this two months ago and that it operates well and to the reasonable satisfaction of the industries to-day is, I think, a very great achievement on our part.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Revenue Laws Amendment Bill, which is of a highly technical nature, as hon. members can see, amends a number of taxation laws, in the first place, to give effect to taxation proposals which have been laid upon the Table and, in the second place, to provide for the imposition of certain taxes of the Republic, namely transfer duties, stamp duties, and marketable securities tax in South-West Africa, with effect from 1st October, 1969.</p>

<p>In addition, certain other amendments are proposed which relate mainly to the said taxes. Some of the amendments are of a purely administrative nature, for example the amendment effected by clause 2 to the Marketable Securities Tax Act, which provides for an extension of the period in which the marketable securities tax is payable; or the amendment effected by clause 8 to section 12 of the Transfer Duty Act, in which a change is made in the duties of registration officers in order to relieve them of the unnecessary work involved in the careful checking of transfer duty receipts&#x2014;something which is done by the Revenue Department and audit inspectors; or the amendment made by clause 21 to section 24 (4) (a) of the Stamp Duties Act in order to lay down an alternative basis for the preparation of the quarterly statements of shortterm insurers.</p>

<p>Other amendments effect certain changes in the taxes. For example, provision is made for exemption from the stamp duty on the transfer of marketable securities by a foreign parent company to a South African subsidiary company in the case where such a transfer takes place at the transfer of a branch of the parent company in the Republic. This exemption may be compared to a similar exemption from transfer duties which was introduced in the Transfer Duty Act in 1964.</p>

<p>The amendment made by clause 26 (1) (c) to Item 18 (7) of the Stamp Duties Act with reference to cessions of insurance policies may also be mentioned. The stamp duty on a cession of an insurance policy is only applicable to life insurance policies at present. In terms of the amendment all insurance policies, for example fire insurance policies, will also be subject to the stamp duty on cessions. This amendment reinstates the position as it existed under the Stamp Duties Act of 1962. Cessions of policies are usually made in order to provide security for a money debt and it is found that such cessions often have to be stamped in terms of the higher stamp duty under Item 20. As a result of the amendment of Item 18 (7) a lower stamp duty will be payable in the cases which I mentioned.</p>

<p>Important amendments are made by clauses 20 (1) (h) and 25 (1) (b) in order to combat evasion of the stamp duty in respect of the registration of transfer of marketable securities. By making use of the provisions of the Companies Act the shares of a shareholder in a company can be cancelled so that his interest in the company automatically passes to the remaining shareholders without registration of transfer. Stamp duty is levied on cancellations of shares (with or without return of capital) where the shareholder is also compensated in another way, for example where shares in another company are issued to him (with or without subscription).</p>

<p>The provisions relating to cancellations of shares, as well as the other provisions of the Bill, are dealt with in the explanatory memorandum which is in the possession of hon. members.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister has pointed out, the principal purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Budget proposals in regard to stamp duties and the marketable securities tax and to bring South-West Africa within the scope of certain Acts.

<p>Clause 6 of this Bill makes provision for the authorities to impose transfer duty in respect of a property where a transaction apparently has not taken place at arm&#x2019;s length and a valuation has to be made by the officials concerned for stamp duty purposes and transfer duty purposes. Now, it has always been the position in the past that where a property or a piece of land has been sold and the price is not a fair value the Commissioner or the Receivers of Revenue have <span class="col_8061-8062" refersTo="page_1183"/>had the right to fix what they consider to be a fair value, but that has been the end of the transaction. The value has been fixed, the duty has been paid and the transaction is complete. Now, in terms of clause 6 of this Bill, the authorities take unto themselves the right to further revise the valuation within a period of two years, and this is going to create an enormous amount of uncertainty in regard to transactions. In other words, one sells or buys a property to-day and one pays the transfer duty on the value assessed by the authority concerned and then within a period of two years there is a possibility of that value being revised. I think it is wrong that we should have this type of uncertainty in our legislation. After all, the official, whoever he may be, who fixes the valuation is an official who is operating under delegated authority so to do and I do not think it is correct for the hon. the Minister and the Department to come to us and say that when it is reviewed by the inspector he shall have the right to make a change. Surely when an official makes a valuation for transfer duty or stamp duty purposes, that should then be the valuation. The Department should not be able to come back within a period of two years and say that they now want to revise the duty and you will have to pay more, particularly to-day when land is changing hands so rapidly. Over a period of two years you may find that there have been two or three owners and that the value even in a year&#x2019;s time or six months after the transaction has taken place may be so enhanced as the result of circumstances that it might affect the basic valuation of the original sale retrospectively. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister why this clause is necessary, because once an official of the Department has made a valuation we believe the Department should stand by it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown mentioned the uncertainty which exists in regard to a transaction when the Department is able to review the valuation again later. Of course, this uncertainty exists in any case at present when a transaction takes place and when a valuation is placed on the transaction. The Department can at any time go back and re-examine that transaction. Hon. members will know that in the case of such a transaction there are two prices in the first place, the buying price or the compensation which is paid, say, for a piece of land and, secondly, if no compensation was paid, there is the declared value. On one of those two values the duty is paid. The Department can now at any time go back and query either of those values and place a higher value on it. Now, the Act states that once the Department has placed its own value on it, it is final. According to a court decision, we cannot do it a second time, but now it often happens in practice that a transaction takes place and that stamp duties are paid either according to the declared value or according to the selling price. Then, in practice, an official of the Department goes and attaches another value to it, the fair value. In practice you often find that this official is an ordinary clerk who has little or no knowledge of that kind of thing and who places a completely wrong value on that item. If these were all senior officials who determined this fair value then it would have been a different matter, but in practice this is not the case. The magistrate&#x2019;s office may be situated in a Small place and the representative of the Department may be a completely junior official who places a value on it which is a completely fictitious value. That is why we ask that the Secretary may go back within two years; where he has an unlimited period in other cases, we ask him to be allowed to go back in these cases within two years only. It is in order to protect the Department in cases where it does not get enough transfer duties. I think this is quite fair.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the circumstances I shall reply very briefly. I just want to refer to a few matters. The hon. member for Constantia raised the point that there were very few data available on which we based this sales duty, and he also said that the data that were available, were outdated. As regards the second aspect, the question of the data being outdated, I just want to say that it can at least be accepted that we adapted the data on a percentage basis to bring them into line with the position in more recent years. As regards the incompleteness of the data on which we based this sales duty, I just want to say that the matter was very thoroughly investigated and that the data were not as incomplete as hon. members might think. Hon. members must bear in mind that the Franzsen Commission went into this matter very thoroughly and that the commission had experts before it to calculate how much this sales duty could possibly yield, and the evidence, data and statistics that were at the disposal of the Franzsen Commission have admittedly not been published, but they were also available to the Department, which continually had some of its best officials with the Franzsen Commission, and which co-operated with the Franzsen Commission. For that reason I can only say that the result we arrived at on the basis of the figures we had available, was arrived at to the best of our ability. This is, if I may call it thus, a pure calculation, a pure assessment, on the basis of figures we made as reliable as possible, but to conclude this <span class="col_8063-8064" refersTo="page_1184"/>point, I just want to point out that there are no statistics in South Africa in connection with the introduction of a sales duty. We will now for the first time be building up statistics in respect of sales duty in South Africa, and we shall have statistics in this regard at the end of this year and at the end of the next few years, so that in future this House will be able to base its policy and the implementation of its policy on scientific grounds.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) referred to the initial confusion, the initial uncertainty and the problems that initially arose in connection with the application of the sales duty as it was introduced. The hon. member admitted that one could not consult people or negotiate with them beforehand, because it was a duty which had major implications at introduction, because it took effect from the moment it was tabled. That is why initially there were many problems and even a measure of confusion. We were entering a totally new field, but I want to repeat that I think that in two months&#x2019; time we have made excellent progress in introducing order into this whole situation. Before leaving this second point, I also just want to mention that it was decided that it would be a duty that would be introduced in respect of commodities at varying rates and that the duty would be levied at the starting point. It must be very clear that it is not a general turnover tax, and because it is such a tax, it is in my opinion a tax that cannot be handled in any way than the way in which we are handling it, i.e. through integration with the Customs and Excise Act. The practical problems mentioned by the hon. member we can discuss separately under the various clauses of the Bill in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Durban (Point) referred to last year&#x2019;s legislation. He repeated what he said last year, i.e. that the legislation was unnecessary, that it was too wide and was put through too hurriedly. I just want to tell the House that all the clauses but one of the legislation we passed here last year, have been implemented, and that they are working well. It is my conviction that the legislation was necessary to the better administration of the Customs and Excise Act. The hon. member also said that the impression had been created that the entire trade had been involved in fraud. I want to tell the hon. member that this is a totally wrong statement. I cannot accept this; I reject that statement. Neither the hon. the Minister nor the Deputy Minister nor the Secretary created that impression. It may be the hon. member&#x2019;s personal impression, and if he repeats it, which he is free to do, I shall be glad if he will substantiate it with quotations from the speeches or statements of the responsible people, i.e. the Minister, the Deputy Minister, and the Secretary, because we have never stated or implied that the entire trade which is connected with customs and excise is not to be trusted.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the court cases that took place, and said that the small number of court cases was proof that the mountain had brought forth a mouse. I just want to tell the hon. member that the court cases that have already been heard, are only those that were heard in the Cape Division of the Supreme Court. My information is that other cases will follow in other provinces.</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Third Time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have come to the final stage, the Third Reading, of the Appropriation Bill, where it is customary not to move an amendment because if the amendment is successful, nobody will get paid. But that does not mean that we are satisfied with the administration of the country by this Government. Far from it. I want to say in the first instance that we are disappointed that the Minister in moving the Third Reading, did not give us an indication of his final surplus. I think we should at least have the final figures because we have only had estimates submitted to us so far and some of these estimates are not very well calculated guesses. We would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether the surplus is bigger than he indicated in his Budget speech, and, if so, how much it is bigger so that the country may know to what extent it has been overtaxed by this Government for yet another year.</p>

<p>Sir, there still remain some problems which worry the people concerned with finance in this country. The Minister has indicated that he is trying to get an increase in the price of gold. We wish him well in that task, but his predecessor, the late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges, also indicated that he was hoping to get an increase in the price of gold; his predecessor, the late Mr. Havenga, also indicated that he hoped to get an increase in the price of gold, and we are still looking for the pot at the end of the rainbow and wonder when that increase is coming. I do not suppose the Minister will be able to tell us, but year after year we are kept alive with this promise and with the suggestion that when this problem is resolved, then all our difficulties will be over. Of course, that is far from being the case. All our difficulties will not be over when the price of gold is increased.</p>

<p>But meanwhile we have had a further difficulty in the past year and that is the difficulty of selling gold. The Minister knows that he has had difficulties overseas with the International Monetary Fund. He prefers this matter not to be debated in detail in this House and we respect his request; we realize his difficulties, <span class="col_8065-8066" refersTo="page_1185"/>but on the other hand we realize that South Africa, while it is still the biggest producer of gold and is still the biggest possible seller of gold, is still kept at bay because we cannot determine the price of gold by putting it on the free market in large quantities, because it will have the effect of depressing the price of gold, and a depression in the price of gold will add to the difficulties of this Government.</p>

<p>Sir, we find that the difficulties in regard to the sale of gold on the free market have brought with them a further problem and that is the problem of Special Drawing Rights. The Minister has indicated in the Other Place that he expects shortly to resolve these difficulties with regard to Special Drawing Rights and the difficulties with regard to the sale of gold to the International Monetary Fund and on the free market. But our doubt is this: Is that promise going to prove to be as optimistic as the promise with regard to an increase in the price of gold? Are we going to be kept on the end of a bit of string for another session or another two, three or four sessions? It is guess work all the time, but meanwhile can we be satisfied that the Minister has control of the situation? So far as the International financial situation is concerned, the Minister has no control over it; he is entirely dependent upon his negotiations with the banking members of the International Monetary Fund; he is dependent upon his success in his negotiations with overseas bankers and with international organizations, and there he is very much in the minority. The indications are that he has received a certain amount of support in recent months, but he is faced with the real difficulty in this country that while he has very high gold reserves, he is short of foreign exchange for the requirements of the country. He has been able to make an agreement recently which has tided him over his immediate difficulties, but we do not know to what extent this is a temporary patch-up and how far it is going to carry him between now and the next session. Whether the Minister can give us any information at this stage, I do not know, but so long as this matter is in doubts, so long will we have the present difficulties in the international field, which in turn have their effect on the local field.</p>

<p>As far as internal finance is concerned, I think the Minister will agree with us that we are very much out of balance. The Minister is uncertain as to whether to have fiscal or monetary control; whether to have the discipline of the one or the discipline of the other or the discipline of both, but we have the unusual position that to-day in South Africa it is easier to get an overdraft to buy shares than to get a loan from the building societies to buy a house. That is the position; it is easier to get a loan or an overdraft to speculate on shares or to buy shares than to get a loan from the building societies, and it is almost as difficult to get a loan from the building societies as to get a loan from the Land Bank. That is a ludicrous position. Sir, when things go well financially, the Government takes credit for it, and when we are in a financial tangle, as we are at the present moment, then the Government must take the blame for it.</p>

<p>I would like to know from the Minister whether he sees any daylight as far as the building societies are concerned. He introduced a Bill this Session, which was passed the other day, which indicated that the Minister hoped to resolve some of the problems of the building societies. But will this new legislation cure those difficulties, or will the borrowing rate of the building societies be increased. If the borrowing rate is increased, will the rate at which the building societies borrow from the public, i.e. 7 per cent, be increased to attract funds, and if that is increased, will the lending rate of the building societies be increased? Will it go up from 8&#x00BD; per cent to 9 per cent or 9&#x00BD; per cent? Because if that is the only way to attract funds to the building societies, what success will the Minister have with his RSA loans?</p>

<p>If the building societies increase their borrowing rate to more than 7 per cent, and increase their lending rate as well, they will experience further difficulties. To-day the public who are speculating are not interested in returns on their investments. They are more interested in growth, which will yield no tax to the fiscus, and which will help them to make a profit. The excess liquidity which we find at the moment in the banking sector is creating difficulties of speculation, a shortage of funds in building societies, and a shortage of funds in the Land Bank, as far as the general public are concerned. The Minister&#x2019;s colleague in Australia said the other day that too much money is in circulation. He proposed that exchange control be relaxed. The Minister of Finance the other day indicated that, while exchange control was under consideration, it was not promised. Now who is right? Does the Minister foresee that there is going to be a relaxation of exchange control? If there is a relaxation of exchange control, will investment in other countries to the north of us be encouraged? If such investment is encouraged, how will the Minister answer those workers in South Africa, those ordinary people who wish to obtain loans from building societies? How will he explain to them that money is available for investment outside South Africa, but that it is not available for them to build their own homes?</p>

<p>These are problems of financial management with which the Minister is concerned. The problem I have just mentioned is one of those he will have to solve. He has my sympathy because of the difficulty of these problems. They are not easy to solve. However, it is our duty to show to the country that the problems are there. When we disperse in a few days time, the Government will be free to do as they like for seven months. They are then not subject to criticism, except at political meetings. The Government is then free to do as it likes. If the country then finds itself in a worse position than it is to-day, the Government <span class="col_8067-8068" refersTo="page_1186"/>will have to account for that position next session.</p>

<p>As far as the public are concerned, they will ask at the end of the session: &#x201C;What has been achieved in five months?&#x201D; There have been 21 years of Nationalist Party rule. This fact has been celebrated, but the ordinary man in the street has not yet seen his financial difficulties resolved. The ordinary man cannot understand why share speculators can obtain money easily and why money for hire purchase transactions is fairly easily obtainable. He has no difficulty in financing his car, his refrigerator, his radio or his washing machine, but he has very great difficulty in financing a new house and setting up a home. He finds that money will be easy to come by for outside investment, if the Minister relaxes exchange control, but he cannot understand why he cannot have his home built. We are concerned about this. The Minister of Community Development has indicated that there is a great shortage of houses. The building society movement is finding itself in great difficulties. They cannot lend money for the next three months. These are real problems which affect the ordinary man in the street, the ordinary voter in the country, the sort of person with whom the Government has lost touch after 21 years in power.</p>

<p>We find on the one hand that shares are oversubscribed many times over. Who do we find leading in this scramble for shares? The Government itself. The recent ventures of Iscor and the I.D.C. into the private sector have indicated that the Government is competing with private enterprise, and picking the plums of some of the bigger industries in the private sector. Industrialists are concerned about this. There has been criticism from leading industrialists about this competition from the Government. They have asked: &#x201C;Where does it stop?&#x201D; We have tried to get answers from the Government during the past session, and we have failed. Meanwhile the development is taking place and meanwhile the Government agencies are competing with the private sector. Does the Minister regard that as a healthy sign, especially when he talks of South Africa being a free enterprise country? Does he regard it as a healthy sign when Government agencies are competing with the private sector, and are encouraging the scramble for shares? The Government agencies are leading in the participation in growth funds. Is the Minister satisfied with the number of growth funds? We have heard that another three are to be established. Surely, the Minister, who on the one hand is trying to get money for the country&#x2019;s development, should not on the other hand be encouraging the growth of mutual funds and the support of such funds by Government agencies. Has the price of shares not been artificially increased? Is the market for shares not a very narrow one? We have several mutual funds all competing for our industrial shares, with the result that many of our shares have a yield of as little as .6 and .3 per cent. When is the day of reckoning coming? The Minister talks about fingers being burnt. Is it only fingers that are going to be burnt, or is there going to be a real flare-up?</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that I am pessimistic, but perhaps he will remember Black Friday. Perhaps the hon. member knows what it is to walk the streets looking for work in a depression. Can the hon. member guarantee that the present state of affairs will continue for all time? Does he mean to say that for all time we must expect a yield of .6 per cent? Is that healthy? I am glad the hon. member made that interjection. He obviously knows what he is talking about. Can he assure the country that it is a healthy state of affairs when our leading shares give a return of only .6 per cent? Does he regard that as healthy? No wonder the Minister of Finance has warned the country that this is not healthy. He has said that people will get their fingers burnt. Who is being pessimistic? The Minister has warned the country of this difficulty. But are the warnings sufficient, because when the flare-up comes, more than fingers are going to be burnt. There are going to be very sorry faces in South Africa. The Minister will then say &#x201C;I told you so&#x201D;. I think the Minister should exert some discipline apart from giving warnings. That is his responsibility.</p>

<p>If we are going to have development in the private sector of this country, the private sector must know where it can develop. It must not be discouraged. Industries have for many years relied on wholesale merchants to take the bulk of their products. Wholesale merchants now find themselves discouraged by no less an organization than the Department of Bantu Administration. Wholesale merchants have been the sheet anchor of business for many years. Wholesale merchants have the experience to provide the necessary advice to the retailer. Right throughout South Africa, not only in the towns, but also in the country and the Bantu homelands, as they are called now, or the Bantu reserves, as they were called in 1948, the wholesaler could deal with these traders. Now we have the situation where the wholesaler cannot enter these Bantu areas without a permit. The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development is deliberately discouraging the wholesaler, and in fact wherever he can prohibiting him, from dealing in the Bantu areas. He insists that the Bantu retailer should deal with the Bantu Development Corporation. The Bantu Development Corporation is now the wholesale organization for those areas. I have a permit with me now, indicating the extent to which the wholesaler is discouraged. The Minister of Bantu Administration said last November, when he addressed the National African Chamber of Commerce in Pretoria, that he took a very serious view of the threat posed by the development <span class="col_8069-8070" refersTo="page_1187"/>of shops not owned by Africans on the borders of the African areas. I have raised this matter before in this Session, and I have asked how far from the borders such a shop is allowed to be situated. A white shop is certainly not allowed inside the borders of a Bantu area. These shops are, however, now not even allowed to be near the border areas. The Minister has not yet replied to me. Wholesale merchants are concerned because they cannot plan ahead. Everything is now controlled by permits. The merchants&#x2019; travellers have to be subject to permits. Every obstacle is put in their way. Of course the industrialists, instead of having to look to a wholesaler, whose credit they know is sound, now have to give credit either to the Bantu retailers or to the Bantu Development Corporation. The Bantu Development Corporation can assure him that his account will be paid but many of the retail traders are saying that they prefer to deal with a wholesaler because the wholesaler can give them a better variety. Anyone who has been to a Bantu Development Corporation wholesale organization and has seen the selection there as compared with the selection of a modern sophisticated wholesale merchant will have no doubt at all as to why the Bantu trader prefers to deal with the wholesale merchant rather than with the Bantu Development Corporation. Trade can only be carried out with the retailer under restricted conditions. Here for 21 years we have dealt with a government whose internal financial policy as it affects the wholesaler, the industrialist and the retailer indicates beyond any doubt that Government interference, Government obstacles and Government red tape are curtailing the normal development which should take place in a modern sophisticated society.</p>

<p>The ordinary man is concerned because he realizes that inflation is still persisting. At the beginning of the Session the hon. the Minister indicated that he hoped to have inflation under control. He indicated in the Other Place recently that he hoped that inflation would be controlled very soon. But what do we find? The industrial organizations of South Africa have advised their members to give the Bantu an increase of R1 per week. Most industrial organizations have encouraged their members to give the Bantu an increase of R1 per week. That increase in industrial salaries of R1 per week is going to have an effect right throughout South Africa. That is an indication of the increase in the cost structure. The increase of R1 per week is deserved because the cost of living has gone up for the lowest income group. The introduction of the sales tax which has not yet been passed by this House will cover a range of commodities which is so wide that unless the hon. the Minister agrees to the suggestions we will make in the Committee Stage, it is bound to increase the cost of living, for the lowest section of the community. Industry has anticipated this and has forestalled difficulties by recommending an increase in the wages of its workers to the extent of R1 per week. It is not only the Bantu worker who has been affected by inflation and the increase in the cost of living. The old age pensioner has been similarly affected. Old age homes have been affected by the increased costs. Social welfare organizations have been similarly affected. Every facet of commercial and industrial life feels the effect of the increased costs, brought about by the Government&#x2019;s failure to handle inflation and the increase in the cost structure. This is a state of affairs which is discouraging many of the poorer sections of the community who feel absolutely desperate but they cannot grumble, particularly if they are non-White because any kind of grumbling is treated as agitation. As I said, we will now disperse for seven months and go back to our constituencies. What do we tell the people when we go back? We tell them that taxes for the wealthy have been reduced and that taxes for the poor have been increased. That is the state of affairs. We finish this Session by telling the public that the taxes for the wealthy have been reduced.</p>

<p>We asked for a reduction in the taxes. We asked for the reduction of the taxes of certain people in the tax bulge. That was what we asked for but the taxes for the poor have been increased and the responsibility for that lies fairly and squarely on the shoulders of this Government. Throughout the recess we will tell the people of South Africa that this Government has been so long in power that it is only concerned with the wealthy, those in the know and those in the upper strata. The ordinary man has been forgotten, the non-European is being kept in his place, the poor have been ignored and the ordinary working man has also been ignored by this Government which is the Government of the big battalions. Having been in power for 21 years, the Government has forgotten the ordinary man.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made mention a few times that the National Party had now been governing for 21 years. He said that the financial position of the ordinary citizen was less favourable, that it was unbalanced, and his problems had not been solved. It is a long time since I heard such an exaggerated statement on financial matters as that the hon. member made. He was speaking completely at random. He adduced no proof of the statements he made. I know that the situation is just the reverse of what he said it was. He knows that the country has never before been in such a fortunate economic position, and has never been so prosperous as it is to-day. He knows that there has never been so much prosperity and the standard of living of the population has never been as high as it is to-day. Everyone in South Africa, responsible experts, and overseas <span class="col_8071-8072" refersTo="page_1188"/>experts, cannot stop talking about the tremendous economic progress South Africa has been making during the past six to seven years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Does that include the farmers as well?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visser">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it includes the farmers as well. We shall come to that. Everybody is talking about the economic miracle of South Africa. The hon. member for Pine-town, however, states that economically things are going badly for South Africa. I want to reply that nobody believes him. He does not even believe himself. Not a single member on that side of the House, if he searches his conscience, believes that statement. If there is one thing of which the National Party can be proud then it is that it has brought about prosperity for the entire population, White and non-White. Nobody, not even the hon. members on that side of the House, can sketch a different picture. They make general statements and, as I said, nobody believes them.</p>

<p>I want to refer to a few of the matters raised by the hon. member. He asked the hon. Minister whether he could, at this early juncture, inform the House what he expected the surplus for the ensuing year to be. But the hon. member knows that only two months have elapsed, April and May. How could the hon. the Minister at this early stage give this House that information? What responsible Minister could at this early stage inform this House that he expects the surplus to be far smaller or far greater. Take the example of sales tax. The sales tax has not even been collected yet. The first sales tax will be collected at the beginning of July this year. This shows once again how unrealistic the point of view of that side of the House is. Would they at this stage, two months after the last Budget, inform the country that the situation is such and such, and that they expect a larger deficit or surplus? Surely that would be irresponsible. He knows it is impossible, and not only impossible, but unrealistic. I almost want to say that to a certain extent it is irresponsible.</p>

<p>The hon. member said something about a shortage of foreign currency which the country was supposedly experiencing. That is not the case. I think the position as regards the availability of overseas currency is still quite an easy one. I do not want to say that we have a great surplus, but at this stage the position is such that the hon. the Minister need feel no concern in that regard. He need not lose any sleep over the position.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned the question of housing. This was the only example the hon. member used to show that economically-speaking the National Party was not governing the country well. That is not correct. 1968 was an exceptional year for the building societies. It was one of the most successful years in their history. I have the proof of this. The following report appears, for example, in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 10th June, 1969&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Most of the building societies whose balance sheets are being issued right now reveal that the year to 31st March, 1969, was a record one in all respects and it looked as if they might have passed through the worst of their troubles with the introduction of the tax-free shares just over a year ago.</block>

<p>I can quote figures to prove that that hon. member is not correct. In January, 1969, the funds of the building societies in respect of deposits and shares amounted to R2.044 billion. In April, 1969, the figure was R2.2 billion. In spite of the speculation fever among the tax paying public, the building societies have, from January to the end of April more or less maintained their position. During the past month there has been a deterioration. We do not have the figures available yet, but that is the impression which is being created. We want to accept that this is the case. But it is as a result of extraordinary speculation and special circumstances arising out of the need of the public to participate in the speculation in order to acquire a certain shareholding in one of the growth funds. That is one single example at the present moment. About a week ago the hon. the Minister announced certain measures in the House to alleviate the position of the building societies. There are, for example, debentures which will be negotiable on the exchange. Would it not be fairer to first wait and see what the results of the concessions are which the hon. Minister made? Must the one measure after the other simply be taken if the situation is a merely temporary one? Consequently that appears to be the position at this present stage. It cannot be expected of the hon. the Minister to take new steps now to cope with a temporary situation. But apart from that no fewer than 28,000 houses were built in the year 1967-&#x2019;68 in South Africa. During the past year 27,000 houses have been built. And what are the needs of South Africa? It was calculated that the annual need for new housing units in South Africa was 27,000 units per year. This we have achieved during the past two years. We have in addition to that built a further 1,000 houses. The only responsible conclusion which can be drawn from that is that the building of new houses, even during the past few years, is keeping pace with the requirements which exist. The accusations which have been made from that side of the House simply do not withstand the test. We know that new houses will continually have to be built. If new situations should arise as a result of which there may possibly appear to be a temporary shortage of houses the Government will, as it has always done in the past, take the necessary steps from year to year. But we do not have a total State economy. We cannot tell investors where they must invest their money. The <span class="col_8073-8074" refersTo="page_1189"/>Government&#x2019;s financial policy is aimed at trying to strike a balance in the economy. But since we have a system of private undertakings in our country it is obvious that the private investor and entrepreneur must be afforded the opportunity of moving in the directions they think are best for them. The duty of the State is simply to construct the broad framework within which they can move. I want to ask that hon. member whether he wants the State to govern the economy in such a way that it tells the investor where he must invest his money? Surely that would be extremely unsound. I therefore want to state that neither that side of the House nor the public outside would subscribe to such a hypothesis. The system of private initiative would be prejudiced in that way. Eventually one would be much worse off. The National Party is not ashamed of the housing which it has provided for the people of South Africa over the past 20 years. The position is under much better control to-day than the position was in 1948 when this Government took over.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the position in regard to inflation and the increase in the costs structure. We concede that the sales duty which was levied would bring a once-only increase. We do not deny that. But even if that should be taken into account, South Africa is still one of the countries with the lowest cost structure in the world. A year ago the <i>Star</i> made a survey of the cost of living conditions in various cities. The conclusion they arrived at was that &#x201C;Johannesburg is still the cheapest city in the world&#x201D;. Those of us who have had the privilege of being able to travel about abroad know that when it comes to cost of living conditions South Africa need not take second place to any other developed country. I am speaking now of countries which are at more or less the same stage of development as South Africa. This is the only fair comparison which can be drawn. Compared with the position overseas it will be found that, as far as cost of living is concerned too, South Africa is still a land of Canaan. The cost of living index does not reflect the cost of living position in any specific country. It only indicates the increase in the cost of living over a specified period of time. That is all it indicates. As far as this is concerned, South Africa&#x2019;s position compares very well indeed with that of the rest of the world. I have here a number of figures dating from 1963 which is now the new basis here for international calculations. Since 1963 the cost of living in South Africa has increased by 18 per cent. The countries where there was a lower increase are Australia, Germany, and the U.S.A. There the increase was 16 per cent, or only 1 per cent lower than in South Africa. Now we also know a country such as the U.S.A. were a few points lower than South Africa a few years ago. It is also probable that the increase in the cost of living in the U.S.A., which has always been the example of how to keep cost of living in check, is now higher than that in South Africa.</p>

I am afraid that hon. members on that side of the House, no matter how hard they try, will never succeed in convincing the people outside that South Africa has not succeeded in keeping the cost of living in check. The cost of living increase over the past number of years and the absolute cost of living as far as South Africa is concerned, compare very favourably indeed. This Government is aware that, for many reasons, it must keep the cost of living in check. But if we compare it with the tremendous increase in growth and prosperity in our economy then it is in fact amazing, and a sign of major success, that South Africa has, in the midst of that, being able to succeed in keeping the cost of living in check. After 21 years this Government can look back with a great measure of satisfaction and gratitude at the fact that it has succeeded, under difficult circumstances, in bringing about so much progress in South Africa and at the same time keeping the cost of living down. That is one thing that I cannot understand about the opposite side of the House. When the Estimates were introduced on 26th March, they put forward proposals which would have had precisely the reverse effect to what they were advocating. It was. their idea that the hon. the Minister should budget for a financial deficit. One member after the other rose and referred to the wonderful proposals by the hon. member for Constantia. However, they did not at that moment say that what they were really advocating was short-term financing under inflationistic conditions. Initially even a periodical such as the <i>Financial Mail</i> did not understand it very well. Initially this periodical also supported the hon. member. But it was not long before the <i>Financial News</i> admitted that it had made a mistake.</p>

<p>It took it a week to come to this conclusion, and it then stated that if the Government had financed for a short period, as the hon. member for Constantia had proposed, &#x201C;it would have been highly inflationary&#x201D;. I want to go so far as to say that hon. members cannot for one moment advocate that the cost of living should be curbed, and then propose a budget policy which would have precisely the reverse effect. Surely that is not responsible conduct. Surely that is not fair. How must we assess the speeches made by hon. members opposite if they are so contradictory? After the speech by the hon. member for Constantia in reply to the Budget speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance, hon. members really cannot, with a clear conscience, continue to accuse the Government of encouraging inflationistic tendencies. Hon. members on the opposite side dare not do so, because their approach was highly inflationary and that assertion is supported by the <i>Financial Mail.</i> The hon. member referred to the <span class="col_8075-8076" refersTo="page_1190"/>general economic situation and tried to create the impression, even though he did not specifically state this, that things were not going very well.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned the yield rates. The low yield rates is a sign of high share prices. We on this side of the House also admit candidly that we think share prices are too high and the yield to low. However, the emphasis does not fall on the yield rates, but on the high prices of shares. This is nothing else but an indication of the confidence of the investing public in the economic growth and potential of South Africa. Those prices are to-day considerably higher than those on the London Share Markets, by almost 20 per cent. They are also considerably higher than those on the New York Share Market. To say however that this is an indication of a lack of confidence on the part of the public in the value of money, is not correct. The hon. member himself furnished a reply to this, which is for the most part that the public is confident that it will be able to make a capital profit with their shares. How does one make a capital profit? One can make a capital profit when there is growth and a high yield on those shares. We maintain that those yields are too low to-day but this does not reflect any lack of confidence, as the hon. member alleged. It reflects, in our humble opinion, an excess of confidence. It reflects a confidence, which in our humble opinion, is not justified.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Minister said it was due to a lack of confidence in money.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visser">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister emphasized that it was primarily due to share investments which were being made in order to make a profit on the growth. The hon. the Minister made this very clear. In the world as a whole it is correct that the confidence in the value of money can be reflected in the prices of shares. In a specific situation in which South Africa finds itself to-day, and in which the share market is functioning to-day, it is for the most part an excessive confidence in the growth of those shares concerned. These people are primarily interested in making a capital profit on the share market. The argument that this is a sign of the unsound economic conditions in South Africa, is not correct. We want to concede that an unsound speculation fever is prevailing, but we hope that this position will subsequently be rectified. This situation is attributable to the excessively large quantity of money in South Africa, and the high degree of liquidity.</p>

<p>I want to point out that the Government has, during the past four months, succeeded in more or less keeping the quantity of money and <i>quasi</i>-money more or less within bounds. In December the total amount of money and <i>quasi</i>-money was R3,464.6 million. At the end of March this year it was R3,435 million. In other words, there was a small decrease; in fact, one can say that it remained more or less constant. I maintain that this is an achievement, taking into consideration the fact that large quantities of money are still entering the country. This is an achievement on the part of the Government, i.e. to have prevented there being a vast increase in the quantity of money. Most of the other countries in the world are struggling with the same problem, i.e. that the quantity of money is increasing at a rate of approximately 2 per cent. During the past three months South Africa has succeeded in more or less stabilizing this position.</p>

<p>The National Party is proud of its record over the past 21 years. If South Africa, during the next 21 years, makes the same economic progress it has made during the past 21 years, this country will be a very fortunate one. The hon. member once again tried to raise a cloud of dust in regard to the wholesalers who are experiencing difficulties in the Bantu areas. Does the hon. member want these dealers to enter the Bantu areas without restriction and without permits? Must there be no control? My experience does not coincide in any way with what the hon. member said here to-day. I do not want to suggest that there are not individual cases where people have experienced difficulties in entering those areas, but these cases are the exception and not the rule. The rule is that the wholesalers to-day are, under the permit system, moving quite easily and freely to the Bantu areas. They are bringing goods and services to the Bantu areas where these are needed to serve this population. Any statement based on fact will indicate that the Bantu areas and economic areas are generally still functioning as a whole. They are functioning as a large economic unity, to the best interests of the Bantu areas and those of South Africa.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that I have come to the conclusion during the past year that the hon. members of the Opposition do not understand what the economic development programme of the Government in respect of the Bantu areas and the economically backward areas is. One moment they are saying that border area development is a failure, and the next they are saying, as somebody said in the Other Place: &#x201C;Every week a new factory goes up in the border areas.&#x201D; This is a sign of the success achieved by the Government. On the other hand, hon. members say that the Bantu areas are not being developed rapidly enough and that not sufficient factories are being established. What is the true state of affairs when one is dealing with an economically backward area? In other countries it has been found that developing such areas is a major problem. It is a long drawn out process, and it is necessary to proceed with care for if things are done too rapidly great errors are made. When development is launched one must develop those economically backward areas which have the potential in the first place and which can get going the soonest.</p>

<p><span class="col_8077-8078" refersTo="page_1191"/>In the second place specific growth points for development must be established in that area. But if one takes the so-called border areas, one finds that a few growth points already exist. It is desirable and logical that a start should be made with the development of those growth points. After those growth points have been established, and after they have been developed, the next step is to seek other growth points and develop them. If one compares the growth points within the Bantu areas with those in the border areas, one will find that it is essential that both should be developed. But, as the private initiative system works, those areas which are the easiest to develop, which have the largest population, and which already have a nucleus of development, will be developed first. As development progresses one can turn to the remoter areas. This has in fact been the experience in England, Italy and France. The Bantu areas development and border areas development are not competing with each other; they supplement each other. I should like to see the day when that side of the House lend their support to the solution of the great problem facing this Government, i.e. the problem of the development of economically backward areas. I should like to see that day when the Government receives positive help in that direction. They must not continually be criticizing various aspects.</p>

<p>Hon. members may be in favour of it, but when steps are taken, they criticize them. Among hon. members there is an ambiguous standpoint in this regard. Since we are now reaching the end of the 1969 Session I am afraid that the speeches which we heard from that side of the House did not create much confidence in their ability to constitute an alternative government. I think those hon. members have furnished proof to-day of 21 years of incompetence in the Opposition benches. It is not only we who think so; the voters outside also think so. This Government has produced 21 years of government which any other population of any other country, if they could have achieved as much, would have been proud. The population of our country and this side of the House is proud of the National Party for everything it has done for its people and for its country.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it is quite right that we should stop and take stock and have a look at the profit and loss accounts and the balance sheets on the economic and financial front, at the Third Reading of this Bill. We should particularly look at what has transpired on this front during the past five months. My hon. friend from Florida attempted to do this, but I think he has made one mistake. I think he forgot, that when you look at a profit and loss account or when you look at a balance sheet, there are not only credits but also debits. I think he rather glossed over the debit side of things. He painted a Utopia which reflects to some extent the credits. Perhaps I shall have something to say about the debits.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that there was really no problem in the building societies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visser">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>He indicated that last year they had an all-time record.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visser">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>That is right.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>This is correct. But I want to ask the hon. member this: An all-time record in what? Is it an all-time record in money values or an all-time record in real values?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visser">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>In every respect, according to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that it is an all-time record in every respect. There is a very big difference between an all-time record in money values and an all-time record in real values, because if the building societies had R1 million to invest ten years ago, they might have been able to provide a hundred bonds, but a million rand to invest at the moment may only provide 50 bonds. This is so because of the rise in the price of properties and the bond required by the ordinary individual to finance his house. I think the hon. member for Florida will agree with me that despite the records, despite any figures which have been published, he knows and the hon. the Minister knows that there are serious problems in so far as the building societies are concerned. If there were not, there would have been no reason for us to make adjustments on three or four occasions to the Building Societies Act in an endeavour to help the building societies. You do not try to cure people who are well and thriving, you try to cure people who are sick and ailing. The reason why we had to make adjustments to the Building Societies Act in this House was because all was not well with the building societies.</p>

<p>Adjustments are normal.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Then the hon. member also dealt with the question of the prices of shares. He said that the high prices of shares are due to the confidence which the public has in South African industry and commerce to-day. I am inclined to agree with him. The public has a great deal of confidence in the economy of South Africa to-day. But it goes a lot deeper than that. The public had a great deal of faith, not only in the shares of South Africa, but also in shares of the Continent, America and England. There the yield used to be 6 to 7 per cent and a person would not touch a share unless it had an earning of 15 per cent. <span class="col_8079-8080" refersTo="page_1192"/>This was the pattern, the yardstick of 20 years ago. But it has changed. Why has it changed? Because of the lack of confidence in money by the people, not the people of South Africa, but the people of the world. What is the yield in the United States to-day? It is as bad as ours. It is not all .6 per cent. There are yields of .1 per cent and yields of .6 per cent and the average is of about 2 per cent. The same applies to the United States. Their averages are low. On the Continent as well they are low. There is a lack of confidence in things which are not real, things such as buildings, land and physical assets which one can see. The world has lost confidence in other things, therefore they are buying shares which are physical assets to protect themselves against any catastrophy they might have to face. This then is the basic reason.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said two things about border industries. First of all he said that the process had to be a slow one. He said it could not be hastened unduly because we would run into trouble. This is true. &#x201C;Slowly but surely&#x201D; is a very good axiom, but that is when you have time on your side. We have had the Nationalist Government in power for 21 years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad some people appreciate that. As I said we have had them in power for 21 years. In this morning&#x2019;s paper I read an article by the editor of <i>Die Beeld</i> saying that unless the position is put right by the year 2000, and no longer 1978, the policy will prove to have been a failure. If we have not achieved what we originally wanted to achieve in 1978, by the year 2000, apartheid will be a failure. But the year 2000 is only 30 years hence. 21 years have already gone. If we are going to use the tempo of the past 21 years and project it over the next 30 years, we do not have to make any forecast. It is a failure and it will be a failure. The hon. member accused us of not helping to make it a success. That is not true. For years we have been telling the Government that the only way to develop the reserves and the border industries is to make use of white capital, white skill, white know-how and the local population. For how many years have we been telling them that? From the first day the matter was discussed. They rejected it as they reject so many of the things we propose. Then they accept it and try to give it a little different angle so that it will not appear to be our thinking. So they bring in what they call the agency basis. The agency basis may work, but the fundamental principle is that which the United Party propounded years ago, namely white skill and white capital. The Government knows as well as we know that without white skill and white capital nothing can be achieved. But the hon. member must not say that we have ignored this. We have made some very very sound proposals on this issue.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that one of the important achievements of this session, one of the credits on our balance sheet, has been the change in our incidence of direct taxation. Other members and I have already said that we agree with this. It is something that was necessary. It has alleviated the problem of the middle man to some extent and has eliminated the bulge. It has provided incentives for the higher income groups. We hope it will increase productivity. The proposals which the Government introduced were based on the Franzsen Commission Report alone. That commission produced a very good report. But I think the hon. the Minister was a little unfair in his reply to the Second Reading debate when he said the United Party would have done nothing. We would not have brought this scheme into being and would not have had the courage to make the changes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Or you would have done it the same way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I think the hon. the Minister was rather critical of what we would or would not have done. But I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that what has happened is a result of the Franzsen Commission. Since 1964 we have pleaded in this House with the Government to set up a commission to investigate income tax. What was the reply we received? The late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges told us that his department had their eye on matters. They kept a continuous eye on the problems of income tax and how it affected matters. Therefore, there was no need for a commission. We came back in 1965 and 1966. We have been back every year. I must give the present hon. Minister of Finance credit that when he took over the portfolio of Finance, he said that he would consider a commission. He accepted it and he did appoint a commission. But I think it must be a credit to us as well that we for years have known that there was something basically wrong with our income tax system. We knew it required investigation. The way to investigate it was through <span class="col_8081-8082" refersTo="page_1193"/>a commission. As usual, the Government appointed that commission five years after we originally proposed it.</p>

<p>I am now coming to a rather difficult question, namely the question of gold. I understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s problems in this regard in that he cannot, or thinks he cannot say too much. I think we must look and see what is actually happening. There have been reports that gold to the value of R50 million has disappeared. We know from a scrutiny of the figures of the Reserve Bank that gold has been sold on the open market. It is up to the Minister to decide whether he wants to take this matter any further. But the point I want to come to is that we are now having statement after statement by hon. Ministers which indicate certain things but tell us nothing. I believe that this is a very dangerous state of affairs in so far as the public of South Africa is concerned. In this House the hon. the Minister of Finance made two statements on the question of gold and our problem in the disposal of gold. Each statement was optimistic in the main. He said he thought we would arrive at a satisfactory gold position. Then the Minister of Economic Affairs in Australia made a very blunt statement saying that the problem of our exchange was going to be solved and we would soon be in a position to export funds abroad. A couple of days ago the hon. the Minister again indicated in the Other Place that he thought the problem would be solved in the near future. Now we come to Sunday. There were two items in the Press which I think we should consider. According to an interview the hon. the Minister gave to the <i>Sunday Express,</i> he said that he is optimistic that by the end of this year we shall have found a solution to our goldmarketing problems. He added that this would directly affect the Stock Exchange. I think the time has come that we divorce this question of the price of shares and the Stock Exchange from the question of our foreign exchange problems. I believe the hon. the Minister is trying to use one to do something about the other. I think it is wrong. But I do say that when the hon. the Minister in his position and with the authority he carries as Minister of Finance of the Republic of South Africa, says that he is optimistic that by the end of this year we shall have found a solution to our goldmarketing problems, I, as the man in the street, take that to mean that this is what will happen, because if it is not going to happen, I do not believe the hon. the Minister should have said so. He is the responsible Minister. He is telling the country that in his opinion the matter will be resolved by the end of this year. I sincerely hope it will. We all hope so. Then we come to the <i>Sunday Times.</i> We find very much the same except that their reporter reported that Dr. Diederichs told him that he was not hinting at an imminent solution to gold sale problems.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister must understand one or two matters. First of all, people are buying shares on the Stock Exchange whether he likes it or whether he does not like it. Basically this is human nature. If you buy well, good luck to you. If you buy badly, you will pay the penalty. The hon. the Minister himself has said that he will not control people speculating with their money. He will not let us have a casino or a lottery, but he has the Stock Exchange. That is fair enough. He is not going to interfere and I think he is quite right. But people take cognizance of what the hon. the Minister says. They must. He is the authority to discuss these topics. In one paper he says he will have a solution by the end of this year and in the other paper he says that he was not hinting at an imminent solution to gold sales problems.</p>

<p>Surely there is a difference between imminent and the end of the year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe the hon. the Minister must either stop making statements or expect us to understand that the solution is very near. I do not say at the end of the year or in January or February next year. It does not make any difference. The public is being given to understand by the hon. the Minister that that is what will happen. I can make any statements I like but nobody takes the slightest notice of them. They are unimportant. But when the hon. the Minister of Finance makes a statement, and is reinforced in Australia by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, the public takes cognizance of such a statement. Make no mistake; this is a vital factor. Of course, I do not agree with the hon. the Minister that when he solves his problem and we can export funds from this country, it will have the enormous effect on the Stock Exchange that he foresees. That is a matter of opinion. As I say, nobody takes notice of what I say anyway. But this does not matter. The hon. the Minister must realize that a number of people have large amounts of money tied up in the Stock Exchange, rightly or wrongly. His statements are important to them. Therefore, they must not be made lightly. When they are made he must realize that the public will take cognizance of them.</p>

<p>Now we come to another problem which we have not solved, the problem mentioned by the hon. member for Pinetown, and that is the problem of our excess liquidity and the shortage of long-term funds. I am sorry that according to the latest reports I have read, the Jubilee bonds have been the success that the Minister anticipated. I said before and I say again that I think he fixed his interest rate too low, and the fact that it is costly I do not think matters. I sometimes think people are not using the right perspective in regard to interest rates. Where you have devaluation in effect through inflation and the value of money gets less, I think one must expect an increase in interest rates. As you pay more for everything else, you also have to pay more for capital. We <span class="col_8083-8084" refersTo="page_1194"/>have this problem, and we have the problem of the building societies. We have a ceiling on bank lending, which is effective in some respects and not in others.</p>

<p>We still have a very active grey market, an extremely active one. In fact, one can do a lot more business through the grey market than one can do through the banks. It is a very good market and a very approachable one. The problem is the shortage of long-term funds which we have not solved yet. It is one of the debits on our balance sheet, and it is hindering the Government itself to a large extent, and the municipalities and the provinces. We are beginning to find a backlog in necessary works which we cannot carry on with because of the fear of inflation, and because of the lack of people who want to invest in long-term loans. But the trouble with backlogs is that they multiply and they snowball, and we are having the situation already where the larger municipalities are complaining that they just can no longer provide the facilities required by their people. I am not going to say that the Minister should give attention to this, because I know he is giving daily attention to it, but he will have to try to break through somehow.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida said that the economy was buoyant. It is buoyant and we are happy that it is buoyant, and I think the forecasts of what is going to happen in South Africa indicate that we need have no real fear for the moment that this situation is going to change. That is on the credit side, but on the debit side we do not seem to be able to get rid of any of this host of controls which we now seem to have to live with for all time, like exchange control, import control, building control, the physical control of factories and the control of labour.</p>

<p>What buildings are controlled? A lot of buildings are controlled. Factory building is controlled. Office blocks are controlled. You cannot put up an office block without permission. [Interjections.] We still have the Physical Planning Act. If you want to establish a new factory to-day, you must get permission. If you want to get one additional Bantu labourer, you have to get permission. I want to raise the question which I raised in this House before. What has been done in so far as the small man is concerned? How does the small man start, and what is the Government doing for him? Because we begin to get visions of grandeur. We talk about enormous edifices with big chimney-stacks and smoke flowing from them, but that is not how a man starts his business. He starts in business with his own two hands in his own backyard, in most cases. He starts to produce something and he sells it; he goes around, and he can only do it in urban areas. He cannot start something in the border areas with the little things he is going to produce, with his market miles away. As I said before, what a man does is to manufacture and take orders and manufacture more and deliver. That is how a man starts a small business. Is the Minister&#x2019;s colleague seeing that the small man is protected, and that if he wants to start a small business in an urban area, he can have the one or two Bantu labourers he needs to get going? If he cannot, he does not have a hope of getting anywhere.</p>

<p>On the credit side this session there are the better pay and conditions for the Public Service, but on the debit side there are two things. The one is the constant increase in the number of public servants. I read a survey a couple of days ago which showed that from 1937 to 1966 the Public Service had increased by 276 per cent, while in the same period the population had only increased by 70 per cent. But the Public Service is drawing off a terrific amount of our manpower, and it is understandable that it should be so because if you look at the legislation we pass every session it is ideological legislation which needs more and more public servants to administer it. And that happens constantly. The bulk of our legislation is ideological, and the great increase in the number of public servants is to implement this legislation. Every department is getting new tasks imposed on it and it is reaching the stage where the position is becoming impossible, and this while we have a shortage of labour in all sectors in South Africa. It is having its effect because we are getting a breakdown in efficiency. One hon. member talked about the building trade. I say there is a breakdown in efficiency in the building trade to-day. You are not getting a first-class job done the first time, and you are paying for the second and the third time that the job has to be done. We are not having efficiency in the motor industry. I know the hon. member for Salt River will not agree with me here, but we do not get efficiency, because we do not have the manpower and you need manpower for efficiency. There is no time to train the men.</p>

<p>Has not the time come for the Government to realize that there are just insufficient white people in this country to do the work required for the total population? Because this is the fundamental fact. You cannot divide two into four; two have to remain two if they want to do a job of work, and we cannot split the public any more. The tragedy is that the Government is doing nothing about it. My hon. Leader has already told the Government what should be done on the labour front. He has talked about a congress for labour and guarantees to the worker. Get something done on the basis that there are insufficient Whites to do the job. The white man is still afraid to-day and I do not blame him for being afraid because what has the Government done to still his fears? Absolutely nothing. Only from this side of the House, through the voice of my hon. Leader, was a guide-line given to the Government as to what they should do to still the fears of the white worker in this country, so that we can use the Black labour with everybody&#x2019;s acquiescence.</p>

<p><span class="col_8085-8086" refersTo="page_1195"/>Sir, we are still having inflation in this country. The hon. member for Florida dealt with housing, but we have the problem of land and the price of land is steadily going up. The hon. the Minister of Community Development two years ago told us that the Government was going to do something about it; they were going to buy land on the peripheries of the big towns and this they were going to use as a buffer against prices rising elsewhere, but we have heard nothing further about it. This question of land is one of the vital problems in South Africa to-day. In Australia&#x2014;I think it was in New South Wales&#x2014;a commission has just sat to investigate the problem of the high price of land. They are doing something. We do not seem to be doing anything. I think the time has come when the Government should appoint a commission to go into the whole question of the high price of land.</p>

<p>Another problem, another debit on our balance sheet, is that the distribution of wealth is being altered, but unfortunately it is being altered in the wrong direction. The Franzsen Commission told us that only 8 per cent of the people in the Republic paid tax, as against 30 per cent to 40 per cent in highly developed countries; and that 6 per cent of the people in South Africa paid two-thirds of the total income-tax. But the position is getting worse and not better. The redistribution of wealth is not from the rich to the poor; it is upwards. The working man is beginning to sense this and if you read some of the speeches of labour leaders you will find that they are beginning to complain very bitterly about the distribution of wealth that we have in this country.</p>

<p>Now, what does all this boil down to? When we look at this balance sheet objectively, when we look at the debits and we look at the credits, I think it clearly shows that the time has come when the shareholders of South Africa, the voters, are going to welcome a change. This Government is too wedded to its political concepts and it is not prepared to accept the facts as they exist. It travels from 1978 to the year 2000, and it does everything to sort of keep the ball rolling, but the time has come for bold new concepts and concepts which are capable of achievement. You cannot go on clinging to old concepts. And again I pay tribute to the hon. the Minister of Finance. I said in the Budget debate that he had the courage to break the shackles of the past. I wish the other Ministers would follow him. I wish he could convince them that the past is shackling them, is chaining them, and is stopping the progress of this country on the full basis where everybody becomes involved. You know, Sir, sometimes I become afraid that we are going the same way as Rome or Greece. One only talks to-day of the might and the wealth of Rome and Greece, but it is no longer there, and why not? Because they clung for too long to the things which they had. They believed that they had found the perfect civilization and a panacea for all ills. They believed, for example, that slave labour was something which was going to exist for all time, and that this was the basis of a civilization which would continue indefinitely. There was no progress; it was stagnant, and that is what the Government is doing. They are not accepting the inevitability of change and they are not moving with the times. They are shackled and tied by their own ideological concepts which hinder movement, and in these days you want movement. And I think the public is going to realize it; they probably already have realized that we cannot be contained for much longer within ideological boundaries, and that we have to break out of them and do a job, as the United Party has propounded so often.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown covered a wide range of topics, but if I were to sum up his speech it would amount to his asking how the little man was being influenced and what the Government was doing for him; and that fitted in very neatly with what the hon. member for Pinetown dealt with so comprehensively, i.e. that this Government was doing nothing for the less well-to-do person. The hon. member for Pinetown put it this way, taxes on the rich had been reduced, and taxes on the poor increased, and he placed the responsibility for this squarely on the shoulders of the Government. This refrain ran through all the speeches made by the hon. member for Pinetown and Parktown. The Government was decreasing taxation for the rich man, but was doing nothing for the poor man. Now I have looked up what the hon. members said last year and here before me I have what the hon. member for Parktown said last year in regard to this matter. I am referring to Hansard, Vol. 23, col. 3136, where the hon. member stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The plain fact is that the burden of taxation on the middle-income group, i.e. those affected by the bulge, is extraordinarily high and compares unfavourably with many other countries in the world. I have here a table which shows the percentage of income which the married man with two children and in employment retains after taxation. The position of a man in the group earning R10,000 a year is as follows&#x2014;</block>

<p>This is not the poor man he is pleading for, but the man who earns R10,000 per year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; In France, after paying tax, he retains 87.1 per cent of his income. In Canada he retains 79.6 per cent, in Italy 80.2 per cent, in Switzerland 77.6 per cent, in West Germany 76.7 per cent, in Spain 80.5 per cent. But in South Africa he retains 73.3 per cent. In the United Kingdom it is 72.6 per cent as compared to South Africa&#x2019;s 73.3 per cent. The only other ones which are worse off than South Africa are Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway.</block>

<p>And now comes the important part&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8087-8088" refersTo="page_1196"/>The United Kingdom is just a point or so below. It is for that group that we pleaded last year and we reiterate our plea again this year.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now reached the end of a very long debate on finances in this House of Assembly. For more than 100 hours we have been discussing finances, and it is of course obvious that we will spend a long time discussing Government finances, because a Budget determines to a very large measure the welfare of a nation. In fact, the Budget is there to iron out the economic cycle as far as possible; to flatten it out; to prevent the economic cycle from rising to the heights and falling to the depths. That, Sir, is the function of a Budget, i.e. to cause the prosperity of a nation, on the long-term to proceed as evenly as possible. In fact, the Budget is the most powerful instrument in the hands of the Government to ensure the prosperity of a nation on a long-term basis, but all the work of a sensible government, of a sensible Minister of Finance, is so casually being thwarted by the actions of a less responsible Opposition, and particularly a desperate Opposition who no longer see on their horizon any possibility of taking over the reins of government. The greatest welfare of all is only obtained if everybody gives of their very best, but this is a Utopian situation, an unrealistic situation which we definitely cannot expect in the realistic present-day world. Unfortunately there is still the beggar who will always be with us, the man who, like a parasite, wants to live off the labour of another, the man who is not himself willing to roll up his sleeves and work to ensure prosperity; and then of course there is still the man who complains, the man who thinks that he is not getting a big enough slice out of the nation&#x2019;s cake. This is unfortunately a human failure which can be exploited so easily, and I am afraid the present Opposition finds it very easy to exploit this mental attitude. Sir, the present Opposition finds it so easy to exploit this situation, particularly if it pleads for the so-called ordinary man, because it has no prospects of coming into power within a reasonably short time and because it need not therefore fulfil its promises. That is precisely the position of the present Opposition. The Opposition has in this debate pleaded to satiation point for the so-called ordinary man, but, as has happened so often in the past, it has also displayed a negative frame of mind because it has no prospect of coming into power. The Opposition is continually assuring us that they are not thinking of political gain when they put in a plea for the ordinary man. On Friday the hon. member for Constantia stated explicitly here that he was not thinking of any political gain for the Opposition when he pleaded for the ordinary man. But, Sir, have we ever had a definition of this &#x201C;ordinary man&#x201D;? At the beginning of every Act one finds, after all, a definition which informs one what certain concepts in that Act mean, but never in this Session have we had a definition of this ordinary man from the Opposition. We have never even come close to hearing such a definition from them. Who is this ordinary man? How much does he earn; what does he do; where does he work? We have never been given a definition of him, and that is why I ask myself: Who is this legendary figure, the ordinary man? I myself have always thought that I was an ordinary man, but when I listened to the description of the Opposition of this ordinary man, then it seems to me I lack two characteristics, or at least one major characteristic, which would qualify me as the ordinary man to whom the Opposition refers and that is that I do not complain. I do not complain about my income; I do not complain about my circumstances. It seems to me that the Opposition&#x2019;s definition of an ordinary man is a man who is always complaining about everything, who is always complaining about his income and who is always complaining about his circumstances. It makes no difference whether this is a labourer earning R2 a day, or whether it is an official earning R8,000 per year; as long as he complains he is the ordinary man. Sir, I indicated to you at the beginning that the Opposition complained last year on behalf of those groups of people who are, through the Bill, being placed in an unfavourable position.</p>

<p>You said there was no bulge.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I read out to you what the hon. member for Pinelands mentioned as an example, i.e. the man earning R10,000 per year. He complained prodigiously about the circumstances of that poor man, a man with an income of R10,000 per year! The man who in the past was affected by the bulge is the man who was earning at least R5,000 to R6,000 per year. It seems to me the Opposition&#x2019;s definition of the ordinary man is that man who complains about his circumstances, whether he is earning R2 per day or R8,000 per year. That bulge has now been ironed out. The man with an income of R10,000 per year has been accommodated by the hon. the Minister of Finance, and now that that has been done, the Opposition, from the introduction of the Budget to this morning, has been pleading for the poor man, who is suffering such hardships; this of course includes the income group between, let us say, R100 per month to R5,000 per year. Sir, the impression I get from this Opposition is that they are so inconsistent in their definition of the ordinary man that no sober-minded positive-thinking person pays any heed any more to the Opposition, and for that reason I want to draw attention, in the time at my disposal, to those things which this Budget and this Government are in fact doing for the lesser well-to-do citizens of the country. In the first instance this Budget, by ironing out the bulge, has given a tremendous incentive to people to work at full steam without the fear that the <span class="col_8089-8090" refersTo="page_1197"/>State will tax away the largest part of their hard-earned income. Never in the past has a Budget done so much to stimulate diligence as this Budget is doing, and for this one aspect alone, we could almost give this Budget full marks. But I also want to point out a second aspect. In spite of all the jeremiads from the Opposition, this Budget does in fact constitute many advantages for the lower income groups. I am mentioning only a few examples: the additional statutory payment of R41 million to the provinces does in fact enable the provinces to make large concessions to the lower income groups. I am thinking for example of the extremely low hospital costs for the lower income groups. The higher income groups must pay their full hospital expenses, but the lower income groups pay just about nothing for their hospital services. In the Cape this extra statutory amount is going to enable the provinces this year to grant books and requirements to all its schoolchildren free of charge, and this is also being done by the other provinces. In the Cape we still have the Divisional Council tax. This extra statutory payment to the Cape will enable the province to decrease its Divisional Council tax. Sir, I should like to refer to another matter, i.e. the increase in social pensions and the great contributions by the State to civil pensions. Here, too, there is a concession which promotes diligence, for a married man receiving a pension who still works can now deduct up to R40 of his earnings from his income without the means test being applied, and this does not apply to rich people, it applies to the poor man, to the man who is so poor that he has to receive a social pension. If he is still working he can deduct up to R40 from his earnings before the means test is applied to him. I want to point out a further advantage: the R3.5 million interest subsidy for public servants in the lower income groups, which will help them to acquire houses. I am indicating the restrictions on income so a man can participate in government supported housing schemes. A man with an income of R100 per month can live in a sub-economic house. It is not the high income groups who benefit from this. A man with two children and an income of between R100 to R225 per month can live in a sub-economic house. These are all things which benefit the lower income groups. In addition there is the R39 million to agricultural credit which is serving to keep our poorer farmers on the land. Sir, these are all possible steps which have been taken in this Budget to benefit the lower income groups. The Opposition should take care that it does not deprive the lower income groups of all sense of responsibility, for by continually drumming it into the lower income groups that they are not receiving their fair share, one is undermining the sense of responsibility of those people. In conclusion it is in fact they who derive the greatest benefit from the services the State provides. All this conduct on the part of the Opposition amounts to is playing with fire, for if it were taken far enough it would be heading directly towards a communistic way of thinking, and for that reason the nation outside will pay no heed to this Opposition which is continually undermining in a negative way instead of producing positive ideas. I am just mentioning the question of this sales tax again, which was supposedly introduced in such a precipitate way and which is supposedly imposing such a heavy burden on the less well-to-do. But what is being forgotten is that the assessment of 5 per cent on income tax does not apply to the lower income groups. He only begins to pay this assessment when he pays R100 in income tax to the Central Government, in other words, any person with an income less than R2,000 per year does not pay this assessment. Therefore, any person paying less than R100 in income tax to the Central Government pays this 5 per cent. The hon. member for Constantia had a great deal to say about the fact that this sales tax was supposedly proving such a heavy burden on the less well-to-do. But if the hon. member were to read the speech made earlier on during this Session in regard to this matter, he would see that if the Minister of Finance accepts the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal in this regard it would in fact be the less well-to-do who would suffer as a result. The hon. member for Durban (Point) said on an occasion yesterday that we were misinterpreting that speech of the hon. member. But let us glance briefly at what the hon. member actually said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to be constructive and helpful and we should like to suggest that depending upon the final settlement of the income tax scales and depending upon a thorough investigation of how and to what extent the sales duty will be applied, that the House and the country be requested to accept its proposals in principle.</block>

<p>In other words, to accept the proposals for sales tax in principle so that we can regard this year as a year of experiment and research. That would mean that these proposals would only come into operation in a year&#x2019;s time.</p>

<p>The hon. member did not listen carefully. The hon. member for Constantia said, &#x201C;&#x2026; that the House and the country be requested to accept its proposals in principle and that we should regard this year as a year of experiment and research&#x201D;. Well, if research has first to be done as the hon. member requested, surely it would mean that we could only put the proposals into operation in a year&#x2019;s time. But I must also be fair to the hon. member for Constantia. It is true that he requested that certain of these proposals should be introduced this year already. He suggested that the Minister should introduce this system by, in the first place, <span class="col_8091-8092" refersTo="page_1198"/>imposing a tax of 15 to 20 per cent on luxuries, plus a minimal tax of, say 2&#x00BD; per cent on a restricted list of goods, goods which should have been selected far more carefully than were the goods appearing on the list submitted by the Minister. But such a tax would only have produced a very small income. In the first instance, there would have been a very restricted list of goods, and in the second instance the tax would only have been 2&#x00BD; instead of 10 per cent. If, on that basis, we were now to have a year of experiment, the Minister would during the course of the year find that the income from that tax was so little that he would have to increase it to what he has now proposed, i.e. 10 per cent. The hon. member&#x2019;s proposal would have enabled the rich man. the man who is in a position to buy, to have accumulated great quantities of supplies. He would have been able to buy to his heart&#x2019;s delight, while the poor man, who would not have been able to do so, would at the end of that year have had to bear the full burden of the tax. That is the way in which the Opposition pleads for the poor man, the ordinary man&#x2014;their proposals amount to the poor man actually being prejudiced because he would have been placed in a less favourable position than the man who is able to buy in advance.</p>

<p>That is my problem with this hon. Opposition: they are continually trying to sit on two stools. Last year they pleaded for the man with an income of R10,000 per year, now, on the other hand, for the so-called poor man. But there is a sting in their plea for they are pleading for an extension of time so that the rich man can buy up and fill his granaries and the poor man, who cannot do so, would subsequently have to bear the full burden of tax. That is my problem with the hon. the Opposition, and that is the reason why it has been rejected for 21 years now. And that is also the reason why it will continue to be rejected next year and the year after, by the voters. I am convinced that if an opposition should ever come to light which could lift this Government from these benches, it would not be the present Opposition. This will have to be done in some other way, but how I do not know. Instead of thinking positively this Opposition simply stands on the touch line looking for an opportunity of causing discord in the ranks of the Government. On that it then wants to prey. During this entire Session they have been on the continual look-out for a crack in the edifice of this Government, so much so that they have completely forgotten to come forward with any positive ideas. Well, they looked in vain for the crack did not appear; the Government is still as unanimous as it always has been and it will continue in full strength to serve the nation of South Africa while the Opposition which sits in the pavilion and does not want to lend a hand in the struggle will remain sitting there until they have dwindled completely.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to avoid any controversial subjects, and discuss the question of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s taxes and their effects on artificial sweeteners. In taxing the artificial sweeteners, or at any rate the best of them, the hon. the Minister is inflicting great suffering on something like a quarter of a million people of the country. Many of them, particularly those in the Indian community, fall into the very humblest class. The Minister&#x2019;s taxation is, relatively speaking, so heavy that he is depriving some of these people of essential foods. These people must either abstain from eating certain foods, such as jams, jellies or certain types of bread, which are essential foods, or eat foods which are damaging to their health. Other foods, such as potatoes, which they cannot afford, they find very difficult to obtain. Sir, I should like to refer in particular to the artificial sweeteners cyclamates and saccharine.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Cyclamates are dangerous.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, even one of my hon. colleagues speaks innocently and ignorantly. Cyclamates carry a duty of R2 per pound. They can be manufactured in this country for R1.40 per pound. They are made in Cape Town. But the price, when they come to be used, is R3.40 per pound. This is a heavy blow to the sort of people I have mentioned. Not only are the diabetics affected, but also the people whom we medical men regard as also not being healthy, those people who are obese. These two groups of people will suffer under this taxation. It is even worse when one realizes that the control by the hon. the Minister is ineffective and bears still more heavily on this South African industry. While all cyclamate used in this country is taxed at source, and while foods, particularly those which are manufactured, and which contain saccharine and cyclamates, are controlled, especially by the Department of Health inspectors, there is no inspection of and no taxation on imported foods containing cyclamates. Such foods, such as jams, etc. have the normal duty placed on them, and the fact that cyclamates may be present in these foods is not noticed. There is no control over these foods. The result is that the locally manufactured special foods are not cheaper than those which are imported, owing to the fact that the locally manufactured cyclamates carry an extra R2 duty, whereas cyclamates imported in foods are completely uncontrolled and not taken into account. These foods come in duty-free. The cyclamate content in such foods is, of course, small but any inspection of a departmental self-service counter will show that imported foods cost anything from <span class="col_8093-8094" refersTo="page_1199"/>30 per cent to 50 per cent less than the locally manufactured products. I carried out such a test myself on Saturday.</p>

<p>The local food containing sugar is cheaper than the imported food containing cyclamate by anything from 30 to 50 per cent. To poor people this is a tremendous difference and in order to satisfy their hunger or their desire for sweets they must take the local product which contains sugar because they cannot afford the imported one. I made an inspection of two of these supermarkets on Saturday, and in one I found two articles which were manufactured locally and which contained cyclamate. Both these articles were more expensive than equivalent articles of food containing foreign cyclamate so that for practical purposes the sales of artificially sweetened food are almost nil. There is very little trade in these articles. Although there is a firm in Pinetown which has a very wide range of such products, its sales are limited compared with the sales of imported goods. Many of the supermarkets do not carry these goods. The people who need these foods have to go to chemists, which means a special journey. Furthermore, as I have said, the cost to them is very high. Chemists in general do not carry the locally manufactured goods. Perhaps I should not repeat this, but I am told that they have agreed amongst themselves that they will not carry the local foods. The sugar firms of this country are very anxious to keep these foods on the shelves of chemists and not have them on the shelves of supermarkets, where people generally go to buy their food. They have to make a special journey to a chemist to buy single articles such as sweeteners and artificially sweetened foods which their health demands. I know that there is a world campaign claiming that cyclamates are dangerous. We had an example of the effect of this campaign before us this morning. Let us look into the matter. Calcium-cyclamate and sodium-cyclamate which are the substances usually used have approximately 30 times more sweetening power than sugar. For the restriction of carbohydrates which are the fatteners of people and which diabetics must be made to carry out and for the health of those who have a sweet tooth but who are obese, possibly because they have that sweet tooth, it is necessary that the diabetic foods should be eaten, and they are prescribed by doctors.</p>

<p>Now, let us look how the world regards the cyclamates. I say this for the consideration of the hon. the Minister of Health which I am sure he will now investigate further. In Great Britain it is permitted in food without any restriction. Under the soft drink regulations of Scotland the committee which sat on this point in 1964, permitted the use of cyclamates freely. It was not considered necessary in Britain to introduce statutory regulations because it is said to be self-limiting in taking. This is from the report of the Cyclamates, Food Additives and Contaminants committee issued as recently as 1965. Cyclamates are being used for all soft drinks except tonic water where the bitter after-taste of saccharine is welcomed. That is roughly the only one where it is used. Appletiser which is a common drink in this country, is marked at the request of the sugar companies as being free from added sugar when it is unsweetened. In order to reply to the question as to whether cyclamates, as my colleague said, are dangerous, I have here a photostat copy of a letter which appeared in the <i>South African Medical Journal</i> of the 20th July, 1968. This letter is signed by eight eminent specialist physicians. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that so important is diabetes in this country that not one teaching hospital in South Africa has not set up a special department for the care of the diabetics. This letter, as I have said, is signed by eight eminent physicians who are in charge of diabetic clinics in all the teaching hospitals in this country. I will not read it all. This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We wish to refer readers to a leading article in the British Medical Journal &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was an article written in 1968&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; where there is a considered review of the whole matter and a complete endorsement of the safety of the cyclamates as presently used. In conclusion, we unhesitatingly recommend to our patients and all diabetics or people who need to lose weight, the use of the artificial sweeteners (cyclamates), and we use them ourselves. They are certainly as safe as sugar.</block>

<p>The article then goes on and talks about the unsafety of sugar which does not concern us for the moment.</p>

This is a doctrine which is being advocated by the most eminent diabetologists in the country. There is no particular specialty recognized by that name, but nevertheless these gentlemen are all specialist physicians. The criticism is that the genetics of humans are affected by the use of cyclamates in excess. The latest medical journal <span class="col_8095-8096" refersTo="page_1200"/>which arrived last week from England states quite clearly that the use of cyclamates in excess, namely some 15 times the average dose a person might use per day, has been found in animals to interfere with the chromosomes which carry the genetic characteristics of these animals. Up to date it has however not been found that the same is the case in respect of humans.</p>

<p>Only in excess is worse. If the hon. the Minister will bear in mind the importance of this matter to these people, he will realize that he is taxing a group of people who can ill afford to pay. The tale of the bad effects of cyclamates is no more proved than is the bad effect of sugar. The sugar producers of South Africa gave evidence on artificial sweeteners before a committee and they made some statements which should certainly be investigated very closely. They said that the United Kingdom allows the unrestricted use of artificial sweeteners except for soft drinks and ice cream. The U.S.A. allows the unrestricted use, except in sweet confectionery. It is interesting to note that in South Africa the use of artificial sweeteners is prohibited except for specified medical purposes. Nobody has ever asked for a prescription to buy cyclamate powder to put in his tea instead of sugar. This is not true. What difficulty there is with the use of artificial sweeteners comes from the hon. the Minister of Finance and not from the hon. the Minister of Health, unless the hon. the Minister of Finance is being used as an instrument for improving the health of the country, by means of finance. I am sure that that is the last thing the hon. the Minister of Health would like to do.</p>

<p>The need is widespread. It is a great hardship when people have to pay extra for diabetic food. I see no reason why a man who suffers from diabetes or a man who suffers from obesity should be made to pay this tax. This is a plea for these people. I hope the hon. the Minister will seek the advice which the hon. the Minister of Health is evidently already offering him, as soon as possible and will see if the difficulties I have mentioned can be avoided.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (Central) spoke today like a director of a pill factory. I can tell the hon. member that I think that the bitterest pill for the United Party to swallow will come when they find out next year in the provincial elections that they have no members in the provincial councils. That will be the case if the speech which the hon. member made is to be the one to take the world in tow. I shall come back to the speech of the hon. member for Durban (Central) again. However, a few other aspects were raised here. I want to deal here with one or two aspects mentioned by the hon. member for Parktown. The hon. member spoke of the Stock Exchange and said that there was a frightful amount of speculation taking place. He said that money was flooding into the Exchange. This is so. The hon. member also went further. He said that the Franzsen Commission had been appointed after the Opposition had been pleading for it for so many years. He made a further statement to the effect that we did not have sufficient manpower in South Africa and that the efficiency of our economy was collapsing. He also complained about the high price of land and also requested a commission in that connection. In addition, he also asked that something be done in connection with the distribution of wealth in this country. Now, after the hon. member has made all these statements, I want to ask him something. The hon. member is a trained accountant and knows a great deal about finance. Therefore I want to ask him whether, because there is so much prosperity in the country, he wants to blame the Government for the fact that people are speculating to such a tremendous extent on the share markets. That speculation is the result of the great amount of money that there is in the country at present. There is such a tremendous amount of money that the people have now actually developed a speculation mania. The Franzsen Commission recommended that a capital gains tax be levied. This was not accepted, and one of the methods, I would say the only method, which the Minister can apply to counteract this is to tax those share transfers to a greater extent. I now want to ask the hon. member if he is in favour of that? Does that hon. member, on behalf of the Opposition, now want the hon. the Minister to increase the tax of a half per cent which is at present applicable to both the buyer and seller? The hon. member must now answer &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;.</p>

In other words, they now even want a much greater speculation to take place.</p>

<p>I now want to ask the hon. member who has just spoken what he wants. What must this Government do to counteract this excessive confidence which the public and the businessmen of South Africa have placed in the Stock Exchange? Those are surely company shares that are quoted on that stock exchange, and no person with any knowledge of shares would speculate to such an extent, or continue to buy shares so consistently, if he was not sure that he was going to make a profit. All those people have the idea that they are going to make large capital gains on the market. That is why they are spending so much. The hon. member also spoke about the high land prices. He said that the Government should do something about that. I should like the hon. member for Parktown to tell us what this Government should do. Surely the hon. members on that side of the House constitute this country&#x2019;s alternative government. It is also this hon. Opposition which must tell the public outside that this Government is doing one thing, while it should be doing something else. What does that hon. member want done in order to counteract land prices?</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<p>I want you to set up a commission to investigate, like the Franzsen Commission.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>What would we gain by having a commission merely to investigate it? That member and all his party colleagues simply do not have a solution for it. The hon. Opposition knows that if it were not for the fact that there was so much money and such wealth in South Africa the people would not be buying land so recklessly. They are doing so because there are prospects of making even more profit. There is so much progress because there is such a degree of confidence in this Government. We know that if the hon. Opposition were to come into power to-morrow, the entire Stock Exchange would collapse. Land prices would plummet; everything would collapse.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the other point which the hon. member made in connection with the manpower shortage. He said that there is a tremendous manpower shortage in South Africa. Surely this is only attributable to this prosperity. If there were to have been a depression in this country there would also have been many unemployed, as was the case in the days when they ruled. We are happy that all our people can be employed. It is a known fact that 2 per cent unemployment is accepted as the average by international standards. If there are 2 per cent unemployed, this is still regarded as full employment. In South Africa the number of unemployed constitutes far less than 2 per cent. Are those hon. members not grateful for that? We should praise this Government for what it has managed to do, i.e. that there is work for everyone and not a shortage of anything.</p>

<p>Mention was also made here of the food prices which had increased to such an extent. The hon. member for Florida brilliantly refuted that statement. He quoted statistics concerning our cost of living. I want to speak about a smaller portion, i.e. only about food prices. I think it is an achievement for South Africa as far as food prices are concerned, that we are among the top 14 countries in respect of 13 different commodities. This is not according to my newspapers, but according to the <i>Financial Mail.</i> [Interjections.] I am speaking about the <i>Financial Mail,</i> not the <i>Financial Gazette.</i> Since 1960 South Africa&#x2019;s position on the list has improved in respect of six commodities. South Africa&#x2019;s position, in respect of the quantity produced, is basically as follows: As far as maize is concerned, we are third in the world, conceding pride of place to the U.S.A. and Argentina. We are fifth in the world in respect of our sheep. Australia, New Zealand, Argentine and Russia are ahead of us. Those are all countries that are well-endowed with capital. It was only yesterday that South Africa was still considered to be an under-developed country. But since this National Party came into power we have built South Africa up into what it is today. There are still several other commodities that I could mention. For example, take sheep, wool, sugar, fish, castor oil, citrus, peanuts, flour, cattle, butter and meat. Despite the production by these other great countries, we appear high up on the production list.</p>

<p>Before we adjourned, I was quoting certain percentages to indicate that food prices in South Africa had not increased to as great an extent as the Opposition suggests. Since 1963 food prices have increased by 21.6 per cent. There are only seven countries in the world where there has been less of an increase. In West Germany it increased by 9 per cent, in Italy by 15 per cent and in Israel by 19 per cent. But in looking at these increases we must remember that in South Africa food was already very inexpensive, and even a large percentage increase in these prices still does not make food in South Africa more expensive than in those countries. Our food still ranks with the cheapest in the world. I cannot see why the Opposition says that our cost of living has increased so tremendously. Although it has increased it is still ranks with the lowest in the world.</p>

<p><span class="col_8099-8100" refersTo="page_1202"/>I should like to come back to the Budget, and for a moment I want to have a general look at the requirements this Budget has to comply with, the degree in which it succeeded and the degree to which we can criticize it. This year the Minister came to light with an achievement, i.e. halving the income tax which the individual must pay, and, in addition, the sales duty which was introduced is not as heavy as hon. members opposite want to suggest. We must, of course, remember and understand that the Government does not trade like a private firm. The State&#x2019;s function is to look after the administration, to ensure a good degree of order and peace in the country and to ensure that there is an infra-structure upon which the private sector can build. With its Budget this Government has, in all respects, looked after everyone and has looked after all sectors of the economy. The Government has also seen to the financing and preservation of that which is its own, and it is serving its people to the fullest extent with this Budget. We cannot be at odds about that.</p>

<p>We in South Africa are a part of the world at large, and when we think of the world at large we must ask ourselves whether we, as a country, also have a function to fulfil as far as the outside world is concerned. In the first place, we must also look at where we come from, at what our origins are. We came from Holland when, in 1652, our forefather settled on the southern tip of Africa. In 1820 our English friends also came in large numbers, and this has continued to take place throughout, and people have come from France and Germany as well. It is surely not necessary for me to sketch the geographic situation any further. We are a part of Africa and, viewed in the broader sense, we are a part of the Whites in the Western world. And we must also view the East as a part of the whole. I now ask to what extent this Budget helps South Africa in the outward extension of its pattern of life and its trade? In South Africa our people have all the facilities, but this Government has once more provided for systems of communication to the outside world. We are reminded here of the cable between South Africa and Portugal which was opened by the Prime Minister this year. We are also reminded of radio and of transport. In this Budget the hon. the Minister made provision for our shipbuilding by setting aside R1.83 million for that purpose. This has all been done in order to extend our trade and our communications with the outside world. You may now ask how we can make contact with the outside world. Firstly, we can do so by supplying services and transferring our knowledge to them. Here we want to ask the Opposition whether they are satisfied with that, or do they criticize the Government as a result of the fact it furnished Lesotho, Botswana. Swaziland and the Northern non-White states with services and also financial assistance this year? If this is not criticized, it is surely a positive step which the Government has taken to help others as well, without neglecting our own people. If we consider the gleaning of knowledge, then our students in South Africa have a restricted field in which to extend their knowledge and we know that our people can learn very little from Africa.</p>

<p>Therefore it is also necessary for us to obtain knowledge from the West, in Europe and the U.S.A., and here, I think, we owe the Minister a great debt of gratitude for having made provision for post-graduate students in engineering and science, and for having ensured tax rebates in that regard. But there is one thing we must not neglect to do either, and that is to thank the Government for its actions in respect of students from abroad who were or are studying at our universities and who conducted themselves, or are conducting themselves, like a lot of agitators. We are glad that this year the Government took strong action and crushed that manifestation. If these people want to study here and want to do harm to our party, our country or our people, then I say we must take drastic action, and the Government must know that, in taking action against them, it will have the full support of South Africa.</p>

<p>There are also other spheres in which we can make contact with the world and fulfil ourselves, and one of these is the sphere of sport. We have five different fields, such as rugby, tennis, cricket, golf and athletics. We see that here as well provision has been made for sport and recreation to the tune of R320,000. But I do not consider this to be such an important factor. Even if we play against no other country, and even if no other country were to come here, it still does not make any difference. We did not take part in the Olympic Games this year, and what did this entail for us? In Bloemfontein we had the South African Games. There we did not merely have a small group of people competing overseas. It enabled our people to develop themselves to a large extent, to compete and to relax, which is perhaps of much greater value to us as a country than if we had taken part in the Olympic Games.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not say that, but that is not everything; it is not the alpha and the omega. We should like to do so. But when those people drag politics into sport and things fall through, the world has not come to an end. That is what I want to bring home to the hon. member.</p>

<p>This brings me to another section which this Government looks after, and that is tourism. We know that tourism can be one of the largest sources of foreign exchange in the world. We only need to think of a country such as Spain, whose revenue from tourism exceeds what South Africa earns with its gold sales abroad. That is how important tourism can be. Here the Government did not neglect <span class="col_8101-8102" refersTo="page_1203"/>to do its duty either. In this Budget R1,825,000 was set aside for that purpose, and we have a fully-fledged Department of Tourism. Everything that is necessary has been established. In thinking of tourism, we ask ourselves what a tourist wants; what does he look at and what does he want? When he gets here he wants to see what the country looks like; he wants to see what its people look like and he wants to examine their handiwork. Many people also go to another country for health reasons and in order to rest. People also want to gain more experience and to obtain knowledge. Since we in South Africa have made great strides with our tourism and our hotel industry, etc., to make it possible for people to be received here, and since we have all the various organizations necessary, I do not think the Opposition can criticize this Government to-day for not having done its share as far as tourism is concerned. We must remember that it is now up to the private sector to take the necessary steps to promote tourism here. We must draw people here, and then it depends upon each member of the community, whether it be the Government, the Opposition or John Citizen, to ensure that we receive those people here and make things as easy for them as possible.</p>

<p>But to me the most important way in which one can carry one&#x2019;s way of life to the outside world, and which the Government and we as a nation can apply, is in the sphere of trade. I want to dwell on that. Trade, whether export or import trade, is the most important factor in the life of any nation. Where one has good trade relations between countries, it creates confidence amongst the people. Particularly since South Africa&#x2019;s rand is in such a strong position, being one of the strongest monetary units in the world, the businessmen of England, for example, and even the English Government, have confidence in this country&#x2019;s economy. We must not forget that this confidence which is created can also be utilized for the benefit of our country and its people. A good understanding develops when there is dynamic trade, and then one gets good neighbourliness. That is why we have good neighbourliness with so many black states in Africa. Since our buying power is highly esteemed, it gives us the knowledge that it is our strength and we must develop it for the benefit of our country.</p>

<p>Let us briefly look at what the figures for 1969 have to say, as far as our exports and imports are concerned, and here I just want to divide up the various countries into Africa, America, Europe, Aisa, etc. The imports from Africa totalled R16 million, while we exported to the value of R42.2 million. From Europe we imported goods to the value of R175.5 million and exported R118 million. In the case of America the imports totalled a mere R42.15 million, as against R19.9 million in exports, and in the case of Asia it was R52 million as against R37.5 million. And so I could continue. In respect of the other countries the figures are very small, but all in all it gives us a total of R294.8 million in imports as against R231.3 million in exports. We see that Europe tops the list, with imports to this country totalling R175 million and exports from this country totalling R118 million. This brings me to the point that we should concentrate more on Europe. These are our countries of origin from which we have imported goods, and it is much easier to extend that existing market further than to seek new markets. It is also very convenient for us to export goods to Europe. Our telecommunications system is very efficient and does not need to be extended further. We have our submarine cable and we have radio, and we have a common language in respect of those people.</p>

<p>To extend our trade with Africa is not that easy, but nevertheless we must not ignore this. I call upon the business men of this country to support the Government in this attempt to extent our trade. Because the countries of Africa speak languages which differ from ours, because their Governments are unstable and these countries are still all underdeveloped, we cannot trade with them to as great an extent as with Europe. A few days ago Professor J. A. Lombard of Pretoria gave us a very good address on this matter. He pointed out how extensive the problems were in connection with developing a greater amount of trade with Africa. It is not easy to develop a greater amount of trade with the East either, or with the communist countries, etc.</p>

<p>We saw that Minister Haak, during his mission to Australia, said that in the distant future, at the end of this century, he foresaw a southern common market among the countries of the Southern Hemisphere, and we are very glad that the Minister thought along those lines. But it is not possible simply to develop trade with the Southern Hemisphere overnight. Even trade with America and Canada will be a lengthy process. In order to realize why it is not easy to get this Southern Hemisphere to develop its trade with us, we must look to history. This, then, brings me back to the European Common Market. If we look at its history it gives us an indication of how long it takes to build up such trade.</p>

<p>During the First World War, as hon. members know, the Netherlands was altogether neutral, while Belgium and Luxembourg were committed to the struggle. It was only in 1921 that Belgium and Luxembourg formed an economic union. They continued with that until 1932, in spite of the fact that they bordered on one another, in spite of the fact that their languages were the same and in spite of the fact that it would have been very easy for them to trade. They continued like that until 1932, when the Belgium-Luxembourg economic union concluded a new agreement with the Netherlands, the Ouchy Treaty, and so the Benelux countries came into being, i.e. Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Under that agreement of 1932, the three <span class="col_8103-8104" refersTo="page_1204"/>governments were to have increased the customs tariffs among themselves; they were to have decreased import duties and were to have abolished the existing trade restrictions in the shortest possible time. But, Sir, world trade is a slow and lengthy process, and therefore the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, Minister Haak, was quite correct when he said that the Southern Hemisphere common market would still take a long time to establish itself.</p>

<p>It was only in September, 1944, 12 years later, that these three governments of the Benelux countries got as far as drawing up a customs agreement, and it was a full 13 years later, in 1957, before they persuaded Italy, France and Germany, to combine and to sign the Rome Treaty, the treaty of the Euromart countries. Mr. Speaker, this indicates to you that one must work along positive lines, and since this Government has developed a trade with the outside world so systematically, soundly and well over the years, we want to ask the Opposition, on their part, also to admit that this Government is doing its share, not only in respect of the Budget, but in other ways as well, by way of missions which were sent overseas, etc. It is very interesting to see how important this economic common market has already become in the world. Those six countries have a population of 185 million, and the area is only a little greater than that of the Republic, but they are already producing 70 per cent of the steel for the United States and 60 per cent of its motor cars, and their total annual trade&#x2014;imports and exports&#x2014;amounts to R22,000 million, which is equal to that of the United States of America. That is why it is necessary for the private sector and the Opposition to help the Government to cement closer ties with Western Europe and to develop our export trade with that part of the world. Sir, if England is admitted to the Euromart&#x2014;and there is a strong possibility that this will happen&#x2014;then the population of that Common Market will be extended to 280 million people, by comparison with America&#x2019;s 200 million. If we could succeed in making closer contacts with that Common Market, it could only prove beneficial to South Africa. Sir, I conclude by saying that we thank the Government for what it has done in this Budget to develop the South African economy to even greater heights than it has already reached.</p>

<p>Sir, I think the records will show that this has been one of the busiest Sessions in the history of the South African Parliament and one in which we have put as many Acts on the Statute Book as in any previous session of Parliament, if not more. From the list I have here it seems that in 1965 we put 103 Acts on the Statute Book, in 1967, 105, and this year we have broken the record with 106 or 107, depending on what the Government withdraws. In other years we have been satisfied with far less legislation. But despite this activity it is quite clear that there are certain shortcomings and vacuums in Government policy which have become increasingly evident. In fact, it seems that in certain spheres of policy the Government and the Prime Minister in particular, have a blind eye. I want to say, Sir, how much I appreciate the presence of the Prime Minister. I know he is not feeling well to-day. I naturally cannot deal with all these shortcomings, but there are one or two which are more significant than others that I want to mention before dealing in detail with one or two.</p>

<p>Sir, hon. members have dealt with the uncertainty in the financial field. We have had no reaction yet from the hon. the Minister of Finance. We know that we have this excessive liquidity. We know that his plans so far have not proved very successful. It seems as though he himself is disappointed with them. He talks about speculation on the Stock Exchange and things of that kind. Sir, that only happens when people worry about the value of the money which they have in hand. It is for that reason, I believe, that this speculation is taking place. The hon. gentleman did not see fit to introduce the Third Reading of this Bill with any statement and we are still left with this uncertainty in respect of our situation. Sir, this is not the only respect in which there is uncertainty as to Government policy. Hon. members will recall that the Government no longer has a policy for the Cape Coloured people.</p>

Sir, we have heard honeyed words from this Government on the advantages of immigration but we all know that it is perfectly true, as the experts tell us, that immigration cannot resolve this matter. We have had a Manpower Training Bill introduced as a private member&#x2019;s measure by the hon. member for Hillbrow and we have had the Government voting against it. We have had talk from the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development on training schemes for Bantu in border industries. But what have we had about training schemes for white men in South Africa? The Government did introduce a Bill to amend the Industrial Conciliation Act. It contained a watered-down version of some of the suggestions made by the hon. member for Hillbrow, but typical of their indifference to this important matter affecting the interests of every white worker in South Africa, this was one of the first Bills dropped by the Government. I am glad to see the Leader of the House making notes. He is no doubt responsible for the fact that this Bill has been dropped. The Government has been equally vague and unsatisfactory about the protection of the white worker in competition with the Bantu worker doing work previously done by Whites only and at lower wages. The hon. the Minister of Transport has been lauded to the skies by the Opposition Press, not by his own Press, for his statement that he has employed thousands of non-Whites to do work previously done by Whites, and there has been no guarantee that they are being paid the same wages.</p>

The hon. gentleman has been at pains to indicate that this relaxation applies only in respect of the building industry in Natal, but obviously he set an example which may and will be followed throughout the rest of South Africa.

<p>I have no doubt that we are going to have brainwaves from him again, saying how they are protecting the white man and his future. The fact of the situation is that they have not applied their minds to this position; they are completely at a loss how to deal with it. But I am afraid we have to face the fact that labour patterns in South Africa are changing. The non-White to-day is doing work which in the past was done by Whites and we are being faced with the problem how to protect the standard of living of the white worker in South Africa. If I look at what has happened during this Session of Parliament so far and when I have heard what came from the hon. the Minister of Labour and the hon. the Minister of Transport, who has told us that he has employed thousands of non-Whites doing jobs previously done by Whites with no guarantee that it is the rate for the job, then I have to ask what is the future of the white worker in South Africa? When I ask that question, I cannot imagine how the white worker can continue to support this Government. [Interjections.] No wonder there are longing eyes towards the empty bench of the hon. member for Ermelo by trade unionists and labour leaders who remember his activities in earlier years and wonder whether if they have to have a Nationalist Government he is not the sort of man who would guard their interests more effectively than the present Government.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has placed this Government in another difficulty and has revealed their lack of courage in another sphere, their lack of courage to cope with the problems of the day. He has also revealed the lack of clarity in regard to certain aspects of their policy. The hon. member for Ermelo is clearly in revolt against certain aspects of their so-called outward looking policy. The issues on which he has chosen to challenge the Government include amongst them that of national unity. For some time now the hon. the Prime Minister has been trying to make the cry of national unity a plank in his platform. Previous Prime Ministers of that side of the House had difficulty to make that an effective cry because of their Broederbond background. This hon. gentleman has an Ossawabrandwag background but I do not think he has dabbled in the Broederbond. He stressed the big difference between &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this business of minis, is it the right sort of thing to be bandied about in this House? The hon. the Prime Minister stressed that the big difference between his party and the party on this side of the House was to be found in the fact that they have always stood for nationalism. I have been constrained to reply that we on our side have always stood for patriotism. [Interjections.] The hon. the Prime Minister asked, since when? Sir, do you recall what happened at the outbreak of the last war? I am being asked to explain the difference between patriotism and nationalism. I have said before that in the African context the hon. the Prime Minister has every qualification to be Prime Minister. He has been restricted, Sir. He has done time. Well, I have done time as well but for a different reason. There is a difference. I believe the hon. gentleman got a remission of sentence for good behaviour; I got rigorous imprisonment for escaping. [Interjections.] So, what is the difference between patriotism and nationalism? I saw it put very well not so long ago by a companion in arms of General Charles De Gaulle, a man who is perhaps the greatest patriot France has ever known and that Europe has ever known. He put the difference in this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I remember how simply you had once explained the difference between patriotism and nationalism, throwing away this perfect definition in an after-dinner talk: Patriotism is when love of your own people comes first; nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] This is not my definition, Sir; it is that of General De Gaulle. Nobody can say that he was not a patriot. I am not suggesting for a moment that a sponsor of nationalism cannot be a patriot, just as I have never suggested that a sponsor of patriotism cannot likewise sponsor nationalism, nor am I suggesting that hon. gentlemen on the other side of the House have not in their ranks some good patriots. [Interjections.] The hon. gentleman says I am playing with fire. I know that. I am playing with fire, but I am going to ride that fire and I am going to say to hon. gentlemen opposite that I feel that the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Transport were showing real signs of patriotism when they repudiated the speech of the hon. member for Ermelo, a speech in which he insulted the English-speaking people of South Africa. At that time I posed a question as to how a party can stand for real national unity and still have the hon. member for Ermelo as a leading member of its parliamentary team in this House. I am not alone in having that difficulty, because a large section of the Nationalist Press have the same difficulty. <i>Die Burger</i> even wrote on 20th May (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>However, we have been told now that peace has broken out in the ranks of the Nationalist Party, that the hon. member for Ermelo and the Prime Minister have become reconciled, and we have been told the terms of the reconciliation. We have read with great interest the public statements, by the hon. member for Ermelo in his own constituency. It appears that he started by scoring a signal victory over those Cabinet Ministers who spoke with him there. I think the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration had a night out with him. And then, finally, he appeared with the hon. the Minister of Finance. What did the Minister of Finance do? He entirely evaded it all. The hon. member for Ermelo was left to go it alone in his own constituency. He went it alone. He has been telling his constituency that he has been right and that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport have misinterpreted his speech. I direct this particularly to the Minister of Transport, because I have great respect for him and his views. I remember how he got up in this House and repudiated what the hon. member for Ermelo had said. Have we had a recantation from the hon. member for Ermelo? The furthest he has gone by way of a recantation was to declare that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport did not take the action they did because of the influence upon them of the liberal section of the Nationalist Press&#x2014;if there is such a section. That is all he said. That is all, by way of recantation, we have heard from him.

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo has chosen to make certain facets of his religion and mine, fundamental as a qualification for leading South Africa satisfactorily, and for being an effective Prime Minister. The two concepts just cannot be reconciled. I want to say that I have great sympathy for the hon. member for Ermelo. I have great sympathy for him because this sort of narrow nationalistic line which he takes is the traditional policy of the Nationalist Party. No wonder he has had so little difficulty in getting support in his own constituency. No wonder members on the other side of the House have been unwilling to take action against him. Amongst them there is also the Minister of Transport. They know what their past has been. They know how wedded to these ideas many of them are. But at least those members do not plead for national unity. In their hearts what they want is Afrikaner hegemony, and they know it. They want their people, and their people only to rule South Africa. That is what the hon. member for Ermelo wants. He does not talk of national unity, but the Prime Minister does and the Minister of Transport does. How can these two groups continue to exist in one party? That is what the public of South Africa wants to know. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, they are all with me. They all agree with me. That is why we have this noise. They all realize that these two groups cannot continue to exist in the same party. This is the party that is trying to make national unity a plank in its platform. [Interjections.] Hark at them, Sir! They all appreciate the difficulty; that is why we have this noise. If I were not right, they would be quiet. Listen to it. Sir. May I just illustrate this matter a little further. I want to recall some of the statements by the hon. member for Ermelo in some of his explanations. I do so, Sir, because I am interested where the hon. the Prime Minister stands. I recognize the voice of Dr. Hertzog, the hon. member for Ermelo. That is the voice we fought in 1948, in 1953, in 1958 and in 1961. That was the authentic voice of the Nationalist Party. I want to know where the hon. the Prime Minister stands to-day. After all, Sir, I recall the 16th August last year, when the Prime Minister attacked the people who were speaking in the traditional voice of the Nationalist Party. Do you remember. Sir, what the hon. the Prime Minister said? He called them &#x201C;super-Afrikaners&#x201D;, &#x201C;baboons&#x201D; and &#x201C;suspicion mongers&#x201D;. This outburst did not seem to concern the hon. member for Ermelo. The same day he spoke at Krugersdorp, and his reply to the Prime Minister was to attack some of the Nationalist Party newspapers, especially <i>Die Burger</i> and <i>Die Beeld,</i> and to blame all the troubles of the Nationalist Party and the deviations from Nationalist Party policy, of which the Prime Minister is in his opinion guilty on <i>Die Beeld</i> and <i>Die Burger.</i> The next day, the 17th August, three Ministers, namely the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Community Development, all repudiated the hon. member for Ermelo. In passing I should like to welcome the Minister <span class="col_8111-8112" refersTo="page_1208"/>of Defence back, and to say how glad I am to see that the hon.

<p>These are interesting terms: baboons, super-Afrikaners, suspicion mongers, political hypocrites and un-refreshing. These were not terms used by the Government in regard to the Opposition. These were terms used by Government members about a front-bencher in the Nationalist Party. These are the people who to-day control the Nationalist Party and they are using these terms against the authentic voice of the Nationalist Party as we have known it since 1948. Shortly afterwards the hon. member for Ermelo spoke in Klerksdorp on the 31st August. There he laid down four principles for the conduct of successful guerrilla warfare. He mentioned them as his father&#x2019;s strategy and it was obvious that he was referring to the rearguard action of the orthodox Nationalists against the revolutionary policy of the Prime Minister. What were those four principles? The first was: It does not pay a commando or small nation to clash head-on with a larger force. Secondly, you must never allow the enemy to choose when he will fight. You must choose when you will fight. Thirdly, having hit the enemy, retreat. Do not be ashamed to run away because you can then come back to fight again.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it seems as though the hon. gentleman is basing his whole strategy on the strategy of the communist movement in China. Perhaps when the time comes I can produce more evidence to substantiate that statement. After these reaffirmations the hon. member for Ermelo made a speech in this House on the 14th April. He contrasted the Calvinism of the Afrikaner with the liberalism of the English-speaking citizen to the serious detriment of the latter. What happened eight days later? Eight days later the Prime Minister in reply to provocation from my side of the House mildly rebuked Dr. Hertzog. The Minister of Transport vigorously repudiated him for his grave reflections and insults to the English-speaking people. The hon. member for Ermelo has denied that he has done any of these things. A week later he was feted at Jan Smuts Airport. On 26th April at Tulbagh the hon. the Minister of Transport revealed that Dr. Hertzog had been on the carpet before the Prime Minister. He claimed that as Transvaal leader he, and not the Prime Minister, was really the man who decided that the hon. member for Ermelo had to be repudiated. A number of meetings in the Transvaal followed, such as that at Badplaas in Carolina where the hon. member for Ermelo appeared in the presence of the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. During that meeting, he reaffirmed everything he had said in this House. A little later in his speech at Ermelo he blamed the Nationalist Party Press for the schism in the Nationalist Party leadership. This caused the ever-tactful Minister of Defence to say at George on 10th May that the hon. member for Ermelo was putting up smokescreens to enable his friends to continue their destruction of party discipline and undermining of the Nationalist Party. The hon. Minister of Defence is an old friend of mine. We understand each other and so we know what he means by party discipline. In typical language he described the hon. member for Ermelo as &#x201C;an old embittered out-worn politician&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, do you know what the reaction was of the hon. member for Ermelo? The hon. member for Ermelo said that the hon. the Minister of Defence had acted in conflict with all the principles of good breeding. Then on 20th May the Prime Minister announced that the differences in the Nationalist Party had been solved and that the hon. member for Ermelo would go to his constituency and clear up all the misunderstandings about his speech. We waited and on 6th June the hon. member for Ermelo went to his constituency and spoke at Amsterdam. He hardly referred to the points of difference between him and the Prime Minister. What did he do? He attacked <i>Die Burger</i> and <i>Die Beeld. Die Beeld</i> reported this meeting in these words:</p>

<block name="quote">Nasionaliste was op die vergadering merkbaar teleurgesteld met dr. Hertzog se toe-spraak.

<p>Then we have the <i>Sunday Times</i> commenting on this meeting:</p>

<block name="quote">In defending himself against attacks by <i>Die Beeld</i> and <i>Die Burger,</i> he described himself and his supporters as those Afrikaners who were attacked because they have the courage to stand up for the spiritual and honourable values of the nation. He made it clear that he considered that <i>Die Burger</i> and <i>Die Beeld</i> and their supporters could not be trusted to do this.</block>

<p>On 8th June <i>Die Beeld</i> reported on the Amsterdam meeting that the speech made there was basically a repetition of four previous speeches. The paper said that when Mr. Dawie de Beer, the Divisional Secretary of the Nationalist Party in Ermelo, asked the hon. member for Ermelo to repudiate the passages quoted by the Prime Minister as requiring explanation, the hon. member for Ermelo lost his temper and exclaimed: &#x201C;I do not know why it is necessary that I should be humiliated at every meeting.&#x201D; The true attitude of the hon. member for Ermelo was best reflected in the slashing attack which the hon. member made on the editor of <i>Die Burger</i> when he accused Mr. Cilli&#x00E9; of threatening to infiltrate the soul of our volk.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister demanded an explanation from the hon. member for Ermelo. The hon. member gave his answer. It was no explanation at all. It was, judging by all Press reports, only an undertaking not to leave the Nationalist Party unless he was kicked out and to wage guerrilla warfare on the same basis as his father fought it during the Boer War. This he would do, he said, as a member of the Nationalist Party, refusing to leave that party unless he was driven out of it. The hon. member gave no explanation in reply to the demands made by the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

At the end of the hon. member&#x2019;s tour and of the meetings in his constituency, the Chairman of the Nationalist Party in that constituency seemed to indicate that the quarrel was over and that the hon. member for Ermelo had met all the demands made upon him. What did we see in this morning&#x2019;s Press? He said that that was just his personal opinion. He had not been able to get his constituency&#x2019;s support. Does the hon. the Prime Minister believe in all honesty that the hon. member for Ermelo has met the demands which were made upon him? Does the Prime Minister want us to believe that the gross insult hurled by the hon. member for Ermelo against every English-speaking South African has suddenly been erased? Does the Prime Minister want us to believe that the hon. member for Ermelo has abandoned his &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; ideas, which according to the hon. the Minister of Community Development, led him to intrigue even against Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy.

We test the quality of that patriotism by examining the contribution that patriotism makes to South Africa and life in South Africa. We test patriotism by the quality of our dedication to South Africa. We look for points of agreement <span class="col_8115-8116" refersTo="page_1210"/>that transcend differences of language. We look for points of agreement which transcend the differences of language between the English- and Afrikaans-speaking people. What do we have from the other side? They have emphasized Afrikaner nationalism. They look for points of difference in order to maintain a separate Afrikaans identity which they could exploit for their political advantage.

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister asks whether it is humiliating to be yourself. I believe that we are moving towards something far bigger in South Africa. I believe we are moving in the direction in which the two cultures which originally existed here are rubbing off the one against the other. I believe we are moving in the direction where we are developing slowly a larger common culture in which both languages are accepted and in which each appreciates as its own what is part of the culture of the other language group. I believe that it is only on that basis that we are going to get real national unity in South Africa. By the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s question, I think he has underlined and emphasized the difference between us. He believes that there is always going to be one group with an English-speaking identity and another group with an Afrikaans-speaking identity, and that we shall work together here on terms. He does not believe that we shall ever have a South African nation. I think that is the difference between us. I think it is so important that we should appreciate that. This brings me back again to General De Gaulle when he said: Patriotism is based on love for your fellows; nationalism on hate for those that are not like you. I believe that to be the great danger, we are faced with in this country.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I have dealt with finance. I have said something about other differences between us. The last matter with which I want to deal concerns the Bantu policy of the Nationalist Party. Here again, Sir, we have uncertainty. We have a lack of leadership which is becoming evident to the vast majority of people in South Africa. On numerous occasions I have challenged the hon. the Prime Minister to ask the members of the Economic Advisory Council to give us some idea of what the apartheid policy of the Government is going to cost the country. His reply has not been that they were too busy to work out the sum.</p>

<p>It has not been that they did not have the opportunity to direct their minds to it. The only reply we had, we had from the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to the effect that this is their policy and that they will carry it out regardless of what it costs.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister says I want a little total integration and total separation. What have we had for 300 years in South Africa? Total integration or total separation? Let the hon. gentleman tell me, because he says I want a little of both. What they refuse to accept is that neither policy has been applied in South Africa for the last 300 years. It has only been in the last 21 years, since this Government has come into power, that we have heard the story of total separation. They cannot continue to <span class="col_8117-8118" refersTo="page_1211"/>bluff the public that their road is the only road and that it must be travelled regardless of cost. There are alternatives and when deciding upon them, the costs and the sacrifices which the public of South Africa are called upon to make are very real considerations. I think all of us in this House acknowledge that the Ministry of Bantu Administration and Development is one of the most important in South Africa. That is why there are two Deputy Ministers assisting the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Despite the hon. the Minister and the two hon. Deputy Ministers, what has happened to the timetable? Under Dr. Verwoerd we knew he hoped that by the year 2000 there would be equal numbers of Bantu and Whites in the so-called white areas. What has happened to the timetable to-day? What happens when one asks this hon. Minister that question? No answer. One can also ask the two hon. Deputy Ministers. The timetable has been abandoned and they know it.</p>

They know very well there is no longer a timetable or even an objective to which they are working. The public of South Africa has a right to know what the objectives of this Government are. These are not the objectives of the late Dr. Verwoerd, Mr. Strydom and Dr. Malan. The objectives are no longer defined. One gets the impression that this hon. Minister is like a cork bobbing on the water, going with the tides and the winds, but that he has no harbour that he is hoping to reach. The fact of the matter is, if his timetable and objective are the same as those of Dr. Verwoerd, he is going too slow to give any meaning to his policy. He knows that if he goes too slowly, if he fails to absorb the natural increase of the Bantu in the reserves and if he fails to offer employment to the surplus Bantu in the White areas, he is on the path to integration and not on the path to segregation.</p>

<p>Over the week-end I read an article written by the Editor, in <i>Dagbreek,</i> which is a paper that does not support the United Party, in which he took note of Sabra&#x2019;s projection, namely that by the year 2000 there would be 23 million Bantu in the urban areas of white South Africa alone. He confessed that he was haunted by this figure. He wrote the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Die syfer 23 miljoen bly by my spook. My ongeduld dat ons moet slaag, moet my vergewe word wanneer ek vra: &#x201E;Beweeg ons vinnig genoeg&#x201D;. Die welslae met grensnywerhede het ook &#x2019;n keersy. Die vernaamste ontwikkeling tot dusver is aan die some van blanke stede en dorpe, soos by Rosslyn, buite Pretoria, Oos-Londen, Pietersburg, Newcastle, Hammarsdale en andere.</block>

<p>This of course brings one to the second problem of the policy, or the lack of it. The hon. the Minister is basing his future plans on border industries, but up to now he has shown no indication at all that he has a realization of the problems connected with that sort of development. The purpose of the policy is to reduce the influence of the black worker in the so-called white areas of the Republic. Towards this objective there has been no progress at all. White South Africa to-day is blacker than it has ever been before. The trouble is that the Government does not appreciate the basic and inescapable problems that they have to face in seeking to implement their policy. One of the basic problems is that when one seeks to develop underdeveloped areas, those underdeveloped areas tend to be surrounded by areas where economic development has reached a high level.</p>

<p>The problem has been well-stated by Gunnar Myrdal who is one of the leading economists in the Scandinavian world. He believes that the gap between rich and poor countries is getting bigger. The rich countries are getting richer and the poor countries are getting poorer. He is convinced that as the lines of communication become extended there is a backwash and that the influence of the developed areas on underdeveloped areas is counteracted. I want to give hon. members his own words. He says:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8119-8120" refersTo="page_1212"/>The movements of labour, capital goods and services do not themselves counteract the natural tendency to regional inequality. By themselves migration, capital movements and trade are rather the media through which the accumulative process evolves upwards in the lucky regions and downwards in the unlucky ones. In general, if they have positive results for the former, their effects on the latter are negative.</block>

<p>In other words, the growth of the developed regions occurs at the expense of other localities and other regions where you have instead stagnation or regression and that becomes the pattern. There was another very interesting article which was written by a man called F&#x00F6;lscher when he was writing for his doctor&#x2019;s degree. He made a critical analysis of the problems connected with the economic and fiscal relations between the Transkei and the Central Government.</p>

<p>F&#x00F6;lscher said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">The economic development of the Transkei depends not only on the technological possibilities within the territory itself, but also, and this seems to be very important, on the manner in which the close adjacency of the relatively advanced economy in the rest of the Republic influences the economic values of these possibilities.</block>

<p>The position in the Transkei and in the other Bantu reserves are similar to those in other areas. They are seriously underdeveloped and they are inhabited by underdeveloped people. There is a lack of education and there are primitive traditions which retard development. There is a lack of capital investment; there is a total lack of orientation in a technological and commercially conscious world. Their natural resources are not what they should be. There is only one advantage over the rest of the Republic and that is that they are the treasure house of untrained and half-trained labour. That labour they export to outside areas. Facing these facts F&#x00F6;lscher alleges that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Were it not for political considerations &#x2026;</block>

<p>By that I think he means ideological considerations&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a solution for the underdevelopment of these areas can be found in shifting their population to areas of high economic activity.</block>

<p>But the politics of the Government do not want to take labour where prosperity is; their policy is to bring industrial activity to the areas where they hope that labour is plentiful.</p>

<p>I have given my answers so often, but this hon. Minister sat there and what has he done? Here is what Professor Barac said at the end of last year in Cape Town:</p>

<block name="quote">The establishment of new growth points should be done on a preferential basis and <span class="col_8121-8122" refersTo="page_1213"/>only in the areas where a thorough investigation shows that they have a chance of undertaking their own economic development.</block>

<p>He was not speaking of Government policy. He was speaking of what is happening in Great Britain. They had new ideas, but they failed. Eventually they can only shift industries to areas where an infra-structure already existed. This is how Professor Barac concluded his lecture:</p>

<block name="quote">It seems that South Africa with her idealogically-inspired border industries policy will have to learn from their own mistakes.</block>

<p>I can leave the matter there, but I want to summarize my argument. I believe that border industries are being developed at great expense. They contribute to the solution of some sociological problems, but as a means of achieving the Government&#x2019;s separation policy they are a total flop. They do not separate black from white in the economic sphere, but instead the border industries bring the races together faster than ever in the new areas. They develop the Bantu areas in an unbalanced manner and retard independent industrial development in those areas. They do not create separate nations or states. All they do is to prove how barren such a concept for South Africa really is. I have dealt with certain uncertainties. We have another uncertainty. That is that we have heard from the Deputy Minister that numbers do not count. He says that numbers do not count in so far as this policy of separate development is concerned. All that is important is on what basis are these people in the white areas. We have had a retreat, we have had explanations and we have had every kind of argument on it, but the fact of the matter is that the numbers of the blacks in the white areas are increasing all the time.</p>

<p>What is more, the ratio of White to Black is getting bigger and bigger. Yet we hear from these hon. gentlemen that numbers do not count!</p>

It is just a very simple matter. Are we going to be allowed servants in the urban areas? Look what happened at Randburg. Look at the troubles that arose. Where are we? What is Government policy? Nobody knows. We do not know where we are. We end this Session with many questions, some of which I have mentioned today, unanswered by the Government. These are questions on the crucial issues before the country in respect of which this Government has no satisfactory policy. There is the question of national unity. The Government as a party is retaining in its ranks Nationalists of the old traditional school whose very presence in the party makes it impossible for them to be the vehicle of a united nation. Their policy as a solution to our race problems is inadequate, unconvincing and is a failure. This too is a serious matter.

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to-day we saw the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in a brand new role. It is a role in which we have probably never seen him before, i.e. the role of a stage artist who tries very hard to capture the attention of his audience with witticism, sallies and a little bit of humour. He tried very hard to get that attention, but it fell quite flat, except in the case of the hon. member for Yeoville. He was laughing all the time. Nobody on that side of the House laughed more loudly about the witticisms of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition than the hon. member for Yeoville did. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition devoted a very large part of his speech to Dr. Hertzog. What I cannot understand, is why the Leader of the Opposition is so concerned about what is happening in the National Party. Surely, it ought to be to his advantage if there is a possibility of strife and dissension developing in the ranks of the National Party. Surely, it is to his advantage if this is the case. Why is he therefore so concerned about the National Party; why is he so concerned about the possibility of strife and dissension developing, and why is he so concerned about the fact that Dr. Hertzog still occupies a front bench on this side of the House? I think we ought to feel flattered by the concern of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. But he ought to be very concerned about the situation in his party. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants us to follow the same disastrous course he has been following since he became their Leader, i.e. that of hiving off. Just look around in this House and see where the members are sitting who once belonged to that party. There we have the hon. member for Houghton who is now a member of the Progressive Party, and then there is the hon. member for Umlazi. Here we have my colleague the Minister of Community Development, and the Minister of Tourism is also sitting on our side, and all the United Party has obtained in exchange is the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who has always been a covert U.P. supporter, even when he was with us. They have had nothing but hiving off over all these years, and now their great concern is that there should not be any hiving off in the National Party either. I say, let us look around us. Look at the long road they have traversed, and see how that road is strewn with principles and promises that were never fulfilled, and see how they have become fewer and smaller and smaller so that of that once mighty party, of which General Smuts was the leader, nothing more than a remnant is sitting&#x2014;fewer than 40 members. I think it is unheard of audacity on the part of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to try to tell us how we should enforce discipline in our party. We do not need the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the <i>Sunday Times</i> to tell us who may be a member of this party and who may not become one. This is a matter for us to decide, i.e. who may be members of the National Party and who may not. But there is one thing I must say. Both the hon. the Prime Minister and I repudiated the speech made here by the hon. member for Ermelo. But has the hon. the Leader of the Opposition ever mustered enough courage to repudiate one of his members who advocated a policy that was diametrically opposed to the official policy of that party?</p>

Furthermore, during this very Session the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that it was the policy of the United Party that all forms of discrimination should be done away with. He said that it was the policy of the United Party that all forms of racial discrimination should be done away with. Is this the policy of that party at present?</p>

<p>But the hon. member admits to having said that. I made a note of it. But I am now asking the Leader of the Opposition whether this is the policy of his party. You see, Mr. Speaker, that Leader of the Opposition, the person who told us that he had been in a prisoner of war camp for three years, does not have the courage to repudiate one of his own members.</p>

<p>I shall go further. Their so-called labour policy is &#x201C;equal pay for equal work&#x201D;. But when the hon. member for South Coast rose here and pleaded that the Bantu doctors in Natal should receive lower salaries than those paid to the Whites, did the Leader of the Opposition repudiate him and say that this was not their policy? No, he did not do so. And in this way I could quote numerous cases of conflicting views being held in that party. And this has not been a characteristic of that party merely as from to-day; since the days of General Smuts it has been the position that they express 20 different opinions on their policy and that each of them advocates his own policy, and that there has never been a repudiation by the Leader of that Party.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member talks about national unity and states that in view of the fact that the hon. member for Ermelo is still a member of this party and occupying a front bench, the policy of national unity advocated by the National Party is a farce. Sir, there is a world of difference between the policy of national unity advocated by the United Party and the policy which this side of the House is advocating. The policy of national unity which is being advocated by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, is total assimilation of the Afrikaans-speaking people with the English-speaking people. At his congress last year the hon. member said that they did not ask whether a person was Afrikaans or English-speaking; they only wanted to know whether he was a South African. In other words, such a person would be neither fish nor flesh. They definitely do not stand for the retention of identity. They are in favour of the Afrikaans-speaking people being absorbed into that so-called national unity. This is total assimilation, and this is not the policy of national unity which we are advocating. The national unity which this side of the House is advocating, is a policy based on the retention of the identity of each of the race groups, but with co-operation on the basis of one loyalty to South Africa. If the hon. member thinks that he will be able to bring the English-speaking people back to the fold as a result of what the hon. member for Ermelo allegedly said about the English-speaking people, he will find that this is a dead horse which can no longer be saddled. I just want to point this out. Co-operation between English and Afrikaans-speaking people is one of the principles of the National Party. Article 12 of the programme of principles, which was drafted long before to-day, reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The party wishes to foster a spirit of mutual confidence and co-operation between the white races. It will therefore ensure that in practice equal language rights in respect of the Afrikaans-speaking and the English-speaking sections of the population will&#x2014;as far as the State is concerned, and as far as the State is in a position to exert influence in this regard&#x2014;be exercised and upheld in all respects and in every part of our national life in the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<p>This is our programme of principles, and the policy of co-operation and national unity has been advocated ever since the days of General Hertzog.</p>

<p>General Hertzog most definitely did not leave the National Party because co-operation between English and Afrikaans-speaking people was lacking. That hon. member does not know what he is talking about. General Hertzog left for other reasons. I was present at the congress held in 1940, and the specific principle in regard to co-operation between English and Afrikaans-speaking people which was embodied in the programme of principles drafted by the Federal Council, was virtually identical with the one drafted by General Hertzog himself. And now I challenge the hon. member to point out the difference between the principles drafted by General Hertzog himself and the principle which the Federal Council drafted at the time in regard to co-operation between English and Afrikaans-speaking people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I say that it has always been the policy of this side of the House to have co-operation and national unity, but on a sound basis and with retention of the identity of each race, but not a joining together or an assimilation of one by the other. We want the English-speaking people to be proud of their language, their traditions and their culture. We grant them those things, because we also want them for ourselves. But this is not what the United Party is saying. The Afrikaans-speaking people who have become members of that Party, are being completely anglicised. They are ashamed of speaking their own language, and the only way in which they think they can ingratiate themselves with the English-speaking people, is to be more English <span class="col_8127-8128" refersTo="page_1216"/>than the English-speaking people themselves. That is their policy.</p>

<p>But what I actually want to deal with, is the labour policy of that side of the House which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition mentioned again to-day. He spoke here of &#x201C;What do we do about training schemes for the Black man in South Africa?&#x201D; and &#x201C;No protection for the white worker against Bantu labour at lower wages&#x201D;, and then he said that I &#x201C;employ thousands of Bantu labourers in jobs previously done by Whites without paying the rate for the job&#x201D;. Let me deal with the last one. This is no new policy. For the past 20 years white rail workers have not been replaced, but when vacancies arise those vacancies are filled by Bantu. But this is not a new policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>When vacancies arise and Whites are not available, Bantu are employed in their place. When one dismisses a white man and takes on a Bantu in his place, it amounts to replacement, but the hon. member is too obtuse to realize this.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with the policy they are advocating. In the first place, they are referring to the so-called training schemes. When I was still Minister of Labour I started introducing training schemes. Has the hon. the Leader of the Opposition ever heard of the training of artisans, of adults? I doubt whether he has, because as far as this matter is concerned, the hon. the Leader is talking about matters of which he knows very little. Has he heard of the training of artisans?</p>

<p>No, it was after the days of Cott, when an Act was piloted through this Parliament by me. But now I want to deal with their so-called labour policy, and with the speech the Leader of the Opposition made in the course of the recent Budget debate. Amongst other things he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We said there should be guaranteed employment of Whites at real wages, not below those at present received, for at least 10 years in those industries where non-Whites are encroaching on white jobs.</block>

<p>This is the protection he wants to afford white workers. He wants to protect them for 10 years, but he wants to protect them in certain industries where the Bantu are allegedly encroaching on the jobs of those Whites. What does this really mean? At the time I told the Leader of the Opposition by way of interjection that he was the only person who understood it, and I am saying it again. In an industry he now wants to give the Whites the guarantee that they will remain in that employment for 10 years. What does he want to accomplish? What does this really mean? Surely, industrial expansion is taking place all the time; new industries are developing. Is he not going to make any provision for any increase in wages? Does he think that the Whites who are there to-day, have to remain there and do the work for the next 10 years? And why does he limit it to 10 years? That merely goes to show how absurd it is. Now the Leader of the Opposition is asking the advice of his labour expert on his left again.</p>

This is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard. He says that the jobs of the Whites have to be guaranteed for 10 years in cases where the non-Whites are encroaching on their jobs.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Is that the least I can do? This merely goes to show what kind of nonsense they talk about this matter. But let me go a little further. He said that there had to be a national minimum wage for Whites. On what basis is that minimum wage going to be determined? Is it going to be determined on the work of the unskilled labourer, or on the work of the clerk or of the administrative official? Or is it going to be a minimum wage based on the work of an artisan? What minimum wage is it going to be, and what minimum wage is going to protect the white worker? How is he going to determine the minimum wage? All of these are vague statements which are made by the Leader of the Opposition. He says things about which he knows nothing at all. He says them merely to create the impression that they also have a labour policy. But let me take this further. He was referring to the national minimum wage and then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We said, fourthly, there should be an application of the rate for the job at realistic, not minimum wage levels, in all cases where the normal wage is above the national minimum wage for Whites.</block>

<p><span class="col_8129-8130" refersTo="page_1217"/>Has the hon. member ever heard that there is such a thing as an Industrial Conciliation Act in South Africa? Does he know that there is a Wage Act? Does he know that there is a system of mutual bargaining in South Africa? Has he ever heard of industrial agreements being entered into, agreements whereby wages are being determined for a specific industry? Has he ever heard that there is a Wage Act in terms of which the Wage Board determines certain wages in an enterprise? Apparently he has never heard of these things, but he now wants to determine wages over the heads of both the trade unions and the industrial councils, by saying that these have to be realistic wages, and this means that the whole system of mutual bargaining between the trade union and the employer will be destroyed completely. This is the protection of the Whites which they want; this has nothing to do with the rate for the job. No, the rate for the job is only good in certain circumstances, because they themselves admit that they do not want to apply it all the times. On a previous occasion I asked them whether they wanted to apply the rate for the job, i.e. equal wages for equal work, under all circumstances, and they could not give me a reply at the time.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, where there is no danger of competition, in places where the Whites will never apply for work, there they need not apply the rate for the job; there they can pay the poor Bantu just what they please; this is their policy. Then the hon. member furnished an example; he mentioned the sphere of employment in which competition between Whites and non-Whites was at its keenest&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This principle was applied by the United Party when it recently succeeded in getting the Johannesburg Municipal Transport Workers&#x2019; Union to agree to the employment of African bus crews on African buses. The white workers get better conditions; new and decent avenues of employment were opened for many Africans; and African fares could be slightly reduced at a time when White bus fares were being adjusted upwards.</block>

<p>Do you know what this means, Sir? They took on the Bantu at lower wages; they are doing the same work the Whites are doing; they drive buses of the same kind; the conductors are doing the same work, but it is being done by Bantu who do so at lower wages than those received by the Whites.</p>

<p>The hon. Member imagines himself to be a person who knows <span class="col_8131-8132" refersTo="page_1218"/>something about labour, but he is displaying his ignorance all the time. But let me quote further what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said about their so-called labour policy. He said that they were advocating a different labour pattern. Remember, Sir, there is a national minimum wage; there is guaranteed employment of Whites for ten years, and all of this is to give them a chance to employ Bantu in the place of Whites. They call this their labour pattern; and then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then we said trade unions must be entrusted as far as possible with the task of smooth adjustment in a changing labour pattern.</block>

<p>But when I asked the hon. member over there whether they would still do that if the trade unions were not prepared to agree to it, he did not have the courage to say yes or no; and now I am challenging him again: If they should ever come into power one day&#x2014;which, thank Heavens, will never happen&#x2014;and the trade unions should refuse to grant permission for Bantu to be employed, no matter how great a manpower shortage there might be, what would he do?</p>

<p>No, that hon. member presumes to know something about labour and he is displaying the greatest ignorance in the world. Hon. members opposite are <span class="col_8133-8134" refersTo="page_1219"/>under the impression that they are bluffing the public with platitudes, with all sorts of fine things which they are saying; and since there is nobody to expose them, they think that the public will take everything for gospel truth. They do not know what they are talking about. This so-called labour policy which they announced here, is the greatest absurdity I have come across in my life, and I do at least have some knowledge of this matter as I was Minister of Labour for six and a half years. But those hon. members move in certain circles on the Rand; they obtain information from trade unions and from certain workers and then they draft a policy which is so ridiculous that no sensible trade union would ever adopt it. I challenge them to name me one trade union leader who is prepared to accept this policy of theirs. I challenge them to find one trade union leader of note in South Africa who would be prepared to adopt and endorse this labour policy of theirs. Sir, they will not find one single trade union leader of note who would adopt this absurd policy, which is not worth the paper it is written on, as a policy for the future. It is a policy teeming with inconsistencies; it is a policy which merely displays ignorance of the true position; it is a policy with which they are trying to bluff the public outside, but the public is not prepared to be bluffed any further.</p>

<p>Then, finally. I just want to deal with one other matter which was discussed by the hon. member, i.e. the Government&#x2019;s Bantu policy, in respect of which he repeated the same old stories he has been dishing up here over all these years in regard to the apartheid policy of this side of the House. As far as the United Party&#x2019;s policy is concerned, he said: &#x201C;How many times have I outlined our policy in this House?&#x201D; What is their policy? He spoke about their policy of white leadership again. Sir. &#x201C;white leadership&#x201D; simply means permanent white domination in South Africa. After all, that is self-evident; that is elementary. After all, one has to be chosen as a leader, and if one is the leader, one is the master. What he expects now is that all those Bantu, to whom they want to grant certain rights, should always be willing, into the distant future, for ever, to choose Whites as their leaders, because they want to retain white leadership. But what does the hon. member for Bezuidenhout have to say about this? His story is quite different. He does not speak of white leadership which amounts to permanent white domination, because that cannot be interpreted in any other way. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout wrote an article in <i>New Nation,</i> in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Briefly, this requires the recognition that a white nation and several black nations cannot ever wish to legislate each other out of the way. They are interdependent and privileges cannot be withheld indefinitely.

Sir, my Leader dealt fundamentally with one issue; he did so calmly, without being excited, in a statesmanlike way. He dealt with the fundamental issue of unity between the white peoples of South Africa. He dealt in equal detail with the question of Government Bantustan policy and where it was leading South Africa. What do we get in reply?</p>

<p>A waffle? We get from the hon. the Minister of Transport a lecture on labour. Is this a repudiation of the hon. the Minister of Labour, whose Bill on manpower training his disappeared from the list of activities of this Session? Is that why it has disappeared, so that the hon. the Minister of Transport could tell us what a good labour Minister he used to be? Of course, he used to know about labour. He was the hon. gentleman who in 1942 had a wonderful scheme for labour, an idea of shared profits, of shared management, of communism! It had the same effect as communism, because the workers would have had a share in the control of industry in South Africa. That was the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s scheme. He is the hon. the Minister who to-day is employing black and Coloured people in white jobs. So he must be the one to get up and try to divert attention from the debate before us. He is the hon. the Minister who belongs to the party which issued the famous or notorious &#x201C;Basterplakkaat&#x201D;. What did we have to-day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, I am sorry. What I was going to say, is that he has become a victim of the &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D;; because what there has been to-day, is nothing but a reversion to those tactics of trying to frighten the white man, the white voter of South Africa into believing that he will be secure behind the Nationalist Party. But he ran away from the issues placed before the House by my hon. Leader. Shrewd as he may be as a tactician, I am not going to fall for his tactics. I am not going to allow him to divert this debate into his field. I have learned from the hon. member for Ermelo that one must not fight on the ground chosen by your enemy. One chooses one&#x2019;s own ground. We have chosen our ground for this debate and we are going to fight on that ground.</p>

<p>Therefore I am going to answer one challenge of the hon. the Minister of Transport. He challenged this side of the House to say where the Nationalist Party constitution differs from that which led to the casting aside onto the ash heap of the late General Hertzog. That hon. Minister says he was there. I challenge him to deny that the issue on which that break took place was whether the clause in <span class="col_8137-8138" refersTo="page_1221"/>the old Nationalist Party constitution, which guaranteed equal rights, political, cultural and language, was to be replaced by a new clause which only guaranteed equal language rights. Am I wrong? Of course I am not! That was the issue of the break, the issue on which the late General Hertzog left the Nationalist Party, because he stood by the old Nationalist principle of equal rights, language, political and cultural. He would not stomach the removal of the other rights and the retention only of language rights.</p>

<p>But let me challenge him further. Let me ask him whether he belonged to the Nationalist Party of the Transvaal when its constitution forbade the membership of Jewish people of the Nationalist Party. The hon. the Minister was a member of a party which forbade the membership of that party for people of the Jewish faith. That is the hon. the Minister who talks to us about national unity. But when he was challenged by my hon. Leader on the facts of what happened this year, he was silenced. I am going to come back to those facts; because what has happened during this Session of Parliament is that the Nationalist Party has become prisoner of its own history. It is caught in the sterile political cul-de-sac which the whole history of that party has created for itself. The leaders&#x2014;I believe they were sincere&#x2014;of that party sought to find a way out of the cul-de-sac. But when they were faced with the real issue, they found that they were blocked by their own members, by their own history and by the strength of the traditions of their own party.</p>

<p>We have heard a lot of bombast lately. There were threats, warnings, ultimatums, attacks by one Nationalist on another Nationalist. This has all been in the process of &#x201C;lugsuiwering&#x201D;, clearing the air, removing uncertainty, removing discontent in the Nationalist Party, this Nationalist Party which is so united, which has found a new outwards direction along which they are all moving together. It is a policy which is able to say, &#x201C;But some of my best friends are English, or Jewish, or &#x2018;verkrampte&#x2019; or &#x2018;verligte&#x2019; &#x201D;. For every one they all have a best friend, who is either a &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; or a &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; or he is English or Jewish. Even golf has suddenly become fashionable. It is no longer an imported, &#x201C;uitheemse&#x201D; game. The isolated deviates were going to be dealt with. They were going to be fixed, because they did not represent the official policy. They were going to be put in their place. And they were, Mr. Speaker! My hon. Leader referred to some of the things said about them. I want to add one or two. The hon. the Minister of Defence said the following of a colleague of his, the hon. member for Ermelo:</p>

<block name="quote">Dit spyt my om vandag te moes lees dat &#x2019;n vorige lid van die Nasionale Party se Kabinet en Parlementslid van die party in Transvaal, dr.

<p>The 18th August?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This is the 18th August, last year. Wait a minute, I am building up! The hon. member for Ermelo according to the Minister of Community Development&#x2014;I quote again&#x2014;&#x201C;het hom Vrydagaand met sy toespraak voor die Rapportryers op Krugersdorp skuldig gemaak aan politieke huigelary en dislojaliteit teenoor die Eerste Minister&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister of Justice said: &#x201C;Ek moet my sterkste afkeuring uitspreek oor die onverkwiklike aanval van dr. Hertzog op <i>Die Beeld.</i> So I could go on quoting. I have another one, &#x201C;Leiers moker dr. H.; onsmaaklik en onwaar&#x201D;, and so on. Then suddenly we find that after all these warnings, after all this name calling, when the chips were really down, the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Transport, as leader of the Nationalist Party in the Transvaal, were not equal to the challenge. When the chips were down after all these threats, after their colleagues in the Cabinet had said this and that about one of their own colleagues, when they were faced with the real issue, they were unequal to the challenge. There was a halfhearted repudiation by the hon. the Prime Minister. There was a prodding by the hon. the Minister of Transport, but it was, in fact, a back-peddling. And now we find that they have reclspsed to their political bosom the very person who was condemned in these terms.</p>

<p>I have quoted these terms. But the editor of <i>Dagbreek</i> had some other descriptions I have not used yet. He called them &#x201C;jukskeibrekers&#x201D;, &#x201C;rysmiere&#x201D;, &#x201C;ondergrawers&#x201D;, &#x201C;dwarsbomers&#x201D;, &#x201C;supers&#x201D;, &#x201C;weerbarstiges&#x201D;, &#x201C;super-regses&#x201D;, &#x201C;Calviniste&#x201D; and so on and so forth. These are the names used by these hon. members against one of their own colleagues. That colleague has been taken back into the political bosom of the Nationalist Party. Sir, what it means, and South Africa must recognize this, is that, when the chips were down, the unity of the Nationalist Party became more important than the unity of South Africa. That was the simple choice which the leaders of the Nationalist Party had to make. They had to choose between <span class="col_8139-8140" refersTo="page_1222"/>the unity of the Nationalist Party and national unity. So they swallowed their pride. They had their chance then to prove their sincerity and to prove that there was in fact a place in the Nationalist Party for all true South Africans. When that chance was theirs, when they had a golden opportunity, they funked it because they were more concerned with the welfare of their own party than with what would happen to the wider interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Transport in his reply this afternoon asked why we were concerned. I shall tell him why we are concerned. We are concerned because we believe that the welfare of South Africa, the unity of our people, is something bigger and more important than the welfare and interests of the Nationalist Party as a political party, or any other party in South Africa. It is our concern that South Africans are being misled into a belief which has been repudiated here, not in words, but in fact, by the deeds of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Let us look at the basic facts of this dispute. The hon. member for Ermelo insulted English-speaking South Africans. The hon. the Minister of Transport accepted that this was a gross insult to the English-speaking people of South Africa. There was then an argument within the Nationalist Party. This is not a domestic problem of the Nationalist Party. This affects the people of South Africa because they are entitled to know where the Nationalist Party stands. We found that things went backwards and forwards. We found first of all, and I quote from <i>Die Beeld</i> of 4th May, the following headlines: &#x201C;Twee L.V.&#x2019;s vasgevat. Min steun vir Hertzog en Stofberg.&#x201D; Six days later, on 10th May, we find the following headline: &#x201C;Dr. Hertzog wen in Ermelo.&#x201D; As early as last year we had a headline saying &#x201C;Verligtes verloor, s&#x00EA; Jaap&#x201D;. An ex-Minister, the hon. member for Oudtshoorn, then said: &#x201C;Vorster is besig om te wen.&#x201D; So it has gone on. I do not have the time to quote them all, but I have all the reports here. One day the verligtes are winning, and next day the verkramptes. One day they are being repudiated by their constituencies, and the next day they are winning. We had the headline, &#x201C;Dr. Hertzog betig voor sy kiesers&#x201D;. This is a more recent one. And after all this, after both sides had been winning, we suddenly find a pipe of peace being smoked. It was a pipe of peace, but it was being smoked for one reason only, and that was to create a smokescreen over the real events which were taking place. What were the terms of the settlement, Sir? What were the terms which led to the smoking of this pipe of peace? The terms were not that the hon. member for Ermelo should withdraw his insults and not that he should repudiate himself and say &#x201C;I did not mean to insult&#x201D;. The terms were not that he had to withdraw one single word of what he said, but only that he should withdraw his allegations against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport. In other words, no retraction was demanded. No apology to the English-speaking people of South Africa was demanded. The only apology and the only retraction which was demanded was in respect of his own leaders in the Nationalist Party. He had to say that they were not in fact misled by their own Press and that he did not mean that they were misled by their own Press, but nowhere did he have to say that he withdrew his insults or that he apologized for those insults. All that the Nationalist Party and its leadership were worried about, and I say this without fear of contradiction, was that his speech might chase away the support of English-speaking people. They were not worried about the fact that the English-speaking people may have been insulted. They were worried because they thought that the English-speaking people might have been frightened away. Just read the speeches of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and the others who spoke in repudiation. Throughout their speeches the theme is not &#x201C;You have insulted fellow South Africans. Withdraw&#x201D;. The theme is &#x201C;You have endangered the unity of the Nationalist Party&#x201D;. In speech after speech, and in repudiation after repudiation there was not once an attack on his insults. There was only an attack on his threat to the unity of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Sir, what is the final end of the road? I have two reports here, both from <i>Die Beeld.</i> The one is dated 8th June, and the other is dated 15th June. In the cutting taken from the edition of 8th June, we find the headline: &#x201C;Ek weet nie, s&#x00EA; dr. Hertzog.&#x201D; The headline taken from the edition of 15th June says &#x201C;Minister Schoeman weet niks daarvan&#x201D;. Neither knew. I should, however, like to quote what was said quite unequivocally by the hon. member for Ermelo. The report reads, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows:</p>

<block name="quote"> Dr. Hertzog se tema Vrydagaand was die Nasionale Party as politieke volksfront van die Afrikanerdom.</block>

<p>And so it goes on, Sir. He is supported in this by a dozen other members in this House, whom I could quote. &#x201C;Die Nasionale Party is die politieke volksfront van die Afrikanerdom&#x201D; is what he said. Not once, by any member, has there been a statement to the effect that the Nationalist Party has grown beyond that point in its own history, and become &#x201C;die politieke volksfront&#x201D; of South Africans. That is the fundamental difference which we have to settle. What we have to settle is not whether the Nationalist Party is the &#x201C;volksfront&#x201D; of the Afrikaner, but whether it is the &#x201C;volksfront&#x201D; of South Africans.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, I do not have the time. That hon. member can make a speech and give us explanations of how an English-<span class="col_8141-8142" refersTo="page_1223"/>speaking person is an Afrikaner. He can do so in his own time. I want to say that we in the United Party, we South Africans, have no place for second-class citizenship or second-class patriotism. We know only a first-class patriotism and a first-class citizenship. We are not prepared to be a &#x201C;aanlap&#x201D;, an attachment, a &#x201C;bywoner&#x201D; of the &#x201C;Afrikanervolksfront&#x201D;. If any Nationalist Party member will get up and repudiate those statements that the Nationalist Party is the party which is a front for the Afrikaner I would welcome it. But as long as that is the belief of the Nationalist Party, then <i>ipso facto</i> those who are not part of Afrikanerdom are &#x201C;bywoners&#x201D; in the political sense. I say that those South Africans who do not see themselves as English- or Afrikaans-speaking, are not prepared to be political &#x201C;bywoners&#x201D;. We are not prepared to be an attachment to the Nationalist Party which stands only for one section of the South African people. I believe that South Africa is greater than the Nationalist Party and that the future belongs to the new generation to which I and most of my colleagues belong, a new generation of South Africans to whom the Anglo-Boer War is no longer a material political issue, but to whom it is something which is dead, gone and forgotten out of the past. We look forward to a new life in which we do not see each other divided as Englishman or Afrikaner, but as South Africans. That that generation belongs South Africa&#x2019;s future. I believe that in that party there are many sincere people who feel the same way. I believe that there are many sincere Nationalists who believe that the future of South Africa lies in the coming together of people of goodwill, the moderates and the true conservatives in the real meaning of conservatism. I refer to the South Africans who are prepared to build on what is good and to move forward to challenge the future. I say with all responsibility that the true conservatives and the true moderates in that party have no place in the Nationalist Party. There is no place for a true South African in that party. There is only place for a sectional Afrikaner. The true South African will find his political home with the United Party for that is where true South Africanism is to be found. In their own ranks there is not even unity. I want to put a question to the hon. member for Innesdal or any hon. Minister. They have passed an Act forbidding political interference by one political party in another race group&#x2019;s politics. Do they believe that it is an offence for people of one race to give money to a political party of another race group? Would that be an offence?</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, there is dead silence, but the Nationalist Party can take money from people of another race. I call as witness the hon. member for Uitenhage in whose constituency a meeting was held. We find in this connection that their own secretary of the Dagbestuur of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s Distriksraad of Uitenhage said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Met die aanvang van die bogenoemde verslagvergadering, wat in &#x2019;n skuur op &#x2019;n plaas gehou is, het die voorsitter melding gemaak van die feit dat verskeie persone, onder andere Wally Jeeva, finansi&#x00EB;le bydraes tot die tak se fondse gemaak het.</block>

<p>I quote this because the hon. the Minister of Transport stood up and attacked us to-day and tried to make out that that was the party which stood for a pure white race in South Africa, a party which was going to protect the white man. I want to ask the hon. verkramptes whether they belong to a party which is going to protect the white man by taking money from non-Whites with which to fight a political battle against their fellow White men.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, illegally. It is against the law to take money from a non-White to fight a fellow White South African. Is that the sort of political morality which we are going to get? Is that the sort of apartheid for which we are working? In this connection I read only the other day that a predominantly Nationalist-controlled company has just taken up a 26 per cent interest in a business owned by an Indian in Pietermaritzburg. Is this the sort of apartheid for which those hon. members are working? Is this the sort of apartheid for which the hon. member for Oudtshoorn stood up the other day and said that the editor of <i>Hoofstad</i> was a great South African with a great political future? He deplored those who attacked the editor of <i>Hoofstad.</i> This is the party which only yesterday was again in <i>Die Beeld</i> charged with allowing &#x201C;Dr. Hertzog se nuwe ou oorlog&#x201D;. This is a party which has divided member from member, idea from idea and thought from thought and it then talks to us of national unity. I say again that that party has in its ranks people who sincerely believe in national unity. I hope they will realize how they have been misled. I hope that they will realize that the real unity of South Africa can only be found when they get out of the political cul-de-sac into which they have led themselves over the years with their propaganda and sectionalism. A party which has lived on hate and fear cannot cleanse itself in a few months or a few years. It will find itself frustrated at every turn by the reaction of those who were strong enough within their own party to force the hon. the Minister of Transport and the Prime Minister to backpedal when the chips were down and they faced a decision.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is an altogether pleasant experience for us on this side of the House to listen to the hon. member for Durban (Point). We know when he is being pushed into the debate by that side. We have also learned, and he demonstrated <span class="col_8143-8144" refersTo="page_1224"/>it again this afternoon, that he grabs here and grabs there and simply drags in anything, and very often it is simply a great fuss about nothing. That hon. member referred to the youth of South Africa and to where they would fit in. I want to say that the youth of South Africa will not link up with the United Party. But they will link themselves up with this party, and they have already proved this. When we gave people above the age of 18 years the right to vote, the number of United Party members in this House decreased much further. It is very interesting that that hon. member referred to the National Party and said that Nationalists had said certain things to one another. The hon. member said that for that reason we must still do a lot of spring cleaning, etc. I want to remind the hon. member of what one of their members said of his whole party. The hon. member did not select someone in order to ascribe certain words to him. The hon. member said certain things about the party as a whole. I am going to mention three things which that hon. member said about the whole party, but this does not affect the United Party because things like that can pass. As far as they are concerned someone can say things like that about their party; they take no notice of it. They rather busy themselves with other people&#x2019;s domestic affairs. Other people&#x2019;s domestic affairs are of much greater importance to them than their own United Party household, where there has been a pretty rotten state of affairs recently. Which party lost some of its supporters during this Session? I know of an hon. member who left that side, but all of us on this side of the House are still together. According to a report which I have at hand, the United Party needs a heart transplant. The whole party needs a heart transplant. That important organ which has to keep the party going is under discussion here, because their&#x2019;s is useless. According to Mr. Wally Kingwill the entire party is actually dead, because that organ has stopped beating. That is what he says about his entire party. But he went further: Except for the fact that that vital organ should be cut out and replaced with another, there is still a great deal wrong with the party. The party needs a new image and slogan. According to him, what they are advocating now is simply worthless. The whole party must now put this matter right. They must obtain a new image and slogan. That is what he says about that party. I think the hon. member for Walmer will have to give advice. The old heart is not pumping at all any more and the image is in terribly bad shape. He also gave this advice: &#x201C;The political position is becoming more fluid, but we cannot depend upon the National Party&#x2019;s mistakes to come into power&#x201D;. On what are the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Durban (Point) once more trying to &#x201C;up-end&#x201D; their party a little this afternoon? They are trying to do so on the mistakes of this side of the House.</p>

<p>We have now sat opposite each other for six months and we have had a chance to sum one another up. It is probably quite a natural reaction on my part if, to-day, I am allowed to have a brief look at the United Party. Mr. Speaker, here sits the ruling party. Our policies are applicable in South Africa, and on all levels of the national economy this policy is being applied in practice. There sits the official Opposition. It is probably their duty and probably their job to examine the policies of this party, as well as their practical application, to weigh this up and to plan their strategy and arrange their mode of action accordingly. For six months now we have seen how they plan their strategy and how they act in this House. We did not actually see much, and we heard even less.</p>

<p>In analysing their actions and examining their strategy, there are a few things we must point out. It is the (Opposition&#x2019;s job, and it probably regards it as its duty here, to analyse the policies of this side of the House, to pass judgment on their practical application and then to level criticism if they find it necessary to do so. Where the policies of parties are so diametrically opposed, one can understand that there would be a great deal of criticism, and vehement criticism at that. We do not want to deprive them of that right either. They may safely exercise that right. We do not begrudge them that right. During these six months we once more had an abundance of criticism in this House. We had a double dose of it. It was criticism which was frequently only negative. There was nothing to be learned from it. It consisted only of condemnation and disparagement. Very little constructive criticism came from that side of the House. The criticism was so vehement at times that they even forgot to give credit where any government deserved credit for its actions. That was pointed out on this side to-day when financial affairs were being discussed. Reference was made to the economic growth in South Africa and to the position of our industry. We do not receive credit for that. That is also simply condemned. I want to point out something else. i.e. the improved relations among the race groups in South Africa and the growth of a greater South African patriotism and nationalism since South Africa became a Republic. There is nothing but criticism levelled at this side in respect of those matters, and we never receive any credit. There is for example, the progress and growth in South Africa which furnish us with problems, such as a manpower shortage, etc. This is a result of great prosperity. It is not a result of poverty. This side of the House does not receive any credit for what it has done. We only get criticism. Be that as it may, it is not only to-day that it forms part of their equipment. They have had it for years. We have also grown accustomed to the fact that the most pessimistic of predictions accompanies the criticism. We know what damage those predictions have already done us in the outside world. We are still struggling to-day to correct certain wrong impressions created in the outside <span class="col_8145-8146" refersTo="page_1225"/>world by hon. members on that side of the House about us and about South Africa. But it is also interesting that the public in South Africa have nevertheless also learned that it is not necessary for one to take much notice of those fearsome predictions of the United Party which are sketched in the somberest of colours. If one is given goose pimples by ghost stories and that ghost does not even want to make the vaguest of manifestations, the people no longer want to believe that that particular place is haunted. These people will have to live a long time, if I may put it this way, to live down their history. In South Africa it will take them a very long time to get rid of that rancour which unpatriotic actions have aroused in our people.</p>

<p>Except for these super-negative actions, these people are living on vain hopes. We saw this again to-day. They had already taken delight in a possible disruption within the ranks of the National Party. This is strange because they are people who live with disruption day in and day out and who have to relinquish members to this side of the House every day. One cannot actually blame them for at least hoping every now and then that the process will be reversed and move in that direction.</p>

<p>If they cherished any hopes, these will also be dissipated. I want to mention three things to hon. members in respect of this matter. If there were dissatisfied nationalists, they would not join the United Party because the United Party does not have the answers to South Africa&#x2019;s problems. Just give a little thought to what happened in the Pretoria (West) election. What happened to the United Party candidate? Loyalty to the National Party is based upon very sound principles. Our people would not have exchanged the principles we have on this side of the House and in this party, for those we could perhaps obtain on that side of the House, or for what is frequently suppressed on that side of the House. National Party unity will still continue to be a stumbling block to the United Party in the future. They will still find themselve up against it every time. Therefore, in their strategy and tactics, they have been cherishing an idle hope and taking delight in something which never became a reality. In their strategy and actions they also employed another fruitless manoeuvre, i.e. to call in supporters of National Party policy in order to support or to try to prove their standpoint. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration said on occasion that they call in false witnesses in support of their case. One witness who was called in was Dr. Rhoodie.</p>

<p>Dr. Rhoodie is one of our people. But they quickly took a dislike to him. They would have liked to take notice of what Dr. Rhoodie said, but then on a certain occasion he said something they did not like and they dropped him just like that. He pointed out to them that the United Party had actually died off and had become what Dr. Rhoodie called a political anachronism. If, then, they want to take note of what Dr. Rhoodie says, they would do well to take note of everything he says. I think that the latest true statement made by Dr. Rhoodie is one of those which the United Party would do well to take note of. His other utterances, even though critical, are constructively so, in support of the policies of this side of the House.</p>

<p>And so we could continue to indicate the negative actions of that party. They are people who, as it were, want to set themselves up as the alternative government in South Africa. Imagine! They are people who, in this House, try to act in such a way that they can at least also present an outward image of themselves as being, in fact, capable of possibly taking over as an alternative government one day. If the Opposition goes to the public and says: &#x201C;At least give us another chance of ruling&#x201D;, it must at least state what is positive and concrete as well. One should at least talk about one&#x2019;s self for a change and one should be prepared to say what one is going to do. One should not always merely speak about and criticize the other man&#x2019;s mistakes or what he neglected to do. In addition to its task of criticizing and, on occasion, at least criticizing constructively as well, it is also its task to give credit. But it is also very important for the party to give voice to statements of policy from its side of the House. In this respect the Opposition failed hopelessly during each session. This is very interesting and I want to quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indeed, the United Party is at its best in criticizing examples of Government maladministration and muddle-headedness.</block>

<p>This is one aspect in which the United Party excels. I quote further on the second aspect&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It tends to falter on issues that appear to involve national security for there is nothing it fears more than accusations that it is lacking in patriotism. It is weakest of all, however, when it tries to explain its own race policy and Sir de Villiers Graaff&#x2019;s latest attempt was no more convincing than past efforts have been.</block>

<p>This was said in 1967 and I have now quoted from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of the 26th October, 1967. That was at the end of 1967, but what happened last year? Did anything happen last year to change this impression as embodied in the piece I quoted here a moment ago. At the end of last year, during this same debate, I said to the Opposition that they were evading a statement of their policy. If they want to become an alternative government or <span class="col_8147-8148" refersTo="page_1226"/>set themselves up as an alternative government, they must at least persist in propagating their policy. They must not be shy. I accused them of being ashamed of their own handiwork. I told them that this blue-eyed boy of theirs had to play in the backyard and was not allowed on the front step. The United Party is shy to speak of the race federation policy. I can understand the fact that we as Nationalists perhaps do not evince an interest for this policy, but there are surely some of their own people who would like to hear what they, as a party, like to hold up as an alternative policy, in respect of the Coloured problem as well. But what have we now heard? This year we did at least hear a little from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. In the no-confidence debate at the beginning of this year, he made, according to Hansard, a 25-column speech. I did not count the number of lines, but I took the trouble to count the number of columns. Although a lot was said in between about other matters, a little was said about policy, and I found about five columns, i.e. one-fifth dealing with this. The image of the federal system, as it appears from this speech, is as follows: In the first place, separate voters&#x2019; rolls for each group, in the second place, a communal council or councils for each of the non-white groups; in the third place, defined representation for each group in the Central Parliament; and, fourthly, liaison among the groups in their various communal councils and the Central Parliament through a system of fixed statutory committees. I find it strange that we hear so little about this policy. Why are we not told a little more about it? As I said, even though we, as Nationalists, would not be interested, it is nevertheless interesting to note the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party fights on with the loyal support of 45 per cent of the voters and with active support among all ranks of the nation.</block>

<p>This is what the hon. member for Yeoville wrote in an article in the <i>Cape Argus</i> on 28th March of this year. If 45 per cent of the electorate supports them, why are they so shabbily treated and why are those voters not given more of an insight into their policy? Why is this information withheld?</p>

<p>If that is the case, why is it not more widely disseminated. One finds very few of these policy statements. The people are really being neglected. Why are the people not more frequently reminded of what is actually happening, and why is no analysis of United Party policy given? When one has been frustrated in opposition for 21 years, one is surely going to do everything possible. One is going to criticize, but, day in and day out, as the Scriptures say, one is going to proclaim one&#x2019;s policy &#x201C;even from the rooftops&#x201D;. I should also like to quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The truth is that the United Party has shown a remarkable strength and virility although circumstances have forced it to be frustrated in Opposition for 21 years.</block>

<p>There they sit, but they do not do anything. If I were to have been forced into that position, I would have proclaimed it from the rooftops, in season and out of season. After the Bloemfontein congress of 1967 an article appeared in <i>The Star</i> of 3rd November, 1967, under the heading &#x201C;New Steam in the United Party&#x201D;, and the following was written&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While the Nationalists approach the 20th anniversary of their 1948 election victory, the United Party&#x2019;s leaders have launched a determined campaign to make everybody&#x2014;but everybody&#x2014;understand its new race policy.</block>

<p>I know nothing about this because very little happened at the end of 1967. Last year in this House I accused the United Party of keeping silent about that. I have now stated what we heard about it in 1967. I know very little about this &#x201C;determined campaign&#x201D;. I shall tell you why they do not dare speak about this policy. I have also given a little attention to this matter and I now want to furnish the reasons why efforts are not being made at present, as I said, to proclaim this from the rooftops, and why we have not even felt the blast of this fiery effort of theirs. In the first place, the United Party does not know whether it really does have the right policy. They are, in fact, the people who have made many attempts at obtaining a policy. Someone said that there are many objects at the roadside of United Party history. However, if one were to go and collect the carcasses of United Party policy one would need a large wagon to do so.</p>

<p>Yes, they could start up a bonemeal factory. But one must not speak too much either about what one has got because one could perhaps get hold of something else which must be proclaimed to the people. Then again there is too much that the people must forget if too much is said about the present policy. Secondly, race federation is politically unattractive and intellectually incomprehensible. I should now like to quote the following very interesting extract&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the United Party still has one major drawback, which even its followers will admit&#x2014;the policy of race federation. Even delegates to the U.P. Congress in Bloemfontein have complained that the race federation policy is &#x201C;too complicated&#x201D; We <span class="col_8149-8150" refersTo="page_1227"/>heartily agree. It is more than complicated. It is incomprehensible. Sir de Villiers Graaff has tried to explain it. Mr. Marais Steyn has tried to explain it.</block>

<p>That was quite a while ago, i.e. in 1964, but I want to take it further. The article continues by stating&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Arthur N. Field &#x2026;</block>

<p>(He was the representative of one of the East London seats in this House)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; has tried to explain it. But still, nobody understands it. It will be remembered that this newspaper gave Mr. Field space to explain race federation to our readers. Now we are tempted to offer somebody else space to explain race federation to Mr. Field. All we ever seem to hear about race federation is a string of clich&#x00E9;s on &#x201C;sharing the fruits of Western civilization without yielding white leadership&#x201D; and &#x201C;respecting individuals&#x201D; and &#x201C;consulting the non-Whites&#x201D;. But federation implies a system of government according to specific jurisdictions and spheres of autonomous legislation and this is where even U.P. followers are in the dark. The U.P. will get nowhere with this policy. It should be scrapped.</block>

<p>That is what the <i>Daily Dispatch</i> of 16th October, 1964, said. That is a long time ago. All the English language newspapers in South Africa support the United Party, even though they perhaps do not do so in full, and prompt it. That is why I say that they were the ones to say it. That was written in 1964. What has happened since then to cancel out that same impression? I know of nothing. There was the Bloemfontein congress of 1967 and I should just like to refer to what a newspaper, which also propagates the policy of the United Party, had to say, I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the duty of an Opposition to offer an acceptable alternative to the policy of the Government. Does the United Party actually believe it has found such a policy and that under its new name, &#x201C;Federal Policy&#x201D; will be given better support?</block>

<p>They are already flinging their arms in the air and saying that it does not help to rechristen the policy. One will get no further by re-christening it because it still remains unchanged.</p>

<p>I want to mention a third reason why these people are not allowed to announce their policy and why they preferably keep quiet. The germ of integration continues to be embodied in their policy. I once more call upon other witnesses. The first witness says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While a system like this would be an improvement on the non-functioning policy of separate development, it is comprehensible to the educated mind only as a transitional arrangement leading ultimately to full political and citizenship rights for all. The United Party&#x2019;s new slogan &#x201C;One land, one nation, one loyalty&#x201D; itself implies this, for no modern party can offer a programme for a unitary State embodying different gradations of citizenship in perpetuity.</block>

<p>I shall come to liberalists and then I shall mention everybody. Then the hon. members themselves can contradict everyone. It is a quote from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 26th October, 1967. I now refer to <i>The Friend</i> of Bloemfontein, As far as I know that newspaper supports the hon. Opposition. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether on a common or on a separate roll, the inevitable development and upliftment of the Coloured people are going to result, under U.P. policy, in continuous pressure for more representation in Parliament.</block>

<p>That is what their own supporters say. Then I want to call upon a third witness. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But this separate, albeit federal, policy towards the Coloured people (which will presumably require the retention of the whole offensive race classification apparatus) must never be regarded as their ultimate fate.</block>

<p>Then I refer to what the hon. member for Yeoville said. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A third factor which affected the United Party thinking was the unfortunate but inescapable fact that Government policy over the years has made its impact on the South African mind. Our Coloured people did not escape this influence. They see themselves, more than ever before, as a separate group.</block>

<p>I repeat&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They see themselves, more than ever before, as a separate group. This is tragic but it is a fact that cannot be ignored in policy making.</block>

<p>The fact that the Coloured develops a consciousness of his colour, an individual group consciousness, is, according to the hon. member for Yeoville, tragic. According to him there must not be that defined group consciousness; the Coloured must have no ties so that he can subsequently be incorporated more easily into the United Party policy. I quote from the <i>Cape Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The positive aspects of direct representation should not be overlooked. The presence of Coloured South Africans in the Republic&#x2019;s highest forum must hasten their <span class="col_8151-8152" refersTo="page_1228"/>full acceptance in all spheres of South African life.</block>

<p>I called these witnesses to prove that the U.P. are not allowed to proclaim their policy. Integration politics is built into that policy of theirs. There are leaders on that side of the House who have stated how Coloureds would be represented in this House; even the Bantu by their own people. When we come down to that analysis, we need another debate like this one. They will not talk about their policy, but this is the only way in which the Opposition can really go to the South African electorate and say: &#x201C;Try us for a change; we have it in us to become the Government of South Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, shortly after the war I had to take a group of Active Citizen Force officers on a tactical exercise. They had to indicate how they would take up defence positions. A certain old fellow from Ladybrand indicated how he would tackle the problem. He placed one of his platoons out in front, quite isolated from the main position. I discussed this with him and asked him whether he did not think the people were vulnerable and isolated and would become restless when they were left alone like that. He said, &#x201C;Before leaving them here, I shall give them a good talking to&#x2014;to boost their morale.&#x201D; It seems to me as though this is what the hon. member tried to do to-day. Apparently he wanted to boost the morale of that side of the House. In fact, if he had not made those quotations from the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> I doubt whether he would have been able to make a speech. Then the hon. member goes as far as to say that we on this side of the House should be positive. He also referred to the hon. member for Walmer, who said that this side of the House needed a heart-transplant. That is quite right, but I was there too, and that hon. member omitted to say that the member for Walmer also said that that side of the House needed a brain transplant. The hon. member speaks about the youth and the position the youth are going to take up. I am astonished that he is so ignorant, because he is prospective information officer for the Nationalist Party. Is he not aware that the F.A.K. recently made a study of the young people in the Transvaal? Is he not aware that they were asked how they felt about national unity? My information is that 57 per cent of them said that they did not see themselves as Afrikaans-speaking or English-speaking South Africans, but as South Africans. That is the standpoint we on this side of the House have taken all these years, and even the youth are beginning to see it this way too now.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about our race policy, but, after all, the Government is not laying a policy before us here. Their policy is just a series of slogans! They say their policy is apartheid, but what is happening in practice? I have said this before, and I repeat it: Surely one only believes in apartheid as one believes in Father Christmas, until one has learned to think for oneself. They say their policy is separate development. But what is happening in South Africa? When there is real separation, there is no development. Where there is development, in places such as Rosslyn and Hammarsdale, there is no economic separation.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked what our policy was. Our policy is white leadership, and I am astonished that members opposite have suddenly become ashamed of it. Is it not white leadership which has brought South Africa to where it is to-day?</p>

<p>The hon. member challenged me to be positive. He said we were beating about the bush. I do not want to beat about the bush. I want to take one specific aspect of our race problem, and I want to analyse it together with that hon. member. In doing so I want to show that the Government has only slogans, but no policy. If they do have a policy, however, they will never be able to implement it.</p>

<p>When we discuss racial matters here, there is an absolute obsession on the part of that side of the House about who is going to get the franchise. When are they going to vote? For whom will they be able to vote? How many representatives will they be able to have? These are the only aspects they think about. But there are many other parts, aspects forming wedges in the entire structure of race relationships in this country, which they completely lose sight of in this way. One of these is the population distribution in South Africa, and especially the population distribution of the Whites. I should like to say something about this, because I think it is even more important than these other matters that are frequently raised.</p>

<p>When we examine population distributions of countries, it appears that there are certain characteristic trends. The population is distributed mainly according to the function of the transport system. Because transport by water, ships and boats, was the first transport system to develop, we find that the accumulation and concentration of people throughout the world <span class="col_8153-8154" refersTo="page_1229"/>occurred mainly in the coastal areas and near rivers. Indeed, we are still told to-day that two thirds of the world&#x2019;s population are to be found either in coastal cities or near large rivers. In this particular respect South Africa is typical of this trend of development, hence the concentration of our population near our large coastal cities. But our development started later in the history of the world. It started in the time when the railway line was already firmly established as the modern form of transport. Moreover, our development went hand in hand with the exploitation of mineral sources. It is for this reason that we have a large concentration of population on the Witwatersrand. This is almost unique, because no where else in the world do we find this. When such a development starts, it creates its own impetus. Initially Johannesburg began as a centre for primary industries. Later on it, in certain satellite industries, started to develop. In time it offered a home to large-scale secondary industrial activities. To-day, however, the continued existence of Johannesburg is ensured not because it has secondary economic activities, but because it is also starting to develop tertiary economic activities now. Johannesburg has become the financial capital of South Africa. It is Johannesburg which offers a home to our financial institutions, to our industrial banks and to our share market. South African history shows very clearly why we have the specific concentrations of populations we do have at present, i.e. mainly in the Witwatersrand area and in our coastal cities.</p>

<p>But there is of course a second factor which promotes and accelerates this process, i.e. industrialization. Industrialization and urbanization go hand in hand. Both of them are cause as well as effect. Industries will always move to those places where there are the biggest concentrations of people, not only because there is a distribution of talent there, but also because such a combination and concentration of people result in a concentration of purchasing power. This is one of the most important factors in industrialization these days. But when we have the industries there, there is also an influx of people there, in precisely the same way as water will flow to low-lying parts. The only way in which this can be stopped is by building dams. This is what should have been done in South Africa long ago. We should have built those dams. Let me say that what we have to deal with here, the depopulation of our rural areas and the urbanization of our people, is a universal phenomenon. It is happening throughout the world. In the United States of America 80 per cent of the population were living on the land at the beginning of the last century. To-day it is calculated that hardly 8 per cent are still living on the land. But although this could happen in America&#x2014;and this is my theme&#x2014;we dare not allow it to happen here in South Africa, because there are important social, economic, political and indeed strategic reasons why it should not be allowed.</p>

<p>I do not want to take up the time of this House by furnishing detailed statistics, but I just want to point out how this position is deteriorating. We are dealing here with a party that has been in power for 20 years, and I therefore specifically take 20 years as my norm. Over the past 20 years the number of Whites in the agricultural sector of South Africa decreased annually by 10,000, while the non-white section increased by 70,000 annually. The ratio between White and non-White in our agricultural sector was nine to one in 1950. To-day it is 16 to one. There is every indication that this ratio will be 25 to one in 1975&#x2014;and that is only six years hence. That side of the House has always been so concerned about the black spots in the white areas. But we have passed this stage long ago. We are now left with a few white spots in the black areas. At present the whitest part of South Africa is the Witwatersrand. There the ratio is one to one. If we look at the white population of the Transvaal, we find that more than 50 per cent of them are living on 1 per cent of the available area. Only .1 per cent of the Transvaal area carries more Whites than non-Whites at present. That is how white South Africa has become. In 1960 the white part of South Africa in the rural areas was indicated as 16 per cent. To-day it has decreased to 10 per cent. The rural areas are running empty. Our towns have become ghost towns. An article appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> recently in which, <i>inter alia,</i> Mr. Theo Gerdener, the Administrator of Natal, was quoted. He also said that the numerical preponderance of non-Whites in the rural areas was becoming one of South Africa&#x2019;s major problems. Here they refer to luxury hostels for children at schools in the rural areas standing empty. One of our villages, Matjiesfontein, was recently sold as a museum piece. This is what is happening in our rural areas, it is running empty.</p>

<p>This is happening after 20 years of government by that side of the House. But it is clear why it is happening. It is clear why our rural areas are becoming depopulated. In the first place, a very small part of South Africa is really suitable for agriculture. Certain experts are of the opinion that only the coastal areas, Natal and a part of the Witwatersrand are suitable for agriculture. In the second place, the fertility of our soil is low. Our rainfall is poor. It is in very few places that our farms reach the optimum size. Our farms are either too large or too small. But there is also an important social factor. The cities can offer better schools. The cities meet all kinds of social requirements, and this serves to attract more and more people to the cities. But the main reason for the draining of the rural areas is an economic one. The market value of our land is too high. Land is too expensive. I am told that, in order to be able to start a farm these days, apart from the value of the land, one has to lay out R30,000 to R50,000 in capital. Surely this places farming quite beyond the reach of the ordinary beginner. The <span class="col_8155-8156" refersTo="page_1230"/>transport facilities are inadequate. Our marketing system is wrong. Our production costs are too high. And then we are also saddled with an inadequate and outdated taxation system which has burdened the farmers for many years and which is forcing more and more people to move to the cities. These are all factors we must counteract.</p>

<p>There are important social and cultural reasons why we should counteract them. Land tenure, the traditional approach in South Africa, gives us spiritual stability. It is precisely our organic connection with the soil which has formed the framework of our cultural institutions all these years. In fact, our whole existence is symbolized by this. The word &#x201C;Adam&#x201D;, denoting the father of mankind, is derived from the Hebrew word &#x201C;Adamah&#x201D;, which means &#x201C;cultivator of the soil&#x201D;. It is precisely this agrarian tradition we have had all these years which has given our people their cultural values. With the severance of this, as they move to the cities, we immediately find a change in our social values and in our cultural system. It is precisely in the rural areas that there is still personal contact on a large scale between White and non-White, and it is the white culture which serves as the cement, as the binding factor, to keep our cultural system stable. But this white group is becoming so small, the cement is becoming so thin that the entire building will collapse in time.</p>

<p>But there are also economic reasons why we should counteract the depopulation. Even at this stage the agricultural sector is still responsible for one sixth of our national income. As an earner of foreign exchange our agricultural sector is still responsible for more than R400 million per year. This is exceeded by one other sector only, and that is mining. And the hon. the Minister of Finance should be very glad at present that he has the agricultural sector, because if he cannot sell his gold, where will he get exchange from? It is agriculture that is helping him. But who can feel happy about the present situation, because the indications are that in 1975, which is just around the corner, there will be less than half a million Whites and more than 12 million non-Whites in the rural areas, which is a ratio of 1 in 25. Have you ever heard of any community which would be satisfied to leave primary food production and the processing of its products almost completely in the hands of one specific sector of the population? I therefore say that economically speaking we are vulnerable, and that is another reason why the position cannot be left as it is.</p>

<p>But there is also an important political reason why we must counteract this. The rural areas in general give us those people who, politically speaking, are more conservative and stable and more consistent. It is the people in the cities who display deviate tendencies and who adopt an outward approach. It seems to me as though this is a sphere in which there is so much activity and where the hon. member for Ermelo is involved in such a duel with his colleagues that I do not want to take this point any further at this stage.</p>

<p>But I think the most important reason still why our rural areas should not be drained is a military or a strategic one. The kind of situation which is developing against us is very clear. There are people who want to grasp us in a stranglehold of terrorism, and the terrorist movement is aimed at three targets. In the first place it wants to pin down the security forces of Southern Africa. In the second place it wants to blockade our diplomatic movement to the North, and in the third place, it wants to dramatise the confrontation with white Southern Africa, because for their purposes and for propaganda purposes this is absolutely essential. Suppose the terrorists come closer and cross South Africa&#x2019;s borders. What will they find there? A thin screen of police and security forces, which from the nature of the case has to be rather thin. And once they have penetrated that screen, they will find a white vacuum. It is a fact that one can drive for 100 miles or further to-day without meeting one single white man on his farm. They will meet a completely non-white element. Is this not precisely what communism is aiming at? As recently as last week Mao Tse Tung once again made a speech in which he indicated precisely that this was the breeding-ground of Communism.</p>

<p>But this is no unique situation either. Other countries have experienced the same. The Israelis experienced exactly the same situation, and what did they do? They established a group of outposts in the form of <i>kibbutzim</i> and <i>Mushav,</i> and it seems to me as though that is the kind of approach we will have to adopt as well. Here I am not thinking in terms of agricultural spots only. I am thinking in terms of combined regions where there will be agriculture as well as industry. I do not necessarily see them as being outpost laagers only, or front-line strongholds only. I see them as active, dynamic industrial spots. It seems to me that, if one has such a series of these industrial spots, one will be able to control the situation, because then it will also be possible to provide extra-urban electricity. From the nature of the case the cost of living will be lower in these areas, and on account of this more and more white people will return there. These areas will become permanent. It is not the Government&#x2019;s border area endeavour that I am supporting here, because the Government is moving certain of our strategic industries to the borders, which is something I will oppose at all times. The Government is also moving to the border areas because they will find non-white labour there, but I am referring to industries which will be white labour intensive. But in this general system that we have to establish in this way, I think that all South Africans, and also the new South Africans, have to play a part. Here we have a new Minister of Immigration, who tells us how many thousands of people he <span class="col_8157-8158" refersTo="page_1231"/>brings in per year. He is an energetic Minister, and he has an even more energetic Deputy Minister, and between the two of them the immigrants will come in rapidly now. But I am just asking how many of these immigrants are going to our rural areas? They are all coming to the cities to-day. I think we should urge that a certain percentage of the new immigrants coming in should go to the rural areas. After all, this is where the 1820 Settlers started, on our borders. This is where the French Huguenots started. Why must all the new immigrants go to the cities, where it is not so easy to absorb them either? But here we need a national plan. We must create a new body, a rural areas development board. We already have the I.D.C., the Industrial Development Corporation. It is so handy to be able to use these abbreviations; we also got a B.O.S.S. recently, but what I am referring to now, is a rural areas development board (plattelandse ontwikkelingsraad) and if this is abbreviated in Afrikaans, we get the form P.O.R.. and it seems to me as though we need a body to urge on (aanpor) this development.</p>

<p>The hon. member said we should be positive. Here is a positive proposal. Create a rural areas development board which can do exactly what I have suggested to the House here. But what do we get from the Government? Only promises and slogans which can never be implemented. Sir, there are many laws. There are the laws of economics and there are the laws of physics, but there is of course also a political law, and the political law states that the longer a Government is in power and the stronger it becomes, the more it neglects the interests of the country. This is what we have now. We have never had a Government that was stronger than this one, and we have never had a Government that was in power longer. Sir, I can assure you that the neglect of the interests of our country and of our people is now assuming horrible proportions, and therefore a change must be made.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>When those hon. members are in a different mood they refer scornfully to the vigorousness of this Government. Therefore that hon. member is guilty of the charge he levelled at the National Government, because he has come forward with a slogan, and that is that the National Government has nothing but slogans, whereas the opposite is true, as I have just said. In the course of what I am going to say I shall come back to the hon. member for Hillbrow. However, I should like to react to certain questions posed here this afternoon by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Before doing so, I just want to point out that I found it very interesting to note, after the reception which I had on a previous occasion from the Opposition on the <i>de jure</i> population of our Bantu homelands and on the <i>per capita</i> income in those homelands, that hon. members gave that matter a very wide berth indeed. This does not surprise me, because it is very clear how they come to fall into that trap. [Interjection.] Those were irrefutable facts which I gave, from which you cannot run away, and you know it, but I am only referring to that matter in passing now.</p>

<p>I want to point out that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to two things which relate more particularly to the field of operation for which I am responsible. He asked, &#x201C;What has happened to the so-called time-table? They have abandoned it. There is no longer a time-table and they no longer have an objective towards which they are working&#x201D;. This is one of the points which he raised, to which I want to react. The other point which he raised&#x2014;and I hope I shall have the time to come to it&#x2014;was the question of Randburg.</p>

<p>In connection with what he said here about the &#x201C;time-table and objective&#x201D;, let there not be the least bit of doubt about one thing. The ideal which the National Party is actively and vigorously pursuing from day to day and from week to week and from month to month and from year to year is to have the minimum number of Bantu in our white areas as against the maximum number of Bantu in the homelands. I say this is always our task, and as regards the so-called time-table to which the hon. the Leader referred, I just want to point out that Dr. Verwoerd had said at that time that the object was to have one Bantu for each white person in our white areas by the year 2000 and that the ratio should not exceed that. In addition he said that by the year 1978 an attempt would be made to reverse the point of increase in the direction of a movement of Bantu back to the homelands. In other words, the impression should not be created now that he said anything but that. That was the point Dr. Verwoerd made, and in this regard we should not have any misunderstanding.</p>

<p>This afternoon I want to stress, against the background of what I said before, that we are working from day to day to settle the maximum number of Bantu in the homelands and the minimum number in the white areas, and that we are not only succeeding in doing so, <span class="col_8159-8160" refersTo="page_1232"/>but that there is no question whatsoever of any change in our ideal, in the plans under our policy and in the implementation of our policy. I say this with the greatest emphasis, and I want to give the undertaking once again this afternoon that I shall make it my business, as I have been doing since the day I was appointed to this position, to try to do precisely this under all circumstances. I shall come back to this matter, but I first want to give three examples out of many more which I can mention. I am firmly convinced, also from what I am about to say, that we are not only succeeding at a faster rate in achieving the objectives we have set ourselves, but that we shall have more and more success in the years to come. I say I want to give three examples in order to show to what extent we have already succeeded. In a previous debate I furnished figures which showed that for the first time in 78 years we had decreased the total Bantu population in the Cape Peninsula from 113,000 to 109,000. This was a major achievement, one which was rendered possible only as a result of the steady implementation of the policy from day to day and from month to month. I shall give a second example, one which I also gave during the no-confidence debate at the beginning of the year. [Interjections.] If the hon. member will just give me a chance &#x2026;</p>

The second example I also gave during the no-confidence debate at the beginning of this year, and I remember very clearly that I held up the diagram for hon. members on the opposite side to see. I said on that occasion that as from 16th January, 1968, the number of Bantu in Port Elizabeth had been showing a very marked downward trend. Surely this is a great achievement. I want to mention another case here this afternoon.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not have the exact figure now. I refer hon. members to that debate which they may consult again. [Interjection.] I gave the figure here on a previous occasion and I do not want to repeat it. I am only giving these three examples, because the difficulty is that if one quotes too many statistics here that is tantamount to throwing them down a bottomless well. That is why I am only giving three examples in order to illustrate how we are succeeding in this difficult process from day to day. The third example which I want to give relates to a town like Krugersdorp. In 1956 the total Bantu population there was 51,720; in 1960 it increased to 56,504; in 1962 it increased to 59,962, and in 1968, as a result of more rigid influx control and other measures, it decreased to 48,249. This, Sir, surely is a major achievement. I want to quote to hon. members a passage from the report of the United Party Town Council, Forward Planning No. 4, which was published towards the end of last year, and which they readily conceded this point. I quote from that report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prior to the war years the Bantu population had been transient and the increase in permanent settlement very slow, but in recent decades, and specially since 1946, an increasingly important contribution has been made by natural increase as opposed to immigration of Bantu to the Johannesburg complex. This is primarily the result of the more settled and balanced composition of the population, which was largely brought about by the strict application of regulations controlling the immigration of Bantu, in the first instance of Bantu males and, since 1963, Bantu females into urban areas. To-day future growth rates of the Bantu population in the metropolitan area depend primary on natural increase rates, i.e. the excess of births over deaths. Reliable birth statistics are lacking but the available evidence does not indicate a decline in the Bantu birth-rate which is high (between 38 and 42 per 1,000 of the population). This trend has been accompanied by a relatively low and declining death rate (1962: 10.19 per 1,000).</block>

<p>Sir, I have statistics which show that in the times in which we are living now we have already reached a position, as a result of the daily implementation of the policy of the Government, where the natural increase of the Bantu in our urban complexes is considerably in excess of the influx of Bantu from outside. In the Johannesburg complex, for example, the natural increase during the period 1946 to 1951 was 176,000; in the period 1951-&#x2019;60 the natural increase was 717,000. In 1946-&#x2019;51 the influx was 313,000 whereas it was 363,000 during the period 1951-&#x2019;60. During the period 1946-&#x2019;51 the influx of Bantu was 1.8 for every one birth; in the period 1951-&#x2019;60 this figure decreased to 0.5. During the period 1946-&#x2019;51 the influx figure was 1 as against a birth figure of 0.56; and during the period 1951-&#x2019;60 the birth figure was 1.98. Sir, this confirms what the United Party Town Council stated so clearly in its report. I am giving you hard facts in order to illustrate how the Government is succeeding in realizing the objectives it has set itself and in the implementation of its stated policy and ideal. We can achieve this to the extent to which we are doing so, only as a result of the dedication of officials, but the first, primary, basic reason is the fact that unlike <span class="col_8161-8162" refersTo="page_1233"/>that side of the House, we on this side of the House do have a policy which we are implementing. We do have a policy whereas those hon. members unfortunately do not have one.</p>

<p>Sir, I should not like to waste my valuable time, but I want to read to you a quotation so as to illustrate and emphasize the lack of any policy on that side, seeing that the hon. member for Hillbrow said we only had slogans and seeing that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked what had become of our so-called time-table. I have replied to him now and I shall come to it again. I want to quote to you from the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i> This is not a newspaper which I like quoting, but on 25th August, 1967, the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> wrote, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wanted: A policy: Earlier this week the Transvaal Congress of the United Party was held in Johannesburg. The attendance was good, the spirit was excellent and some rousing speeches were made.</block>

<p>But then the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> said that something was lacking&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reason is that political conflict in South Africa does not centre around the question of more efficient government, but around the much more emotional question of national, i.e. white survival. That is why it profits the United Party little in terms of votes to show that the Nationalist Administration is defective in some areas or even that it has taken over some of the United Party&#x2019;s own ideas. Before the United Party can make any headway it must persuade people that it has a policy, that it has a safer policy in the central, crucial area of race.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the difficulty of that side of the House. Sir, I now want to show further how we are implementing our policy in respect of this very difficult problem of the number of Bantu in the white area. While it is true that there were approximately 530,000 Bantu employed in our industries&#x2014;this is an estimated figure which I received from the Department of Commerce and Industries&#x2014;in the country as a whole in 1967, this figure represents an increase of only 156 per cent as compared with the 1947 figure. But over against that the gross value of production increased from R922 million in 1947 to R5,812 million in 1967. Expressed as a percentage, there was an increase of 530 per cent in the gross value of production. Sir, what does that mean? Surely the implications of this figure are very clear. While we did make use of essential Bantu labour in the white area&#x2014;we have always said that this is our policy and that we do not intend doing away with it, because we cannot do so, and it was also the policy Dr. Verwoerd stood for when he said that we were striving to have one Bantu for every White in the white area of South Africa by the end of the year 2000&#x2014;this increase of 530 per cent in the gross value of production was an almost super-human achievement in the light of the increase of only 156 per cent in the number of Bantu employed in our industries. [Interjections.] I know it hurts, because these are facts which I am giving the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to mention one last figure in this connection. On 16th January, 1968, the Physical Planning Act came into operation in South Africa. That is a very important Act. It has brought about large-scale changes in many fields here in South Africa. That hon. member is aware of the fact and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware of the fact that we can no longer simply give permission for the proclamation of industrial areas in the white areas. We put a stop to that. Are those hon. members really so childishly na&#x00EF;ve as to think that this does not contain a definite implication; are they so childishly naive as to think that if in the next decade we implemented that Act as we did during the past year, as I shall illustrate to you now, it would not necessarily have important results in South Africa in connection with the matter which is under discussion now, as it is already having? I want to mention one single figure to you: from 16th January, 1968, to 31st December, 1968 employers asked for 42,271 Bantu workers, single Bantu workers, in terms of this Physical Planning Act, and they were granted only 26,916. In other words, based on the demand as against the number granted, there was a saving of 15,355 single Bantu. On a family basis the number would have been considerably more than 15,355. This is the number that was kept out of our white areas and white industries in this way.</p>

<p>Sir, it is an interesting interjection that the hon. member made there. There is one thing which hon. members on the opposite side must understand very clearly and that is that as a result of the fact that we stand for a policy of contract labour, a policy which the Bantu are not only accepting more and more, but are also appreciating more and more, as a result of the fact that this policy of contract labour has <span class="col_8163-8164" refersTo="page_1234"/>already become so streamlined that the Bantu can very easily go and visit his home because of better transport facilities&#x2014;we go out of our way to make it as easy as possible for the Bantu to visit his homeland as often as possible&#x2014;and as a result of other factors in connection with this contract labour, we are finding to an increasing extent that the Bantu are no longer interested in bringing their families from the Bantu homelands to the white area. In this respect the National Party Government has made a large-scale breakthrough which cannot be under-estimated.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course; we are very proud of it. Our policy on this side is to have the minimum of Bantu in our white area. We have confirmed this by our deeds, as proved by the statistics which I could give you in the limited time at my disposal. In contrast to that the policy of that side of the House, as they have said repeatedly, is to settle the Bantu here on a family basis. I do not want to cover that field again; I have done so before in order to show what it would have cost. [Interjections.] Sir, if those hon. members mock me, I shall discuss that again. The fact of the matter is that it is an almost unbelievable achievement for any Government to be able to say that under the circumstances in which we find ourselves in this country, there are 1,664,000) contract labour Bantu in South Africa in terms of the contract labour system, which is coupled with law, order, peace and prosperity for all, both White and non-White, in this country. Those hon. members can quibble and complain as much as they like. This figure is the correct labour bureau figure for July, 1968. It is the latest figure which we have at our disposal. They can quibble and complain and do whatever they like, but the fact of the matter is simply that under their policy we would have had to multiply those 1,664,000 Bantu, who are here as contract labour, with four or five persons per family, according to what the generally accepted concept has always been in the past, because they want to settle the Bantu on a family basis here. If we should find then that the total number of Bantu in our white areas is below 6 million, I am prepared to give those hon. members just what they want. That is why they mock when one gives them these facts. That is also why they try to get away from them. I challenge the United Party now to react effectively to this figure which I mentioned previously and which I have repeated now. Actually I was not intending to repeat it. They should not try simply to laugh it away or think it away. Let them react to it effectively. They are caught in a trap from which they cannot escape, and from which the country cannot escape. Either we use these Bantu under a contract labour system in our white areas, as we are doing, or we use them on a family basis here, as the United Party say they want it. Now Lam repeating to them that the official figure in respect of the Bantu who were here as single Bantu on a contract labour basis in July last year was 1,664,000. If one wants them here on a family basis it is obvious that many more than 1,664,000 will be here. Even a small child can understand that. Those hon. members ought to understand it. Why do they jeer at these figures now? It is because they are being dealt a very severe blow in this connection. It is their declared policy, in the words of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who said repeatedly during this session, that they want to establish the Bantu here on a family basis. This is one of the dilemmas with which this country is faced. I now challenge the United Party to escape from this dilemma in terms of their policy, and to declare how they will prevent the number of Bantu in the white areas from increasing beyond the number which is in the white areas under National rule. Let me see whether they can do it. I repeat that a small child can understand this. One does not expect that kind of attitude from adults.</p>

<p>Just give me a chance to reply. There are only two places from which they can come and from which they will come. As I said previously, they will come either from the white farms or from the Bantu homelands. That is where they will come from. Even a child can understand that, Sir. One should not ask such an unintelligent question. That is precisely my objection. I have stated this very important fact repeatedly in this House. Now the United Party is trying to get out of this in a ridiculous way. However, they cannot get out of it, because if we have single South African Bantu males here on a contract labour basis, it means that there will be far fewer of them than under the policy of the United Party, who want to settle them here on a family basis. It is absurd to argue further about this matter. The United Party cannot get away from this. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>This policy of ours of having a maximum number of Bantu in the Bantu homelands and a minimum number of Bantu in our white areas very clearly <span class="col_8165-8166" refersTo="page_1235"/>implies vigorous economic development around and within those homelands, and also in particular, greater self-government for the Black peoples in their own territories. It means more and more self-determination for each Bantu people in each one of the homelands. We are not running away from this either. That is why I am repeating these points very clearly in the House this afternoon. Under our policy the road for each Bantu people to develop to full self-determination is clear. This does not exclude independence. This has always been our declared policy, is still our declared policy, and will be our declared policy in the future. All possibilities are open to the Bantu peoples in their own homelands, and when the time arrives, full independence for them can be considered. That time may be soon or not, and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said in the Other Place the other day that it was quite possible that that time would arrive long before the year 2000. It will depend on the Bantu themselves, and on other circumstances which may come into play. The point which the United Party cannot get away from is and remains the fact that the Bantu nations can achieve self-determination under our policy, and that we are leading and assisting them along that road. As a result, we are getting an increasing measure of appreciation from the Bantu.</p>

<p>In connection with the economic development of our Bantu homelands, I now want to say the following: We on this side of the House continually keep in mind the final conclusions of the Tomlinson Commission of 1955. That Commission said at that time: &#x201C;It is the conviction of the commission that the development programme of the Bantu areas must be tackled in the spirit of an act of faith.&#x201D; The commission compared this challenge to that of the rebuilding of the war-ravaged countries in Europe in 1945. The commission concluded its report with these words: &#x201C;The choice for South Africa is very clear: either the challenge must be accepted, or the inevitable consequences of the integration of the Bantu and European population groups into a common society in South Africa must be endured.&#x201D; As I said, we are continually keeping in mind these important words. It is now almost 15 years since these words were written, and what has happened in the meantime? As I pointed out just now, there is no integration in South Africa to-day, as a result of the vigorous action of the National Party. We have so far succeeded in implementing this policy of separate development on a sound basis in South Africa. We are constantly doing so with a view to the future. I do not want to go into it again now, but we pointed out very clearly in the no-confidence debate how we had progressed in this direction. I now want to say with emphasis that as far as the economic development of the Bantu homelands is concerned, I believe that a new era of homeland development has arrived under National Party rule. A new era of development has arrived as a result of the actions of the Bantu entrepreneurs themselves, as a result of the agency basis and the agency system, and the rapid development thereof, and also as a result of border area development and other methods which we are applying there under the able direction of the hon. Minister M. C. Botha. Let there be no doubt whatsoever: As I said with great emphasis at George, I believe that a great deed is called for. The view of the National Party Government is that a great national deed is called for, so that we can have smoke rising from the chimneys in and around the Bantu homelands. This is perhaps the greatest challenge faced by any small nation in the world, i.e. not only to tackle this great challenge with pluck, determination and energy, because we are already doing so from day to day, but to overcome it in the interests of all the people who are settled in this country. That is why I say that I believe a new era has arrived. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education appears to have taken over the role of the present Minister of Community Development as the fortune-teller of the Nationalist Party. As was the case with the present Minister of Community Development, he was full of predictions of reversing the racial tide in South Africa. I noticed particularly that he did not sound quite as sincere as the hon. the Minister of Community Development used to sound when he used to predict these wonderful figures for us. I think he did not sound quite as sincere because I believe he does not quite accept his figures himself. After 21 years figures in fact now prove absolutely nothing at all, as we have said time and again in debates in this House during the present Session. During the course of my speech I will show just how fallacious the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s figures in fact are.</p>

<p>Before I do so I want to deal with another matter which was raised earlier in the debate this afternoon, namely the question of national unity. An hon. member on the other side raised this question and said that the Nationalist Party had always been the party for national unity. I just want to remind hon. members opposite that I as a person not born in South Africa am labelled by the Government as a third-class citizen. I who have lived most of my life in South Africa and have served in its Forces have been labelled a third-class citizen by those hon. members who preach national unity. I want to say to the hon. members on that side that we do not have to talk national unity, since we are in fact the living examples of it. Our whole record over the years of our existence has proved this time and time again.</p>

<p>If the hon. member would like me to deal with patriotism, I certainly will, but in view of the fact that I have other things to say, possibly to that hon. member, let me just say to him that the record of the United Party over the years has certainly shown us to be far more patriotic than hon. members on that side. If the hon. member wishes to have a debate on that party&#x2019;s war record, I am quite prepared to have such a debate. In just a few moments&#x2019; time I will show just how unpatriotic hon. members on that side were, and I will not embarrass them by mentioning the years from 1940 to 1945. I should like to mention the years after they came into power. We had an hon. member on the other side talk about the shortage of skilled labour in South Africa. I should like to suggest to that hon. member in particular that if the Government party had been truly patriotic, we would not to-day be as short of skilled labour as we are, because it was the Government party that halted immigration in 1950. When history comes to be written of this time, I believe that that will be the greatest crime levelled against the Nationalist Party, namely that they halted immigration and cost South Africa approximately one million white citizens. This debate and the entire Session has illustrated time and time again that the Government has floundered on its race policies. We have heard from hon. members on that side that even the non-White groups now accept Government policy.</p>

<p>I would like to quote just one short paragraph from a newspaper report. The paragraph reads as follows: &#x201C;Although a growing percentage of non-Whites have accepted the policy, it must be borne in mind that they have had little alternative.&#x201D; That comment came from the Administrator of Natal, Mr. Theo Gerdener, who is a well-known Nationalist. I want to repeat what he said: &#x201C;Although a growing percentage of non-Whites have accepted the policy, it must be borne in mind that they have had little alternative.&#x201D; This Government has no answer to the race problems of South Africa and it never has had one. It has succeeded in bluffing its supporters over the past years, but this bluff is now coming home to roost. I think the essence of this is that fear has regulated Government thinking for the past 21 years. Firstly, they fear losing power. If they did not fear losing power, why is it necessary for them to go to the extent that they do and in fact boast about the indoctrination of children at schools? Why is it necessary for them to control their Press in the manner that they do and threaten the Press they do not control? Why is it necessary for them to control the South African Broadcasting Corporation? Why was this necessary if they did not fear losing power? Why was it necessary for them to stop immigration? Why was it necessary to use State bodies to the extent that they do to put out party propaganda?</p>

<p>If the hon. member wants an example of that, let me remind him of the debate we held here recently in regard to the Information Vote which showed that the Department of Information has opened up information offices in many of the villages and drops of South Africa where it is quite obvious they will have no effect whatsoever, except on the local inhabitants.</p>

<p>Then there is the fear that their own supporters will learn the truth about the facts of South Africa. As a result of that fear we have the hon. the Deputy Minister quoting figures here <i>ad lib</i> while in fact they do not mean anything. If all we have from the Government after 21 years is figures, then heaven help us!</p>

<p>Yes, figures do not count. But the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s greatest fear of all is their fear of the non-White races of South Africa. They especially fear the black man. I think that if the truth be told, the &#x201C;winds of change&#x201D; speech terrified the life out of them. If one lives in South Africa for a very short space of time, one quickly appreciates that only a frightened person would vote Nationalist, because a man who has confidence in himself and his ability would no more vote Nationalist than communist.</p>

<p>The other matter they feared during this Session was, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) said, that the &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D; had captured the Nationalist Party hook, line and sinker.

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before the adjournment I was dealing with the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and his contribution this Session in particular. I suggest that the Government would get no help from that hon. member. I should like to quote from an article which appeared in the <i>Nataller</i> of the 3rd January, which reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of the Government does not mean the watertight segregation of the different race groups, but the laying of the foundations on which development of like groupings can be built up.</block>

<p>This is a new angle to the Nationalist Party policy. But if there is any doubt, I should like to quote an article published in the same newspaper. I do not claim that it was written by the hon. member, but I would suggest that it expresses his views. It appeared on the 10th January, of this year and reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">There is only one way to get the homelands started quickly and that is to allow white capital and initiative there; not only allow this to take place, but to entice it there and if necessary, to force it by making white skill and capital less attractive elsewhere.</block>

<p>It went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">It is doubtful whether the Whites will ever be in the majority in that portion of Southern Africa which must remain permanently under their control.</block>

<p>This expresses the attitude of the Nationalist Party, but I should like to suggest that when the Government Press starts telling the factual truth to South Africa, the Government, and that hon. member in particular, should point out to businessmen that if they do not go to the homelands and the border industries, the Government has every intention of forcing them to go there. This is what the hon. member for Umhlatuzana said. But he is not alone in this attitude, because the hon. member for Klip River, the leader of the Nationalist Party in the Province of Natal, said just the other day in a report that the Government is to force African farm labourers to work on white farms. It would prevent them from returning to their homelands until the farm labour shortage ended.</p>

<p>Now we come to the crux of the whole matter. Other members on that side talked about returning the Bantu to their original homelands. But that hon. member and the Government as a whole now comes out with the statement that they will only be returned to the homelands if the Whites have no further use for them. If they can no longer be employed in white areas, they can go to their homelands. In other words, Natives must be forced to return to the homelands. First they must go, according to the Government. But now they must stay away, providing they can work for the white race. So this is the policy we are concerned with. Then I should like to read a little further:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Torlage said the Government wanted to make it clear that this would not be tolerated.</block>

<p>He referred to African labour.</p>

<block name="quote">The Africans had been farm labourers for years and could not suddenly change their jobs. Africans for whom there was still work, would not be able to go to the homelands.</block>

<p>There are roughly five million Africans working in South Africa to-day. Now one must assume that these Africans will not be able to go back to their homelands, because they are needed in the White economy.</p>

<p>If I am talking nonsense, I am only repeating what the hon. member said in a statement not more than two or three days ago. The point is now that these Africans cannot return to their homelands if they work in the white economy. This is what the hon. member has said. This is the policy of a Government which has been in power for 21 years. No longer has the African a choice of where to sell his labour or for how much he can sell his labour; he will now be told by the Government where to work. I suggest that this is nothing more or less, than forced labour. I could call it other names, but I will leave it at that. It is forced <span class="col_8171-8172" refersTo="page_1238"/>labour. I would like South Africa to be the judge of a government that acts in this manner. According to democratic principles, a man is entitled to sell his labour where and when he wishes. But so much for the homelands. The Government says that the Bantu must return to the homelands, but the hon. member for Klip River lets the cat out of the bag and says they can only return to the homelands if the Whites have no further use for them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Now I will point out the fallacy of this remark to the hon. the Minister of Transport. At the moment there are 9,000 Blacks doing jobs previously done by Whites on the South African Railways. I think the total of Blacks working on the South African Railways exceeds 100,000. So one must then assume that those 100,000 can work for the South African Railways, provided there is work for them. Immediately when there is no work for them, they can all scatter off, back to some homeland which they probably have never seen.</p>

<p>But the position even becomes worse. Fifty per cent of all the economically active Bantu in South Africa work in essential services for all race groups. That is over two million Bantu. In other words, they can only be replaced if there is no further work for them. I should like to ask that hon. member, where are they going to find two million Whites to replace these Bantu? Because that is their policy. The economically active non-Whites in South Africa increased by 439,000 in the past four years, while the Whites increased by 110,000 in the same period. The hon. member for Primrose, who trots out so many figures here, had better look at these figures a little more closely than he has been doing; because here is the crux of the matter and the failure of Nationalist Party policy for 21 successive years. Every four years 100,000-plus non-Whites come into South Africa&#x2019;s economy, and the hon. member says they will only work while they have jobs. That obviously leads to one thought only&#x2014;separate development only exists if it means the development of the white race, and let the devil take the hindmost. I should like to ask hon. members on that side, what progress has there been in the border areas? What progress has there been in the Bantustans themselves? None whatsoever, or precious little. The South African economy has boomed, but wherever it has boomed, separate development does not exist, and hon. members on the other side know it.</p>

I also can trot out figures like the hon. the Deputy Minister. In France it is 8.8 per cent. I can go on.

It is estimated that 140,000 Bantu entered white areas in 1965. Of this figure, 90 per cent were males. I should like, without any political overtones, to suggest to the Government that it is about time they investigated this position. Ninety per cent of the Bantu labour in the white cities that have entered these cities in the last few years are males.</p>

<p>For the information of the hon. member for Durban (Point), I shall answer his statements. It shocks one when a member acts in the way the hon. member for Port Natal acted in this House to-night and to hear the statements he made. I have never believed in labelling anybody. I have never been a snob in my life. But the hon. member said this afternoon that he was being labelled as a third-rate citizen in the Republic of South Africa. There is no need for that hon. member to be labelled. He is labelling himself. It is a pity that an hon. member should act in this Chamber with only one object in mind, i.e. to break down relations that have been established by the National Party. What is the reason for it? I notice the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not in the House to-night. I can understand that, too. Having acted the way he did in this Chamber this afternoon, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition ought to take a good rest. The hon. member for Yeoville sat next to him guffawing. However, we still have a few responsible members on that side of the House. In this connection, my political instinct told me that members were deeply shocked by the actions of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition dealt with patriotism and nationalism. As regards South Africa, I say to you, Sir, that the concept of patriotism and nationalism is synonymous. I want to tell the Leader of the United Party and to the members representing that Party in this Chamber that patriotism and nationalism are synonymous.</p>

<p>What did we see happen here this afternoon? What happened here this afternoon? It was proved quite clearly again this afternoon that it was no longer possible to conduct a debate in this House in which one principle was contrasted with another and in which one ideal was contrasted with another. It is no longer possible to conduct a debate in this Chamber on the question of whether there is any efficiency or not. When one presents this House with figures, one is laughed at as has happened with the hon. the Deputy Minister. This year the Department of Bantu Administration went to a great deal of trouble to make certain figures available to members in detailed form. Then the hon. member for Port Natal comes along and says that absolutely nothing is being done as far as the development of the homelands is concerned; absolutely nothing is being done for the Bantu. That is the kind of statement we get. <span class="col_8175-8176" refersTo="page_1240"/>What are we to do when dealing with an official Opposition that is giving preference to only one thing&#x2014;and a shocking thing at that&#x2014;and that is to disrupt relations. I can tell hon. members and particularly the hon. member for Durban (Point) that they will never succeed in what they have set out to do. The hon. the Opposition will never again have the privilege of being the government of South Africa. The hon. member for Hillbrow, with the great ideals and clever thoughts he entertains, said to-night that the longer the Government was governing the weaker it will get administratively. This is merely a contradiction in terms. In South Africa we are dealing with a problem we appreciate fully, namely that we as the Nationalist Party should display a sense of responsibility because we do not have an official Opposition which we can ask to come forward with a new direction and some new ideas as is the case in many other countries where they have a different political concept. Oh no. Mr. Speaker, it will be disastrous for South Africa if they ever came into power again. What are we dealing with? We are dealing with the breaking down of relations. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spent a great deal of time this afternoon making certain statements against this side of the House, statements he would never be able to prove. We are dealing here with an hon. Leader of the Opposition who acted in an undignified manner. When an hon. Leader of the Opposition is so utterly concerned about the domestic affairs of this side of the House, I just want to tell him that it has got nothing to do with him. Why does the hon. Leader not rather concern himself with the problems he has? I think those problems are too great a head-ache and too complicated for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to consider. When considering these problems, they seem to me to be a dreadful head-ache. What else has the hon. Leader done? He tried to break down the relations between the Afrikaans and the English-speaking people in South Africa. The hon. member for Durban (Point) followed him in his arguments. The hon. member for Durban (Point) does not know and will never appreciate what an Afrikaner is. The hon. member for Port Natal also took pride in the fact that he had the privilege of being an immigrant in this country. If this country of ours had not been such a democratic one, it would not have been possible for that hon. member to be sitting in this House to-night. The hon. members spoke about relations and alleged that the National Party was giving preference to the interests of the Afrikaner. I want to say here that preference is being given to the interests of the Afrikaner &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am dealing here with the relations between the Afrikaans and the English-speaking people in South Africa. It is true that the National Party attaches primary importance to the interests and the identity and to that which is our own, namely our culture and our church, as far as the Afrikaner is concerned. I go further and I say that the English-speaking people in South Africa owe it to the National Party that primary importance is also attached by this Party to their own identity and to their right to have a culture and a church of their own. If that hon. Opposition had been in power in South Africa, it would not have been the case. On the contrary, after Mr. Macmillan&#x2019;s speech we saw what a great so-called Afrikaner the hon. member for Yeoville was. That hon. member may probably be accommodated somewhere, but that is not what I want. South Africa is my country. Not only is the relationship between the Afrikaans and the English-speaking people in South Africa being promoted but the individual identity of Afrikaans and English-speaking South Africans is being protected under the National Party because after South Africa had become a Republic the English-speaking people in South Africa realized to an increasing extent that we had our own identity. I should not like to say it in this House, but I will have to say it. If the hon. member for Durban (Point) wants to hear it, I want to tell him that I am married to an English-speaking lady myself. Would the Afrikaners have elected me as their representative if the National Party had rejected the English-speaking people? It is a ridiculous approach. In this country recognition is being given to <span class="col_8177-8178" refersTo="page_1241"/>both language groups. I come into contact with many people and I know that the English-speaking people are becoming more and more conscious of nationalism. They are realizing to an increasing extent that nationalism and patriotism are synonymous concepts. To English-speaking people in South Africa patriotism has always been an important factor, and they are realizing to an increasing extent that to act in a patriotic way in South Africa one has to be a member of the National Party. Every former leader of this Party bad a special gift, as the present hon. Leader of this Party also has. Even the hon. Opposition with their political obtuseness has noticed this gift. The Leader of this Party understands human nature and one can understand human nature only when one has integrity and singleness of purpose. I do not want to mention names, but there are hon. members sitting in the front benches on the opposite side of the House who think highly of my Leader. I can see and sense it. I can see that some of the hon. members opposite think highly of the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Transport, because they regard the Prime Minister as an expert on human nature and as somebody who, despite negative criticism, will never abandon his principles. In the political arena, as soon as one runs away from one&#x2019;s principles, one lands up in a political quagmire like the one the United Party is finding itself in at the moment.</p>

<p>It is essential that I state quite clearly that there are thousands of cases in the Republic of South Africa where Afrikaans-speaking people have married English-speaking people. Such cases are to be found in this House as well. These two streams of culture serve to enrich and develop South Africa so that it has a distinctive identity. We have an Afrikaans and an English culture, but a South African nation. It is my right to talk about my Afrikaner people and it is my privilege to talk about a South African nation.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to make this one statement and after that the hon. member may ask as many questions as he wants to. I regard it as essential that, in the case of mixed marriages, the parties concerned should choose which stream of culture to adopt. I shall never dictate to people whether to adopt the Afrikaans or the English culture. Nobody can go through life without having a culture or a church. That is the solution and that is the course this National Party is following. We maintain the two main streams of culture and we give full recognition to both language groups. There was no need for hon. members opposite to have flung this question of intermarrying at us and to have used it against us in a disparaging way. They need not have done it, because every one of us has the right to adopt one of the streams of culture as one&#x2019;s own. I shall now give the hon. member for Sea Point the opportunity of putting his question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that he and his wife, who is an English-speaking person, have separate cultures, but what about the children?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bodenstein">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>I have tried to explain it just now, but the hon. member was too busy thinking up a question. [Interjections.] I say again that it is the duty of an Afrikaans-speaking person and an English-speaking person, when they marry, to decide which culture their children will adopt. In my case, my children are entirely Afrikaans, but I shall not take it amiss if somebody should decide to adopt the English culture. That is why we find among us people with the name of Nicol and McLachlan, and so forth, all of them who are staunch Afrikaners. Where have they come from? They are people with English surnames and who are members of our Party and who need never be ashamed of their past. It is a pity that a Party such as the United Party is always disrupting relations.</p>

<p>Moreover, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has tried to-day to disrupt labour relations. Surely the hon. Leader and the hon. member for Yeoville, who is hanging his head now&#x2014;and he has reason to hang his head&#x2014;can never compete with the hon. the Minister of Transport. They say no attention is being paid to the interests of the white labourers. Sir, I am speaking of white workers, because to me there is no longer such a thing as a labourer; there are only white workers, and we, as the National Party, have never been snobs. Some of the best people in my constituency are workers. They are not materialists; they are living a decent life and they are just ordinary workers, and the ordinary worker in South Africa rejects with contempt any person who does not mean it honestly with him. That is why the hon. the Minister of Transport can visit any of the workers&#x2019; constituencies in South Africa where he will be treated respectfully. But I challenge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Yeoville to visit one of the workers constituencies. When one suddenly pretends to be the champion of the white workers it amounts to violation of human rights.</p>

<p>Questions were asked here this afternoon as regards the training of the workers. Hon. members should visit all the technical schools throughout the country and the technical colleges which are being erected throughout the whole of the Republic. I say the Opposition should not look down upon the workers of South Africa, because the workers are playing an important role to meet the challenge of increased production and development. The workers of South Africa are supporting the <span class="col_8179-8180" refersTo="page_1242"/>National Party, and the English-speaking people of South Africa are supporting the National Party to an increasing extent, and it will be a happy day for South Africa when that Opposition will disappear from the scene and we shall have a new political set-up in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>I am quite prepared to accept that the Minister is quite irresponsible and that he will not be responsible for what appears in the <i>Cape Argus,</i> but I would like to deal with the report of the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s own speech, particularly in the light of some of the speeches we have had this afternoon. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What white South African could honestly claim that he would have reached his present level of prosperity without the part played by the Bantu?

<p>Why does he refer to the opponents of the Government only? Let me read what appears in the column alongside that report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Ras Beyers, the former legal adviser to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, attacked the Prime Minister, Mr. B. J. Vorster, and the Nationalist Party for doing too much for the Kaffir. He also said he was not prepared to commit suicide by co-operating with the English.</block>

<p>I take it that the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s condemnation applies equally to the speech made by Dr. Ras Beyers. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. But I want to remind the hon. the Deputy Minister of a document which was issued in 1944 and which was claimed by the Government propagandists and policy makers of the day to have had a very great effect on the 1948 election, because it was published and republished. It said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where are we going? Are such things possible in South Africa? Expenditure on Natives and Coloureds. It is no wonder that you do not have labour. In 1938, 1,562,000 morgen were purchased for Natives with the white taxpayers&#x2019; money for an amount of &#x00A3;4,753,000. This year an amount of over &#x00A3;1 million will be devoted to Native education. &#x00A3;615,000 has come from the white man&#x2019;s pocket. This year an amount of &#x00A3;700,000 will be devoted to old-age pensions and disability pensions for Natives. The Government has now decided this year to pay &#x00A3;1,850,000 as extra wages to Natives on the mines. This amount is not taken from the mines but out of taxation. For years the farmers have pleaded with the Government to make proper arrangements in connection with farm labour, as this is in the interest of the whole nation. Everyone must eat. But in vain. The Government continues with its recruiting policy which is now made worse with this matter and the poor taxpayer must now pay higher wages to the Kaffirs of the mine bosses. This is going too far. Under the sub-economic housing schemes from 1934 to 1943, 4,307 houses for Europeans and 31,272 houses for Natives and Coloureds have been built. There is money for them, but there is no money for our &#x201C;oudstryders&#x201D; and their widows and families. There is also no money for our old people, and there is no money for our poor people, flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood.</block>

<p>When the Deputy Minister then makes a speech like he made the other day, I suggest that he look into his own party&#x2019;s background when they published documents such as this. This was a pamphlet issued by Mr. M. D. C. de Wet Nel, then Secretary of the Nationalist Party, on 12th April, 1944. This pamphlet was issued by the man who later became the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>That can be proved from the Estimates of that time to be completely untrue, but what was the complaint here? The complaint was that our Government was doing too much for the non-Whites. The complaint was not that we were doing nothing, but that we were doing too much. Mr. De Wet Nel was complaining bitterly that too much money was being spent on the Bantu <span class="col_8181-8182" refersTo="page_1243"/>and that there was no money for the &#x201C;oudstryders&#x201D; and the poor white people. Let the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development be quite clear that when he makes a speech like the one he made the other day, he should see that his own doorstep is clean.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with another matter. Having listened to the debates here to-day, I have wondered what part exactly does Parliament believe the Bantu should play. I have taken this quotation from the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s speech, not only because I want to criticize him but also because it seems to me one of the most reasonable statements that I have heard from the mouth of a member on the Government side for many a long day. Here was the Deputy Minister saying: &#x201C;What white South African could honestly claim that he would have reached his present level of prosperity without the part played by the Bantu?&#x201D; But that is what we have been saying here month after month and year after year, and it is continually repudiated. Does the Government&#x2019;s policy lend itself to a continuation of the basis of the white man&#x2019;s &#x201C;know-how&#x201D; and his capital, together with the labour of the black man?</p>

<p>I say that was a most reasonable statement, entirely in line with United Party policy and the words of the United Party for years past. It is precisely what we have been saying, and now the Deputy Minister comes along and says precisely the same. I must say that we on this side of the House agree with him. But when we have debates of this nature I begin to wonder just how Parliament views the Bantu in South Africa. Sometimes I think he is viewed as Public Enemy No. 1, but then again you get a statement such as this made by the Deputy Minister. From this statement it is clear that they are recognized as being the basis of the prosperity of the whole of South Africa, so they cannot be Enemy No. 1. But if anyone stands up here and pleads for a part in the economy of South Africa to be allotted to the Bantu as his right, does he not run the risk of severe criticism from hon. members opposite?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House believe that one of the fundamental principles is that there shall be one economic law and one economy in South Africa, and that to this economy every person brings his little mead of contribution, however small it may be, and that the Bantu are entitled to get their share of the economy, although it may be a small share.</p>

<p>When we get speeches such as we have had, I wonder how far we can go in pleading that the Bantu are entitled to get something back out of the common pool of the economy of South Africa. [Interjection.] The hon. member behind me says they get it. Sir, I will tell you what they get. They get what they got from the other Deputy Minister this afternoon, Dr. Koornhof, namely statistics. If statistics could fatten and prevent soil and water erosion, then the Bantu areas to-day would be swimming in milk and honey, because that is all they seem to be getting from that Deputy Minister, rows and rows of statistics, but they cannot live on statistics. The Deputy Minister gave statistics of Bantu who have been sent back out of the white areas, to show how the Bantu have been reduced in the white areas, but where have they gone? If the Deputy Minister would come to Natal and put himself under my guidance, I would show him where they have gone. If he thinks they have gone back to the homelands, he is wrong. They have not gone back to the homelands. They are going to what is to-day called by the euphemistic term &#x201C;irregular urbanization&#x201D;.</p>

<p>They go and squat not in thousands but in tens of thousands until they are uprooted and pushed on again. They do not go to the homelands. What are they going to do in the homelands, Sir? They have to work to live, and if the Deputy Minister, pursuant to Government&#x2019;s policy, uproots these people in vast numbers and sends them back to the homelands, there is nothing for them to do there; there are no wages for them to earn there; there is no master to employ them. What do they live on? The bulk of the Bantu in the reserves, whether they are <i>de facto</i> or <i>de jure,</i> are living on money that is brought in by wage-earners who are working outside of the homelands. Sir, the Deputy Minister nods his head; he agrees. That is the true position, so every time Bantu are taken from outside of the reserves and sent back again, they are taken out of a job; they are sent back to the reserves and they cease to be wage-earners; they become people who cannot earn the wherewithal to buy their own food in the reserves, so they come back again, irregularly, in their tens of thousands. The Deputy Minister probably knows it but he will not admit it. He wants nice, tidy figures to show that the Bantu are being sent back to the homelands. They are being sent away from what he calls white areas, but they are not being sent back to the homelands. If they go to the homelands they are turned down and they come back and squat on the verge of the white area once more, and so the whole merry-go-round continues with the Bantu continually looking for a job. Sir, I come back to the point which I made just now: Who can defend the Bantu in this House without fear of being taken to task almost for having the effrontery to plead the cause of the Bantu? How can we get up in this House and say to the Government: &#x201C;Before you send the man back to the reserve please see that he has a job to go to; before you send a widow and her children back to the <span class="col_8183-8184" refersTo="page_1244"/>reserve, please see that she has a job to go to so that she can work there.&#x201D; Sir, how can you say to the Government, &#x201C;Please see that the simplest things in life, a roof over their heads, and food, are available to them&#x201D;? Sir, I challenge the Government to tell us the precise method that is adopted in the various so-called homelands to prepare in advance for the people who are being endorsed out from the so-called white towns. What steps are actually taken before 50 or 100 or 500 Bantu are sent back to the homelands; what takes place in the homelands; who goes there and finds out whether there are homes for them and whether there is food for them and whether there are jobs for those who want to work? Is such a survey undertaken?</p>

<p>Sir, the Deputy Minister asks whether I have never heard about the Bantu townships. Yes, I have heard about them and that is just about as far as it has gone.

<p>Now. Sir, I want to move on from this point and come to the next one, and here I would like the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention, if he would kindly show me the courtesy. I want to deal again for a moment with a matter with which I have dealt here before and that is the question of Zululand and what is taking place up there, as well as the position of the Bantu up there. I want to say this, and I am weighing my word very carefully. I am quite sure that the Minister will be able to read between the lines what I am going to say.

<p>The Minister or the Department issued a statement when the Paramount Chief left for Pretoria to say that while he was in Pretoria, he had asked the Minister to introduce the tribal authority system and to create territorial authority in Zululand. Sir, I want to make this clear. There is a doubt cast on whether in fact that was a request from the Paramount Chief, because we know the Zulus and we know their traditions. The Paramount Chief never had authority from any gathering of Zulu people to go to Pretoria with such a request. There was never a gathering of the Zulu nation or of its elders or of its tribesmen or of its chiefs where such a request was made and where the Paramount Chief was authorized to go to Pretoria to make such a request. Meetings had been held, Sir, and precisely that issue had been put to the Zulus and they had turned it down, and to-day the trouble flared up again. The Deputy Minister of Bantu Development is reported to have issued a statement the other day to say at another gathering that the Zulus had not reached the stage of having a territorial authority established there because they were still in mourning for the late Paramount Chief Cyprian.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister knows perfectly well that that has nothing to do with it. Why does he make a statement like that? It has nothing to do with the fact that the Zulus were in mourning. The Deputy Minister knows that the Zulus do not want it. He knows that the greatest care should be taken to take the Zulu nation along with the Government and that this should not be forced on them. The trouble that is arising in the Royal family at the present moment is due to the fact that the Government is partisan in regard to what is taking place in Zululand, and the Minister knows it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; of his guilt. Sir, the first and primary object to-day in Zululand is to get the members of the Royal family together so that they can heal the breach which has been created. I want to put that to the Minister, not to the Deputy Minister but to the Minister himself. I want to put it to him that his diplomatic people up there, including the Commissioner-General, should be used at this stage for one specific purpose&#x2014;leave all the politics out of it&#x2014;and that is to get the Commissioner-General and the members of the Royal family together to heal the breach, to get that split in the Royal family resolved. Sir, there are good men there; there are men of high integrity; there are men of great responsibility among the elders in the Zulu nation. The man there who is the hereditary Prime Minister of Zululand is at the present moment being slighted. There is no need for it. His attitude is perfectly clear. He is a democrat and he works on what the nation wants, and when meetings are held and a decision is come to, he accepts that decision and puts it to the authorities. Sir, I hope that the Minister is going to accept my statement that the division, the schism, which has arisen amongst the members of the Royal family in Zululand to-day, is threatening harm not only to the whole of the Zulu nation but to the whole of Natal. Traditionally, Sir, we have never had trouble in Zululand without also having trouble in the rest of Natal. That is history, Sir. I ask the Minister not to make party politics out of this and to put the Commissioner-General, with his advisers and officials on to the job and to let them heal the breach. It can be done, and when that breach has been healed it will be time enough then to go forward with further politics.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to another matter dealing with this question of politics in Zululand. I have here a paper called <i>Africa South.</i> I see the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development nods his head; he evidently knows about this. I wonder how far the Government are behind this. This journal says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Africa South</i> is the official organ of the official African political parties of South Africa.</block>

<p>I wonder what &#x201C;official&#x201D; means. What are the official African political parties? Does it mean that they are officially recognized by the Government? Are they officially recognized by the Government? Sir, this gives the background to the eight Bantu groups, and the big heading in the case of each of these groups is this, if I may begin with the Zulus&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you are a Zulu, join the Zulu National Party to gain your political independence.</block>

<p>In the case of the Tswana, it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you are a Tswana, join the Tswana National Party to gain your political independence.</block>

<p>These are the officially recognized political parties, whatever &#x201C;officially recognized&#x201D; means.</p>

<p>The Bantu are asked to join these parties so that they may get their independence. What do they say about that? It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The <i>Africa South</i> monthly magazine is an independent monthly magazine which aims at propagating ideas on territorial separate development which must lead to ethnic autonomous republics of Southern Africa. These different racial republics will unite to form the confederation and common market for Southern Africa &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">How to become a member of one of the national parties: Write or consult the organizer &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, I hope the Government is going to say what is an official political party for the purpose of this document. Has the Government accepted this document? Are they behind it; are they supporting it officially? How far are they supporting these policies and these parties officially? Have they accepted the proposition that these parties are formed, as they say, to gain their political independence? Can we go and quote this and say that the Government is so determined to give the Bantustans their independence that in their magazine they have named eight such authorities and the Bantu are being advised to join the national party of each of the various groups&#x2014;the Zulu National Party, etc.&#x2014;to gain their political independence, and that the Government is behind that concept?</p>

<p>Sir, it says that it is the official organ of the African political parties of South Africa, and if the Government are going to repudiate it, then I hope that they will say so in terms loud and clear because, Sir, this is exactly what we warned the Government about; we said to them: &#x201C;You have been promising these states independence year after year; they will claim it from you one day. You think that you have your foot on the accelerator; you will find that you have not; you may try to put your foot on the brake; it will not work. You will find that the states that you are manufacturing have their foot on the accelerator and you will not be able to control the pace.&#x201D; Sir, what is wrong with the document that comes out and says clearly exactly what the Government has been saving is the object to be aimed at? Sir, the Government has said all along that the Bantu will have their political independence, and now when the Bantu say so in white and black, for the eight ethnic groups in South Africa, the Government is shocked and surprised and they would like a copy of this document and the next thing is that they will repudiate it. Sir, nobody is going to be more unhappy, more flabbergasted than the Government if the Bantu take them at their word and come along and say: &#x201C;We are now out for political independence.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, I am running short of time. There is an article in here which goes for Mr. Guzana, the Leader of the Opposition in the Transkei. It slates and castigates him for one reason, and that is because he will not fight for political independence of the Transkei, because he leaves that to Kaiser Matanzima with all the other difficulties he has with the Government. And Knowledge Guzana, the Leader of the Opposition, should be the man who is fighting for political independence. Instead of that, he says he must co-operate with the white man. What nonsense. Kick him out, he says, at the next election; get rid of this man who does not understand Black nationalism in South Africa.

<p>Why does the hon. member not also ask me how many people I addressed the following evening at Bonnievale, when I addressed not a Rapportryers meeting but an ordinary political meeting? It was in fact against people like the hon. member for Durban (Point) that I spoke that evening at Barrydale. I now come to what I said that evening at Barrydale. It was a long speech but I just want to confine myself to that part in which the hon. member referred when he quoted from the <i>Cape Argus,</i> the <i>Cape Argus</i> of Saturday evening. It is such a pity the hon. member did not read my speech himself in order to see what it contained, because I feel quite inclined to think that the hon. member for South Coast would agree with me. I also think the hon. member for South Coast regards attacks and allegations which are being made to the effect that too much is being spent on the Bantu as a despicable thing. I spoke that evening about the development of the homelands, among other things. I mentioned figures of the amounts which have been spent on the homelands during the past number of years. I also referred to the amount which has been appropriated for that purpose for the present financial year, i.e. R67,637,000, as a provisional estimate. I went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This figure seems high, but if the extent of our task in respect of the development of Bantu homelands is analysed well, I can honestly say that this is definitely not too high.</block>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. member agrees with me that it is not too high, or that it should be more, or less. I went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as these amounts are concerned, you will permit me to point out that during the past few years, and again now, shortly before the next election an old, suspect political propaganda trick among Government opponents has once more made its appearance &#x2026;</block>

<p>And when I speak of &#x201C;Government opponents&#x201D; then I do not care a rap whether those opponents are a Vause Raw, a Sannie van Niekerk, a Ras Beyers or a Senator Swanepoel, It makes no difference to me. If a Government opponent employs this despicable insinuation to mar race relations then I will, under all circumstances, repudiate him. [Interjections.] Yes, Sir, I would even have the greatest contempt for an hon. member who states that under this National Government Whites and non-Whites are swimming together at Sea Point.

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Sir, but I would also be glad if the interjections would stop for a change. The hon. member for South Coast also made the point that there were objections because the Bantu were being financed as he put it, &#x201C;out of the common pool&#x201D;. Now I want to tell him where the objections are coming from. If a Ras Beyers is <span class="col_8193-8194" refersTo="page_1249"/>guilty of this, that does not mean to say that the National Government should be guilty of it. After all, we have no objection to spending the necessary money on Bantu development. We did not object to money being spent on Bantu education or higher education for the Bantu. That was in fact the premise of my speech at Barrydale. I said it was necessary that the Bantu homelands should be developed so that the Bantu homelands could accommodate a larger number of Bantu. My premise, and the premise of my colleague on my right who spoke this afternoon, is that it must be possible to accommodate the largest possible number of Bantu in the homelands&#x2014;as many Bantu as those homelands could possibly take&#x2014;so that the numbers left in the white cities will be smaller. In addition they will be able to live under better conditions in their homelands.</p>

<p>This brings me automatically to the next point raised by the hon. member for South Coast. He said that when we return the Bantu to the homelands we should see to it that the necessary housing and work is available for them there. That is our policy, but that does not mean to say that if a Bantu enters a white area illegally, and if he does not have the necessary leave from his homeland authority to be there, we should not send him back to where he came from. That, after all, is what influx control implies. This is after all the influx control which were being applied by the United Party as well, or am I wrong when I say that? Am I wrong in my deductions, now that I have listened to responsible members of the United Party? I am not referring now to the people who sit at the back and talk about the &#x201C;hardships&#x201D; and the freedom which people must have to sell their labour where they want at the highest price. I am referring now to responsible members, such as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast. I am going to do the hon. member for Durban (Point) the honour of calling him a responsible member. These are the people who state that they are also in favour of influx control being applied. Is it not also their policy that the Bantu, who enters a white area illegally, must go back to where he came from? That is, after all, what we are doing, Sir. But I want to inform you that even in those cases where Bantu are in the white areas illegally, we do not act un-sympathetically towards them. I have repeatedly mentioned the townships which are being built, and the treatment being received there by the Bantu. I have already spoken about how those who are receiving old age pensions are given a free plot with a free house on it. I have already explained here how welfare services are made available, to those who are without a means of subsistence or income there, and how they are given relief work in order to keep them going. But that field I have covered before. It is probably not necessary to repeat it to-night. I just want to assure hon. members that we do not act in an un-sympathetic way towards these people. We do not simply dump them there and leave them to their own devices.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me whether it was being ensured that there was housing and opportunities for employment for them there. The reply is &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, provision is being made for them. We have welfare officers and agricultural officers, the people who have close contact with the Bantu in the homelands, who are looking after this. Where there are cases of people who are in need of assistance, they are being looked after. We are not the heartless people we are often made out to be. I think I can leave this matter at that. I think the hon. member will agree with me that he and I have nothing but contempt for people who want to make political capital out of this matter, by saying that too much is being spent on the Bantu when we know that we have trusteeship over the Bantu and that it is we who have to lead the Bantu along the road of self-development in South Africa.</p>

<p>There is another matter I should like to discuss with the hon. member for South Coast. The hon. member for South Coast made an allegation to-night which was incorrect. He stated here that the former Paramount Chief, Cyprian Bekezulu, had requested that a territorial authority for Zululand should be established, but the hon. member alleges that he does not have the consent of the Zulu nation to do that. Mr. Speaker, allow me to say that long before Paramount Chief Cyprian Bekezulu came to see me and the hon. the Minister in Pretoria, I opened a regional authority complex at Vula Mehlo. The hon. member will know where that is. I think it is in his constituency on the South Coast of Natal. The Paramount Chief raised this matter on that occasion. He said that they were remaining behind. I can quote his words here. He said that they had noted that the hon. the Minister had gone to the Tswana territorial authority and that the then Deputy Minister and I had gone to the Venda territorial authority and to the Tswana territorial authority. He asked why they could not also have a territorial authority. Why were they being neglected. I availed myself of that opportunity to reply that we did not want to serve a territorial authority on them. I said that if they asked for it, that request would receive attention.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He addressed a request to us to come and see us. We told him that he could come and see us. Our office doors are open to Whites and non-Whites; that is why our office doors were open to him as well. He came and we told him what the problem was. We told him: &#x201C;We want to make sure that we have the Zulu nation behind you when you organize the area.&#x201D; The Commissioner-General. Mr. Boshoff, is doing his duty. He is furnishing guidance in this respect, and I am not able this evening at this stage to say how many of those regional authorities have been established. However, I think the vast majority of those regional authorities have already been established. The hon. member for South Coast must not belittle me here by saying that I had said that the Zulu people was in mourning. The hon. member is acquainted with the Zulu people. He knows that after the death of the Paramount Chief, Cyprian Bekezulu, they are in mourning. They also know that when the regent was appointed this nation did not want to hold any great festivals because they were still in mourning. I now want to make an appeal to the hon. member for South Coast. I will not make a similar appeal to any other hon. members opposite because not all of them have a sense of responsibility. However, the hon. member for South Coast is a responsible member in Natal and in addition the hon. member for South Coast is also acquainted with the Bantu, particularly the Zulu people. [Interjections.] Hon. members must not laugh about this. Why do they want to laugh about this? After all, it is the truth, or do they not agree with this. Because the hon. member for South Coast is a responsible member, and because he does not differ with us on the need for the survival of the Whites in South Africa, and because he does not differ with us on the need for the peaceful co-existence of Whites, Bantu and the other Coloured groups, it is the duty of this hon. member, just as much as it is mine, my colleagues and my Minister&#x2019;s, to keep the relations between the Zulu people and white South Africa favourable. I want to ask the hon. member not to confuse matters. Do not make things more difficult than they are. Rather help us. You are able to do so. You know the Zulus and can help us. I am saying this to you more than to any other person, because you are able to do so, but in God&#x2019;s name stop sowing suspicion of the Government and sowing suspicion of the motives of the Government. [Interjections.] There I hear the same old cry from the hon. member. Stop wanting to incite the Bantu against the white man in South Africa.</p>

But I would say that this would come better from the hon. the Deputy Minister if he himself was a little bit more careful in the accusations he makes during the course of political speeches.

<p>I will accept from the hon. the Deputy Minister that he denied having made that statement. Unfortunately I have not seen any public denial of it in any Press.</p>

<p>I should like to revert to another matter in regard to Government policy. I believe that during this Session there has been a marked and noticeable development in a wider field of public debate on public issues, more so than in any previous period in our history. I believe that this public dialogue is most valuable. The exchange of opinion which we are now fortunately having in this country between the editor of one newspaper with another in the respective newspapers, is a good thing in South Africa at the present time. I believe that we are finding that the electorate is seeking more than mere slogans and superficial assessments in regard to our problems in South Africa. For that reason I want to return, if I may, to some of the unfinished aspects of the first debate of this Session, namely the No-Confidence debate; since then we have waited for five months, waited for clarity from the Government. No clarity has been forthcoming. In his reply to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in that debate, the hon. the Prime Minister took the House into his confidence and confessed that in so far as the Coloured people were concerned they would have their representative council and that they would be able to look after their community interests through that council. In regard to that aspect, there was no argument as far as we on this side of the House were concerned. But he then left the picture quite incomplete. Whilst we have stated our position as to what the political future of the Coloureds should be in this country, the hon. the Prime Minister merely said that the completion of the picture as far as the Nationalist Party was concerned, had to be left to future generations.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to deal with the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attitude in regard to various matters in that debate. When the hon. member for Stellenbosch says that that is not correct, I want to ask him whether he will get up after me this evening and tell me what the political future is of the Coloured people in South Africa, other than that they will have a representative council.</p>

<p>Now, Sir. I want to refer to the question of the urban Bantu. We have dealt with the homelands to some extent. I want to repeat what I quoted in February. The hon. the Prime Minister said that I had correctly quoted the late Dr. Malan, who said:</p>

<block name="quote">The first and most important problem in this connection &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is, in the development of apartheid&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is that there are many Natives who have never lived in the reserves, but have always lived in the European areas. If one tried to return them to their tribal homes, the Native reserves would have to be extended considerably and much more land would have to be given to them, otherwise <span class="col_8199-8200" refersTo="page_1252"/>there would be tremendous congestion in the existing reserves.</block>

<p>That was quoted by Dr. Malan as being his view and his approach to the question of the Natives, as they then were known, in the urban areas. The fiction of a Bantu citizenship, the fiction that the Bantu in the towns and in the urban areas, who are permanently settled in the area, Still have roots in some homeland, was of a later vintage, after Dr. Malan. That came first in 1959 with Dr. Eiselen&#x2019;s report and the prelude to the Dr. Verwoerd scheme so far as the Bantu were concerned. The hon. the Prime Minister agreed during the debate this year that the position had been correctly stated. The Prime Minister said that he agreed with Dr. Malan&#x2019;s assessment of the position. He went further. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s words were the following:</p>

<block name="quote">The black man needs us a great deal more than we need him. It is a fact that we shall find it difficult at this stage to get along without him if he should suddenly be taken away from us, but we shall be able to manage in some way or other. (Hansard 1969, Col. 354.)</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister continued and repeated certain quotations from the late Advocate Strijdom and the late Dr. Verwoerd, in which they said that the national policy must be drafted in such a way as to promote the ideal of ultimate total apartheid in a natural way. Then he quoted Dr. Verwoerd, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The ideal of total apartheid gives one something to aim at. Dr. Malan, Advocate Strijdom and I have said repeatedly that the policy of apartheid constantly moves in the direction of ever increasing separation.</block>

<p>Sir, that is the factual position. It is accepted that that is the position. We have then the policy which emerges, so far as the urban Bantu are concerned, from the statements of the previous Prime Ministers to which I have referred. First of all, total territorial separation is unattainable. That is basic from Dr. Malan&#x2019;s days. Secondly, the policy must be drafted towards the attainment or the promotion of an unattainable ideal. That is to try and work towards something which Dr. Malan has said is, and which the Nationalist Party has accepted as being unattainable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_planning">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>He did not say it was unattainable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>But Dr. Malan said it. The hon. the Deputy Minister is not aware of these quotations. They were quoted and accepted by the hon. the Prime Minister in February as being correct. Dr. Malan said that, in fact, the policy was that total apartheid was an Unattainable ideal.</p>

<p>Now, Advocate Strydom laid foundations to build towards this attainment of total separation. Dr. Verwoerd assured us that the policy of apartheid constantly moves towards ever-increasing separation. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Justice agrees with me that these are the aims, and the hon. the Prime Minister said that they have been the consistent aims over the 21 years of the Government&#x2019;s policy. That is the moving towards the achievement of ever-increasing separation. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education has said to-day that the aim is the minimum of Bantu in white areas and the maximum in Bantu areas. Now, what is the position of this Government which maintains that it has a policy for the urban Bantu. According to the Sabra survey there were 3.47 million Bantu in white urban areas in 1960. In 1969 the figure is 5 million. Is that a movement towards ever-increasing separation? Sabra&#x2019;s estimate says that by the year 2000 there will be 23 million Bantu in the white urban areas. This now is the ever-increasing movement towards separation. These hon. Deputy Ministers are aware of these irrefutable facts. It is a fact that the percentage of white employees in the manufacturing industries is decreasing by, 1 per cent per annum, while the percentage of non-white employees is increasing by 1 per cent per annum. They are aware &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>We face interdependence of the White upon the Black and the Black upon the White as real to-day as it was 21 years ago. We face the factual existence of the Bantu who cannot be repatriated from the white urban areas. We also face the factual increase in their numbers. Yet this Session responsible members have repeatedly said that the choice before the electorate of South Africa in so far as our relationship with the urban Bantu is concerned, is one of two things; either we must accept apartheid, segregation or separation or we must accept integration. <span class="col_8201-8202" refersTo="page_1253"/>I believe that this is an irresponsible approach.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister for what he has said at Barrydale when he said, as the hon. the Prime Minister has said earlier on this year, that the Whites are dependent upon the non-Whites for their economic prosperity. The development of separation has not been achieved by removing a few representatives of the Bantu out of this House or a few representatives of the Coloureds out of this House. Separation, and I mean separation in a meaningful way, is not being achieved by having separate bus queues and post office queues, or by having separate beaches, benches or buses for the different races. What we have is an urban presence which is factual and which is permanent, whether it is migratory or whether it is settled. I believe that the future growth in numbers in urban areas is an irreversible fact. One wonders why the Government does not want to face these facts. One wonders why the Government does not want to face the fact and the reality that these Bantu will be in the urban areas and that they will remain in the urban areas. One also wonders whether they are going to be as reluctant as they were when we on this side of the House told them how they can get a move on with the development of the homelands, and that is by using white capital and white know-how. They accepted it reluctantly and they dressed it up as an &#x201C;agency&#x201D;. They dressed it up as an agency and said they will get on with this new scheme of development for the homelands.</p>

<p>The urban Bantu presents two alternatives as we in this country face each other politically. The one is to realize that there is a group of Bantu who cannot be repatriated and the other is what the Government suggests, namely to make a success of the migratory labour system. I believe we must accept the permanency. I want to say that we can accept the permanency and I say it for several reasons. Firstly a settled Bantu community will be established, secondly they should have, as we propose, home ownership which will be a foothold for law and order amongst the Bantu people. The third and important matter is that we shall have a continuing labour force which promotes efficiency in the individuals who are employed in industry and in labour. Fourthly there can be a cut back on the amount of wasted time, energy and manpower in trying to administer an unworkable migratory labour system. What are the disadvantages? The hon. members on the other side of the House will say that they will increase in numbers because the Bantu families will grow and there will be more and more Bantu in the urban areas.</p>

<p>The criticism of what we have suggested, namely a settled population, is that they will grow in numbers. Surely, the number of Bantu in the urban areas will increase in any event. The numbers must increase. That is the pattern which has developed over the last 21 years. To think that it will not happen is not to face the reality. I cannot see the possibility of any policy decreasing the numbers. There will be a natural growth, whether it is migratory labour or whether it is the settled population. The growth of a settled population will be a natural growth. It will be a legitimate growth amongst the Bantu people living a family life. It will be a growth within the Bantu race itself. I wonder whether the hon. members opposite realize what problems we are creating for future generations by a migratory labour force. First of all, whether we like it or not, we are producing a new racial group in South Africa born in illegitimacy. That is the mixture of the Bantu and the Coloured people. That group has been developed in this country. It is rootless, they have no homes, and in the most cases they are born illegitimately as the result of the cohabitation of the Bantu and the Coloured person.</p>

<p>I have just said that the Bantu and his wife must be allowed to live and settle and become a permanent part of the urban population. [Interjections.] All right, he will have his children. Are we static? Is the demand for black labour never going to increase? Is the number of labourers or workers in industry required never going to be any larger than it is at the present moment? But I want to say this, and if the hon. the Deputy Minister feels that I am perhaps overstating my case he must say so. I want to ask him to inquire from Bantu Commissioners over the years in South Africa. He must inquire as to what happens with the Bantu women who legitimately come to the Cape to work here. Whether she has a husband in the homelands or not, the first thing she does is to acquire herself, as it is termed, a Cape Town husband. She lives with an adopted Cape Town husband, so that she can be protected from the other single Bantu who come into the cities under the Government&#x2019;s migratory scheme.</p>

<p>Is that something that we can tolerate continuing in this country? It does happen. We have mentioned this over and over again. But the Government sits back and says no, there must be the migratory system. One hesitates to Use the word &#x201C;basic&#x201D;, but surely the basic humanity is such that one must see at least that man and wife are together; the man cannot go home from Cape Town for a weekend or a long week-end in the Transkei. Man and wife should be together. I say it to-day <span class="col_8203-8204" refersTo="page_1254"/>and I am certain it must come when this Government rethinks its approach to the urban Bantu. I have said that there is welcome discussion and expression of opinion in the Press and in public and in organizations in South Africa on this problem. It seems that what is needed and needed urgently, are new directions and new thinking with this problem. It seems that we will never receive this direction and this thinking from the Government until this Government gets away from the fear of what will happen if it drops the slogans that brought the Government votes at the polls, at the polling booths, in the last few elections. They are doing no service to South Africa by continuing a policy which is based on slogans. I believe that the public is getting more and more alive to this fact because they see there is no solution being offered at the present stage. We have sat in this House now for five months during this Session and waited to hear one suggestion from the members of the Government as to what is the solution of the urban Bantu problem. It is a problem of our own making. It is a problem of the making of our history, because the Bantu are for all time integrated into the economic life of South Africa. They have been, they are at present, and they always will be in the future. Commerce and industry are now tiring of the restrictions and the administrative rigmarole that has to be dealt with before they can obtain urgently required labour for the continued development of South Africa. I believe that these are problems which this Government has failed to attend to; these are problems which will become more and more acute as the years go by in this country.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have been a member of this House for almost nine years. In the course of every session explanations were given and statements were made by hon. Ministers in regard to the policy of the National Party. And yet it was once again our experience to-night to see the hon. member for Green Point rising and asking for explanations in regard to certain aspects of the policy of the National Party. I should like to analyse two of the component parts of his premise. This is his own point of departure. Firstly he said that we were economically dependent and would at all times remain so on Bantu labour, especially in respect of the cities. Secondly, he said that house-ownership and property rights should therefore be granted to that labour force. At the same time the hon. Opposition are levelling the reproach at us that the Government is not implementing its policy; that it is not succeeding in reversing the flow of Blacks into our cities. Let us analyse the two statements the hon. member made in regard to land ownership and the necessity for labour. It has often been repeated in this House that these factors would result in a growing black labour force flowing into our urban areas. This would mean that the black population in our peri-urban areas would steadily increase and also that the ratio between White and Black would become more and more unfavourable. [Interjections.] That hon. member is now levelling the reproach that this is in fact the case. If that is so, may I ask what the position would have been if this Government&#x2019;s policy had not been implemented up to now and if the brakes had not been applied. But there is one question which the hon. member deliberately avoided very carefully. Once he has settled this growing labour force in our peri-urban areas, once he has provided them with housing and granted them property rights, what would then happen to the political relations of those people in these peri-urban areas? What would they do about their political aspirations and where would they exercise their political rights? That is the cardinal point of the United Party&#x2019;s policy which he did not touch upon.</p>

<p>The hon. Opposition is now levelling accusations to the effect that this Government is allegedly deviating from certain aspects of its policy. It is definitely not for them to accuse the Government of deviating from its policy. The United Party should not think that we have forgotten where their policy originated. I want to analyse the United Party&#x2019;s race federation policy to-night and take a look at what it looked like when it saw the light for the first time. I want to quote from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> dated 19th August, 1961. It is interesting to learn from that report that the race federation policy of the United Party actually originated in a circle outside this Parliament. In this newspaper report a certain opinion was expressed, and it reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is the opinion of Dr. M. H. Silke, a Cape Town scientist who was one of the chief architects of the initial concept of race federation.</block>

<p>In other words, the race federation policy had its origins outside Parliament. Outside assistance was called in in order to formulate that policy. But what view was taken of this policy by the person who helped to formulate it and how did he view the future logical consequences of his policy? Very conveniently the following was said at that stage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party however has decided not to incorporate details in its official policy at this stage. Sir De Villiers Graaff wants to keep the policy as flexible as possible so that if necessary it can be amended to suit changing conditions.</block>

<p>Those changing conditions to which they referred, were to gauge the frame of mind of the electorate and then to try to strike the note which would find an echo in the electorate. That game is still being played. What is more, they admit that that game is being played. Now I want to quote from <i>New Nation</i> dated February, 1969. In that publication the hon. member for Bezuidenhout stated clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8205-8206" refersTo="page_1255"/>The Opposition can now recover ground. There is no better time and place from which to operate than Parliament. The United Party will have to erase the impression that it has no meaningful alternative.</block>

<p>The whole idea is to reform this policy and to adapt it from time to time. But let us analyse this policy in its original form and see what it looks like.</p>

<block name="quote">White voters would elect M.P.s to the federal parliament in the same way as they did now except that the Coloureds would be voting on the same roll and would have the right to sit in Parliament.</block>

<p>This is one of the inherent principles of the United Party policy. The article goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Africans would vote on a separate roll in constituencies in their special provinces to elect a specified number of M.P.s fewer than the Whites to the same Parliament. Indians would do the same on another separate roll.</block>

<p>When was this matter last analysed by the United Party? Now I come to the crux of the matter, i.e. the difference between us and the United Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This would mean a multi-racial parliament but with the Whites always in the majority at least for the foreseeable future. Initially it would be a Whites only cabinet but ultimately it might be possible to make it multi-racial. If this happened the Civil Service would also have to be multi-racial.</block>

<p>Here we have the race federation concept as it was when it saw the light for the first time. Now the hon. member for Green Point comes along and adopts as a principle a growing number of non-Whites on the perimeter of our urban complexes. Inside those complexes he sees as a policy the federation plan of the United Party as it saw the light for the first time, with growing political power for those people, a multi-racial parliament, and ultimately a multi-racial cabinet and a multi-racial Public Service. That is why we simply cannot find each other on this basis. That is why we and hon. members opposite simply cannot find common ground. In spite of explanations furnished by this side of the House, they are still advancing arguments of this sort, as the hon. member for Green Point also did. But over the years, since their concept of a race federation saw the light, the United Party has met with adversity. They have shown deterioration and have been casting about to a certain extent. They have been searching for a way out for themselves and on occasion they did, according to a newspaper report, receive a considerable boost. Amongst other things the following is said in this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The presence of that dynamic ex-Nationalist, Dr. Jan Moolman, gave them just what they needed to revive &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the kind of straw the United Party has been clutching at in the meantime. This has also been the cause of disunity and a split of opinion in that party which we have seldom seen in any party. The hon. member for Durban (Point) and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tried to indicate here this afternoon that there was a difference of opinion in the National Party. The difference of opinion in the United Party is infinitely greater than this can ever become in the National Party. The difference of opinion in the United Party is so great that they have hived off in all directions. The United Party still has members who do not agree with the party leadership. Not all of them have the courage of Hamilton Russell, who left the party. Hamilton Russell said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I accept, however, that many members of the United Party feel in all honesty that we are in a period when South Africa faces dire threats and that Sir De Villiers Graaff is fighting for time so that there will be someone with whom other countries can negotiate.</block>

<p>This afternoon we were treated to an image of the United Party as contrasted with the National Party which was not only calculated to be for domestic consumption. This afternoon we were treated to an image of the National Party which suggested that we were a group or a lot of intolerant racialists. This afternoon the hon. member for Durban (Point) did an injustice to the image of the Afrikaner as contrasted with his English-speaking fellow-citizen in this country. All of this was done in an attempt to achieve two objects, i.e. to disguise and conceal the difference of opinion in their ranks and, on the other hand, to present to the outside world an image in which the National Party was depicted as racialists and intolerant people. There is a difference of opinion in the United Party. I have already quoted Mr. Hamilton Russell, who also said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am acting alone. There has been no conspiracy. There are others who feel as I do but I will probably be the only one to move.</block>

<p>Why did the other members of that party not have the courage to do the same? I want to come back to the hon. member for Durban (Point), and I find it a pity that he is not present in the House to-night. I want to come back to his image of the Nationalist, the National Party and, in particular, his image of the Afrikaner. The hon. member&#x2019;s object is, on the one hand, to frighten the English-speaking people away from the National Party, and, on the other hand, to cloud the image of South Africa and of the National Party as <span class="col_8207-8208" refersTo="page_1256"/>far as the outside world is concerned. But let us put to the test the nationhood of hon. members opposite and the statements they made. I regret that in this process I shall also have to deal with my friend the hon. member for Green Point. A statement was made by a certain Mr. Donald Ross, the former United Party member for Benoni in this House. He was reported in the <i>Sunday Times</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Donald Ross, M.P. for Benoni, told me yesterday that Dr. Verwoerd must not assume that English-speaking South Africans can be counted upon to pull his chestnuts out of the fire for him.</block>

<p>The United Party members who were sitting here, and some of them who are still sitting here, said those very same things and took them even further. I should like to quote the hon. member for Green Point. He was quoted by the very same Mr. Ross. Amongst other things the following was said in that report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In his protest Mr. Ross quoted the words used by Major Lionel Murray, M.E.C., in the Cape Provincial Council.</block>

<p>This is what he said in that Council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the English-speaking South Africans are not prepared to sacrifice their sons for Dr. Verwoerd and his present policies.</block>

<p>Sir, it is being suggested that there are elements in the National Party who are opposed to their English-speaking fellow-citizens of this country. Those statements which came from that side were clothed in stronger and more cutting language than that of any statement which has ever been made by anybody in the National Party.</p>

<p>What does the nation look like which the United Party sees in South Africa? They see a nation, as has already been described by some of them, which is neither Afrikaans nor English. In other words, they want to see a nation which is an unrecognizable conglomeration of people who do not speak a pure language, who have no cultural background, and who have no history and pride behind them. They want to see a nation in South Africa which speaks neither English nor Afrikaans. They want to see a nation which has no stability behind them. How does this contrast with the nation which the National Party sees? Allow me, Sir, to use a quotation which has often been read out in this House, i.e. the quotation of what was said by Advocate Strydom, which to my mind is one of the most succinct and finest comments which has ever been made from the Afrikaner point of view in regard to co-operation and nationhood in South Africa. On 22nd January, 1957, he said the following in this House (Hansard, column 43, vol. 93)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Both sections are equally entitled to all that our country has to offer her children, and any attempt to detract from this should be regarded as an act of the greatest disloyalty to South Africa. Both sections are entitled, apart from the ordinary rights of citizenship, to maintain and enjoy and expand in perpetuity what is essentially and primarily theirs &#x2026;</block>

<p>Where would one find words finer than these and a clearer insight into nationhood? At the end of his speech Advocate Strydom said emphatically that if anybody were to detract from this, he would regard it as an act of the greatest disloyalty. What right have the hon. member for Durban (Point) and the hon. Leader of the Opposition to launch attacks on the National Party on the strength of the premise that we are anti-English and that we are dividing a people? We on the National Party side believe that we have an opportunity which is unique in the world. We believe that we have been blessed with all the elements which are necessary for creating a great people and a great nation in a great country. Hon. members opposite have the opportunities of acquiring the same knowledge and adopting the same attitudes in this regard. If this country of ours were granted the opportunity of making progress in an undisturbed manner, nothing could prevent it from becoming a great country, just as other countries have become great. We are on the point of gaining the goodwill of the world, such as has never been the case before. Wherever one travels in the world, one encounters a new concept of South Africa to-day. One finds a new willingness to learn about South Africa&#x2019;s problems. There is a new approach towards South Africa and its special circumstances. A certain attitude is gaining ground in the world to-day especially in respect of our colour policy, i.e. that this may not be a policy with which everybody agrees, but that it is at least a policy which is well worth watching. It was my privilege recently to converse with political leaders from other countries. One thing that was distinctly said to me, was that no matter what we did in respect of our colour policy, we should not follow the example of the United States of America. &#x201C;We see what this has led to. We may not agree with certain aspects of South Africa&#x2019;s policy, but we accept that it is a policy which we may not understand fully. It is with interest that we are watching what is taking place in South Africa. We do at least believe that what is being done in South Africa, is not the same and is not going to lead to the same chaos as is the case in the U.S.A.&#x201D; That is why it is tragic that on other occasions in this House the United Party has always been trying to disparage the image of South Africa and to cast doubts upon the sincere efforts made by this Government. It is tragic to see that as far as the outside world is concerned, they are making all sorts of attempts at casting as dark a shadow as possible over the future of South Africa. It would be a glad day when we have an Opposition in this House <span class="col_8209-8210" refersTo="page_1257"/>which would differ with us on details, because that is their right, but which would evince loyalty to South Africa in always presenting the best image of South Africa to the outside world. They are so quick to say that they are attacking the National Party, but in that process they are quite often damaging the good name of South Africa. If there is one appeal I want to make to them to-night, then it is that they should cease that practice and help the National Party Government to improve still further the image of South Africa, which is improving day by day, because a great future definitely awaits us.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that it is now becoming the custom in this House for people not to take much real interest in what is being said here unless we are discussing the Coloureds, the Bantu or the Indians. I promised that I would also participate in the debate, although I do not often do so. But before I come to that I thought I would perhaps find an opportunity of just returning first to the Budget itself. I thought that one could perhaps remind the Minister of Finance of the fact that in his Budget speech he announced the introduction of a sales tax. During the course of that debate I told the hon. the Minister that I was certain that he would get in not R100 million, but closer to R200 million. I went on to say that I believe that if it was R200 million, the public would eventually pay R300 million when all was said and done since it was being levied at the initial stage; and not at the final stage of the selling process. The hon. the Minister then laughed at me and said in his reply that one member had even gone so far as to say that it could amount to R300 million. Of course I did not say that the tax would amount to R300 million. I said that the effect on the taxpayer would amount to R300 million. I think the Minister will now agree with me, now that he has had a small measure of experience of this, that my figures will not be too far out. I went on to say that this tax might perhaps put a stop to inflation temporarily, but that the sum total in the long run would be that it would prove a further incentive to further inflation. The hon. the Minister laughed at that and the hon. member for Florida said that he could not agree with me at all in this connection. But what happened? I said that wages would follow on the ripple effect which he was setting in motion here. I see that one of the chain stores, I think it is the O.K. Bazaars, has already made it known that they will have to increase their Coloureds&#x2019; wages by R70,000 or R90,000. I think this is as a result of this tax.</p>

<p>It is easy for that hon. member to talk. If one does not foot the bill, it is easy to talk. I know there are some of the hon. members who are becoming so verlig these days that they are advocating that a Bantu labourer on a farm should be paid R2 per day. I cannot do that, but if they want to do so, let them. To be serious again, I want to say that I told the hon. the Minister that he would be compelled next year to increase the salaries of public servants and that he would then be angry with us if we told him that he was doing this for political reasons shortly before the elections. He would say that he was compelled to do so as a result of the increase in the cost of living. It was not so long ago that I said this in this House. I think the hon. the Minister would agree with me to-day that I was not too far wrong at the time. I do not think the hon. Minister will again be so eager to tell me that my figures were entirely incorrect, or will he? I do not know. We shall hear later on what the position is. But there is a second aspect I should like to bring to the attention of the Government. It is a pity that the hon. the Minister of Community Development is not here to-night. I know that he is not feeling very well. I am sorry about that. Recently the hon. the Minister said something very interesting in regard to the question of land for housing. He pointed out how land for houses for the middle income group was quite disproportionately high to-day. That is so. What is one of the contributory reasons for the prices of land being so high? It is because certain business men are buying up tremendous tracts of land and laying out township areas, not with the purpose of selling that land immediately, but with a view to making the maximum profit possible. Not only do they want to make profits on the land, they also want to make profits on the shares of those companies which are being established. I notice that a former Cabinet Minister, who always told me that he was having quite a hard time, is now chairman of a R50 million company for the development of land in Natal.</p>

<p>He said so Then he is not telling the truth. The fact remains <span class="col_8211-8212" refersTo="page_1258"/>that quite a number of companies, and very often the same groups, are to-day, by means of take-overs, laying out new township units and in various other ways, causing the prices to soar and shares to go up to such an extent that one wonders how they expect to pay out any dividends on them. Now it is interesting to quote the hon. member for Florida again. He said this afternoon that the shares were too high and that the income of the shares was too low. To that he added that all this proved was what confidence investors had in the economy of South Africa. That is of course nonsense. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me. It is as nonsensical as saying that the increase, year after year, in the number of bets on the race course can be used to denote that people now have so much confidence that they know what horses are going to win.</p>

<p>Yes, it is absolutely nonsensical. I agree with the hon. member. I think the hon. member for Florida was talking nonsense. I think that if this Government wants to do something to cause land prices to drop a little so that the ordinary income group man can also acquire his own home, this would be welcomed. I am not talking about public servants only now. I am talking about all the citizens in this country. I have not yet heard one single announcement where this Government came forward and stated that it was going to do something in regard to the speculation in land prices so that land would remain within reach of the ordinary taxpayers. I understand that a survey is now being made in the Cape Province of the number of plots which are already available in coastal areas and which are being offered for sale but on which houses have not yet been built. I understand that from the Natal Coast down and up again to South West, enough plots have been laid out so that every white person could at least have 1&#x00BD; plots if all of them were to be built on. Can the Government not consider putting a curb on a few of these companies? Cannot a tax be imposed on them instead of the sales tax, in respect of vacant plots? Cannot the tax on built-up plots be made cheaper at the same time? Let us do something to check those speculators a little so that he can reduce his prices, sell sooner and make the plot available sooner for someone to build on, rather than to wait until he can sell the plot at high prices, make his millions out of them and in this way keeps the shares of his particular company on the share market high. Is is not possible for the Government to devise something in this regard? After all the Government has devised so many things. One cannot say here to-day, as they previously said, that too much was being done for the Bantu. After all, the Government has brought out such wonderful plans for housing the Bantu. Cannot they devise something now to try to help the poor white occupant of a house in some way apart from the way of subsidies and alms? Or are they unable to think of something or devise any plans. Or is it that they do not want to do so? Are they afraid that they will hurt certain barons and planners, people who have never worked for any of their capital appreciation, but who have, with all kinds of clever tricks and clever plans, formed companies and in this way made their money? Or are they part of those people?</p>

<p>Whatever he said, it makes no difference. Let him support me and plead for houses for these people. The hon. the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would be well-advised to do so as well. He must sometimes think back to the days when he also was still poor. It applies to that hon. member as well. Some of us are getting rich too quickly. Of course there is nothing wrong with getting rich too quickly. But let us not forget the people from whom we stem. Do not throw them to the wolves. What did they do?</p>

<p>What are they doing. I can tell you what this Government is doing. It remains the question of colour and more colour, day in and day out. I hope the hon. the Minister of Police is here now, because I want to express my disapproval to him in regard to a certain report I read. These people <span class="col_8213-8214" refersTo="page_1259"/>are so obsessed with colour that they even go so far as to hire and pay native women to seduce white men into committing an immoral act. Have you ever heard anything like that? Native women being hired to act as decoys in order to catch white men committing immoral acts? I hope the Minister will, before this debate has run its course, deny and rectify that report. The report did not appear in a United Party newspaper. It appeared in a National Party newspaper. To my way of thinking, and I think to that of most members in this House, using a decoy is a reprehensible way of trying to catch offenders. But when a native woman, and the worst type of Native woman at that, a disgusting Native street woman is hired to act as a decoy to invade what is most sacrosanct in the life of any person, i.e. his family life, and be paid with the white taxpayers&#x2019; money to catch white men, then I say it is an absolute disgrace.</p>

<p>No, I will not be caught. But unfortunately there were people who were caught. I can only go on what I read in the newspaper reports. Is there a single member in this House who approves of this method of hiring Native woman, the worst street woman, to catch white men?</p>

<p>There one Nationalist is saying &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. Who is it? Will he have the courage to say who he is? I do not think so. I do not think that the Afrikaner wife and Afrikaner mother in this country will have any respect for the Government that deliberately allows this type of thing to continue in South Africa.</p>
