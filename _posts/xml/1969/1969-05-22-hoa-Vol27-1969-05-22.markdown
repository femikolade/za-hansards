<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened very carefully to the general debate under this Vote up till now, and let me say immediately that I have discovered a new spirit even as regards certain aspects in respect of which we had had criticism from the other side in the past. A new spirit is evident as regards our Coloured population, our brown people in this country. During the past years this Government and this Minister of ours have seen to it that a completely new deal has been brought about as far as our brown people are concerned. Unlike 15 years ago the brown people are no longer a cynical, unprolific power-political factor in the politics of the white man. Prior to that the United Party showed great interest in the brown people, but it was only during elections that the United Party took any notice of these people in order to get them to the polls. Real and true community development for the brown people at present ensures that the old shadowy and ambiguous position of the brown people on the fringes of the white community, is rapidly making way for one of a population group in its own right. Let us no longer have any illusions about this. To me one thing is quite clear. This new deal we have now in respect of our brown people, a new deal in the social, political and other spheres, which the National Government has afforded the brown people during the past years, is going to contribute towards an intensified political awareness being awakened among our brown people in the immediate future.</p>

<p>This deal is going to lend a weighty voice and definite personality to our brown people throughout South Africa. The brown set-up or the brown establishment, if I may call it that, will henceforth become a growth point which will have far-reaching implications in the homeland of the white man. I say in the homeland of the white man, because it is axiomatic that once the Government has planted the idea of a separate territorial freedom for the black majority in this country, we are not left with a country in which we as Whites would be able to create our own and only homeland through our own ingenuity alone. On the face of it it would appear as if Whites and brown people are destined to live <span class="col_6403-6404" refersTo="page_0349"/>together in this country for many future generations. This basic truth particularly affects those of us who live here in the Western Cape. It is particularly in this part of our country where we will have to try and find during the coming years with greater wisdom the boundaries which are required for good neighbourliness in our part of the country. Our future, particularly in the Western Cape, remains intensely bound up with that of the brown people. We in the Western Cape cannot wish them away from our back door. In future we shall have to face with the greatest wisdom the complicated tasks of the shaping of a policy and the practical implementation thereof.</p>

<p>It is against this background that I as one who lives in the Western Cape want to ask to-day whether, as regards the future dispensation for our brown people, the time has not come that we should have a Tomlinson Report&#x2014;if I may call it that&#x2014;on the new patterns of the future which are developing at present. Should we not utilize the best brain power in our country, as was done in the case of the Tomlinson Commission at that time, to consider afresh the whole situation in which we are finding ourselves? When saying this, I do not mean that this should, in the first place, deal with the political dispensation with which a start was recently made as far as the Coloureds are concerned; there are other factors on the present level of our existence and on that of the brown people which I believe it is time to reconsider basically and anew.</p>

<p>I just want to mention two of these in passing. In the first place, we have the process of our brown people becoming blacker, particularly in the Western Cape and, in the second place, the coming into being of a Coloured metropolis on the Cape Flats where literally thousands upon thousands of Coloureds are concentrated within the smaller set-up in the Western Cape. Thousands of single Bantu migrant labourers in the Western Cape are responsible for a process of interbreeding with the Coloureds as a result of which the Coloureds are becoming blacker and blacker, a process the end of which we shall never know. I do not think it is our intention ever to push the brown people over to the side of the black majority in this country. If we were to try to do this, we would have more than a million brown Bantu persons, if I may call them that, among us in the Cape Province alone. I say &#x201C;among us&#x201D; because for their aspirations there is no homeland of their own at present. It appears to me to be elementary common sense to lay down the principle that in the great contrast of White and Black at the southern point of Africa, the brown people and the Whites belong to the same side&#x2014;please note, not in perpetual enmity, but for the sake of the power and balance which are required in practice for the political peace in this country.</p>

<p>Sir, I now come to a second problematical statement. The concentration of the fantastic number of Coloureds, the creation of what is virtually a metropolis for the Coloureds in the Cape Peninsula, is a cause of concern to those of us who live in the Western Cape. The issue at stake here is the enormous concentration of Coloured people particularly on the Cape Flats. Sir, we have here to-day a twilight region of sub-economic housing in which thousands of brown people are being concentrated to an ever-increasing extent. Sir, within one generation and within a radius of approximately 20 miles a mass population of a few million people, less than half of whom will be Whites, will be concentrated in the Cape Peninsula alone. To me it is abundantly clear that we have reached the stage where we will have to consider this situation particularly within the boundaries of our smaller Western Cape. This is a situation which is bound up with many other factors in respect of the development of our future pattern in the smaller Western Cape. I just want to mention three of these: the increased drain on the water potential of our smaller Western Cape; the signs of overconcentration in the Cape Peninsula and, together with that, the creation of new growth points in our smaller Western Cape as a whole &#x2014;all these things are factors which are bound up with the situation. It is against this background that the thought has occurred to me whether the time has not come that we should consider basically whether new momentum should not be provided particularly in respect of two traditional Coloured townships.

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg has come along with the same old story again that the United Party always wants to use the Coloured people for political gain. Of course, we have made use of the Coloured vote, but the old Nationalist Party did the same. There was a time when the Coloured people in this country voted for the Nationalist Party and for the United Party; they did not distinguish between the two parities. I am thinking of the time of Mr. Bruchner de Villiers. In his time many Coloured people voted for the Nationalist Party, but the Nationalist Party lost the Coloured vote because the Party told them: &#x201C;We are going to take you off the Common Roll.&#x201D; Surely the Nationalist Party could not expect the Coloured people to continue voting for them after they had told them that, and consequently they voted for the United Party. This is an old story which does not carry any weight in this country any longer. The hon. member should not come along and tell us that the Coloured people have now become politically conscious, because many of them have been fully conscious politically during all these years. Sir, I do not want to go into this matter any further.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula made a speech here yesterday in which all of us probably showed great interest. He made a serious appeal to the Coloured community to obey the law of the land and to make full use of the Coloured Representative Council. He <span class="col_6405-6406" refersTo="page_0350"/>appealed to them to strengthen, improve and develop themselves. But he also appealed to the white community. He appealed to us to display our goodwill towards the Coloured people and to see to it that they do not drift away from us further or that they do not become more embittered. But the hon. member did not say that the Coloured people should accept the Coloured Representative Council as the end of the road as far as they are concerned. He said the Coloured people should use the Coloured Representative Council to win back the rights they have lost. The hon. member for Westdene, who is not here at the moment, thereupon attacked the hon. member for Karoo because he was supposed to have said that the Coloured people should never be satisfied with this Council. We on this side of the House do not expect the Coloured people to be satisfied with the Coloured Representative Council and with the political rights they receive through that council. Neither can we expect them to be satisfied with that. The Coloured people will not be satisfied with that indefinitely. The conclusion one has to draw from what the hon. member for Westdene has said, is that the Coloured people should now be satisfied with those rights they will receive through the establishment of the so-called Coloured Parliament and that they will receive nothing besides that. One cannot expect them to be satisfied with that indefinitely. The Coloured people will have to develop further, and they will develop further. I feel absolutely certain that the Coloured people will not be satisfied and that they will want further political rights to be given to them in this country.</p>

<p>The hon the Minister was so kind as to invite me to visit the training centre for Coloured cadets. I must say I was very impressed with the work that is being done there. The buildings and the facilities which have been erected and are being provided there, are excellent and I think good work is being done at that training centre. I must say that the officials that are working there&#x2014;and I am thinking particularly of Colonel Van Dyk who who is in charge of the training centre&#x2014;intend doing excellent work there. The institution was established only recently, but Colonel Van Dyk is a person who sympathizes with the Coloured people and I am sure he will provide them with the proper training in the right spheres. Of course, I regret that the institution is still such a small one and that it has not developed more, but I take it that this will happen in due course. When I visited the institution recently, there were approximately 200 cadets and I think they were making good progress; at the moment the training is more of a disciplinary nature. Training of this nature will be invaluable to them. We should keep up this good work and develop the institution so that more cadets may be accommodated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I should like to associate myself with the hon. member for Malmesbury. We do not always see eye to eye, but in this case we do see eye to eye as regards the shortage of schools, particularly in the country areas. The Coloured people in the country areas are also leaving those areas and are moving to the cities. Nobody can blame them if they think that they may improve their position by doing so. However, I am not sure whether they are actually improving their position, because they come to the cities while they are quite unprepared for city life. In many cases their position deteriorates after they have moved to the cities. However, we do not blame them for doing so, but it will be in the interest of many of them if they remain in the country areas. They leave the country areas and move to the cities for several reasons. One of the reasons is that the school facilities for their children in the rural areas are inadequate. Another reason is that they do not have sufficient sports and social facilities in the country areas. Of course, provision is being made for school buildings on farms at present. School buildings are rented after the farmers have erected them. However, not many farmers are in the position where they can afford to erect farm schools and then to let them. They simply do not have the capital. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is possible to provide farmers with loans in cases where they are prepared to build such schools on their farms. I notice that the Department recently informed the Cape Agricultural Union that it would be prepared to erect schools on farms under certain circumstances. But to my mind this will be a very slow and drawn-out process. I may be wrong, but to my mind at least 50 or possibly 60 per cent of the Coloured children in the country areas have never attended school. The schools in the towns are usually overcrowded and accommodation is extremely scarce with the result that there are no boarding facilities for them. The result is that they cannot attend those schools. It is also in the interests of the children that their parents should remain on the farms. For that reason I want to ask that more farm schools be built, whether by assisting the farmers to erect these buildings or through the Department erecting these buildings itself. Bound up with these schools are dwellings for teachers which are absolutely essential. These dwellings have to be built as well. Usually the farmer does not have the capital to build these dwellings. Either the farmer will have to be assisted in this or the Department will have to erect these dwellings itself. I think this matter is being given serious attention in the Department. However, the time has come when more hostels should be built. The Department is actually prepared now to build these hostels at places where there are secondary schools, but no provision is being made for children in primary schools yet. Hostels will probably have to be built for these children as well to see to it that they attend schools in places where they cannot attend farm schools. There are even people who are of the opinion that, if this cannot be done, <span class="col_6407-6408" refersTo="page_0351"/>provision should be made for bus services for children living a short way from the towns in order to take them to the schools in this way. But the problem is that even the schools in the towns are overcrowded at present to the extent where it is impossible for them even to accommodate the Coloureds living in the towns. I ask for more money to be spent on schools. I am speaking particularly of the country areas. This should be done in the cities as well, but I am pleading here to-day particularly for the rural areas. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the course of this debate the Opposition to a large extent created the impression that what had been done over the past 20 years was merely destructive. Appreciation is expressed of the fact that&#x2014;and I am very glad about it&#x2014;what is taking place now, amounts to a new deal. At the same time however it is being alleged in a negative way that all we had been doing during the past 20 years, was to break down; that everything was simply broken down and that nothing was provided in the place of what had been broken down. I am thinking of what was said about the hon. member for Peninsula. He said very nice things, but he also said something which I simply cannot allow to pass without comment. This was the same spirit which was displayed in other speeches as well. I quote: &#x201C;They and many of their white friends have urged that they should be considered as part of the white population&#x201D;. The impression is being created now that, because we had deliberate political segregation, it was one uninterrupted process of breaking down. Hon. members do not keep in mind the positive side of the matter, namely that it has formed part of an absolutely positive policy throughout, and that what is taking place at present is a logical result of a policy which was expounded by the National Party even before 1948 as its accepted policy according to which certain rights in this Parliament would be taken away and be replaced ultimately by political rights elsewhere, namely in the Coloured Representative Council. We have been carrying out this very policy all along up to the present. I want to put it quite clearly now, and I would like the Opposition to tell me whether they find any fault with that, because this is, basically, what we have been doing all along. The white people of South Africa has maintained its identity as a white nation in this country for over 300 years, because it was something sacred and precious as far as the white people was concerned. The Whites were not prepared to sacrifice their white identity. For that reason the Whites were prepared to maintain that identity, in spite of the liberal world opinion, the United Party and the Progressive Party. That was our policy and we have been carrying it out all along. We said that this was the course we followed, and we have been following that course all along. [Interjections.] Wait a minute, I am coming to the point I want to make. We shall never allow it to be watered down or to be sacrificed. That has been our policy and we have proceeded along that road. This is one of the corner-stones on which the National Party has been built and on which it has became the great and powerful party it is to-day. We shall never deviate from that policy and we shall never apologize for it. As a matter of fact, we have nothing for which we have to apologize. Because we appreciate the value of having an identity of one’s own and because we were prepared to make sacrifices to maintain that identity among the other population groups, we were also prepared to pay a considerable price to help the Coloureds to obtain an identity of their own. For that reason we have helped them socially and economically to uplift themselves and become self-dependent, to obtain something of which they themselves can be proud&#x2014;something which is peculiar to their nation as well as a national identity. That has been our positive policy all along, a policy which is being held up now as having been a terribly negative one over the past 20 years.</p>

<p>It is being alleged that we have only now become converted because we have just started applying a positive policy. What utter nonsense&#x2014;I almost want to say what rubbish, what unworthy statements in a worthy House such as this. The Government has made available to the Coloured people educational facilities which cannot be compared with what was made available in any other country in Africa. What other country in Africa has provided its Native population with similar educational facilities as have been provided by this Government to the Coloureds in South Africa? We have given them their own university, something to which the Opposition has objected strongly. We have founded their own development corporation not only to help them financially, but also to teach them to develop their own economy and in this way to develop something which they can be proud of. It has therefore been a positive policy all along. We have also educated them politically by establishing boards for them in which they could learn from experience the practices of government. In view of all these things one sometimes becomes a bit tired of hearing all the time that we have only broken down these people, as though we have not also taught them to be attached to the land, as though we have told them that they are a loose element hanging in the air and that we want nothing to do with them. Have we not given these people the opportunity of becoming attached to the land in their own group areas? Have we not created for them all possible facilities to develop economically? Have we not provided them with all the educational facilities which I have mentioned a moment ago? We have done all these things for them, and hon. members opposite should admit it. But this is not all. Have we not given the Coloureds their own rural areas and have we not assisted them in developing those areas? Have we not provided them with <span class="col_6409-6410" refersTo="page_0352"/>extension officers? Sir, I should very much like to invite these people who are talking a different language to my constituency to see what is being done in the areas of Steinkopf, Concordia, the Richtersveld, Komaggas, Lelie-fontein and other areas. Those areas have all been planned. Some of our best extension officers have been made available to them and we have helped them to improve their farming methods. While it has hurt one in the past to see the condition of the animals of these people, we have helped them by means of extension officers and economic assistance provided by the Department, to breed decent animals. A few years ago it was not worth their while to allow the small number of cattle they had to graze on the land. But the quality of these cattle has been improved in the meantime and they are proud of it now. As a matter of fact, they like to show you these things today. They have achieved an identity and pride of their own. Hon. members will do well to go and look at the white and black sheep they keep in that area; let us go and have a look at their system of fencing off their land in camps and the water that was laid on for them. Sir, we have tried to instil into these people a pride in their land; we have helped them to become attached to the land. In short, we have given them everything possible which is required for them to develop a national identity and national pride of their own. I can honestly say that the Coloured people have responded with pride to all these things; they have accepted these things in a wonderful way and they have made proper use of them, notwithstanding all the allegations we still have to listen to, allegations that they are supposed to be treated in a negative way and that they are being kicked out and pushed away. Of course, we did not want to make them &#x201C;part of the white population&#x201D;, and we do not apologize for that. Our policy is a positive one of segregation and sacrifice. The hon. member for Peninsula must admit this, as he has in fact done, although he regarded it as something terrible that we did not want to make them &#x201C;part of the white population&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In that case I merely want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Gardens and the hon. member for Malmesbury. We have a serious problem as far as education is concerned. I support the idea of taking the school to the pupil. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I have no intention of following up the type of comment made by my hon. friend, the member for Namaqualand, because I should like to deal with something quite different. By August arrangements will be made for the first sitting of the new Coloured Representative Council. In terms of a Press release issued by the Minister’s own Department in March, with the establishment of this council the functions of the Department of Coloured Affairs will be transferred to the executive of that council. From then on we shall have two departments. Firstly, an Administration of Coloured Affairs, a department which, I understand, will be linked with the Public Service Commission and whose task it will be to assist the executive committee of the C.R.C. Secondly, we shall have a Department of Coloured Relations, which is to act as a link with the Government and perform the remaining functions of the Department of Coloured Affairs. That is what I understood the position to be.</p>

<p>Let me say, first of all, that we welcome the creation of the Department of Coloured Administration as being a practical means of training the Coloured community in the mechanics and responsibilities of local government and local affairs. This is essential for the proper working of any democratic system anywhere in the world, and it is important that our Coloured people should actively participate in the administrative affairs of the country as a whole. I think it is important that in dealing with the matters which will come before them they will see their activities as part of the administration of the country as a whole and that they are making their contribution to it.</p>

<p>The main functions of the executive committee of the C.R.C., working in conjunction with the Administration of Coloured Affairs, will be finance, education, community welfare, rural areas and local government in Coloured areas, as and when certain functions in this regard are delegated to it by the different provincial administrations. I quote here from the official handout. Could the hon. the Minister tell us to what extent this whole administrative scheme has been thought out in any depth, because it seems to me that there will always be a degree of overlapping in many fields of local government and other matters for the Coloured people. For instance there is the position of local government for them and for other sections of the population. There will be overlapping in a great many fields. Let us take the question of finance and education. Where education is concerned this will presumably cover such matters as the day to day running of the schools, teachers’ appointments, salaries, pensions, leave, study provisions, examinations, both internal and external, the control of hostels, where these exist, and teacher training. They must be interested and at least have some views on that, although they are not to have any say with regard to the University of the Western Cape. There will be the question of the proper election of school committees. I am interested to see from the Department’s report that out of a total of 1,400 State-aided schools only 12 have school committees at the present moment. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can <span class="col_6411-6412" refersTo="page_0353"/>tell us why? They will obviously want to discuss agricultural and technical training. None of this can be handled by them or by anybody else in a kind of Coloured vacuum. After all, the Coloured people are part and parcel of our community. If anybody made that clear this afternoon, it was the hon. member for Moorreesburg. What I should like to know is what link there will be, if any, between the Coloured Council and its Executive Committee and the two departments of Administration and Coloured Relations on the one hand and, for instance, bursaries that are granted and their training necessities which will be met in part by the University College of the Western Cape. We have been told by the hon. the Minister in a previous debate, that they would have no say or representation where this university was concerned. What kind of a link will there be educationally with the Joint Matriculation Board since if they are to deal with education, they will presumably be concerned with educational standards as well? Of course, anything to do with education means that these matters will also have to be considered in terms of ultimate employment at whatever level they happen to consider it. I should like to have the hon. the Minister’s assurance as to where the control of finances will lie. Will this lie with the administrative section as matters are at the moment? No one is educated in a vacuum. That is quite clear. Once trained, most people have to get down to some kind of work. There is bound to be a direct relationship between school leavers and their qualifications on the one hand, with which the Council will presumably be concerned, and the South African labour market on the other hand. Will it be a function of the Coloured Council to discuss these highly relevant matters? I should like to know from the Minister how they can fail to be interested or involved, and whether he, in fact, will encourage them to discuss matters such as guaranteed wage rates, the scope of employment for their people, the nature of jobs open to them, the question of unemployment insurance and workmen’s compensation. One may say that these are all matters for this Parliament, but they are all matters of concern in the field of education and training as well. There is the relationship of supply and demand for professional people which is bound to concern them. I am not only thinking about teachers. There are doctors, nurses, engineers to be trained and so forth. All of these are linked with education in the secondary schools. What about apprentices and trades, such as the building trade and motor mechanics? There will be no one left in Parliament to speak directly for them and their interests in these matters. We are now forbidden by law to take any part in discussions of this kind at a local level. Can the hon. the Minister tell us, as regards all these practical everyday issues linking education with the availability and the disposition of labour and with the economic prospects of the Coloured community, how all these are to link up in terms of the activities of this Coloured Representative Council? Where are these matters to be discussed and decided and to whom must these people make representations on these particular questions when they have taken any decisions? In other words, where is the link to be between education, locally administered and controlled on the one hand, and the organized South African labour market with all its ramifications on the other hand? It is quite clear that the Coloured community cannot spend their whole lives in terms of their economic activities, taking in each other’s washing. As we know, the majority of them work for us. These matters, I maintain, cannot be dealt with in separate compartments. They have to be dealt with in terms of the country’s economic activities as a whole.</p>

<p>Now the second matter I should like to raise is the question of community welfare, over which the Council will have jurisdiction of a kind. Now I find it most ironical in terms of welfare that the last report of the Coloured Development Corporation shows that the largest sum of money, 31 per cent, was allocated to setting up liquor businesses, and another 26 per cent for setting up hotels. That means that 57 per cent of the capital that was lent to people for business undertakings by the Corporation last year went to liquor businesses and hotels, which means liquor in both cases, and one of the greatest social evils among the Coloured people is the high degree of alcoholism from which the community as a whole suffers. In fact, in the Press the other day it was reported that a big hospital for alcoholics was to be built at Athlone, which will cost R130,000. It will only deal with 30 cases initially. But this is to deal specifically with alcoholics in the Peninsula area, and it is to be right next door to the hotels. I really find this rather ironical, and perhaps the Minister can give us some explanation. This hospital is to be built by an organization called the S.A. National Council for Alcoholism. I should like to know how much active co-operation across the colour line will be permitted to this organization if the Coloured community is to take full advantage of the help offered to it? It seems to me to be important that we should know whether they are going to be in a position to work together.</p>

<p>The Coloured community has already begun to make suggestions as to the various matters with which this Council should deal. The liquor laws is one of those matters and I have a Press report here dealing with it. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#carr">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. CARR</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that the hon. member for Wynberg has taken a more positive approach to this problem to-day, but certain remarks came from the other side last night which we cannot allow to pass. I very much regret that the hon. member for Karoo is ill and I hope he will very soon return to perfect health. Unfortunately the hon. members for Peninsula and Karoo created the impression that with the coming into power of <span class="col_6413-6414" refersTo="page_0354"/>the National Party the Coloured man was the loser and that he was demoted in some way. They pose to the Coloured man and to the outside world as angels of light and the up-lifters of the Coloured people, but what is the real position? We live in a very complicated country and the impression is given from the other side in this debate that there are only two kinds of people in South Africa, Whites and Coloureds. But the fact is, as we know, that historical processes over 300 years resulted in the development of a white nation which is established here in South Africa, and there are also many Black nations amounting to 14 million people, and in between them there is developing a brown nation, the Coloureds, of 1½ million people. Whatever the Coloureds may do, they will always be a minority in South Africa. One thing is certain, as the hon. member for Namaqualand said: White South Africa will never accept integration, and I believe that there must always be separation between Whites and non-Whites in South Africa. Apart from anything else, integration in any form will never be accepted by white South Africa. Not only will Nationalist supporters or the Afrikaans-speaking people not accept it, but it will not be accepted in any way by supporters of the party opposite either. About 10 years ago I was associated with the constituency of Pinelands, which as hon. members know is a very strong United Party seat. At that time the Council at Pinelands wanted to build a few houses in the compound where they keep their equipment, for Coloured people, but there were flashes of blue flame and indignation and the plan had to be dropped. What was the position of the Coloured man in 1948? I remember very well what the position of the Coloured man was in 1948. At that time the United Party Government looked upon the Coloured man as the appendage of the white man. I would like to say that we on this side as Nationalists have not got the racial arrogance to look upon anybody as an appendage.</p>

<p>We know the force of nationalism; we want to be ourselves and we know that the Black nation and the Brown nation want to be themselves and that they want to control their own affairs, and within their own areas we are going to make that possible for them. I believe that the only way in which we can all live together here and enjoy our rights is by following the policy of separate development of the National Party. Sir, I want to refer briefly once more to the position of the Coloured man in 1948. At that time he was neglected by the white man; he was exploited economically by the white man, and on the other hand he was undermined economically by masses of Bantu who came into the Western Cape, which is the Coloured man’s traditional home. One has only to recall what happened in places like Kensington to know that that is absolutely true. The Coloured man was undermined in his work because the Black man who lived at a lower economic level could always undercut the Coloured, and the filthy slums of Kensington and District Six developed under the regime of the United Party. Sir, the Coloured man faces a Black majority in this country, and just as we want separation between White and non-White, so the Coloured man does not want to be absorbed by the Black man. The Coloured man knows very well that he will not get sympathetic treatment from the Black man if the United Party’s policy of gradual political integration were to be carried out in South Africa, a policy which must culminate in Black rule</p>

<p>If you are going to have Coloured M.P.s in this House and white representatives of the Black man in this House, that is political integration, and then ultimately the power must fall into the hands of the Black majority and the Coloured man will be crushed and so will the white man. Therefore I believe that the Coloured man has a vested interest in the implementation of the National Party policy of separate development.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to refer briefly to three other matters. Far from oppressing the Coloured man, we are the uplifters and the liberators of the Coloured man. What chance did a Coloured man have in 1948 to start his own business? What share did the Coloured man have in the wealth of the liquor trade or any other trade? He had no chance at all; he was exploited by the white man.</p>

<p>As I say, the Coloured man was undermined by the Black man. But three things were done by the National Party to uplift the Coloured man and to bring him to the state where he is to-day and to give him his chance. Sir, one thing shines through every page of this report of the Department of Coloured Affairs and that is that the hon. the Minister and his Department are absolutely sincere in their desire and their determination to give the Coloured man his chance. One of the great things that we did for the Coloured man, was to stop the movement of the Black man into the Western Cape which is the Coloured man’s traditional home, and to give the Coloured man the chance to find his own feet and to provide the labour for this area. Secondly, we established group areas. We as a white nation have not got one piece of land. From our inception as a nation in 1910, South Africa has been divided by Black states created by Britain, i.e. by Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, and under our own policy it will <span class="col_6415-6416" refersTo="page_0355"/>become more broken up. The Coloured man has not got one piece of land either, but he has his stake in South Africa. As the hon. member for Namaqualand has said, the Coloured man is an agriculturist, and I believe that a certain percentage of every nation must make their living on the land. The Coloured man has that chance in the areas set aside for him. In the group areas in the towns &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Namaqualand spoke about the 1½ million acres of land in Namaqualand. These areas are traditionally his. In the group areas in the cities he can own his property and his own business. He may even have a liquor or any other business and he is protected from white competition. This is the first chance in history the Coloured man has ever had and we are giving him this chance. Thirdly we are giving the Coloured a political chance. Every nation in the world wants to control their own affairs and to elect their own people. When the four Coloured representatives came to this House I believe there were 33.000 registered Coloured voters. Now there are 500,000 registered voters, because the Coloureds have taken a positive interest in this matter. For the first time not only the Coloured man in the Cape, but also the Coloured men and women in the whole of South Africa, are being given a chance. (Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am aware of the fact that this Government is taking a lot of trouble to improve the position of the Coloureds in the Western Cape, and we on this side of the House are grateful for that. However, the Nationalist Party is now singing a different tune to the one it sang in the days when we ruled the country and when they spoke of the fact that we were spending too much on Coloured education, etc. I thought that the Nationalist Party would be satisfied not to rake up the past, because we on this side of the House have a clean record in respect of the Coloureds. [Interjections.] When the hon. members for Namaqualand, Moorreesburg and others place statements on record here which are untrue, someone must put them right. I want to do so, and I want to begin with what the hon. member for Moorreesburg said. I now merely want to remind him of the days in 1949 when he was an election agent for Mr. Van Rensburg and when he had six Coloured committees to do election work against me for the Nationalist Party. He had two in Kensington which gave shoes to the Coloureds. Hon. members may ask the hon. member for Outeniqua. He was there and he knows what happened. At that time we took a photograph and I can give this photograph to the hon. member for Moorreesburg. [Interjections.] The hon. member did do that. Do not tell me that at that time the Nationalist Party was not seeking the Coloured vote, because they were trying to bribe the Coloureds with shoes and football jerseys. As far as the hon. member for Namaqualand is concerned, I merely want to tell him that we should rather leave the matter there. We must forget about those days. I can also refer to that. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it would do any good if I once again raked up the shoot-them-down politics of the Nationalist Party in respect of the Coloureds?</p>

<p>I shall speak about the Vote. I have never deviated from the Vote. The position is that we on this side of the House will not allow ourselves to be intimidated in ways such as those which were tried this afternoon. There are many more serious matters which we could discuss in connection with the Coloureds. For example, the Coloureds on farms in the Western Province are becoming progressively fewer to-day and nothing is being done about that. Here are statements that there is not a shortage of Coloured labour in the Western Province. At the same time the Secretary for Coloured Affairs stated the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are 1,550,000 Coloured people living in the Western Cape and this figure will grow to 3,580,000 by the end of the century.</block>

<p>He goes further and proposes that we build community centres for Coloureds in the country districts, in order to keep them there and in order to pay them higher wages. This is all very well, but the fact of the matter is that at present there is a chronic shortage of Coloureds in the Western Province.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I have never said so. On 16th October, 1968, Mr. De Villiers, the chairman of the Cape Agricultural Union, said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The farmers in the Boland are experiencing a chronic shortage of labour and on behalf of the farmers I want to make a very serious appeal to the Government to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the actual conditions on the farms. Our labour problem is much greater than is realized.</block>

<p>I get the impression that there are people who altogether underestimate this matter and who are not aware of the seriousness of the position in the Western Cape. I was glad when the hon. member for Moorreesburg said that these Bantu migrant labourers were interbreeding with the Coloureds to the extent that the Bantu strain was becoming predominant. This is so, and it is a dangerous state of affairs about which I speak every year, but nothing is done and no interest is displayed. As a result of these migrant labourers without their families, our farms are being depopulated, losing their Coloured labourers. The hon. member is correct in saying that this is still continuing. There is a great deal that we can do for our Coloured labourers. Last year I pleaded for special services for Coloureds so that social workers could teach Coloured women in the country districts in particular to do needlework, etc. The old farmworkers, who have spent their whole lives working on a farm, are also being thrown to the wolves in their old age. Is it not possible for the Department to help farmers so that they may jointly establish old-age homes for Coloureds who have given them faithful service for years and years, from early in the morning to late at night? Why must they specifically come to the cities in order to receive these facilities at old-age homes and why must they come to places in the city to die? Is it, then, not possible for us to think of ways and means of helping those people so that they may know that in the evening of their lives they will also obtain accommodation in the country districts?</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I want to touch upon another matter, i.e. education. I am grateful for the educational facilities which are available for Coloureds to-day, but the greatest breeding ground of Communism was and still is those schools where they learn subjects which they will never again use ever. The so-called &#x201C;three R’s&#x201D; are very good, but I consider it essential that skilled training be given to Coloureds in the country districts so that those people can prepare themselves for their callings later in life. I accompanied a Judge’s wife to a wedding and the mother of the Malay bridegroom told her to go and look at the bedroom suite which had been made by the bridegroom. The Judge’s wife admired the bedroom suite and said that she had thought that the bridegroom was a teacher. The Malay woman then said that they teach their children that everyone in life will fall, and that when they fall they must land feet first. In other words, you must be prepared to do something if that other profession goes wrong. Is it not then possible to give a kind of training at school where they could learn something which their homes would need, i.e. to look after their husbands’ clothes, and look after the children and to cook food. The majority of them will, in any case, never become teachers.</p>

<p>No, not only the Coloureds.

They must be taught this so that they can do something and be worth something. Hon. members can picture for themselves the position of a Coloured person who has obtained Std. 6 in the country districts and who thinks of himself as educated. When he goes to look for work he finds out that there is no position in which he is acceptable with the education that he has. I honestly do not think that this is a political matter, but a matter to which the hon. the Minister could give his serious attention because this is necessary. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>That hon. member’s conscience is troubling him to such an extent, in respect of the United Party’s past, that he specifically had to come along and make that kind of speech this afternoon. He is as aware as we are of the fact that the United Party has vanished from the political arena as a result of their integration policy of the past, which they still adhere to to-day and, in fact, advocated yesterday. I want to leave it at that now.</p>

<p>When we speak about Coloured affairs in this House we are speaking about an important matter in the composition of our South African nation, because the Coloureds are one of the population groups in South Africa. In other words, we are dealing with our relationships policy. In speaking about that we must do so in such a way that we do not damage those good relations which are so essential to peaceful coexistence. I am glad that throughout this debate the speakers appeared to have that sense of responsibility. I am also particularly glad of the fact that it appears as if the policy of the National Party in respect of the Coloureds is also being accepted to an ever greater extent. It is essential that this should be so, and we believe now that the Coloureds have also received proper political rights for the first time, as we heard from the mouths of the Coloured representatives yesterday, and that when the Coloureds first begin to exercise those rights, the support and approval of the Government’s policy will continue to increase. It is essential that this should happen. I want to express the hope that our Coloured community will, to a large extent, make use of the opportunity which they are now being offered, that they will also give their approval to the Government’s policy, by way of the political rights which they have now obtained, at the election which is to be held within the space of this year. They can do this by casting a high percentage of votes. I hope and trust that the Coloureds will do so, and thereby will indicate, not only to South Africa, but to the world, that they are accepting this opportunity with tremendous joy and responsibility, and that they will also exercise it in a responsible manner in the interests of South Africa, but especially in their own interests as well.</p>

<p>I now want to speak about the position in respect of Johannesburg. This links up with what I have already said. In Johannesburg, Coloureds are now being gathered in their own residential area. Coloureds are being taken out of the various areas of the Johannesburg complex and are being settled in their own area. It goes without saying that Coloureds who, in the past, did not know one another, or had nothing in common, are now being gathered together in their own area. We are glad of that. I am convinced that the Coloured population are also particularly glad that they now have their own areas where they can develop to full maturity. But there are, of necessity, problems involved when such a resettlement takes place. I am now grateful to be able to say that I am convinced that the Department of Coloured Affairs is doing everything in its power to eliminate levels of friction of bottlenecks which may be taking place, and to allow this resettlement process to take place on a very sound footing. This appears from our findings there. We see that the people are happy. The only conclusion to which one can come is that it is being done in such a way as to meet with the approval of the people concerned.</p>

<p>But, Sir, obviously that complex, which is now being built up there, is situated between the white and Bantu areas. On one side it is separated from the white area, with a very small area in between. On the other side is the Bantu residential area. Between those two groups the Coloureds must now find and establish themselves. They must be happy there in the future. I consider it essential that the planning should be done right from the start in <span class="col_6421-6422" refersTo="page_0358"/>such a way as to eliminate all possible levels of friction which could develop in the distant future. The planning must be of such a nature that, as far as possible, no levels of friction shall develop in the future. This is essential, because the entire survival of South Africa, and especially the white man in South Africa, depends on the measure of future success we achieve in connection with racial peace and the peaceful co-existence of races in South Africa. We all realize this. We know that the entire policy of the Government is aimed at bringing about that peaceful future co-existence of the races. I now hope and trust that success will be achieved in doing it in that way.</p>

<p>But this afternoon I want to point to one very important link in this process, i.e. the Rand College of Education. I believe that this training college should serve as a very important factor in this process of the establishment of the Coloureds and in the expanding of their area, so that, eventually, as a population group, they will reach full maturity there, feel an attachment for the soil and also be able to continue living happily. Let there be no mistake about the fact that eventually a very large Coloured population will be settled there. I now want to ask that, in the first place, we gratefully take note of the very good work which is being done at present at this Rand College of Education by the white rector, several white lecturers, as well as Coloured lecturers. We should very much like to express a word of gratitude and appreciation to them for their work, especially the Whites who are working there under very difficult circumstances. As far as that is concerned, we also want to ask for the position of those Whites always to be treated in a very sympathetic way. But now I want to ask that the position of this college be given thorough consideration and that we do our level best to allow this college to develop in such a way that it will, in fact, be the cultural centre, the life source and the vital artery of the Coloureds in that area when it has finished developing. I want to say that we are also grateful for the development which is taking place, for the erection of a new college building and for the new grounds which they have received. But it is extremely regrettable that I must say here to-day that we have knocked in vain on the Department’s door in order to have those grounds enlarged. Our request fell on deaf ears. This is regrettable. It is a tragedy. The excuse that there are no opportunities for extension, that further land cannot be purchased because it is too expensive, is, as far as I am concerned, a very weak and a very unacceptable excuse [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Sometimes not even loud words are of any use, not if they fall on deaf ears.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with the speech which the hon. member for Peninsula made in this House yesterday evening. The hon. member and I discussed his speech before the time. I want to associate myself with it and to give him the fullest support in everything he said. The hon. member made a constructive and objective speech here yesterday evening, a speech based on the experience which we have gained as Coloured representatives. If there are hon. members who were nettled at criticism which he expressed, I merely want to refer them to a private discussion which I had with the late Dr. Verwoerd in March, 1966. On that occasion he said to me, <i>inter alia</i>: &#x201C;I am not interested in the political standpoints of the Progressive Party, the United Party or the National Party. I know them. As far as Coloured representatives are concerned, they must be independent, because I want to know what the Coloureds feel and think and what their needs are. If there is any criticism I want to hear it; but I must feel that it comes from the Coloureds and not from a certain political party.&#x201D; Now the criticism of the hon. member for Peninsula must be accepted as such.</p>

<p>In connection with the hon. member for Peninsula’s speech I want to indicate the stage which we have reached this year with the election of the Coloured Persons Representative Council. I want to repeat the hon. member for Peninsula’s appeal to the Coloureds, because what happened was that when the Coloured Council was originally constituted, and thereafter, a great deal of criticism was forthcoming from the Coloureds about the people serving on the Coloured Council. It was found that there were many more competent and more experienced people outside the council, but my reply was: But why, then, did they not take part and ensure that those people got onto that council? But at the same time I merely want to warn the hon. the Minister in a spirit of goodwill by saying that with the nomination, the organization and the establishment of the original Coloured Council, there was also a great deal at fault with the Department of Coloured Affairs. People were used who ought never to have been in the Public Service, apart from the fact that they were used in order to look for people co serve on the Coloured Council. I do not want to go into details. The person whom I specifically have in mind is no longer in the service of the Department, but it is only after she had done a great deal of damage that she was discharged. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to be very careful, when it comes to the nomination of the 20 members of the Coloured Council, about how he decides on who must be nominated. I hope that the hon. <span class="col_6423-6424" refersTo="page_0359"/>the Minister accepts this in the spirit in which it is meant.</p>

<p>There may be a great deal of criticism, and a great deal of destructive criticism was levelled here yesterday evening at the dispensation for our Coloureds to-day. My time is too limited to go into particulars, but I want to say here that what I appreciate of the Prime Minister was the statement which he made in this House during this Session about our children having to decide. He was criticized and it was said that he did not have a Coloured policy, but I maintain that it is impossible to define a Coloured policy to-day which would have to bind our children, because we do not know what the conditions will then be. This honest and frank statement of the Prime Minister also links up with what the late Dr. Verwoerd said at one stage, i.e. that we could not continue in South Africa to drag the Coloureds along behind the Whites as an appendage; they must develop into a fully-fledged population group in South Africa. If that development were to take place and we were to begin with the most elementary requirement, it means that single roof over a family’s heads instead of four or five families in one room in District Six. I am speaking of a private roof over a family’s heads, where there are at least doors which can be closed. And if the educational development were to take place, as it is doing at present, and were to be extended, and the socio-economic development be added to that, we would, in the future, in our children’s era, as the Prime Minister said, have a position in which the attunement to and the determination of relations between the Coloured group and the white group would be totally different. Therefore I take my hat off to the Prime Minister for his frankness in having said this, and I accept it. This is as I have always seen it.</p>

<p>I want to repeat what the hon. member for Peninsula said here in appealing for care when thoughts were entertained in the future about legislation which discriminated against the Coloureds. I think that we already have too much discriminating legislation on the Statute Book. I am not delving into the past and I do not want to rake up old stories, but there is a great deal which could be done away with or that we could soft-pedal a little. But I can give the assurance to the hon. the Minister and the Government that these small discriminations cause a tremendous degree of frustration among the Coloureds. I have now been here for 11 years and I know what I am talking about, and there is so much that is unnecessary and in respect of which coercion need not be used, but in respect of which coercion is used as a result of measures which are already on the Statute Book, but which as far as I am concerned, ought never to have been there at all. They are now there, but let us be careful, because it is these small things which cause the greatest frustration and are the most volatile fuel for frustration and embitterment. Let us be careful with them. Let us develop the Coloured population group to a fully-fledged population group, citizens of South Africa who can go to meet the future without those irritations and causes of friction.</p>

<p>I briefly want to thank the hon. the Minister for the invitation which he extended to us to visit the cadet camp at Faure. The hon. member for Peninsula has already spoken about that. I personally have been there and I am proud, for the reasons which I gave on that occasion, of the fact that I supported that legislation at the time. At the time of the discussion of that legislation, my thoughts went back to the years when I was a young boy and saw a train full of recruits of the White Pioneer Corps arriving at the Bloemfontein station, half of them barefoot. I can remember what fruits we reaped in the war years from the training of those lads in the Pioneer Corps. What I saw at Faure, at that training centre, is very encouraging. All that I can say is that Colonel Kingwill agreed with me when I wished that, at the time when we were soldiers, we could have had such a camp, such mattresses to sleep on and could have enjoyed such housing and food. It was begun <i>de novo</i> and it was beautifully planned, but now I should like to ask the Minister this. Since there is now a para-military organization in existence for Coloured boys, can the hon. the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Defence and the Government, not go into the matter of whether the time has not come for us to have a general call-up system for the Coloureds as well, as is the case for white boys? I can understand that this is now a beginning. Registration must now take place between the ages of 18 to 24 years, and thereafter they must be registered each year at the age of 18, but can we not make this permanent so that the Coloured boy would also be called up to undergo military training? Now that my children must undergo military training, I myself have found, in my own home, what a tremendous difference this can make to a young boy. It gives him a feeling of pride and of responsibility. I think that we would inspire a greater sense of responsibility in the growing Coloured generation if we could place this training on the same basis as that for Whites, so that a Coloured boy has to register at a certain age and must undergo his military training.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. member for Outeniqua raised the question of the political future dispensation for the Coloureds, especially in view of the fact that recently the reproach has often been levelled that this side of the House does not want to indicate to the Coloureds what the end of the road will be. To a certain extent I also agree with the hon. member for Outeniqua. Unfortunately I could not be present in the House when the hon. member for Peninsula was speaking yesterday. I have been told that he said a number of first-rate things and gave good advice to the Coloureds in regard to what was in prospect for them in the immediate <span class="col_6425-6426" refersTo="page_0360"/>future, but there is one thing I did not hear, i.e. that he asked them to develop towards having a national aspiration and an identity of their own.</p>

<p>Fine, in that case the hon. member can have another turn to speak, but I do not suppose the hon. member intends to speak further, because if the hon. member felt strongly about the matter, there have been many subsequent opportunities for doing so. In any case, as far as the Coloureds are concerned, the position at present is such that we may be grateful for many things. For a population group which is so heterogeneous and which genealogically has developed out of unrelated groups and which has a long history of inferiority or rather, to put it this way, of being in an inferior position in many spheres of their life, it is difficult to develop a national aspiration, a national identity and a national pride of their own. And we must help these people to develop these things, because our whole policy is aimed at giving them these things. Now, it is not only necessary for them to develop a national pride in the eyes of the white nation, but also in their own eyes; and I think that at this stage this is perhaps still the most real problem for the Coloured population. I think this is an instruction, a challenge, which hon. members could have set the new Coloured Persons Representative Council, i.e. that in this respect they have a task to fulfil with the knowledge that further political rights will be based on the degree of maturity of the nation and the responsibility of the members of that nation. That is why I am at this moment extending my congratulations to the Coloureds on the new era which is in the offing for them. I congratulate them on the large number of people who have been registered and who are going to vote in the coming elections. That proves that these people are interested and that the seeds of this aspiration are present. I congratulate the Coloureds on the calm and honourable manner in which they have conducted the election contest up to now. It is unnecessary to say any more in this regard, but with reference to the reproach that we do not see the end of the road and with reference to the attempt to force us to say where we are taking the Coloureds, I nevertheless want to read experts from a debate on the Bantu and the Coloureds in which the late Dr. Verwoerd and the Leader of the Opposition, Sir de Villiers Graaff, took part. In 1961 the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said the following (Hansard, column 4388)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I told him (Dr. Verwoerd) we stand for the maintenance of Western civilization in South Africa, and I told him that for that to be maintained I believe that for the foreseeable future&#x2014;I do not pretend to be able to see as far as he can&#x2014;that means the maintenance of white leadership in South Africa.</block>

<p>In other words, in respect of a race group, i.e. the Bantu, where at that time the National Party had already outlined the road as seen right up to the end, he was still not at all in a position to work out a practicable policy and spoke of the &#x201C;foreseeable future&#x201D;, not even of generations to come. Consequently Dr. Verwoerd was quite justified in giving this reply in the same debate (column 4547)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to add that when I stated in connection with the Coloureds that I had only outlined the development up to a certain stage&#x2014;it does not indicate the absolute limit of development because I believe that at that stage one will be in a better position to judge how to go further forward along the same road&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition reproached me for not having given a final blueprint. In other words, I am expected to describe every detail of our constitutional planning up to the very end, but when he himself referred to his policy he stated that that was how he saw the position for the immediate foreseeable future, and that one must leave future developments to be determined in the future.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is political audacity, if I may say so&#x2014;after all these things have been said, after it has been the policy over the years to advance in the light of what one sees, as far as one is able to see it, towards solving the problems&#x2014;to expect this party and this Prime Minister all of a sudden, after seven years, to furnish them with a plan up to the very end. What I should like to tell them, is that the foundations have definitely been laid. We do not have a final solution as yet, but we have laid the foundations of the road ahead, and that is important. It took this Government eight years, from 1948 to 1956, to create the framework up to the point where we can proceed with the political rights of these people. The road ahead has therefore been paved. Now we are expected to indicate the end of the road. I have already said what my summary is in respect of such an attitude. Sir, some time ago a certain person wrote as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If one were to review the views held by most of the persons who have written and spoken on this matter, there is, however, a clear thread which runs through to the very end of the road. This thread shows that the future pattern has already been formulated clearly by the present generation and is gradually being implemented, and that future generations will have to take care of developing it further and adding the finishing touches.</block>

<p>Sir, a nation is after all not born in the space of one or two generations; that has often <span class="col_6427-6428" refersTo="page_0361"/>been said here, and that is why I think that the hon. the Prime Minister was fully justified in saying what he said here this year, and I once again endorse this to-day&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If one wants peace, then the development must not be towards each other, but must be away from each other. We have placed the Coloureds on that political road. It would be presumption on my part, Sir, if I wanted to say to you that I saw the end of the road. Just as my predecessor did not see it, I do not see it either. But what I can in fact do, is to lay the foundations as I think that road will unfold, and I shall lay those foundations with the Coloureds as and when their representatives are chosen, as and when we find the answer to this question of the liaison which there should be between this Parliament and them.</block>

<p>Sir, I think this summarizes the matter. I think as far as this matter is concerned, an adequate reply has been given in as far as it can reasonably be expected from this party and its leadership at this stage, and the object of my speech to-day was to ask the future Coloured Persons Representative Council to follow that lead, to avail themselves of their opportunities and to aspire after a national identity of their own.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I agree, but I think it is equally impertinent for the hon. member to assume that the National Party had found a final solution to any of our non-White problems, which is what he has done. Sir, we have no final solution. We are watching the volution of this country as far as every racial group is concerned, and all one can do is to try to see the direction that one wishes such a policy to follow, but I do not think that anybody in this House should dare to have the impertinence to guarantee its ultimate success, and that applies to any group. I might say that even the hon. member for Moorreesburg, who asked for a sort of Coloured Tomlinson Commission report, cannot expect that that would solve our problem, particularly as the Tomlinson Commission’s report has not in any way solved the African problem in this country, although it appeared in 1956. But I do agree with him that some effort should be made at least to anticipate the problem and to know the magnitude of the problems that we tackle when we go in, for instance, for the wholesale removal of people.</p>

<p>As I see it, the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs is going to find himself without a portfolio one of these days; he is going to be in the same position as the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs, because one finds that education is now going over to the Coloured Representative Council; that social welfare for the Coloured people is going over to the Coloured Representative Council. Then there are three other matters which vitally affect the Coloured people: Group areas belong in part to Planning and in part to Community Development; housing belongs to Community Development; separate amenities to Community Development; beach apartheid has now been handed over to the Cape Provincial Council. The hon. the Minister is going to be left with one university plus the training centres of which there is one only at the present stage, plus whatever vocational training centres he is going to set up. I sincerely hope that be gets a move on with that, in view of the fact that during 1968 there were only 985 contracts of Coloured apprentices registered. Other than that, of course, he has the portfolio of placement of Coloured labour, and here he comes into conflict with his other portfolio, which is the portfolio of Labour. Where he has to decide which interests come first with him, the interests of the Coloured people, whom he is supposed to look after in his capacity as Minister of Coloured Affairs, or the interests of white labour, he of course opts for the interests of white labour. We had a very glaring example of that quite recently in the case of the machine operators in a bank. Coloured matriculated girls applied for those jobs and the hon. the Minister, acting administratively, as he said, in the field of job reservation&#x2014;I would say that he was acting in an intimidating fashion because what was he doing except to threaten the bank that he would use his power to introduce job reservation if they made it necessary &#x2014;opted against the Coloured girls who had got the jobs and in favour of white girls who, he said in a long answer to me, were available but who, I might say, the bank found unsuitable. Where his interests clash therefore the hon. the Minister opts for the white labour interests as against the Coloured labour interests. So we are going to have this interesting situation where, virtually, he is going to be a Minister without portfolio, just like, and I am sorry to make such an odious comparison, the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs. However, I agree with the hon. member for Moorreesburg in one respect. That is that we should have some form of planning. Here the hon. the Minister can at least serve a useful function by repairing some of the depredations of other hon. Ministers who have such a vital interest in the future of the Coloured people, i.e. the Minister of Community Development and the Minister of Planning. In the hands of these two Ministers lies the future of the Coloured people as far as their place of residence is concerned and where they may occupy premises for business purposes. To the best of my knowledge no proper forward planning has ever been done before the Department of Planning decides to declare an area a white <span class="col_6429-6430" refersTo="page_0362"/>group area and the Group Areas Act is implemented by the Department of Community Development. When I say &#x201C;no forward planning&#x201D;, I mean planning as regards the people who have to be moved. Of course, planning is done to see whether it fits in with white interests and whether it fits in with the Government’s policy of segregation. However, no actual planning is done as far as the individuals arc concerned. Afterwards the hon. the Minister’s Department moves in and somebody comes out with a survey of the number of families that are going to be affected by the move.</p>

<p>I believe this is putting things quite the wrong way round because before a single move is planned, the hon. the Minister should make it his business to find out everything about the community involved so that he may know exactly what is going to be involved, not only the number of people but also what it is going to mean to their family and social life. We talk about community development and yet it does nothing else but break up existing communities. Thus, District Six has been a Coloured community from its inception, from 1830, and if District Six is not a traditional Coloured area, I do not know what a traditional Coloured area is. Now it is proposed to move 6,250 families out of District Six and scatter them all over Bonteheuwel and the Indians out at Rylands. I do not think these things are ever taken into consideration. What information does the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs furnish his colleagues with about the economic effect of a proposed removal? There is, for instance, the additional cost of transport, because those who had lived within walking or cycling distance of their places of employment are now going to be moved as far out as Bonteheuwel and those in Simonstown 10 miles away to Slangkop. This will mean additional transport costs for them. What efforts are made to contact their employers to find out whether they are prepared to subsidize these people at least to the extent of the additional transport costs? Because these additional costs are going to weigh very heavily on unskilled labourers particularly, such as the dockworkers in Simonstown, and semi-skilled workers working in the factories. What efforts are made to determine what income a family is going to lose as a result of the fact that women and children can not do any casual part-time work to augment the family income? All these aspects are aspects of enormous importance. If I am wrong, I hope the hon. the Minister will tell me, but I do not believe that any proper survey of this nature is ever carried out before the Department of Planning decides that a given area is going to be a white area and the Department of Community Development steps in to implement the decision. From this point of view I would agree with the hon. member for Moorreesburg that we need a proper survey, but not a survey in anticipation of an all-time solution of the Coloureds’ problem.</p>

<p>I should now like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is prepared to correct the incorrect impression created by the Press report about the raid threat to the Coloureds, as it was headlined in a newspaper, to get recruits for the Coloured training camp. In reply to a question of mine the other day he told me that no such intention was in his mind. What he expected, however, was that police would ask the Coloured youths to produce their registration certificates on demand. In yesterday’s first edition of the evening paper, I think, that impression was put right because in terms of the Act, Coloured people are given seven days in which to produce those certificates. That is in terms of the only amendment of mine which during the period of 15 years that I have been in this House, has been accepted by a Minister, a fact for which I am deeply grateful nevertheless. However, I hope the hon. the Minister will correct this impression, because there is a considerable anxiety amongst the Coloured people that they are now going to be subjected to the sort of pass raids to which Africans are subjected.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I want my speech to follow up the speech made by the hon. member for Sea Point. While I sat listening to him, he reminded me of the man whose mind was so closed to any intelligent ideas that he was only open between one and two. The hon. member’s arguments revolved around education. It was education that he wanted to discuss and in regard to which he wanted to express criticism. He said that years ago, when the United Party still ruled the country, they also tried to do something for the Coloured people in the field of education. Of course, no one would want to suggest that they did not try to do anything. The basic difference, however, lies in the fact that what they wanted to do would have led to the disintegration of not only the White, but also the Coloured community, with everything attendant upon that, while what the National Party is doing is based on the principle that there is a difference between the two groups &#x2014;the Whites on the one hand and the non-Whites on the other. That is why what the National Party is doing for the training and education of the Coloured people can only lead to the consolidation of both groups.</p>

<p>If one looks at the activities of the Minister and of his department during the past year, one sees the same constant growth of the past two decades. When any student of population problems, both in the outside world and here in South Africa, wants to test the success or failure of a policy, there are three tests that can be applied in the case of the National Party. In the first place the National Party’s activities can be tested against what has been done elsewhere in the world where there are also White and non-White population groups living together. The regulation of the contact situation can be compared, on the one hand as carried out by the National Party here and on <span class="col_6431-6432" refersTo="page_0363"/>the other hand as carried out by the authorities in the other society. If we look at other parts of the world where there is a more or less similar racial situation, we notice that there are mainly two ways of approaching the matter. In the first place there is the approach on the part of the Whites to spend money on the training of the non-white group, especially in the educational and economic spheres. However, they do so entirely for their own selfish considerations, i.e. only to serve the white community. For this reason this approach cannot succeed. On the other hand one finds in those communities the so-called sentimentalists, i.e. those people who want to spend money on the non-Whites only to satisfy their own egoistical ideology. In this lies the problem that we find in other parts of the world. If one tests the National Party against this, one finds that those two approaches do not form part of our approach.</p>

<p>But on the other hand our policy can also be compared with that of the United Party. As I said a moment ago, the United Party also spent a little money in its time. At that time there were also education and training for the Coloureds. However, I just want to mention a few figures briefly in order to indicate the difference between the quality and the quantity of what they did, and what we are doing. In 1945 there were only 173,000 Coloured children at school. In 1952, that is to say, four years after the National Party came into power, there were already 203,000 Coloured children at school. We must bear in mind that at that time the National Party already had to start changing the basic principles according to which the United Party had set to work. In 1964 we had nearly 350,000 Coloured children in primary schools. In the secondary classes there were more than 37,000, while there were 164 Coloured children in the tertiary sphere. In 1968 there were more than 400.000 Coloured children in the primary schools. In the secondary classes there were more than 44,000 children, and in the tertiary sphere there were 805. This same growth in numbers, which is not only a growth in quantity, but also a growth in quality, one also finds in respect of the schools, in respect of the teachers, and in respect of the syllabuses. In other words, if one were to carry out a test in South Africa to-day and test the National Party’s standpoint in relation to the outside world, one would find a stability such as exists nowhere else in the world, when one tests the United Party, one finds the same. But the best way of testing whether our policy is succeeding, is to test it against its own principles; those principles out of which the National Party grows and as translated into policy by the hon. the Minister of Defence when he was Minister of Coloured Affairs, and now again by our present hon. Minister. Then one will find that the National Party’s approach to education and training is not directed at the Coloured people merely for the egocentric benefit of the Whites. That is why it is not concentrated merely on certain facets of the life of the Coloured community, but covers all the facets of their society. It was not only directed at formal education, but also at informal education. It covers the entire Coloured community; all its members, all generations and all age groups. We are trying our best to permit the talent of each individual in the Coloured community to develop and grow.</p>

<p>I just want to mention a few examples. Just look at what the Government is doing to acquaint the urban Coloured population with the rural community, and in this way acquainting the urban Coloured not only with the rural atmosphere, but also with those Coloureds who belong to the rural community. In other words, contact is being brought about between the two groups. The reverse is also being done, however, so that the rural Coloured person will also be able to adapt himself to urban surroundings and will not degenerate if for some reason or other he has to go and settle there. There are other facets as well. We think for example of training for leadership. If there is something the Coloured people probably want very badly and of which they have a great need, it is leaders in their community. I call to mind, for example, the leadership course that was offered by the Hewatt Training College from 30th September to 4th October, at which one of them said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not only the enormous benefit offered to us by this course which has made it such an exciting occasion for us. It is the contact we made with the top educational personalities which has left an indelible impression. It was as if a veil was taken away from our eyes. We came fully under the impression of sincere dedication, and for that we are grateful.</block>

<p>In other words, in contrast to what the hon. member for Sea Point said when he took a very superficial look at this education, the National Party is covering all facets of the community of the Coloured people. I also want to quote a few other examples by reading from Alpha’s index to show what spheres of the Coloured community are covered by the department. In July, 1967, an article appeared about a shoe industry at Saron. The article will naturally point out the Coloureds’ association with the specific aspect mentioned. Social work among the Coloured population has also been written about. An article entitled &#x201C;An Attorney&#x201D; was also published in order to acquaint the Coloureds with the various legal aspects. Further articles were, for example, &#x201C;A School for Epileptics&#x201D;; &#x201C;Training of Marriage Counsellors&#x201D;&#x2014;one of the most important matters in a Western community, i.e. the stabilization of marriage and family life; &#x201C;Housewives arrange a Fashion Parade&#x201D;; &#x201C;Blood Donation&#x201D;; &#x201C;Horticulture Society blooms&#x201D;. In a subsequent edition of <i>Alpha</i> articles appeared on &#x201C;Nutrition Advisory Services&#x201D;, &#x201C;The Crechè at Eersterus&#x201D;, &#x201C;How your Child is Protected&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Unhealthy Eating and Drinking Habits among Children&#x201D;.

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are a few unconnected matters I should like to bring to the hon. the Minister’s notice. In the first place, the hon. the Minister recently visited the Coloured communities of South-West, which now also fall under him. According to reports it seemed as though his path was not strewn with roses everywhere. According to reports the Basters of Rehoboth displayed fairly strong signs of dissatisfaction. There was even talk of their wanting to bring a charge against the Government with world bodies. Other reports, again, stated that the 12,000 Basters wanted immediate independence for Rehoboth. They wanted their own Prime Minister and Cabinet. In any event they wanted to take charge of Justice and Home Affairs immediately. They also wanted the same syllabuses for their schools as the schools for Whites have. I do not want us to rely on newspaper reports. I hope the hon. the Minister will comply with my request to give us an account of what precisely is happening there and what the Government envisages in respect of particularly the constitutional development of Rehoboth. According to what we know of Rehoboth, it consists of a number of farms, a few schools, some shops and a couple of bars. If it is the policy of the Government to make this area an independent republic, we should very much like to know precisely what procedure will be followed.</p>

<p>I believe that post has already been filled. But seriously, I should like to hear what the hon. the Minister envisages. Is this going to be included in his official designation? Will he also be Minister of Rehoboth Affairs? If that is so, what is the intention with the Nama? Will he also become Minister of Nama Affairs? In general I should also like to know what attention is being given to the constitutional development of the Coloured communities, of which there are three different ones in South-West? In South-West African newspapers reports appeared to the effect that it is the intention that all three of these communities will receive representation on the Coloured Council of the Republic. We should like to know what the plans in that connection are; what the nature of the representation will be; how it will be granted; and whether the Minister thinks that the Coloured Council of the Republic will be satisfied with it when it does happen.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with the position in regard to South-West Africa, I just want to draw the hon. the Minister’s attention to three items in the South-West African Estimates. The one item falls under primary, secondary and high schools, and at the bottom the following observation is made by way of a footnote; &#x201C;the minimum and maximum salaries of teaching staff are R36 and R3,720 per annum, respectively.&#x201D; I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what teaching staff are only getting R36 per annum. This item definitely looks strange to me. Then under subhead E there is the item &#x201C;Population register photography in respect of pupils&#x201D;. I will be grateful to know whether the population resister is being introduced in South-West Africa, and what the significance of this item is. Under the same subhead there is the item &#x201C;Allowances, presents and rations to headmen, etc.&#x201D;. Now, we are dealing with Coloureds, and I should like to know what headmen are concerned in this.</p>

<p>Then I want to draw the hon. the Minister’s attention to a little matter that has been brought to my notice by Coloured parties, and this concerns the training of Coloured boys and girls as medical doctors, advocates and attorneys. The hon. the Minister will know that most of the Coloured people are Afrikaans-speaking, and for that reason most of them receive their school education in Afrikaans. Those who then want to continue their studies, especially those who want to become medical doctors, advocates and attorneys, and also those who want to enter many other professions for which no provision is made at the University of the Western Cape, must then take these courses at the English-language universities, where the medium is English, while there are in fact Afrikaans facilities at other universities. This nuts those students at a very great disadvantage, and it seems to me as if the Afrikaans universities have a great responsibility here. It will take many more years before there are sufficient facilities in this field at the University of the Western Cape, and there can be no doubt about this. I think it would be a serious indictment of the Afrikaans universities if Afrikaans-speaking Coloured persons cannot continue their advanced studies through the medium of Afrikaans, but are forced to do so through the medium of English because the Afrikaans universities refuse to help them. In my opinion there is a very important principle at stake here, and this is where the Government ought <span class="col_6435-6436" refersTo="page_0365"/>to intervene. Surely the principle is that an Afrikaans-speaking child is entitled to receive higher education in his own language. It would be the height of irony if Afrikaans universities should reject this principle, and by doing so forced Afrikaans-speaking persons to receive their training through the medium of English. There are facilities available for the training of attorneys and medical doctors and other professional men in Afrikaans. These institutions are being heavily subsidized by the Government, and I should like to know how the Government intends to meet them halfway and to see to it that justice is done to Afrikaans-speaking Coloured students.</p>

<p>Another little matter which also deserves earnest attention is the question of the increasing occurrence of child labour among the Coloureds. I do not know whether I should rather have raised this under the Labour Vote, but as Coloured Affairs also falls under this hon. Minister, I want to raise it here. The fact of the matter is that clergymen and other social workers are seriously concerned about the fact that many young Coloured children are being employed by bazaars and shops, and that they are being used as newspaper sellers until late at night. This practice has a very detrimental effect on the desire of the young Coloured to receive further education. Everyone who is concerned with the problem tells me that the attraction of the money they earn undenmines their willingness to receive education. It is generally complained that this has a disrupting effect on education. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether Coloured Children are enjoying the necessary protection in this respect, and whether they are enjoying the protection we deem fit to give white children, i.e. that they are not allowed to work before they have reached a certain age.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who sat down a moment ago addressed the hon. the Minister in the first place and asked various questions to which I take it the hon. the Minister will reply in due course. I should therefore like to submit for your consideration a few thoughts following on those of previous speakers. I am referring specifically now to the hon. member for Houghton and the hon. member for Outeniqua. Reference was made to the fact that in our formulation of a policy in regard to the Coloured population we cannot yet see the end of the road. Reference was also made to the hon. the Prime Minister’s having pointed out this year that this is a matter about which future generations will also have to think and will have to decide. I just want to point out to hon. members that the hon. the Prime Minister was not suggesting by this, as the hon. member for Houghton and the hon. member for Outeniqua mentioned in passing, that we have not formulated a policy, but that the Prime Minister was referring specifically to the question of whether the Coloured population should have their own separate homeland or not. In regard to that specific matter the hon. the Prime Minister pointed out that the intention to create a separate, continuous homeland for the Coloured population was still an open question which would form the subject of a great deal of thought and discussion and on which future generations would make decisions. Future generations will have to solve this problem in the light of the development over the years and in the light of the particular circumstances prevailing at the time.</p>

<p>I also want to submit, however, that in our time we can with our policy of separate development in regard to the Coloured population and their needs and aspirations, make a great deal of progress in cultivating and stimulating a sense of having ties with and a love for the soil among the Coloureds. We can cultivate a love for the soil of South Africa among them, because this is also their South Africa. We can also cultivate real patriotism among them and in this way we can make a very great deal of progress without necessarily having finally to decide about the question of a separate, continuous homeland area for the Coloured people. In view of the history of the Coloured population, in view of the history of our country and in view of the potential of the Coloured population. I think that there is very little chance of our being able to achieve such an ideal. However, we must go out of our way and we must plan purposefully, so that we can as far as possible have full-fledged Coloured communities developing in particular areas. In those particular areas they should have proprietary rights, as is in fact the case. The development of complete services for specific communities should also be made possible.</p>

<p>I do not think we can easily separate the Coloured population from the white community along with which they have developed, to whose economy they are attached to a large extent, and on which they are largely dependent. If we look at the development in certain areas, we shall notice that there used to be quite a number of home industries in mission reserves which were under the charge of white missionaries or white managers. Recently quite a number of changes have been effected, and Coloured people have taken over those responsibilities. In many cases the tendency is that where there is no proper white supervision, control, management and planning, nothing comes of those industries. On the contrary. they gradually break down because they cannot compete. That is why I want to ask that we should bear in mind that our Coloured population will at this stage, and probably for many years to come, need a great deal of assistance and guidance from the Whites, and that they depend to a large extent on the leadership and the initiative of the Whites. When looking to the future we must bear this in mind. I therefore feel that we must create such a structure that the Coloured community, wherever it may be situated and wherever we <span class="col_6437-6438" refersTo="page_0366"/>see it developing, should be able as much as possible to find contact with and to offer its services to the white community, or to those white industries that are within its reach.</p>

<p>I think it is largely the position that the Coloured community in the Peninsula is already a reasonably prosperous and rapidly developing community to-day. This is largely attributable to the fact that the Coloured people can find contact with a mainly white economic structure, and that they can sell their labour there and so enjoy the fruits of the prosperity of the country. I think that with a view to the future and the development of the Coloured people we must definitely bear this in mind. We shall be doing the Coloured population a disservice if we just want to put them together somewhere and tell them to develop and find their own way. In that case we will be leaving them in the lurch. They are simply not capable of doing that, and do not have the managerial ability, at least not at this stage of their development. They still need the assistance and guidance of white leadership and initiative too much. I want to stress, however, that we have to give consideration to, where this is at all possible, reserving large, continuous areas, or areas as large as possible, for the Coloured population and to allow them to develop, if I may put it this way, into full-fledged districts. Perhaps we should get away a little from the idea of thinking in terms of residential areas only, and think of areas which can develop to full-fledged districts. This is extremely necessary in the Peninsula. These should be areas in which the Coloured people, Coloured leaders and Coloured businessmen will in due course also be able to render the additional services to that community, so that they will be afforded more opportunities of realizing themselves to the full and of not only working, but also assuming managerial responsibilities. In this way they can themselves exercise leadership and lead their community and population group on their road of development. There are too few white leaders to bear the burden and the responsibility of leadership, managerial responsibility and business initiative alone.</p>

<p>We have this in Namaqualand and in the larger Coloured areas and reserves, where we find a good deal of this. In those areas there are good possibilities for development, but I think we could come closer and also bear this in mind in areas that are situated closer to us. In the Swartland, near Malmesbury, there is such an area in the neighbourhood of Mamre, Kalabaskraal, Dassenberg and Riverlands. This could be investigated, and it could be established in good time whether such a broad, full-fledged community development could not take place there, not only as a residential area, but as a full-fledged district which will eventually have not only its own post office, but also its own magistrate’s offices, police offices, etc., which will be staffed by Coloureds.. I also have in mind an area near Piketberg, where the Wittewater and Goedverwacht missionary stations are situated, where there are already a few thousand Coloureds living. Should we not perhaps consider consolidating two such areas and developing them as a larger complex where a larger community can live and where a more extensive development of the talents and initiative of the Coloured population can take place? There are other areas I could mention, but I want to leave it at this.</p>

<p>I just want to ask that our approach to the Coloured community should be as open as possible, and if we approach the matter in this way, I think we need have no fear of becoming entangled in our own planning in the near future. We will then find that the overall management, i.e. the Coloured Persons’ Representative Council, which will in due course get into its stride and render service, will also be able to perform its functions more easily, and to act more easily without clashing with white governing bodies at our white towns and cities, because they will be more concerned with Coloured communities in their own areas, where they have their own governing bodies. If we look at the development of the Coloured population during the past two decades, we see that it has definitely been encouraging. I want to say here to-day that the Department of Coloured Affairs and the hon. the Minister, to whom the hon. member for Houghton referred here as a Minister who might lose his portfolio, have done very encouraging work. While they probably come up against discouraging things too from time to time, I want to express the confidence that the hon. the Minister and his Department will continue with optimistic planning, having regard to the true facts. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I trust the hon. member for Piketberg will forgive me if I do not follow the trend of his discussion. I want to raise two matters with the hon. the Minister. The first one concerns the provision of recreational facilities for the Coloured people. It is not my intention to dwell upon the controversy that has existed in the past, in regard to the provision of suitable venues for Coloured people when they sought to put on performances and to hold social functions. Having been involved quite closely with some of their problems I can appreciate their difficulties and their frustrations. I hope that in the future when these cases arise, sympathetic consideration will be given to the difficulties which the Coloured people have in regard to finding suitable venues when they wish to hold various functions and to indulge in recreational facilities.</p>

<p>I want to raise with the hon. the Minister the question of the difficulties which exist now and future difficulties in regard to the planning of these facilities. I realize that much depends on the basic facilities and I am aware of the good work that is being done by Council for Culture and Recreation. They have ambitious plans which I believe will be to <span class="col_6439-6440" refersTo="page_0367"/>great advantage for the Coloured people when it comes to culture and recreational facilities. But it will be very difficult for them to carry these plans to fruition if adequate facilities do not exist. I know that the hon. the Minister is sympathetic in this regard, and I want to appeal to him most sincerely to assist further, because I believe that at the moment under the present circumstances we have difficulties in this regard. I want to give the hon. the Minister a specific case, because then I believe he will realize that this case may not be an isolated one. We have in the Wentworth complex in the Durban area a housing scheme for the Coloured people. I know, regrettably, that it has fallen behind schedule, but I believe that the intention is that nearly 1,400 houses will be built there for the Coloured people. These houses will be of a sub-economic and economic standard and also for people who wish to own their own homes.</p>

<p>It seems that no positive plans have been made in that housing complex to provide the facilities which I know the Council for Culture and Recreation is working for and is seeking. I want to quote to the hon. the Minister a reply I received when I made an inquiry to find out what exactly was planned for this area. This comes from the Department of Community Development and it reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have to advise that the provision of recreational facilities for Coloureds falls outside the purview of this Department and it is suggested that you approach the Department of Coloured Affairs in this connection.</block>

<p>Now, bearing in mind that we have this housing scheme of 1,400-odd houses, I want to lay emphasis on the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should add that in the layout scheme at Wentworth provision has been made for open spaces which could be used for sports-grounds, etc. Provision has also been made for a shopping centre where a cinema building is already in existence. This building unfortunately is still occupied by Service Products, where disabled persons are employed. It is, however, expected that the building will become available for Coloureds in the not too distant future.</block>

<p>My problem is, that I do not believe that a cinema will provide the recreational facilities envisaged by the Council for Culture and Recreation. I believe there must be more intensive planning in this regard, and I ask the hon. the Minister to instruct his Department to pay specific attention to this particular aspect.</p>

<p>Now I want to raise another aspect. I should like to seek clarity in regard to the scheme for the distribution of vitamin tablets to Coloured schoolchildren. I know that the Government has set its face against school feeding in any form, but to me this scheme which is operating for the Coloured children is a ray of hope and perhaps something which could be developed in the future. There are certain problems I have, and perhaps the Minister can help me and give me information. I understand that this scheme is a legacy from the work undertaken originally by the Cape Department of Education and it was continued on that basis and that each year funds have been made available for the purchase of vitamin tablets to be issued to undernourished and indigent Coloured schoolchildren. The information I have is that in 1964 there were 73,000 schoolchildren in the Cape Province who were benefiting from the distribution of these vitamin tablets. At the time it was said that owing to the doubtful benefits, the scheme would have to be reconsidered. In 1965 I was told that roughly 43,000 indigent children were still receiving these tablets. The tablets were over 4 million in number, their cost was just over R3,200, and the distribution cost was roughly one-tenth of that amount. Then in 1966 I was advised that this scheme was still in operation, but that as from 1st January it had been put into operation in all the provinces in the Republic. The number of tablets distributed still amounted to just over 4 million. The number of schools where distribution was effected was 557, and the number of pupils remained approximately the same at 47,000-odd. I was also told that there was no accurate assessment of the results, but that the principals of the schools reported that pupils receiving the tablets had shown improvement in health and in school work. I believe that was a very encouraging conclusion to which the principals came.</p>

<p>Then in 1968 I was told that the scheme was still in operation, but that it had not been found possible to follow up with research to discover the benefits which had been derived from the scheme because the costs would be high. Sir, if there is obvious benefit, I see no necessity for instituting an intensive research programme, but it seemed to me that there again there was no extension of the scheme. The expenditure had risen slightly: it was R3,780 and it was still operating on a Republic-wide basis, but no specific details were available on a provincial basis. This year on 5th May I was told, in reply to a question, that the scheme was still in operation in all provinces, that roughly 4 million tablets had been distributed, that the cost was still in the region of R3,300-odd and the cost of distribution roughly R600. But the point that puzzles me was that initially when the scheme was in operation in the Cape Province only, there were 44,000-odd pupils who benefited. Now that the scheme is operating throughout the Republic, there are still only 44,000-odd pupils benefiting and my question to the Minister is this. Is it then right to conclude that some of these indigent pupils in the Cape who used to benefit have now been deprived of this scheme in order to allow a broader distribution to the indigent children in the other provinces? I <span class="col_6441-6442" refersTo="page_0368"/>would appreciate some clarity in that regard. I appreciate very much the difficulty in assessing the results, but I want to emphasize again what I consider is the importance of the comment of the principals themselves when they emphasized an improvement in health and school work. I believe that if for such a small expenditure an appreciable and noticeable benefit can be seen in school work and in the health of these children, then I am right in asking the hon. the Minister to consider a gradual extension of this scheme, not only primarily in the Cape but in the other provinces also, and to make the tablets available to as many children as possible.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure that the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, will not expect me to follow up what he said, since he discussed a few matters in which he is interested and which he put directly to the Minister.</p>

<p>The election of the Coloured Persons Representative Council towards the second half of this year, is a special event for us as Whites, but is particularly so for the Coloureds. In fact, I want to view it as the introduction to a new era, a new dispensation, which opens to the Coloureds a special sphere and new fields, fields to which, in the past, they could not lay any claim and could not have any hope of entering. It is in fact in that that I see the point of separate development, as the Coloureds are now, for the first time, being enabled really to be in the service of their own people. I cannot fail to see the difference between the old dispensation and the new dispensation, i.e. that those spheres which in the past were cared for by the Whites, where the Coloureds were administered along with the Whites, are now being opened to them; Coloureds may now rise in those posts, be they in the sphere of education or administration, until they reach the highest posts in those fields. In other words, the Coloureds are now being afforded the opportunity of developing themselves, of really living their lives to the full and, in actual fact, of looking after their own interests. If we look at this report of the Department of Coloured Affairs, it is striking and also gladdening to see to what extent the Coloureds are already participating in the various spheres of the life of the Coloureds. It is interesting to see to what extent they are already entering the liquor trade and commerce in general&#x2014;butcheries, for instance. We are also familiar with the extent to which they have already entered the field of education, and with the tremendous privilege they have of having their own university which, after studying there, they can leave unfrustrated and without building up frustrations there, as was the case at other universities in the past, and can once again return, without a period of adjustment, to serve their own people. As I see it, this is already proof of the success of separate development as implemented by this Government.</p>

<p>But this great privilege which has now accrued to the Coloureds, i.e. that of assuming responsibility for themselves, places a tremendous task on the shoulders of those who have to lead the Coloureds, the Coloured leaders. To bring this responsibility home to the broad masses of the Coloured population, is definitely a task which is much greater than merely passing this on to the Coloured Persons Representative Council. Although there are many organizations which are making a point of inculcating this sense of responsibility upon the Coloureds, I think that the Department will definitely devote even more attention to this matter in the future, particularly in the sense that the Department will go out of its way to encourage those people who make contact with the Coloureds in various spheres to inculcate this sense of responsibility upon the Coloureds.</p>

<p>I just want to mention one single facet. We are aware that the Coloureds do in fact represent a poor section of our population, the result being that they are quite often at the receiving end of welfare services. It is quite often the case that at present the Coloureds still do not really appreciate the responsibility, i.e. that the spending of these funds should have a special significance for them, and that these funds should be spent in such a manner that it should also meet with the approval of those who make those funds available. If we think of the extent to which old-age pensions and family allowances and especially children’s allowances are quite often being mis-spent, then we feel that our people in the rural areas in particular, who are taking offence at this, do after all have some justification. I am aware that the Department is doing everything in its power to ensure that these funds are used in accordance with the purpose for which they are granted, i.e. that in the case of children’s allowances the latter should be spent on the children. We are aware that the Department is doing everything in its power to ensure that these funds are spent in the right manner, but I nevertheless feel that we may ask the Minister whether it is not possible for him to give us some more clarity in regard to the extent to which attention is being devoted to this aspect.</p>

<p>My time has almost expired, but I would still very much like to call attention to this one point. In this new dispensation we feel that it will perhaps be easier to-day and that it is possibly time for us to reconsider the idea of providing the Coloured children at farm schools with a certain measure of agricultural training. I should like to view this against the background that the Coloureds are not being granted the full opportunity of qualifying themselves for the work they will have to do in the future. I know that there are valid arguments to the effect that this training cannot be offered in primary schools, which is what farm schools are, but I nevertheless feel that we have here a gap which has to be filled in some way or other, especially if we <span class="col_6443-6444" refersTo="page_0369"/>consider that so many of these children from families which have lived on farms for generations, are being lost to the agricultural industry as a result of the fact that they move away to the towns. I am convinced that if something can be done in that direction&#x2014; even if it did not imply changing the syllabus but merely providing in some way or other practical guidance at these farm schools&#x2014;it would yield good fruit.</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down will excuse me if I do not follow him because there is a specific matter that I wish to discuss with the Minister. This relates to a problem that is causing considerable concern to municipalities in the Eastern Cape and in particular to the City Council of Port Elizabeth. Listening to the debate here on this particular Vote, one is inclined to think that it is only in the Western Cape that we find Coloured people. I think it must be borne in mind that in the Eastern Cape we have well over 200,000 Coloured people. In fact, that figure might quite easily be exceeded if we take into account all the areas west of the Kat/Fish line. The problem to which I wish to refer is the one of finding an effective way of dealing with those idle Coloured persons who are social misfits, who as a result of alcoholism, drug addiction and other causes, have fallen by the wayside and who in ever increasing numbers are establishing themselves in shacks on the outskirts of Coloured townships. Sir, apart from the slum conditions which these people create and which arise from their social problems, they also constitute a threat to the law-abiding Coloured community who are making such a splendid effort to uplift the status of their townships. They want as much as anybody else to live their lives in peace and quiet, and I believe, therefore, that we owe it to the Coloured community to see that they are protected from elements who have failed to discipline themselves and to utilize the proper housing facilities adequately and who cause social problems by their non-conforming behaviour. Sir, there is no doubt that this problem is a socioeconomic one and that in the long term it has to be solved by providing better education, greater work opportunity, better wages and better recreational facilities. But in the meantime there must be more effective short-term action to take care of the immediate situation. This will obviously involve housing. In this particular regard I believe that great progress has been made in the Eastern Cape. I believe that in Port Elizabeth the City Council has this matter in hand, but in spite of the already spectacular completed housing programme, there is still a very considerable shortage of houses. To a certain extent this has been brought about by the fact that 80 per cent of the new houses that have been built in Port Elizabeth, had to be taken up by displaced persons under group areas removals. In addition, the present population of Port Elizabeth and the surrounding area has been increased by some 20 per cent by immigrants to the City due to lack of work opportunity in the rural areas which, as you know, Sir, are labouring at the present time under a very considerable economic set-back. A sum of R2½ million is to be spent in the next year or two to provide some 2,600 units in the Coloured townships in Port Elizabeth, and it is confidently expected that within the next four or five years some 7,500 houses, excluding private building, will be completed. Sir, although housing is an important factor, it in itself will not solve the problem to which I have drawn the hon. the Minister’s attention. Rehabilitation will have to play a very vital role indeed. As the Eastern Province is a Coloured preferential area with Port Elizabeth as the main centre, the Coloured population which is already in the vicinity of 100,000 in Port Elizabeth, is going to grow spectacularly in the years that lie ahead. I would, therefore, urgently request the hon. the Minister to provide the area with rehabilitation centres which are proving so successful here in the Western Province. These centres are not available to us at the present time in the Eastern Cape. As I have indicated, we have a very considerable Coloured population, and I think the time has arrived when the Minister must seriously consider the question of providing that area with rehabilitation centres such as those which are available at present in the Western Cape. I believe investigations by this department, by the Department of Social Welfare and by the Department of Justice, have revealed that a very real need exists in the Eastern Cape for these rehabilitation centres. I refer, of course, in the first instance, to a rehabilitation centre for adult men such as you have at Kraaifontein. This institution has to serve the whole of the Cape Province, and at the present time, to the best of my knowledge, that institution is already full. It appears to be most logical that a further expansion will have to take place, and I would say most emphatically that if further expansions have to be made it would be wise to make arrangements in the area which the centre has to serve. It would greatly facilitate visits by families to men who are detained in these particular centres. Not only do we plead for a rehabilitation centre such as you have at Kraaifontein, but when the hon. the Minister considers the building of a further Coloured cadet camp, I would ask the hon. the Minister to give the Eastern Cape very serious consideration. I want to say that I was one of those who was privileged&#x2014;and I want to thank the Minister for the honour he did me in inviting me&#x2014;to see the Coloured cadet camp at Faure. I must say that I was most impressed indeed with what I saw there. I can only say that I think these training centres are going to play a tremendously important part in rehabilitating young Coloured people, to equip them to play an effective role in the country’s expanding economy. Not only this, but they will also be an asset to their community and will help to overcome delinquency and other tendencies which create <span class="col_6445-6446" refersTo="page_0370"/>social problems and ultimately lead to the creation of these shack villages which are creating a great problem in the Eastern Cape. On the same basis, Sir, I think the Eastern Cape could well qualify for the establishment of a youth camp like the one which is presently proving very successful, I think, at Weltevreden.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to make this plea to the hon. the Minister: He is in fact the Minister of Education in so far as the Coloured people are concerned, and in this process of rehabilitation I believe that education plays a very vital role indeed. But I am concerned over the fact that many school children&#x2014;and this applies not only to Bantu school children but also to Coloured school children&#x2014;are going to school to-day without having been properly fed. I am quite convinced that hungry school children simply cannot make use of the educational facilities which are afforded to them, and for that reason I believe that the money spent on education does not often yield the full benefit that it should because the children attending school are hungry. Sir, one of the most serious problems confronting the agriculture sector to-day is agricultural surpluses, and I am quite convinced that the Minister of Agriculture is not going to clamp down on production because that would be the most fatal approach that he could adopt. Therefore we have to find better ways and means of distributing the foodstuffs which are available in this country, and I can think of no better way of doing it than to channel it towards those school children who are attending school without having had a decent meal. I would ask the hon. the Minister to give this matter very serious consideration. I make this appeal to the hon. the Minister to think positively with regard to the establishment of rehabilitation centres in the Eastern Cape. I believe that with our very considerable Coloured population, a population that is going to expand tremendously within the next few years, the time to give this matter consideration is now, before some of our social problems get completely out of hand.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Before I reply to the individual requests and pleas made here, I want, right at the outset, to refer to the different interpretations by the Coloured Representatives as well as certain members on the opposite side in regard to the speech made in this House by the hon. Prime Minister earlier this year. There is for example the interpretation given to it by the hon. member for Karoo, who unfortunately, owing to an indisposition, cannot be here to-day, that this speech by the hon. the Prime Minister, in which he referred to posterity which would also have to play its part in the governing of future relationships between Coloureds and Whites, was supposedly an admission of the failure of our policy. There was another interpretation forthcoming from the other side to the effect that the hon. the Prime Minister’s reference to the youth was supposedly an indication that the National Party had no policy. I consequently think it would be a good thing to have absolute clarity on what the hon. the Prime Minister said and meant. I would just like to quote a few sentences from the speech the hon. the Prime Minister made in this House on 7th February. He said on that occasion, to use his own words, that we will be dealing with a white nation on the one hand, and a Coloured nation on the other. He also stated that we must lay the foundation now for the development and the pattern in future. He went on&#x2014;with this he concluded his speech&#x2014;to say that the development which would follow in this field, would take place according to the policy of separate development. It would be a pity if any person had to have any doubts in regard to what the hon. the Prime Minister envisaged in this regard. There is no question of there being any obscurity in regard to the policy of the National Party. There is a lack of clarity in regard to how it will eventually be developed further. But there is one thing no person in this House need have any doubt about, and that is that this development for the Coloureds will take place in accordance with the policy of parallel development. That is the basis of our entire pattern. How they will in future liase with this Parliament, is a matter which not only the white children but also the brown children can think about. The Prime Minister quite rightly, said that the question of liaison between the Coloured Persons’ Represenative Council and Parliament was a matter which he would leave to the Coloureds, meaning the Coloured Persons’ Representative Council. A decision would have to be taken about that. Whether it would be a select committee or a commission, might not even be the final answer. There is still the idea which Dr. Verwoerd himself expressed here, that even a commonwealth might be established. Whether it could be done will have to be decided in the future, but there is one thing nobody need have any doubts about, and that is that this liaison which will develop, will develop between parallel political bodies. That is the basis of our policy. I think it is necessary that we emphasize this aspect, i.e. that the children will also play a part in future. The hon. member for Moorreesburg was quite right in pointing out the importance of the development of a new Coloured political personality. This Coloured Persons’ Representative Council is going to introduce a new Coloured personality in this country, and it is going to confront us and particularly our children with a new relations problem, or rather a new relations situation, and for that reason it would be a good thing if our children can know in good time that we have laid the foundations for this development; that we have opened the way for them to accomplish parallel development. But we must envisage what this development will include in the future. It is going to include the fact that this Coloured Persons’ Representative Council, with its executive body, is going to occupy an important position in <span class="col_6447-6448" refersTo="page_0371"/>society, not only in the Coloured society but also in South African society. I think it is necessary for our children to realize that they must in future have the right attitude in regard to the Coloureds who are developing in this connection, and that within the framework of parallel development the necessary respect will have to be displayed towards those institutions and the people serving on those bodies. But I have also heard from the Coloured Representatives in this debate that strong exception is being taken to the discrimination which is supposedly to be found in our legislation. Exception is being taken by the hon. member for Karoo, by the hon. member for Peninsula, and the hon. member for Outeniqua has lent his support to this, to the fact that our legislation has over the years been discriminatory. I want to concede that our apartheid legislation has discriminatory aspects. But this discrimination is not merely one sided, does not emanate from the Whites towards the Coloureds. After all, it is at the same time a protective measure for the Coloureds themselves. Would the Coloured be able to develop and expand his little business without these discriminatory measures? No, Mr. Chairman, these discriminatory measures comprise the protection the young Coloured business men need to-day in order to remain viable against the more powerful, hetero-racial capital, even that of the Whites. In the social sphere it is necessary that they be protected against the numerically superior Bantu. These discriminatory measures are necessary for the protection of their group consciousness and their own identity. The Coloured leader who advocates to-day that these discriminatory measures, which include group areas, should be abolished, is doing his people an ill service. For group areas, which according to the Opposition constitute a discriminatory measure, imply sound benefits for the Coloureds in the social and economic spheres. In the intellectual-political sphere it also benefits them, because they acquire as a result a sense of place and they can realize their attachment to the soil and in this way occupy their rightful place in South Africa.</p>

<p>I therefore feel that there is a task awaiting our children, a task of treating these Government bodies of the Coloureds and the Coloureds themselves with the necessary respect in future, because if we as Whites expect respect, our children must also learn to show respect to the other racial groups.</p>

<p>We must all learn this, and not only learn it, but also put it into practice in our own lives. It produces quite beneficial results as far as goodwill is concerned. We can testify to that. We have received an abundance of proof of this in the implementation of our policy of parallel development. In fact, this mutual respect invests South Africa with the strength which makes it unassailable.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the requests of individual members. The hon. member for Peninsula appealled to the Coloureds to make use of the coming election. I am very pleased about that, and I have no doubt that his request will produce good results. He expressed concern about the possibility that the voter’s rolls might not be available in time. The Department of the Interior assured me this morning that the lists have already been typed. It is expected that this work will have been completed by the end of June. The typed lists will then, even before they have been printed, be made available to the Coloured political parties. That ought to leave them plenty of time.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury expressed his thanks to the Department for the registration work being done. Of course there are other Departments and bodies to whom we also owe a vote of thanks in this connection: the Interior. Information, Police, the radio, the Press&#x2014;all played their part here. We are very pleased that the registration campaign went off so well. There was a time when <i>The Star</i> was predicting that the registration would be a failure. It was predicted in that newspaper that only between 300,000 and 350,000 would register. In reality almost 650,000 registered. That is why this is something one is grateful for, that use was made of this registration opportunity with so much interest.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member for Westdene, who apologized for not being able to be here to-day, referred to the need for giving the Coloured voter guidance in so far as the polling procedure is concerned. If one thinks how few of those 650.000 ever voted in the past, one can understand that they must be afforded an opportunity of being instructed. I can inform him that we are already engaged in this. We have asked the Department of Information to be of assistance. The Department has made a film with the title &#x201C;This is how one votes&#x201D;, which has already been shot and in which Coloured voters play a role, even at the polls. This film is almost complete now. We intend distributing it throughout the country so that it can be shown in all Coloured bioscopes. In that way it ought to be possible to instruct the Coloureds in this regard. Over and above that, the Department is engaged in drawing up a brochure on a question and answer pattern in regard to the various questions which a voter may perhaps put. In reply to his additional questions, whether it is going to be published in <i>Alpha,</i> I can give him the assurance that this is going to be done. The hon. member also pleaded that <i>Alpha</i> which at present has a circulation of 15,000, should be expanded. I can also assure him that this is being considered at present.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mossel Bay made an appeal, on the basis of the misuse of liquor among our Coloureds in particular, that research <span class="col_6449-6450" refersTo="page_0372"/>be undertaken, if need be at our universities, to inquire into the causes of this. I just want to inform the hon. member that this is one of the matters into which the research has been instituted to such a thorough extent now, that one doubts whether even further research is necessary. I have here in my hand a list of 13 publications, research works on the question of the drinking habits of Coloureds which have been published. I think that we have now reached the stage where one feels that we already have a lot of information. We now have a great deal of knowledge and information. One should rather proceed now to the intensification of the treatment process. It appears from all these research works that in the treatment process one should preferably treat the Coloureds in a preventative way than, say, undertake the rehabilitation of a drunkard. In that regard we can all do a great deal. Members put in pleas here to-day for various forms of welfare services and recreational activities. We already have the example of Vlaeberg in the constituency of the hon. member for Stellenbosch That, I think, is the field which we can now enter with far better results than to give our attention to further research. Not that I am being derogatory in regard to it, but we now have this wealth of information. We know the problem is that they do not really have any programme for spending their leisure time. While that is the case, I think that we should rather concentrate on organizing their free time to better effect, of helping them with various activities, which are known to us all, and in this way perhaps getting them so far as to develop another living pattern and national pattern.</p>

<p>In this connection we have also lent a hand by way of a film. The National Film Board has had a film made by the name of &#x201C;Johnny&#x201D;, which has already been showing for some time in Coloured bioscopes, to emphasize the question of the abuse of liquor. I saw this film myself and found it particularly striking as a very effective means of bringing home this disadvantage of abuse of liquor in a fitting way. The intention is that this film will be followed by one which will perhaps place emphasis on positive factors, which will show how a person can be useful to society if he is able to resist those evils. I really want to suggest that we, and not only the State, but all those who have an interest and who are interested, will concentrate on intensifying this preventative programme of action for the Coloureds. This to a large extent, also serves as a reply to the plea made here by the hon. member for Sea Point.</p>

<p>In regard to the cadet centre, I am very pleased that so much praise was expressed for this centre. The only person I did not hear expressing any praise was the hon. member for Houghton. To her way of thinking it is probably still a &#x201C;forced labour camp&#x201D;, as she described it here in the debate last year. I do hope the hon. member will still find occasion to go and have a look at it. It is not far from here. One can reach it in quite a short time. She can then go and have a look at what that &#x201C;forced labour camp&#x201D; looks like. Perhaps she will find that her impressions coincide with those of her bench-fellow and other colleagues. This training centre is a show piece which was established to render a very useful service, of which the Coloureds themselves are very proud. Hence the pleas we have received, <i>inter alia,</i> from the hon. member for Malmesbury and others, who wants us to establish as many as five or six similar centres. The hon. member for Walmer, the last speaker, made a plea to the effect that we should establish one in Port Elizabeth as well. This is a matter which I feel is very deserving; but for the sake of fairness we will at least have to give it a chance for a year, so that it can prove itself properly, before the State can proceed to establish the next one. Then, I think, those places where there are large concentration of Coloureds such as Port Elizabeth must obviously come into consideration for such a centre. But at this stage we feel that we should at least give this institution a chance to grow.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton was concerned about the appeal I made the other day, and in which I referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to police raids. If she had read the appeal properly, she would have seen that I had not stated that they would be carried out, but I did say that they would be considered if the legal provisions were not obeyed. She has already received the figures which I furnished in reply to a question. It has also been mentioned here already that only a little more than 2.000 reacted, while it should in fact be 15,000. This is a circumvention of the Act. It is a matter which the Coloured leaders are displeased about. Hon. members also saw how Dr. Morkel and Mr. Le Fleur expressed opinions condemning this, and did not disapprove of this appeal which I made with the possibility of police raids being carried out later on. For that reason this is a matter which we will in fact consider in future, i.e. if there is no response to these appeals.</p>

<p>In addition the question of schools and hostels was raised by the hon. member for Malmesbury. Other hon. members also referred to it. They pleaded for schools, and particularly hostels in the rural areas with the purpose of keeping the Coloureds in the rural areas. We realize to the full the need for the provision of education in the rural areas as a means of keeping the Coloured children there. We realize to the full the need for providing education in the rural areas as a means of keeping the Coloured child there. For that reason many schools are being established on farms now in implementation of this policy and conviction of ours. If there is no church or other body capable of establishing the buildings, the State itself will erect the school buildings, as well as the accommodation for teachers. All that we desire is that the farmers make the grounds available to us, which we can of course rent from him.</p>

<p><span class="col_6451-6452" refersTo="page_0373"/>As far as hostels are concerned, the hon. member for Malmesbury expressed himself greatly in favour of our establishing country hostels in remote areas, not only for high schools but also for primary schools. The hon. member for Gardens also expressed an opinion in this regard and pleaded for hostels for primary school children. The State wants to tackle this matter in a way which will bring about the establishment of these hostels for us in the following order of priority: Firstly, at each multi-stream high school; secondly, at every country high school; and thirdly, at primary schools in the sparsely populated country areas. In this way I hope that we will in fact be able to contribute to keeping the Coloureds in the rural areas.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point also made a plea for vocational training for the country children. I can inform that hon. member that we are at present considering the possibility of including a subject like agriculture into this multi-stream pattern as such at these schools. With this I am also replying to one of the last speakers who pleaded for this. The other subjects include domestic science, commerce, technical subjects, and so on. This is a matter which is therefore receiving consideration at the moment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg referred to the high percentage of the expenditure by the C.D.C. on liquor concerns and hotels. This gives quite a distorted impression. The hon. member has the figures correct, but I am afraid the impression is distorted. In the past one had the problem that the drinking localities for Coloureds were in the white areas. This applied to the hotels as well. With the establishment of Coloured group areas the problem was that there were none of the necessary drinking facilities in these areas. The Liquor Commission therefore came forward with proposals that the drinking pattern of the Coloureds should be changed. It had to be changed by for example introducing the restaurant idea where they could buy food together with the liquor. The result of this has been that the Coloured Development Corporation had to intervene immediately in order to assist with the financing necessary for the establishment of those kind of drinking localities where a new drinking pattern could be introduced. When I visited those drinking places in the Cape Flats a year or two ago I was really impressed by the orderly and acceptable way in which the Coloured persons there were behaving themselves. Because we had to tackle this matter first, it seems as if the C.D.C. is concentrating on liquor matters. However, this is no fair representation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point also mentioned homes for the aged in the rural areas. I can give him the assurance that the Department is taking an interest in this matter. We are always prepared to lend generous assistance to organizations in regard to those establishments. Of course, the demand must be such that such institutions are fully justified. The hon. member must kindly forward those requests to the Department. We will surely consider them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked quite a number of questions. The hon. member should in future make an attacking speech because there would then be less for me to reply to. Now he has asked so many questions instead of making a speech that we will have to get down to his questions. The hon. member asked, <i>inter alia,</i> for details in regard to the amount of R36 which appears on one of the schedules and which was paid to a teacher. The reply is that female needlework teachers receive R42 and R36 per year in the rural areas for part-time instruction of approximately one hour per week. For that one hour per week, R36 is regarded as being quite fair. In addition the hon. member asked a question in regard to Coloured children who were working. This is a matter which belongs under the Vote of the Department of Labour. The same Act applies to both, whether one is a Coloured or a white child, i.e. that if they are under the age of 15 they may not work in shops, nor may they work in factories if they are under the age of 15. There is of course an exception, and that is in respect of children who sell newspapers. That does not fall under one of the wage measures. As you know, that is a job which lasts only an hour or two. That is a separate matter. If there are children working in shops who are younger than 15, or in factories who are younger than 15, then it is a matter which the hon. member can certainly report to our Police so that it may be investigated. In addition the hon. member asked what chiefs appeared under the South-West Africa Coloured Affairs Vote. These are the chiefs of the Namas.</p>

<p>I think I should also furnish an immediate reply to the other question the hon. member put in regard to the Rehoboths and others in South-West Africa. The Rehoboths, Namas and Coloureds there, I have all visited. I have held conversations with them all. The impression I gained, in the few days I was with the Rehoboths, was that there was a great need for development in the Rehoboth territory. It is a beautiful territory, as the hon. member knows. He previously represented a constituency in that part of the world. It is among the best pasturage in South-West Africa. But there is a great deal of neglect. There is no fencing or enclosed paddocks. The situation is therefore one which requires development. I have also found in my conversations with Rehoboth leaders that there is a great need for this among them, and that they would welcome State assistance. Opposed to that there is another group among them which is distrustful in regard to anything the Whites or the Administration or the Government wants to undertake. To that the South-West Administration and the hon. member for Windhoek, who is chairman of a committee of inquiry that did valuable work in regard to the Rehoboth matter, can fully testify. The question <span class="col_6453-6454" refersTo="page_0374"/>now is whether one should allow this development, which is essential, to wait until the constitutional struggle has eventually been finalized. The hon. the Prime Minister met the Rehoboth Bastard Council earlier this year. On that occasion he invited them to draw up their own constitution. Since 1923 already they have been engaged in drawing up a constitution. A constitution is drawn up and is then negatived by the citizens. It is simply impossible to make progress with this matter. Then the hon. the Prime Minister invited them to draw up a constitution which will give them self-government. He even offered to make Government lawyers available to assist them with the drafting of that constitution. That invitation stands. But at the same time the development for the sake of those in the Rehoboth territory who want it and who need it must continue. With a view to that the Secretary for Coloured Affairs is in Rehoboth to-day. He is to day once again addressing the Bastard Council of the Rehoboths in regard to the plans we have. I hope to be able to issue a statement within the next 10 days which may perhaps answer many of the questions the hon. member wanted to put, arising out of what the Government will be able to do in this connection and at this stage.</p>

<p>In regard to the Coloureds of South-West I can give hon. members a very favourable report. I met the Coloured Persons Council of South-West and experienced among them the greatest goodwill towards the Republic and the Government. In fact, it was so great that they were in fact eager to obtain representation on the Coloured Persons Representative Council. Hon. members know that according to the White Paper South-West is being granted only one representative. However, they desire to have more. I said to them that this was a matter they could discuss with the council, when it was established. I do not think it is fair that any change be effected at this stage. As far as the Namas are concerned, Sir, you will recall that according to the Odendaal Report Namaland has in fact been increased in size. It has been increased in size twofold as a result of the white farms which have been bought out. It is now a large territory, with Gibeon as their capital. There I also met the chiefs. I can also testify that they displayed the greatest goodwill towards us and our officials. The hon. member also asked whether the title, Minister of Rehoboth Affairs, will be used. When I deal with Rehoboth matters, I shall be termed that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Swellendam referred to the question of social pensions and the abuse thereof. I can just inform him that the Department has for the past year-and-a-half been engaged in a very intensive plan of action aimed at eliminating the abuses. According to replies which I have already furnished in this House, we have already achieved a great deal of success in that regard. We are continuing, with the assistance of the Police and other bodies, together with the persons who have complained, to iron out these matters. I join the hon. member in thinking that these pension abuses are not in the interests of the good race relations which ought to exist.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Moorreesburg. He asked for a kind of Tomlinson Commission. One is of course never averse to making inquiries and gaining knowledge, but there is undoubtedly a great difference between this present position and the position in respect of the Bantu matters which the Tomlinson Commission went into. The Tomlinson Commission was appointed before there was a Transkeian Parliament, and before there were territorial authorities. That commission helped to a large extent to assemble that information, and it was also of assistance in regard to the policy which has ultimately been formulated now. To-day the position is a different one. Here we are on the verge of achieving an additional administration for Coloured Affairs. Under the commissionership of Mr. Gaum, we are now going to obtain an administration for Coloured Affairs. In addition we have the Department of Coloured Relations. In other words, we have now reached an administrative stage where we have at our disposal the largest possible administrative machine. This administrative machine has at its disposal the necessary knowledge. That development has already taken place now. But in addition we also have the Coloured Persons’ Representative Council, Which is to be established. I really believe that this Coloured Persons’ Council should be afforded an opportunity of reflecting on its major problems itself. Whether it is a question of a homeland or homeland areas, that council must reflect on the problems. As I stated at the last meeting of the Coloured Persons’ Council, it is a matter on which the Coloureds must also reflect now. We as Whites have always done the Coloureds’ thinking for them. We shall still continue to help them to think, but I really do think that we should afford the Coloureds the opportunity, by means of their statutory and administrative bodies, of also making a contribution. That does not mean to say that we will not reach a stage where we will feel that there is nevertheless a need for this, but I really think that at this stage it is a matter which we can safely leave in the hands of the Coloured Persons’ Representative Council which is still to be established. The hon. member for Wynberg wanted to know whether there could not perhaps, as a result of these two Departments which are now going to be established, be duplication, and whether there would not be any duplication between this administration and the provincial administrations. That is in fact the objective with the establishment of the Department of Coloured Relations, namely to prevent such duplication. The Department of Coloured Relations will to a large extent be a liaison department between the administration and other Government Departments and the provincial administrations. It ought to be possible to prevent the problem which the <span class="col_6455-6456" refersTo="page_0375"/>hon. member foresees by means of this machinery.</p>

<p>The hon. member also pleaded for the expansion of welfare services. I can just inform the hon. member that it is the intention that the Coloured Persons’ Representative Council, as one of its first measures, shall pass a measure dealing with social services. The Department has already drafted this, and it is being kept in preparation for the consideration of the Coloured Persons’ Representative Council. If they are satisfied with it, it will be given to them to introduce as one of their first legislative measures.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton was also concerned about the question of co-ordination among the various departments. I can inform her that we are in fact, with a view to the danger that there may not perhaps be sufficient co-ordination, establish a permanent committee for the re-settlement of Coloureds throughout the Republic. The four departments serving on that committee are the Department of Planning, Community Development, Labour and Coloured Affairs. During the past week the Ministers of these Departments have convened for the purpose of actually reorganizing this permanent committee and placing it in future under the guidance of the Department of Coloured Affairs. One of our senior officials will be in charge of that committee, and the hon. member can therefore deduce that this ought to bring about the necessary co-ordination.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Berea asked whether more could not be done in regard to recreational facilities. The hon. member serves on the Council for Culture and Recreation for the Coloureds, and as he knows, it is one of the tasks of the local authorities to be of assistance in this respect. The Council for Culture and Recreation is of course still prepared to render the necessary financial assistance in this regard. All that is necessary is that those bodies should furnish us with the necessary information. The hon. member also put a question in regard to vitamin tablets. This service is being undertaken by the Department of Health. The Department of Coloured Affairs is only exercising control, and pays for the service. The onus is on school principals to apply for the provision of tablets to the schools concerned, and the Department of Health indicates whether they approve an application. The expansion of the service therefore depends upon the fundamental need for the tablets and the applications from school principals.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer put in a plea for a rehabilitation centre near Port Elizabeth. We have already considered this matter on a previous occasion. The city council of Port Elizabeth has also addressed representations to us in this connection already. It is therefore not a new request which is being addressed to us. The question of such a rehabilitation centre near Port Elizabeth, similar to the De Novo rehabilitation centre in Kraaifontein, is a matter which one considers with quite a good deal of trepidation, because one wonders whether this is the basic requirement. The hon. member referred to people who were inclined to abuse liquor, and also to people who had been warned, and so on. The plea for a training centre at Port Elizabeth is perhaps more substantiated, for the De Novo rehabilitation centre at Kraaifontein has 38 people who came from the Eastern Cape. But apart from that we decided a year or two ago to establish a second rehabilitation centre at Wellington. The plans have already been drawn up, and the hon. member will realize that we cannot at this stage establish such a centre at Port Elizabeth as well. That is why I think that these two rehabilitation centres will in the meantime have to be used by the Eastern Cape for their inebriates. For the rest it remains our task to cope with this problem on the preventative level, as I said in my former reply. Mr. Chairman, I think that that covers the matters which were raised.</p>

<p>Yes, that is not a bad idea. The training of Coloured doctors is a matter that is receiving attention from us. In fact, we are now acquiring land for the establishment of a medical school for Coloureds in Bellville. During the past week or so 80 morgen adjoining the present university college has been acquired by the Department of Community Development for a medical school for the Coloureds in this area. But, as the hon. member can understand, the establishment of a medical school is a process which can take years. In the meantime the Universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch will help with the provision of this training.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask for the privilege of the half hour? The Nationalist Party is beset with race prejudices. Just lately there has been concentration on <span class="col_6457-6458" refersTo="page_0376"/>White prejudice and the rallying of the prejudiced by exploiting the so-called &#x201C;liberalism&#x201D; of the English. For obvious reasons it is not so easy or wise to appeal openly to white prejudice. Therefore, it is done cunningly by using the field of religious dogma to show that one section of the white race thinks liberally towards the black races. Therefore, the suggested dilution of the Afrikaans-speaking Nationalist Party with English-speaking people will endanger the outlook and the policies of the Nationalist Party Government towards the African people. The attitude of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet towards the different race groups is causing concern. It is getting close scrutiny. The question everyone is asking is whether the Prime Minister will ride the storm. Does the Prime Minister know where he is going and does the Cabinet know where the Government is going with regard to race policies? After recent clashes in this House on the Prime Minister’s Vote and in the Other Place on this policy of the Prime Minister, we are justified in wondering where exactly this Government now stands. If there is any uncertainty about the Prime Minister, then there must be uncertainty about the future of this Government and its policy as well. We have for long been saying that the rank and file of the Nationalist Party do not believe that the Government will carry out its Bantu policy as propounded in this Assembly. Although the late Dr. Verwoerd made it clear that it was his intention to carry out separation through to its logical conclusion, to give the reserves sovereign independence and to take back Bantu to the reserves, to the homelands as he called them, the people did not believe him. We have been saying that. After disclosures made by the hon. the Minister of Defence last year in this House that although Dr. Verwoerd was promising the Coloureds and telling the world that the Coloureds would not lose their parliamentary representation, we heard that in fact he was saying directly the opposite to one of his Ministers. Bearing this in mind, the Government cannot blame the country if it is suspicious about any policy statements made by its Ministers on race problems.</p>

<p>But the Prime Minister surely lays down this policy. We doubt whether the Prime Minister knows what the policy is.</p>

<p>Dr. Verwoerd always envisaged a commonwealth between white South Africa and the seven or eight small black independent states. However, Chief Kaiser Matanzima, we see, has different ideas. He talks of one black nation and one big black federal state which will talk with the South African Government on equal terms. Bearing that in mind, we should like to know from this Minister whether the intention still is to proceed with this policy of independence. Having been told by the Government that it has no solution for the Coloured problem, there is concern amongst Nationalists themselves about whether the Government has any solution for the Bantu problem. The development of the reserves are fundamental to the Government policy. It is fundamental to Dr. Verwoerd’s policy. After all, he was the architect of separate development. It was his idea that the Africans should be taken from the white areas back to the reserves. But what do we hear now? Is that still the policy that the Africans are to go back? We now hear that numbers do not count. They are important, but they are not decisive. I should like to quote from a leading article of a Nationalist newspaper which illustrates the absurdity of the position; which illustrates just how worried Nationalists themselves are becoming about this policy and which has justified the attacks we have made on the policy from the time when it was first announced that it was impractical and that it would not be carried out. This article is dated 2nd March, 1969, and the heading is &#x201C;Dit deug nie&#x201D;. It reads as follows:</p>

<p>They use this article to attack the Deputy Minister of Justice. However, two days after this article appeared the Prime Minister made the same statement in the Other Place. The Minister had made the statement before. Why the poor Deputy Minister alone must be picked on at this stage I do not know, because the hon. the Minister had made a similar statement before.

<p>Why the people are worried and why the Government is now announcing that numbers although important do not count, is because there will always be numbers in the white areas unless the Government can take them out and they can only take them out by developing the reserves. I want to ask if it is still the Government’s policy, after these statements have been made in fact, to take the Bantu to the reserves. Dr. Verwoerd said that he expected the turn to take place in 1978, but I think Mr. De Wet Nel said it would be in 1976. These two gentlemen spoke a lot about the separate development of the reserves. It is 14 years since the Tomlinson Commission reported and precious little has been done in that time. The latest critic is the Commissioner-General of the Transkei who should know. Last year he criticized the development and this year he has done so again. He pointed out that it is neither scientific nor profitable to enforce economic development where economic growth does not exist. We have also had the report of the Xhosa Development Corporation. This is a corporation which was brought into being to develop the reserves. It points out that agricultural production under existing conditions has shown no appreciable advance. It says that despite the painstaking devotion and energies of the officials concerned, the output is below the potential of the area and is below that of comparable areas in the Republic. They say that the improved concessions of the Government on the basis of those applicable to border areas will not provide sufficient assistance. In the opinion of the corporation additional concessions such as lower transport tariffs and tax reductions will be necessary in order to create competitive industries. This was reported in the latest report of the corporation which was brought into being to develop the reserves. It has become obvious that border industries are not the answer, and it is also obvious that the Bantu cannot bring about sufficient development on his own. We have heard from the hon. the Prime Minister that we must not develop faster than the Bantu himself can absorb. But the hon. the Deputy Minister of Justice, who seems to be the chief spokesman on Bantu Affairs, especially for the Rapportryers who all want him, provided that he tells them the things they want to hear, said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Die ontwikkeling daar moet gedra, verwek en opgewek word deur die Bantoe self en daarom kan ons slegs hulp en bystand verleen. Gaan ons te vinnig sal dit horn verbygaan en sal vir horn van geen betekenis wees nie, en sal dit weer net blanke ontwikkeling wees. Dus die eerste taak is om die Bantoe as mens self te laat ontwikkel en eerste te ontwikkel. Dit is ’n lewenstaak. Dit is ’n taak nie van ’n dekade nie, maar van dekades en selfs eeue.</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister says that it will not happen in his time or our time and now the hon. the Deputy Minister talks about centuries. If we have to rely on the Bantu themselves, there will be no development. There <span class="col_6461-6462" refersTo="page_0378"/>can be no development. The Government has also announced an agency plan. They want Whites to go into the reserves on an agency system. This in itself is a departure from Dr. Verwoerd’s policy. When Dr. Verwoerd was asked about the investing of white capital in the reserves, he said that he was not going to allow White capital into the reserves at all, because if you took White capital in, you would want white management; if you took white management, you would want white staff; if you took white staff you would want white wives and their children; you would then have to have schools, schoolmasters, churches and ministers and therefore a white community again. His policy was to get rid of the Whites. The fact that white capital is now going to be taken into the reserves on an agency basis, is contrary to what Dr. Verwoerd said. I want to know from this hon. Minister whether it is considered to be his duty to develop the reserves or whether he considers it to be a burden. We have had two Deputy Ministers speaking with two voices. On the one hand we have the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration who made an excellent speech at George, where he said that he regarded it as his duty and that of the country, that the reserves should be developed. On the other hand we have the speech by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Justice at Stellenbosch to the Rapportryers, where he spoke differently. He told the audience there of the magnitude of the task. He said that accommodation and work do not have to be provided for all the Bantu; all of them do not have to be removed from the white areas, but only the superfluous. They are those not gainfully employed, the wives, the children, the elders and the idlers.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I am not slanting a thing. I have the exact speech handed out by the Minister of Information. He repeated that the removal of these superfluous appendages was not dependent on the development of the homelands because they were dependants and not the workers, and all the Government had to do was to supply housing facilities for them. At any rate, he showed some humanitarianism there. He estimated that in 1960 there were 3.8 million odd of these people. There are many more now of these superfluous people, and in considering the magnitude of the task, and remembering that they increase every year, the task becomes greater every year. Just in case any of the Rapportryers thought that he and the Nationalist Government were to blame for these &#x201C;oortolliges&#x201D;, he set their minds at rest by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek dink in dié verband ook aan die nalatenskap van ’n vorige bewind wat in 1945 in die Bantoestadsgebiedewet die beruigte artikel 10 ingeskryf het waarby Bantoes in die blanke tuisland behandel word asof hulle burgers van die blanke tuisland is omdat dit bepaal dat ’n Bantoe wat gebore is in ’n Bantoewoonbuurt binne ons blanke stedelike gebiede of wat in ’n stadsgebied vir 10 jaar vir dieself de baas of vir 15 jaar vir verskillende base gewerk het, nie uit daardie stadsgebiede verwyder kan word nie.</block>

<p>The hon. member has been in Parliament for a long time and he was Deputy Chairman of the Native Affairs Commission. He is not a newcomer here and he should know better. I hope he was not deliberately misleading those Rapportryers. What did section 10 of the 1945 Act passed by the United Party contain? It gave the Governor-General the right, if requested by an urban area, to prohibit the entry of Bantu into urban areas, and he could also lay down conditions under which those who were there could stay there. Who introduced the provision that they could stay there and have citizenship rights and that they could stay there for 10 years if they worked for one employer or if they had worked for 15 years for different employers and were born there? Who gave them that right? It was Dr. Verwoerd. In 1952 Dr. Verwoerd amended that Act and what did the Deputy Minister say? He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie artikel pas natuurlik nie in ons opset van afsonderlike ontwikkeling nie.</block>

<p>The architect of separate development, Dr. Verwoerd, introduced that measure, and this Deputy Minister tells them that it does not fit in, and he says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As daaraan gevat sou word, kan u u voorstel wat ’n keel daar opgesit sal word.</block>

<p>Sir, are they thinking of tampering with it, and if they are, there is no doubt that the Verwoerdites will attack them, because thinking people know that Dr. Verwoerd himself introduced it. [Interjections.] He blames the United Party for the maintenance on the Statute Book of this provision treating people as citizens and in case some of the Rapportryers were critical of the employment of Bantu in white areas, he provides them with balm for their consciences. To those who asked whether they had to say farewell to the implementation of separate development because of the need for Bantu labour in the white areas, he said no, not at all. The use of foreign black labour, he said, was not in conflict with separate development, provided there were four conditions applied to it; firstly, that they were not to become domiciled and obtain citizenship rights, secondly, that they were not encumbered with their superfluous appendages like wives, children and other dependants; thirdly, that their numbers did not become uncontrollable; and fourthly, that the labour force would not be used to the detriment of the white labour force. Sir, can anyone imagine a more callous and shocking approach? The labour force, despite section 10, has been migrant and under his policy it will <span class="col_6463-6464" refersTo="page_0379"/>be completely migrant with all its economic and social evils. The Deputy Minister and other Ministers, when talking of charitable organizations and churches in the past who protested against the treatment of the Africans in the urban areas, referred to these people as &#x201C;do-gooders&#x201D;, and it has become a term of contempt. Sir, the &#x201C;do-gooders&#x201D; are not only the English churches and organizations now, but the Afrikaans churches are coming out also against this system of migrant labour, so they are also becoming &#x201C;do-gooders&#x201D; now. The Cape Town Municipality just recently was put in this embarrassing position that it had to decide, in discussing its male Bantu hostels, whether to have prostitution and venereal disease or homosexuality and rape. That is what it has come down to. The Deputy Minister completely closes his eyes to the fact that there are probably millions of Africans who are already domiciled in the white areas.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>They have no other home. That was why Dr. Verwoerd gave them protection. The Government does not intend relieving the Africans of their obligations as South African citizens. They suggest giving them dual citizenship, but they regard them as South African citizens. They made them South African citizens. Sir, it is not section 10 which made them South African citizens, and those people will have that citizenship no matter what they may say. Then the Deputy Minister insists on controlling their numbers. Sir, these numbers are controlled now. Influx control was introduced in 1945 to control their numbers, but he wishes to control them in an unsympathetic and inhumane manner, making physical use of their bodies from year to year and replacing them irrespective of whether they are needed and whether they need the work or not: all they will be is a cog in the labour machine. His fourth condition is that they must not be a threat to the white labour force. They will not be a threat unless the Government carries out its policy of training Bantu labour in the border areas in competition with white workers. Then they will become a threat, but not otherwise, because there is a shortage of labour now. In case there were some of the audience who were still uneasy about the continued employment of such large numbers, he produced his ace card. He asked them to consider and give their thoughts to the fact that without this labour force we could not maintain our economic growth of 5 per cent per annum. Without that growth he said we could not afford to spend R250 million on defence, and he did not believe that any right-thinking Afrikaner would suggest that we should reduce this amount. He said that without that economic growth we could not educate our youth, nor afford the technical or technological education of our people; and above all he said without that economic growth we could not finance the policy of separate development. [Interjections.] I am reading a translation of what he said. These, he said, were the sober facts. They are sober facts, Sir, and these are the facts we have been telling the country all along. You cannot do without that labour; you will not have that economic growth without that Bantu labour in the white areas. You cannot do the things he is talking about without that labour. They said we were all wrong, but now they are preparing the people to accept that labour force, to accept the Bantu in the white areas. They say that numbers do not count, but what a selfish way it is of putting it, because they do not consider the interests of the black people at all; they are only considering the interests of the white people, appealing to that particular audience for support. Sir, Dr. Verwoerd and Mr. De Wet Nel, when stating their policy for the development of the Reserves and their ideas for removing the Natives, always put it on a humanitarian basis. They spoke loftily about ideals and appealed to us to have ideals and to help these people. Now we want to know from this Minister what his ideas are. When does he think, if ever, will the Native population be taken back to the Reserves? Is it still the policy? Why are they preparing the people now? Why do they keep on making speeches about numbers not really counting? Is it because they have abandoned that policy and do not intend taking them back any more? Is it that they now admit the failure of their policy in regard to the development of the Reserves? I challenge the Minister or any hon. member to tell us what is happening about the development of the Reserves, and how many more people are being employed there. There is nothing happening at all, and the Bantu people cannot be employed there. You only have to look at the numbers of the Bantu being taken out of the Reserves every year to work in the white areas. [Interjections.] That hon. member has so much to say, but he must know that the white areas are getting blacker and blacker. And what about the farms? Why did the Deputy Minister when addressing the Rapportryers not talk about the people on the farms? What is going to happen to their wives and children? Are they not going to be allowed to stay on the farms? Are they superfluous, too, and must they also be sent back to the Reserves? And where is all the money going to come from to house all the superfluous people in the Reserves if there is no provision made there for the employment of any of them? [Interjection.] It is the same old story, but it is so true and we have been saying all along that this policy is a fraud and a bluff. <i>Die Beeld</i> and other papers are also saying: &#x201C;We are not bluffed by this story that numbers do not count.&#x201D; It is time that the Government now faces the facts and lets us know.</p>

<p>You know what our policy is. But I am not discussing our policy now. We are trying to make the people realize that this Government has no policy. The policy of the Government for the Bantu is as bad as it is for the Coloureds. The Prime Minister has had the honesty to admit that he does not know what will happen to the Coloureds in future; he hopes our grandchildren will solve the problem. As far as the Bantu are concerned, they just talk and theorize, but when it comes to applying it they fail. The trouble is that the policy of separate development was enunciated by Dr. Verwoerd; he was its architect. He told them all about it and he gave them the blueprint as to how to set about it, but unfortunately he passed away. Now this Cabinet is left with the task of carrying it out and they do not know how to carry it out. They are failing as Dr. Verwoerd would have failed. We told him he could not do it and this Government is failing also, because it cannot carry out that policy. The sooner they admit it and face up to the fact and make a change in their policy and admit that the Bantu are living here permanently in the white areas and let them enjoy a normal family life in the white areas, the better. [Interjections.] They are going to live here in any event. But under their policy they want them to live there for a year so that they can go back again, with all those social evils. Why not face up to the fact and let them have their families living with them; those who are permanently urbanized? Why not give them a stake in the country and let them have their own homes in their own townships? The sooner the Government faces the facts and realizes that it will have to accept our policy in regard to the Bantu, as it has done in so many other instances to their advantage, the better for them and the country.</p>

<p>Sir, the greatest single dividing factor between the United Party and the National Party is to be found in their different approaches to the position of the Bantu in South Africa. It is quite clear that these two standpoints of the United Party and the National Party are under no circumstances reconcilable, especially after this afternoon. Just imagine, Sir, that an hon. member speaks here this afternoon about Bantu Administration and about verkramptes, in the same breath. See how bankrupt they are! They staked all their money on a split in the National Party, and now it is a question of sour grapes; they were mistaken. Sir, in 1948 the electorate of South Africa gave this Government a clear mandate, and that mandate is that distinctive separate development for the various population groups in this country should be implemented. That is the great mandate that was given to this side of the House.</p>

<p>Time and again at elections the electorate emphasized this in no uncertain terms. Now the hon. member says here this afternoon that the Nationalists no <span class="col_6467-6468" refersTo="page_0381"/>longer know what apartheid is and that it is not being implemented. I want to make this statement here to-day: What the policy of the National Party claims for the white man of South Africa, is undamaged survival here at the southernmost tip of the continent of Africa. The policy of the National Party must be implemented, regardless of what it may cost; it must be implemented since it is the only way to protect the white man here. The policy of the National Party does not only grant survival to the white man here on the southernmost tip of the continent of Africa, but also to the Bantu in South Africa. I do not wish to suggest that our policy is without difficult angles. In fact, it definitely involves some nagging problems. My plea is that we as Whites in South Africa should solve these nagging problems jointly. There were problems in the past and there will perhaps be greater problems in the future, but we as Whites must necessarily cope jointly with those problems which crop up and which will necessarily crop up in the future as well. This is a challenge to every white man in South Africa. From any individual, no matter to what political party he may belong, this requires greater things than mere politicking. If the United Party does not want to contribute its share towards thinking in terms of bigger things, then the National Party will, as it has done over the past 21 years, carry out this task on its own and do so in no uncertain manner.</p>

<p>Sir, permit me in the few minutes I have left to extend a special word of thanks to my predecessor in the office I hold to-day, i.e. that of Deputy-Chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission. It is with praise and appreciation that I want to bear witness on behalf of this side of the House to the great things he did while holding that office for many years. Along with him I want to mention the hon. member for Krugersdorp, who was a member of the Bantu Affairs Commission. We are expressing our appreciation for those services they rendered. Sir, you will also permit me, as newcomer to this Department, to tell you briefly what I found in this Department. Reference was made here to the late Dr. Verwoerd as the person who laid down this policy. Rather derogatory remarks were made here about the present hon. Minister, but I want to say this here this afternoon: It would be a good thing for any person who does not know this hon. Minister intimately, to make a point of improving his acquaintance with him, because we on this side of the House say that he has accepted this supreme task in the Republic of South Africa with devotion and with dedication. He does not permit himself any rest, by day or by night, in carrying out this task, and that is why I say that this task is in the hands of a good person. I cannot help mentioning in addition the two hon. Deputy Ministers who are assisting him. South Africa will thank them for the way in which they are carrying out this unenviable task of theirs, especially in view of the fact that one has to deal with an Opposition such as this one. I shall go further by telling the United Party and South Africa this afternoon that the Secretary for the Department and all his officials are people who are carrying out this difficult task with dedication. I am merely asking one thing in respect of these people who are working together as a team to carry out this difficult task, i.e. that the Opposition will take this into account and not come here with absurd arguments as the hon. member for Transkei did this afternoon.</p>

<p>It surprised me this afternoon that a Whip of the Government Party, a leader of a province, a Deputy-Chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission, could get up here and talk such nonsense. The hon. member contradicted his own Deputy Minister here. How can we understand the policy of the Government under these circumstances? The hon. member took it amiss of the hon. member for Transkei that he quoted figures here which had been mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Justice. According to him, we do not know what their policy is and so he presented the policy. On page 29 of his speech to the Rapportryers the hon. the Deputy Minister gave a complete exposition of the number of male and female Bantu in municipal locations, in compounds, in backyards and on white farms. According to these figures there are nearly 1½ million female Bantu on white farms. He then continued and made an analysis of who was working and who was not working, and eventually arrived at the conclusion that 3,800,000 people could be taken back to the Bantu areas; that is the number of appendages that could be taken back.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister said that progress and development <span class="col_6469-6470" refersTo="page_0382"/>must take into account the absorptive capacity of the Bantu. Of course, one can agree with that; naturally that has to be borne in mind. But who is there but the Whites of South Africa to expand and strengthen that absorptive capacity? It is not only on the question of policy that there are always contradictions among Government members; we even have it here. Members on that side are continually boasting about the number of properties and businesses, especially in the Transkei, which are being taken over from Whites by the Bantu, and then the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Education comes along and gets carried away by the idea that industrialists should quickly apply to establish industries on the agency basis, otherwise they are going to be left behind. At the same time the hon. the Minister tells us that the agency basis is not a new policy. It is an old policy, in contrast to what was stated by the hon. member for Transkei. If it is an old policy, as the hon. the Minister says, and there is such a rush, as the hon. the Deputy Minister says, how much money has already been invested in the homelands on this agency basis? After all, under these circumstances it must be a substantial amount. Surely there must be results. But we all know, Sir, that there are difficulties, even with the border area benefits. As we pointed out in a previous debate, there are difficulties even for the white border areas. The benefits are not adequate. It is interesting to note what is said in the report of the Xhosa Development Corporation, in which specific reference is made to the concessions which are offered there. I have the English report here. They say, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">The approved concessions of the Government on the basis of those applicable to border areas will not provide sufficient assistance. In the opinion of the corporation additional concessions, such as lower transport tariffs and tax reductions, will be necessary in order to create competitive industries in the homelands with those in the white areas, and to encourage and attract white entrepreneurs within the framework of Government policy.</block>

<p>Surely this is the agency basis of which we hear so much. More benefits are being envisaged. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister what benefits he is envisaging? What are the provisions going to be? What are the restrictions going to be? What is the norm he is going to apply? Because you see, Sir, it is no use saying that industrialists should apply and that there applications will be considered on merit. The people do not know what they should do. They do not know what the possibilities are. Only if that position is made known, is advertised, so that industrialists may know whether it is an attractive proposition or not, can they decide what can be done. Notwithstanding everything that had been said, Dr. Eiselen said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">For heaven’s sake get a move on. What does it matter if you are too impetuous, because it will also give your Government the strength and the courage to tackle this vital matter with zeal and courage, without which its policy can never succeed. Your minor blunder will not ruin anything.</block>

<p>Sir, we all know that the concept &#x201C;more rapid development&#x201D; implies a great deal. We realize it. There are all kinds of economic activities. But even here there must be a list of priorities. It will be so much easier if, for example, the number of workers for whom employment opportunities have to be provided are properly trained. If we do not do that&#x2014;the Government is in fact not doing enough in this regard at the moment&#x2014;then we are only creating a reservoir of unplaceable unemployed persons. We are living in a technological age to-day. That has been said many times. The development that is taking place and the continual demand for productivity are leading to more and more mechanization and automation. We are encountering this position to an increasing extent in every undertaking, in every industry. That is why employees are being replaced by machines; not only that, but a smaller number of employees are required to look after one machine. Coupled to that there is the fact that the one remaining to look after the machines has to be a skilled worker. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for King William’s Town got himself into a corner by quoting the statement, &#x201C;Please move&#x201D;, from the Eiselen Report. This is precisely what the United Party should do. It should get a move on. But it cannot get a move on because the Party’s wheels will no longer turn. They are no longer being greased. They have seized up. In fact, the Party has shrunk or dwindled away virtually to nothingness. They always refer to verkramptheid as something from which we allegedly are suffering. In view of that I think it has become necessary for us to investigate to some extent where real verkramptheid is to be found. What is political verkramptheid? They constantly relate verkramptheid&#x2014;the hon. member for Transkei again tried to do so&#x2014;to the philosophy of the Government in respect of its policy of separate development. I think it has become necessary for us to ascertain who in the composition of this House really is verkramp. With reference to this matter I should like to make the statement, because I am sick and tired of this, that in the political development of South Africa there has never been a more explicit example of verkramptheid than that we have in the United Party. I believe that future political historians <span class="col_6471-6472" refersTo="page_0383"/>will confirm my statement that the Opposition is merely the attenuated appendage of the old U.P. or S.A.P. verkramptheid. With regard to references made by hon. members to the events of the past few days, I just want to say that in reality the small number of immature, wet-behind-the-ears authors of smear letters and articles in <i>Veg</i> is nothing but an insignificant verkrampte ally which that large verkrampte Party has gained in their struggle against the Government. That is all. The definition of verkramptheid which they want to apply to us is in fact applicable to them. What else is verkramptheid but a chronic tendency or disease in persons, organizations and parties to cling desperately to outdated, impractical and obsolete customs, ideas, principles and philosophies?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in that case I regret that my interpretation of what is permissible on the Vote is incorrect. The United Party has no grounds on which it can attack us and cannot furnish any proof that we have not progressed with our policy in respect of separate development. They tried to prove that we were not succeeding in decreasing the numbers of Bantu concentrated in our urban areas and they tried to prove that we would not succeed in removing them through the implementation of our border area policy. But whatever argument they may advance, they will not succeed whatever may happen as their approach is in direct conflict with the policy of the National Party. The hon. member for King William’s Town said the implementation of our policy would require large sums of money. In other words, here we once again have the purely materialistic approach of the Opposition. They want to know what it will cost to implement our policy and how deeply South Africa will have to put its hand into its pocket to implement our policy of separate development. We have stated repeatedly that we do not ask the question, &#x201C;What will it cost South Africa to implement the policy?&#x201D;. With us it is merely a question whether we shall succeed and whether we shall be able, with the assistance of a united white nation, to implement a policy which will ensure the future of the white nation in South Africa. That is what the United Party cannot understand. That is why I have just tried to prove in a few words that the Opposition clings to verkrampte ideas. Surely it is an obsolete idea that one can bring together under one roof peoples with widely divergent and different cultures, languages and religions, politically and otherwise. We have sufficient proof from history that this does not work out satisfactorily. Even the Negroes in America to-day are aspiring to an identity of their own, not so? They want to get out from under the roof of integration, but the Opposition still wants to bring together under one roof the different peoples of South Africa. History proves that such a policy cannot succeed. Here in my notes I have these details, but the Chairman does not want to allow me to use them on this Vote. The colonial history of the Western European powers contains examples of attempts to pacify conquered nations by offering them political rights, for example, increasing political representation under one roof. That never succeeded. Even as long ago as the time of Alexander the Great the Greeks tried to do that after Alexander the Great had conquered the Persians. He told his soldiers, &#x201C;Marry the Persian girls&#x201D;. He himself took a Persian princess; his drastic plan did not work out. Even the Egyptians of Biblical times tried that with the Israelites. Even after 400 years when they tried to raise a fine young Israeli boy in their royal court they could not succeed. What did that boy do in the end? He led the Jews to their own freedom. The policy of integration and assimilation of the Pharaohs did not succeed. What the United Party is doing to-day is to cling to antiquated, verkrampte ideas of that nature. That is why it cannot make any progress. That is why they cannot make any headway, to use the words of Dr. Eiselen &#x201C;Do get a move on. Modernize your thinking. Wake up. You are asleep. You are clinging to an illusion which cannot succeed in practice in South Africa&#x201D;. Surely it is impossible. The idea of the Opposition of representation, under their policy of integration, in terms of which a qualified franchise will be given to the Bantu according to which they will first be represented by Whites and subsequently even by their own people in this House, is unacceptable <span class="col_6473-6474" refersTo="page_0384"/>and also in conflict with the tendency and the aspirations at present displayed by all non-Whites here and in the Black states of the whole of Africa. They are aspiring to an identity of their own. They want to be free. They want to get out from under the roof which the white colonial powers placed over them, no matter what equality there is under that roof. They want to avail themselves of opportunities over which they are acquiring authority in their own territories, in homelands of their own. That is the pattern of our policy, and it is a positive, progressive and enlightened policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the adherence of the Opposition to an idea which is an obsolete and impractical one in South Africa. It is their desire to bring together people who do not belong together, politically and otherwise, in terms of an obsolete idea. That proves the deep-rooted verkramptheid from which the United Party is suffering.</p>

In its midst it has people who differ with one another in principle, as I shall try to prove in the course of my speech.

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte wants to know who says that. I thought it was general knowledge, for this unity in their ranks has of late been shouted from the rooftops. But we have always told them that where there is large-scale apartheid, there is no development; and where there is development, there is no large-scale apartheid. We have always said that there should be development in South Africa. But what do we find now? We are getting support from a most unexpected region, as my hon. friend for Transkei has just proved. I want to emphasize this point a little more, because from the region of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Justice and Planning we have received the greatest support possible in this regard. He said: &#x201C;Of course, it is also true that we need these labourers just as they need us, and I want to submit for your consideration the idea that without this labour we shall not be able to maintain a 5 per cent growth rate in our economy.&#x201D; He went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Without this economic growth rate it is impossible for us to finance, in particular, our policy of separate development itself.</block>

<p>That is what he said. He is trying to evade the fact that large-scale apartheid has therefore failed completely, i.e. by sending back to the reserves all of those who are not working. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is really his policy that everybody who works inside the so-called white area has to come here on this basis of migratory labour? If this is in fact the case, I should also like to know whether he thinks he is acting in accordance with the views held by the best amongst the thinking Afrikaners? But I said that we found in the Nationalist Party at present that there were conflicting opinions in regard to matters of principle. I want to quote further from the speech made by the Deputy Minister of Planning where he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These are sober facts which I want to submit for the consideration of the presentday new-fangled armchair politicians who are supposedly in such a hurry now to implement our policy of separate development.</block>

<p>No, of 1958. I can show you the clipping. They went on to say that this would happen if we were serious about this policy and if this was not merely an empty slogan.

We were told how close the co-operation between the Nationalist Party and its newspapers was and how they went hand in hand.

I should like to ask the hon. the Minister which of these two policies he supports. I shall listen attentively to hear what he replies to that.</p>

<p>Or rather, to be thanked for it. Judging by the chorus of voices I hear, I can conclude that this is also the view of the hon. members on the other side. But that is not true. Does Rhodesia have a policy of separate development? Do the Portuguese have a policy of separate development? Rhodesia is a country which has a much higher ratio of non-Whites to Whites than we have; they are locked in a struggle with, one can almost say, the whole world. World sanctions have been introduced against Rhodesia; they are a small country but they do not have this policy. Who would say that they have less peace, calm and order than we have? Who can say that? This is, in other words, an argument which does not hold water. The same applies to the Portuguese territories. Surely, they do not have this policy. I do not want to go into the reasons why we still have peace and order in this country; that is a long story, but any Nationalist who wants to claim that the prevailing calm and order is the result of their policy, is simply not propagating the truth.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to the hon. the Minister himself. This hon. Minister often wants to make us believe that their policy is being accepted whereas ours is not. To-day I do not want to go into the matter of whether or not our policy is being accepted by the Bantu; I only want to confine myself to the question of whether or not the policy of the Government is being accepted by the Bantu in South Africa. The hon. the Minister will probably not suggest that the Opposition in the Transkei accepts it, and I do not think that he can furnish any evidence to prove that the urbanized Native accepts it. I think his statement is based purely on the fact that the Party of Kaiser Matanzima does apparently accept the movement towards independence. However, there are no grounds for such a statement. The Government of the Transkei take what they are offered, but they are also asking for much more. Who can say that this is an acceptance of the Government’s policy? They have already told us that they demand much more land and that their people should be granted permanent rights in our cities. As has already been said, they do not only demand that they should be on their own, but they demand that they should now be able to introduce a federation system for themselves. They demand changes in the Pass Laws; they are quite opposed to the fact that they can be sent back to their own areas. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the Transkei is willing to accept these resettlement towns, which he is now establishing in the Ciskei and at other places where they have not yet reached the stage of development the Transkei has?

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pinelands, who has just resumed his seat, put numerous questions to the Minister and I think the Minister will reply to them. However, I should also like to say a few words about them. The hon. member asked whether it was the policy of the Government for the entire Bantu labour force in South Africa to consist of migratory labourers only. I believe that state of affairs will never be possible, but if that could have been the case, it would have been the happiest and finest state of affairs ever. An example of an industry we have managed to run with migratory labour from its very earliest days, is the mining industry. The Bantu live in their compounds and we have never experienced any problems with them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>There are young Bantu as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_jager">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. R. DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>With young Bantu one may perhaps have more problems than with the old ones. It would be much safer to get the old ones only than it would be to get the young ones. We have never had any problems with them. Therefore I think that if this were a matter which had been settled and if it were possible to attract all our labour from the homelands under the system of migratory labour, that would have been the best system. The hon. member also asked what our policy was in respect of matters affecting numbers. It is our very policy to make as much use as possible of migratory labour and to the extent to which that is practicable. The hon. member for King William’s Town mentioned here what the hon. the Deputy Minister had allegedly said in connection with agencies. The United Party is never prepared to go about something from the bottom up. It is an extraordinary thing that the hon. member did not simply say at the same time that we should introduce white capital and white initiative into the homelands, which is their policy, but we shall probably hear that before long. I can only tell the hon. member that as far as agencies are concerned, and according to information we have at the moment, there were as many as 90 mining concessions in the Bantu homelands quite some time ago. The difference simply is that the National Party realizes that it has to start its <span class="col_6477-6478" refersTo="page_0386"/>policy of separate development in the homelands from the bottom up and not from the top down. It should not be done by introducing white capital, for example. If we were to introduce white capital, it would mean that Whites would be undertaking the development in the homelands and that the Bantu would be and remain no more than workers. The Bantu cannot develop their territory in that way nor will they be developing themselves. That is why it is the policy of the Government to develop those homelands from the bottom up. What is more, this will not be such a rapid process. In spite of the fact that the development of the homelands will take longer if it is undertaken by the Bantu themselves, they must do that themselves so that they themselves may develop their homes and their territories. This is the only way in which that can be done. In the first place we must have regard to the fact that the homelands in the Republic consist of approximately 260 small areas and black spots. These areas must be consolidated and developed. We must accept that the economic potential of some is greater than that of others, but all of them, without exception, are typically under-developed areas.</p>

<p>It is on this basis that development has to take place. The homelands are poor. According to the 1959-’69 estimate, the gross geographic product of the homelands of the Republic was R105 million, which represents a mere 2.3 per cent of the total gross domestic product of the Republic. Therefore one can see how poor and undeveloped the homelands are. To pump in capital and not do anything more and for the Whites to develop these territories will not be of any real help. We must start from the bottom so as to develop the Bantu themselves. The question of policy was mentioned, but the National Party does have its policy. In the Transkei approximately 85 per cent of the economic activities of the Bantu are in the field of agriculture and forestry. Therefore it is an excessively low productivity which prevails in that territory, and for that reason the Government has laid down its policy to develop those homelands. In fact, development in four directions has been laid down.</p>

<p>The first direction in which development will take place in these territories is in the field of agriculture. In the history of the world this was the first kind of development and therefore it should also be the first in the homelands. In the second place the development of trade and industries should be undertaken by the Bantu themselves and through the corporations. I do not have the time to go into these corporations now. Even the United Party knows of these corporations which are in existence and of the way in which they are being developed so that subsequently they may be handed to the Bantu themselves. In the third place the academic and technical training of the Bantu is important. A fourth important aspect is the establishment of industries in border areas. In order to illustrate what progress the Government has made in this direction, I want to mention the fact that a five-year plan is drawn up each time. In 1961 R114 million was spent. For the next five-year plan an amount of R491 million was budgeted in 1966. This shows us what progress has been made in this connection.</p>

<p>My time is very limited, but I should like to refer to one further matter and that is education and technical training. These have been changed for the Bantu in the homelands and, in general, also for the Bantu outside the homelands. In 1948 R2&#x00BC; million was spent on education. In 1967 R30 million was spent. In 1952 there were 814,000 schoolchildren and in 1967 2,100,000. At the time when I obtained this information there were 8,000 State-controlled schools in the Republic of South Africa for the Bantu. There are three university colleges, 42 training colleges for teachers, 5 agricultural colleges and 36 centres for technical training and the training of artisans. When one has regard to these things as well as to the progress made over the past few years in the homelands and as far as the Bantu in general are concerned, it ought to be clear even to the United Party, and they ought to realize, that it is a senseless question to ask, &#x201C;What is your policy?&#x201D; If in the course of these 21 years the United Party has been unable to grasp or learn the principles of the policy of separate development of the National Party, hon. members opposite should not put such questions to the hon. the Minister. Furthermore, he has told them these things so many times and if it has not sunk in yet, I think it is time they simply forgot about it and realized that they will never understand the policy of the National Party. I think it is either beyond their powers of comprehension or otherwise they do not want to understand it because they are afraid of this policy. As has already been mentioned, they have had the experience that this policy of the National Party has diminished their numbers to such an extent that they are so &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D;, as the hon. member said, that soon there will be nothing left of them.

<p>Members of the Control Board are appointed exclusively on the strength of their ability, by virtue of the diversity and nature of their knowledge and experience, to control the matters of the Corporation. Provincial origin as such is not taken into consideration, but it is understandably in the wider public interest that members should have knowledge of different parts of the country.

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a) 13th October, 1966.</li>

<li>(b) The Controller of Customs and Excise at Port Elizabeth (who has been on pension since the 1st October, 1968).</li>

<li>(c) On own authority and without the knowledge of the departmental Head Office.</li>

<li>(d) The terms of the instruction are mainly that all correspondence should be replied to in the language in which the original letter was written but that correspondence with Head Office and other departmental offices in connection with such matters should be conducted in Afrikaans.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) The only reference to disciplinary action may possibly be read in the proverbial sentence &#x201C;I would not like to see that the Secretary again cracks his whip in connection with this matter&#x201D;.</li>

<li>(3) As the contents of the relative instruction are considered to be a misconception of the spirit of previous circular letters to promote the use of the official languages, an instruction has now been issued for its immediate withdrawal. The main purpose of the appeal to officers in connection with the use of the official languages is reflected in the following extract from a departmental circular letter:<br/>&#x201C;Complaints are received from time to time from individual members of the staff that they are offered little opportunity of making use of the second official language&#x2014;Afrikaans in the case of the more English orientated customs work and English in the case of the more Afrikaans orientated excise work&#x2014;and thus they either cannot achieve proficiency in <span class="col_6485-6486" refersTo="page_0390"/>the second language or lose the fluency they possessed.<br/>In some circles it is strongly felt that the matter of the alternate use of the two languages should be insisted upon. Although this system has been in use for years in some departments, I am not convinced that it offers a permanent solution; the spontaneous use of a language is preferable.<br/>I, therefore, once again wish to appeal to every member of the staff, in his/her own interest as well as in the interest of fellow officers and in general, to see to it that both languages enjoy equal treatment.&#x201D;</li>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>However, I will come back to him a little later. I want to start off the debate to-day by discussing with the Minister the application of section 10 of the Bantu Urban Areas Act, the section under which Bantu qualify for residence in the so-called &#x201C;blankestan&#x201D;. In terms of this section, subsection (1) (a) allows such Bantu who have resided continuously in a prescribed area since birth to remain there. Subsection (1) (b) provides that any Bantu who has worked continuously for one employer for 10 years, or for various employers for a period of 15 years, can remain in the prescribed area, and subsection (1) (c) provides that such a Bantu may stay there if he or she is the wife or the minor child of any Bantu who qualifies under subsections (1) (a) or (b), and it continues to say &#x201C;after lawful entry into such prescribed area, ordinarily resides with such Bantu in that area&#x201D;. Now it is apparent from this that for a wife there are three main requisites with which she must comply to qualify to remain in a prescribed area. The husband must qualify, she must gain lawful entry, and she must ordinarily reside with her husband. It is the question of the application of these three provisions that I want to discuss particularly with the hon. the Minister if the hon. Whip will get out of the way so that I can at least get the attention of the hon. the Minister. Thank you.</p>

<p>I have here a particular case of a Bantu who was born and brought up in the prescribed area of Johannesburg, who has lived there all his life, and there is no question about his qualification to remain there. In January, 1967, he married a Bantu woman from, it so happens, Hammarsdale, who had grown up in the Pietermaritzburg area. In May, 1967, he went with his wife to Orlando; he reported to the Superintendent and applied for a house to occupy as a married couple. They were refused this permission and she was ordered to return to Natal and her reference book was endorsed accordingly, so now we have the position that the legally married wife of a husband born and legally resident in <span class="col_6489-6490" refersTo="page_0392"/>Johannesburg is refused permission to join him. This is the first point that I want to raise, namely the question of lawful entry. How does such a Bantu gain lawful entry? I wonder if the hon. the Minister would be so kind when he replies to this debate, as to elucidate this point because this is a factor which is causing tremendous hardship and trouble to these Bantu people. Is it the intention of the Department to say to a Bantu who qualifies under section 10 that he may only marry a female who qualifies under section 10? Because, Sir, trials under the Immorality Act have shown that you cannot tell people with whom they must cohabit, with whom they must live and whom they must marry. When you get down to dividing the people into those who qualify under section 10 and those who do not, then it becomes absolutely ridiculous. There is no need for me to remind the hon. the Minister of the cases which have been decided in court in this connection. Then there is also the question of &#x201C;ordinarily resides with&#x201D;. How does a bride show that she ordinarily resides with her husband without the sympathetic receipt or treatment of an application by the officials? I submit that what is happening to-day is that the hon. the Minister, through his Department by regulation, is circumventing the provisions of section 10 (1) (c) of the Act. The Act was placed on the Statute Book with the intention that these people should be given the humane consideration of allowing them to have their lawful wives in the prescribed areas, but by regulation, through his Department, this Minister is circumventing those provisions. The result is that we have what is developing in the townships around Cape Town in particular, as mentioned here yesterday by the hon. member for the Transkei. Sir, in every one of the areas where this section is stringently applied there is a shortage of domestic labour. The housewives of South Africa are also suffering because of the application of the regulations as applied by the hon. the Minister and his Department. I am sure that if this section of the Act was applied humanely, responsibly and in a sympathetic manner, the domestic servant problem need not be what it is to-day. I want to ask the Minister what would have been the position in Randburg. I notice that the hon. the Deputy Minister, who was directly concerned with this matter, is not in the House.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, Sir, I do not know whether I can hold it over. What would have been the position in Randburg where the housewives did not accede to certain requests made by the Deputy Minister with regard to domestic servants? I would like to know from the hon. the Minister what has happened at Oudtshoorn where I believe an instruction was issued that they were not to employ Bantu as domestic servants, even if they were qualified under subsections (1) (a) or (b), let alone if they qualified under subsection (1) (c). But, Sir, there is another aspect of this too and that is what is evolving amongst the Bantu people of South Africa to-day. At a recent conference of the National Council of African Women in Kimberley the national president decried the endorsing out of urban areas of African widows, divorcees and spinsters by the authorities. She went on to point out that amongst the Bantu people in this country there is the same trend to-day that there was amongst the white people a few years ago&#x2014;I am not going to say how many years ago&#x2014;where gradually the womenfolk were accepted as being the equal of the men, particularly when it came to the question of employment and taking their place and their stand alongside of their menfolk.

<p>I am not getting up to reply to anything that we have had from the United Party so far and that requires a reply, because in actual fact there is nothing to reply to yet, except the one remark that was made yesterday afternoon by the main speaker on the United Party side, i.e. the hon. member for Transkei, when he said: &#x201C;Nothing is happening in the homelands, and I challenge the Minister to prove the contrary.&#x201D; I shall certainly reply to this in the course of my speech. My real purpose in getting up is to express my disappointment at the trend taken by this debate so far after four United Party speakers participated in it, and speakers at that who are regarded as responsible speakers on that side, especially on Bantu affairs. I want to start with the hon. member for Transkei, who spoke for half an hour. How did he spend that half hour? He spent it by expressing his disappointment, which he could not hide and disguise, at no split having occurred in the ranks of the National Party.</p>

<p>This is what he spent his time on, and for the rest he read out the speech made by my colleague which was reported in the newspapers and which was circulated and commented on. Then he concluded with the foolish remark: &#x201C;Nothing is happening in the homelands.&#x201D; Sir, I want to draw your attention to the fact that in these Estimates provision is made for larger amounts than we have ever asked Parliament to vote. When you put this Vote yesterday afternoon, you said that you were putting Vote No. 30 on the Revenue Account, on which we are asking for R46,225,000. You also put Loan Vote N. on which we are asking for R59,100,000, and South-West Africa Vote 14, on which an amount of R12,674,000 is being asked. If my arithmetic is correct, this comes <span class="col_6491-6492" refersTo="page_0393"/>to a total amount of R117,999,000. Sir, when a Budget such as this is being discussed, one does expect a responsible Opposition to say: &#x201C;In this case too little is being spent; here the money is being spent unwisely, and there the money is being spent unwisely.&#x201D; One prepares oneself for a Budget debate in order to be able to furnish the necessary information on the various amounts asked for, and what does one get from that side? They come along with the story that there are &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D; and &#x201C;verligtes&#x201D; in this Party! Sir, how one can get the United Party to discuss this Budget I simply do not know. The hon. member for Klip River quite rightly said here that the gulf between our policy and theirs was so wide that we simply could not bridge it. The hon. member for Marico said quite rightly that the United Party had remained behind in this process, and that it did not know what was going on here in connection with Bantu development and the implementation of the policy of separate development in respect of the Bantu. The hon. member for Mayfair tried very hard to bring this debate back to the Budget, and this morning we had to hear the hon. member over there speaking about the leader of the National Party in Natal. Sir, he has enough difficulty about a leader. I understand that a certain strong young man is coming forward there. And then the hon. member talks here about a certain Bantu bride who could not gain admission to the urban areas. I want to return to the remark made by that hon. member &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will get his reply. The hon. member said that nothing was happening in the homelands. I could perhaps just have referred the hon. member to the speech made here by the hon. the Minister on 3rd February this year (Hansard, Col. 38). In that speech the hon. the Minister explained what was happening in the homelands. But perhaps it is necessary that I should give the Committee the figures again. If that hon. member compares the figures I am going to furnish in a moment, with the figures the Minister furnished on 3rd February, he can say again that the figures do not agree. They do not agree, because I have later figures than the hon. the Minister had. From these later figures it is clear that many things have happened in the homelands during the past year. Then the hon. member says: &#x201C;Nothing is happening in the homelands, and I challenge the Minister to prove the contrary.&#x201D; Sir, the data I am going to furnish do not include the Transkei, because the Transkei has its own government; the Transkei has its own Minister of Agriculture. The hon. member probably knows him.</p>

<p>The hon. member will also know what is happening there. He must have seen what is happening round Umtata. We leave the Transkei out of these calculations. Fifty-two per cent of the area of approximately 17 million morgen has already been planned. Here is the Minister of Agriculture, who is dealing with the planning of the white area of South Africa. He knows that planning plays an important part in the development programme. If you plan, you must carry out your planned programme, but it is a long and slow process. Twenty-one thousand miles of roads have been built, with 693 bridges. The hon. the Minister gave a lower figure in this connection. Sixty-four thousand miles of fences have been erected in this planning process in order to provide the necessary camps. In order to supply water, 6,000 boreholes have been sunk; 4,650 dams have been built, larger and smaller dams. The hon. member is welcome to go there with me one day, and then I shall show him those dams. I am not ashamed of the dams that have been built there, we have built fine dams there. Sir, the livestock are also being improved. Stock are no longer kept only to prove the status of the owner or for lobola purposes. We have taught the people there also to market their stock. We are building stock-fair pens there, and stock-fairs are being held. More than R2 million per annum is being collected from the sale of stock at these fairs. If we want to talk about contours and retaining walls &#x2026;</p>

You can give them figures on 3rd February, and you can give them the latest figures on 23rd May, but it is no use, because they simply do not want to know these things. Sir, more than 17.000 miles of contours have been built. Two thousand four hundred dipping tanks have been built. Eleven thousand morgen have been planted with trees for firewood, so that these people will not need to pick up dung-cakes, which should be used to fertilize their land and use them for the purpose of making fire. As regards irrigation land, 9,202 morgen have been added to the 15,267 morgen of 1960, with the result that there is approximately 25.000 morgen of irrigation land. The hon. member for Transkei shakes his head.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister spent 7½ of his ten minutes threatening to tell us about the development in the Bantu Homelands. For 7½ minutes he waffled around and around the point, and eventually, when he could not keep away any longer, he told us about the agricultural development in the Bantu homelands. I will deal with this matter in a moment and will come back to it, but I want to deal with the real development that is essential there. Before doing so, I want to deal with the earlier part of the debate. Yesterday the hon. member for Transkei completely shattered the whole illusion of Nationalist Party policy. He completely destroyed the illusion that the Government knew where it was going and that it had a clear policy. He showed the vaccilation and the conflicting and differing approaches of different hon. members including where one hon. Minister contradicted another. In reply the hon. member for Klipriver completely repudiated what was said by his own Deputy Minister. That was the sole attempt to reply. When we now have a Deputy Minister speaking, what do we get? A lot of waffle and no reply to the charges by hon. members on this side of the House. The Deputy Chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission tried to make an emotional rallying speech here, but what were the facts he dealt with? His one point that he tried to make was that Bantu wives and children were allowed on the farms. Where do the wives and children come from in the Weenen squatters camp, the emergency camp? Are they not taken off the farms? Are they not taken off the town lands? That was the hon. member’s sole contribution. What he did prove yesterday was that the Verligtes were right in Natal in wanting the hon. the Minister for Foreign Affairs as a leader. They would have done much better and he only proved the correctness of that campaign. He also proved that he does not know his own constituency. I want to come back to the hon. the Deputy Minister’s speech in a moment.</p>

<p>Next week we will have 21 years of Nationalist Government. That is usually an occasion for celebrations. We usually have parties and give people a key. [Interjections.] Last year they had celebrations&#x2014;flop ones&#x2014;but this year how &#x201C;tjoepstil&#x201D; it is. Where are the celebrations? Instead of celebrating we find them mourning around the deathbed of the whole apartheid policy. They are mourning around that deathbed and quarreling over the spoils of office while mourning the death of their own policy. How has the wheel not turned! Is this the party who used to call the United Party &#x201C;Kafferboeties&#x201D;? This is the party that called us ‘Kafferboeties&#x201D;. Now we are the &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; party. The hon. member for Marico yesterday said that the Nationalist party is a progressive and a verligte party. [Interjections.] But what are the facts? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister said he was going to tell us about the homelands. I have done a little study on the subject and have here for instance the publication <i>Bantu</i> of April, 1969. This is the official magazine and it sets out all the progress that has been made in respect of the economic growth of the homelands. Incidentally, I notice a very nice picture in this publication and I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister recognizes it. It shows children at school and the caption is that there are 493 schools in the Ciskei. Is this a Ciskei school that is illustrated here?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>He does not know. That picture appeared in the publication <i>Bantu</i> but if the hon. the Deputy Minister looks at the <i>Bantu Education Journal</i> of May this year, he will find exactly the same photo. This was not in the Ciskei, however, but at the Bantu College of Taung. They do not even have enough photos. They have one which they have to cart around like a mobile education policy. Their mobile school that goes around to show off education, does not hide the facts. We read in the <i>Bantu Education Journal</i> that &#x201C;exciting progress has been made&#x201D;. The journal says the following:</p>

<block name="quote">During the latter part of 1968 we experienced three unforgettable events.</block>

<p>That was the establishment of three territorial authorities. When one reads further, however, one finds the following:</p>

<block name="quote">We should like to stress, however, that provision will have to be made for economic activity, so that avenues of employment are provided for the population. At present thousands of our men and women still go to the white areas to work there. However, <span class="col_6495-6496" refersTo="page_0395"/>the time must come when the homeland governments will say to the white Government: &#x201C;We are sorry. We would like to help you, but we no longer have workers to spare&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Where are these workers going to be? We find that according to the latest report of the Bantu Development Corporation, there has been tremendous progress, exciting progress. In ten years they have granted 795 loans, 553 trading licences including 21 liquor licences and new imaginative progress, namely one milk depot. There are 85 service industries and 15 industries. They have established in trust two furniture factories, three vehicle repair shops, three bakeries and one meat processing factory. On an agency basis a sawmill and a quarry have been established. This was established to deal with 12 million Bantu and with 80,000 new work seekers. These are new workers coming into the market to look for work each year. What have they established?&#x2014;21 liquor outlets and a milk depot and a handful of other businesses. To employ how many of the 80,000 new workers? According to the department the ideal of this exciting progress is to be able to say to white South Africa: We have no labour for you, because we are employing it all here. What do we hear about? A few dams and furrows and a few morgen of irrigation land? How many people is that keeping on the land in the Bantu homelands? To how many people can it give food, clothing and an existence? The Government is playing with the problem. I do not have the time to deal with the other aspects of it, but I want to mention that the cost of administration of the 795 loans of R3.9 million is R664,000. If we are going to get down to analysing the Budget, we are entitled to ask what South Africa is getting for the R664,000 administration for the R3.9 million of loans. How many people is it giving work to? How much is it contributing towards a viable economy in the homelands? That is the issue. The issue is whether the homelands have any hope of becoming viable enough to exist as separate independent states. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to thank the hon. member for Durban (Point) most sincerely for his display here this morning. It was apparently meant to be a farce and in that respect it succeeded. The comedian was good and we really hope that he will visit us again and give a display on a later occasion. The hon. member accused the hon. the Deputy Minister of having used his time to do certain things and then he went along and did precisely the same things himself, using a great deal of time to speak about the festivities of the National Party after 21 years. This gratifies us and we feel happy about it. We have no objection to the hon. member using his ten minutes to speak about that. At the end of his speech he asked certain questions which really amount to this: What is South Africa getting for the amounts being appropriated in these Estimates? The hon. member only has to look around him to see what South Africa is getting for it. In the first place, South Africa is getting a purely white Parliament for the amounts being appropriated here. These amounts are being appropriated for the establishment of separate development, and this is a state of affairs which we would no longer have had in South Africa to-day under the United Party’s policy, which yields so easily to pressure. However, I shall speak more about that on a later occasion.</p>

<p>The United Party is trying to create a psychosis in South Africa. They now have a new slogan, i.e. telling the people every day that apartheid is an illusion, that apartheid has not succeeded and that apartheid is failing. The method which is followed is typical of the United Party, i.e. to speak disparagingly of what is being done to create growth points, as has already been mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister. They make disparaging remarks in their speeches when it suits them to do so. When they go to the constituents they will tell them what large amounts this Parliament is appropriating for the development of the Bantu homelands. Then they will tell the constituents, as they also do at every by-election and general election in the country districts, where it suits them to do so, about the large amounts which this Government is appropriating for the promotion of separate development. This cry of &#x201C;look what they are doing for the Bantu&#x201D; is very specifically intended to create an unfavourable climate, and the hon. members of the Opposition are thereby not doing South Africa a service. Hon. members opposite also want separate development in South Africa, even though they may be led here by the strong liberal and more progressive element and by the more leftist trends of thought in their party&#x2014;they are all leftist, but some are more leftist than others. I want to state that the Opposition will achieve as little in the future as they have in the past. The most important facet of the National Party’s policy, with which this House must concern itself, will continue to be the regulating of relationships between the peoples in South Africa. It was historically decreed that we should have many peoples in this country in which we are living.</p>

<p>The hon. member is at liberty to juggle with words if he wants to, and he must decide to what &#x201C;nation&#x201D; or to what people he belongs. We say that there is more than one people in South Africa and I assume that the hon. member claims that there is only one people and only one nation in South Africa. Apparently he is a member of that people of 18 million here in South Africa, as some of his leaders have already said. However, this is a mere splitting <span class="col_6497-6498" refersTo="page_0396"/>of hairs and a juggling with words. We are aware of this and as long as this is so it will be the first great and primary task of this Government to appropriate funds for the regulation of these relations among the various peoples. In 1948 this Government, which has now been sitting here for 21 years, received two great mandates. One was to lead South Africa constitutionally towards an independent Republic. This mandate was carried out, to the joy and happiness of everyone, the prophets of doom included. The second great mandate which we received was to bring about apartheid in South Africa, to introduce and to promote separate development. In those days such a thing did not exist. But under the National Party we have come a long way with this, except for the Rip van Winkels in South Africa who do not want to know better and who prefer to take a political nap, who prefer a political narcosis and will remain in that condition until they wake up with a start one day. In the meantime we are giving their children and descendants in South Africa a viably white South Africa. Hon. members opposite will continue to criticize the amounts which we are appropriating here, amounts for the promotion of separate development. But we get a lot out of it. The cost aspect is of less importance to me than the aspect of principle. Now hon. members must not go and announce outside that this party says that the cost aspect is not important. All I am saying is that it is less important than the aspect of principle. Therefore we do not mind what we are going to pay in rands and cents, as long as we can thereby give a white homeland to the white man. I want to emphasize that every cent that we spend for promotion of separate development is spent in the interests of the white man in South Africa. Let hon. members opposite get up and contradict this.</p>

<p>We are already reaping the benefits of this policy of separate development. In the field of education our children are already enjoying those benefits; we are already enjoying the benefits in our transport services, and hon. members opposite are also making use of that; we are already reaping the benefits in the residential sphere, because we removed the black spots and created viable conditions for the white man, in the western suburbs of Johannesburg, for example. But at the same time we also created viable conditions for the Bantu in Soweto and Meadowlands. At the time we were criticized, but to-day we are all reaping the benefits, and we do not begrudge it to the United Party either. Besides, we are also enjoying the benefits of separate development through job reservations; we are enjoying the privilege of land ownership, the privilege of having South Africa occupied by Whites only.</p>

They have come with a new scheme, with a new concept of living, with the concept of separate independent states in which the Bantu people of South Africa must live. Meanwhile every member on this side of the House has pointed to the impracticability, to the impossibility, to the lack of realism of the theoretical policies of the Government. We have shown that what South Africa needs is a new look at this problem. Because what has happened? That hon. member talked of 21 years of Government policy &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, you referred to it just now when you said that in that 21 years you made South Africa safe for the white man. And yet there are to-day more Bantu in white South Africa than ever under a United Party government. And this figure is growing by the year; they cannot stop it. The only difference is that members opposite pretend that these Bantu are not here; they draw lines on the map and say those are the homelands; so the Bantu are not here anymore. They take Kwa Mashu, draw a line and say this is now a Bantu reserve and, consequently, there are no longer any blacks in white South Africa. They take Umlazi and in spite of the fact that the Bantu work in Durban, they say they are no longer within white South Africa. It is all nonsense; it is crazy. The fact is that there are more Bantu in white South Africa to-day than ever before, and they are still growing. We claim that the Government cannot stop it. The difference is that by pretending the Bantu are not there &#x2026;</p>

<p>Oh! But the report says that it is being carried out. So, how can the Government be carrying out a report which has not even been completed yet?

[Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, here we have an example of the planning of this Government&#x2014;a report which has been finalized and already being put into effect, and yet the Deputy Minister responsible does not even know about it! But I want to ask him to make it available to us. Because what is being done? The report of the Xhosa Development Corporation said that the Corporation had investigated a number of projects. There was an investigation into the possibility of developing coal deposits in the Transkei. Well, I have just marked it &#x201C;n.b.g.&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words, no future. Then tests were carried out in connection with phormium tenax. There are prospects of manufacturing bags; so the Xhosa Development Corporation is taking over the decorticating plant from the Bantu government of the Transkei. There is one successful industry, i.e. a Bantu beer brewery with a capacity of 2¼ million gallons per annum, a number of beer halls and one hotel. These appear to be successful. A bulk fuel depot was investigated but here they have struck problems. They have investigated sea products but that is also &#x201C;n.b.g.&#x201D;&#x2014;there is no future in it. Then there is an industrial site at Butterworth where they have done well. They have used 250 local Bantu labourers to build roads manually, by hand, because there is a drought in Butterworth.</p>

<p>You said they had their own Minister. This is how the Xhosa Development Corporation ends its report, and remember this is this Minister’s baby, not ours. Under the heading &#x201C;General remarks&#x201D; it says:</p>

<block name="quote">While satisfactory progress has been made in the tertiary sector where steadily increasing numbers of Bantu are being established as entrepreneurs and as managers of trading and other businesses, the tempo of development in the secondary sector is understandably slower than in the established industrial areas and in the primary sector, i.e. in agricultural production, under existing conditions, no appreciable advance is noticeable.</block>

<p>Elsewhere, however, they say that before you can have industrial development, you must have agricultural development, that the infrastructure must be agricultural. Yet this report says there is no progress. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It seems clear that the economic development of the area should rest largely on agricultural and livestock production, but agriculture, in all its aspects, is not a productive industry at present.</block>

<p>Here, in their own report, they condemn their own policy. I say again, this quoting of a few miles of furrows and fences and of a few morgen of irrigation is not an answer to our claim that under the Government’s policy Bantustans cannot house their own people. Under this policy they cannot house the Bantu in the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klip River knows about the Msinga reserve. Last year I went there. There is not even sand left; erosion has bared the rocks.

<p>That hon. member has said that there is no development. He should listen to what a certain Mr. Dennis Bradley said in an article &#x201C;Border industry, the quiet revolution&#x201D;, which appeared in <i>The Star</i> of Monday, 17th February. 1969. He is assuredly not a Nationalist. Mr. Bradley said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is in the throes of a quiet revolution. This is subtly changing the economic life of the country, and in the long run will affect everybody. Spearheading this transformation scene are South African and overseas businessmen and entrepreneurs, usually the most conservative men in the community and vehemently opposed to any change.</block>

<p>He continues by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since June, 1960&#x2014;when border industry planning came into being&#x2014;well over 300 White-run businesses have expanded their activities on the boundaries of the African homeland or set up new ventures there.</block>

<p>This man said this and it was published in one of the English newspapers. Nevertheless, hon. members of the Opposition say that there is nothing. I also want to go further and quote from <i>Die Vaderland</i> of 24th February, 1969. Under the heading &#x201C;Undertakings of young Tswana’s flourish with State assistance&#x201D; the following report appeared (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the assistance of the Bantu Investment Corporation 100 business undertakings have already been established in Tswanaland and a capital expenditure of more than R2.5 million.</block>

<p>Do hon. members expect it all to happen overnight as in the fairytale &#x201C;Alice in Wonderland&#x201D;? No, just as the hon. members of the Opposition said that the border areas would not develop, while to-day they have to concede that there is excellent development, so they will have to concede in the future that our homelands are also developing. But I <span class="col_6503-6504" refersTo="page_0399"/>think that I have now said enough about this subject.</p>

<p>I want to make a very positive contribution this morning. Since we are now in the third phase, developing the homelands, I want to plead with the hon. the Minister about a certain matter in this connection. There are many industries to-day which are desirous of going to the homelands on an agency basis. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to institute another system of planning so that it will not be necessary for these industrialists to go to all the various Government Departments in order to find out from one of them what he can do there, or to ask another whether he can obtain transport concessions, or what he can do in connection with the training of his labourers in that area and what the wage determinations would be. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to establish a super division consisting of one person. This person must be able to advise the Minister on how to get these people to the homelands as soon as possible. Every assistance must be given to these industrialists who are desirous of going to our homelands. I should like to see the day when we only have to go to one Department and can obtain all the information there. I want to plead for the abolition of the tremendous number of forms which these people have to fill in and which they then have to return to the Department. These people must be assisted, because they want to go there. I want to tell hon. members that there are several industrialists who are very anxious to go there. This morning I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that this red tape which we have in our Government Departments should be totally eliminated and that these people should be helped.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to another matter. I want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister this morning. In urban areas to-day we find that tremendous friction occurs at bottlestores where Bantu beer is sold. The Bantu flock to the bottle-stores between one and two o’clock, when it is their lunch time, to buy their beer. Then they take the beer back to the industrial area and drink it there, or they merely drink it on the pavements. This is creating tremendous friction in our white areas. I now want to plead with the hon. the Deputy Minister, who is handling this matter, for registered Bantu eating houses to be allowed in the industrial complexes in order that Bantu beer may be sold to the Bantu with their meals. I am prepared to say that the strictest conditions must be imposed in such cases. I concede that those Bantu eating houses must not serve beer after 5 o’clock in the afternoon, because then the Bantu must return to his home. I know of the difficulties we had with the Mai-Mai Bantu beerhall in Johannesburg, but we do not want to create such a situation. In addition I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to consider the possibility of erecting decent beerhalls within the industrial complexes, beerhalls which would be under the control of the local authorities, so that the Bantu can buy their beer there and drink it under supervision instead of running to the bottle-store each time to buy beer and then returning quickly and drinking it at work. The Bantu will not give up his beer and therefore we must create a situation under which he can get it when he wants it, in circumstances other than those prevailing at present. If this were to be done much less friction would develop between the white man and the black man at our bottle-stores.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Brakpan will have to pardon me if I do not follow him up, because he devoted the greater part of his speech to representations to the Minister. We can agree with him to a large extent. Where the hon. member spoke of the wonderful progress we have made with the apartheid policy, however, I want to differ with him. If his interpretation of progress is that a permit or a licence is issued to every Bantu who belongs in another area, and they are then regarded as migratory labourers, then I suppose there has been progress, because then there can be millions and millions more Bantu in urban areas. However, this is not what this side of the House considers to be progress in connection with separate development.</p>

<p>However, I should like to revert to a statement that was made by the hon. member for Klip River yesterday and in regard to which I fully agree with him. The hon. member for Klip River made the statement that there was a gulf between the National Party and this side of the House which is becoming virtually unbridgeable. I readily agree. The gulf is so wide that it is unbridgeable, and I shall tell hon. members what the reason for this is. The further this National Party continues with the development of its apartheid policy, the wider the gulf becomes. It cannot be otherwise. I want to add this to what the hon. member for Klip River said. This gulf is caused not only by the race relations, but also by the political relations between the white races in this country. [Interjections.] Oh yes, the gap is widening, because the stronger the Nationalist Party becomes, the more arrogant it becomes in its actions and the more it adopts the attitude that the only way in which there can be unity between the white races in the country is under the umbrella of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>I go further. The fact that this Party has remained in power for so long is unhealthy for the country. The fact that it has remained in power for so long and is now becoming so arrogant in its actions causes its actions in connection with the nonwhite races to be of such a nature that this Party could never agree with it. This apartheid policy, these developments, are the foundation stones on which the policy of the National Party rests in connection with the Bantu alone; they have no policy for the other non-white races. The policy for the Bantu is the establishment of separate sovereign Bantu states. Or is this no longer the policy? [Interjections.] It seems to me it is no longer the policy. Is this the answer? [Interjections.] According to the hon. member who is shouting over there, it seems to me this is no longer the policy.</p>

<p>But, Sir, it is fundamental to the policy of that Party that sovereign independent Bantu states should be created. They want to have the rest of the world believe that they are giving the Bantu a pass, or a certificate, or a passport, to the effect that he belongs to a country which is independent and sovereign, and because that is the position, this must always remain the policy of that Party, or the whole thing would collapse like a pack of cards in so far as the image they want to hold up to the outside world is concerned. Proceeding on that assumption, and I take it that it is correct, notwithstanding the mumbling of that hon. member opposite, I say that that fragmentation of the country cannot be accepted by this Party. I therefore agree with the hon. member for Klip River that the gulf is becoming wider and wider. It is unhealthy for any country in the world that the viewpoints of its people in connection with race relations, and the political relations between the white races should drift further and further apart. If this is not unhealthy, I do not know what it is, but do not put the blame for that on this Party. It is not our doing. The policy that Party is trying to follow in connection with race relations is creating the position that there is no longer a bridge between us.</p>

<p>I want to return to the situation of the Bantu, which was also mentioned by the hon. member for Klip River and by the Deputy Minister. It is claimed that success is being achieved with the removal of the Bantu. But there are still 3.8 million left, and the hon. member for Klip River declared emphatically yesterday that we misunderstood the position; these 3.8 million do not come from the farms. He said: &#x201C;Oh no, the hon. member for East London (North) will always have his Bantu families on his farm.&#x201D; The hon. member should get up again and tell me where those 3.8 million are. We are not prepared to accept this summarily. But let me return to the development of the Bantustans, and especially of the Transkei and the Ciskei, which the Deputy Minister dealt with. I also want to deal with the report of the Xhosa Development Corporation, which deals with this development. I wish I had the time to discuss the development the hon. members always ridicule us about, saying that we are against the development of the border areas. In all fairness, Sir, is there any area in South Africa for the decentralization of industries which is more deserving than the East London area, that area which is wedged in between that mass of people?</p>

<p>Has that port lagged behind, or has it not? From the nature of the case this is one of the areas which should be developed, and that is so in terms of the mass of people who are starving in the Transkei and the Ciskei at this stage&#x2014;and do not tell me I am exaggerating. Having had a drought such as they have had, and having no maize, and having lost a third of their livestock through the drought in the Transkei and the Ciskei, are they not worse off now than they have ever been during the past 20 years? And if they are worse off, and the rehabilitation of those areas is to take such a long time, is this not the area to which more attention and more assistance should be given, both on the borders and within the area itself? And what does the report say about the area? If one looks at the series of industries which have been established there and which were mentioned by the hon. member for Point a moment ago, it is such a small one, but do not let me belittle it; it is an attempt, it is a beginning. At least it is getting somewhere. But what does the report say?</p>

<p>The report says they tried to help them in agriculture, and have been doing so for years by means of extension officers, but despite the sustained and untiring devotion and the zeal of the officers concerned, the yield is below the potential of the area, and below that of comparable areas in the Republic. Consequently the establishment of industries founded on agricultural production is not progressing as rapidly as is desirable. And so the report goes on to say repeatedly that agriculture is lagging behind and that for that reason the industries are lagging behind, and the major problem is transport, which is also lagging behind. In other words, both outside and inside the area there is not the kind of progress that could absorb the population there, and what do we find? Still more of them are being taken there, and here I want to give especially the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development another opportunity of telling me again what he said by way of interjection the other day, i.e. that people are not being transported there irrespective of whether they are prepared to go or not. A pretty picture is held up to <span class="col_6507-6508" refersTo="page_0401"/>them, and then they are loaded in and transported to those areas like cattle.</p>

<p>I gained the impression from the hon. member for East London (City) that he was blaming the National Party for the fact that it has been in power for 21 years. I do not think that is fair, if I understood him correctly. I think that, in the first place, he must blame the South African electorate for that, and in the second place, he must seek the fault in the United Party. It is a compliment for the National Party rather than criticism.</p>

<p>Sir, I realize that as a person who has spent 35 years outside the borders of South Africa, I should not venture lightly upon matters of detail such as those which have been raised in this debate. I therefore want to confine myself more to a few general standpoints which have been adopted here by the United Party. The first aspect to which I want to refer is that, in my opinion, the general standpoint is being adopted that the policy of separate development has already failed or is in the process of failing. From personal experience I want to say that in South-West Africa, where this same policy is being implemented by this same Minister, it is achieving remarkable success. If I think of what our experience was only four or five years ago in respect of the Bantu tribes in that territory, and I think of what their attitude is to-day in respect of the acceptance of this policy, and the progress which has already been made in the application of this policy, then it is succeeding; and this is what is necessary. It is highly desirable, although perhaps not essential, to obtain the co-operation of those people who are so intimately involved in the implementation of this policy. I do not think it can be said that because there are more Bantu in the white areas to-day than there were 25 years ago under the United Party regime, this policy is failing; by the same token the National Party could turn round and say that if it had not been for this policy there would perhaps have been four or five times more Bantu in those areas to-day than there are. I therefore do not think that this is an argument which can simply be accepted.</p>

<p>Another argument to which I want to refer briefly and which was also raised here yesterday by one or more of the hon. members opposite, relates to the economic considerations. I accept that the economic considerations cannot simply be disregarded, but I venture to suggest that the implementation of this policy must not be made completely dependent upon economic trends. I accept that adjustments will be necessary, adjustments on the economic side and also, possibly, in respect of the implementation of the policy and the speed with which it is carried through. But I think that it is dangerous to make it dependent upon purely economic considerations. If we look at the regulation of relations between population groups to-day, what does it cost? Sir, if you will allow me to draw this comparison, what does the regulation of harmonious relations between the two white language groups. English and Afrikaans speaking, cost the taxpayer of South Africa? But we raise no objection to that, because that money is being applied for the purposes of ensuring the unity which there ought to be and for the sake of the prosperity of this country, and the same applies here. If we look at what racial clashes in various countries are costing the world, we find it to be millions of rands, and it is not only a question of the money, but also of the precious lives that are lost. Must we then try to make this policy subject to economic considerations alone?</p>

<p>There is another general argument which is raised, and that is that the National Party is bluffing and misleading the South African electorate in respect of the implementation of this policy. The hon. member on my right says &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. If it were true that a political party could bluff and mislead the electorate for 21 years and in five general elections, what is one to think of that electorate? And the United Party claims to be the party which places its confidence in the Whites of South Africa. If they have no confidence in the judgment and the powers of discrimination of the white electorate, how can they have confidence in the Whites? These are two standpoints which are not reconcilable.</p>

<p>During the by-election in Windhoek the Opposition sent a speaker to Windhoek to help their friends in distress there, and it goes without saying that he spoke about Bantu policy. I want to refer briefly to what he said and relate it to the arguments which have been raised here. I assume that he is a responsible person, because one does not send an irresponsible person to help a friend in distress. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a recent debate Minister M. C. Botha said that the Natives accept his policy. Every session it is stated that more must be spent on the Natives.</block>

<p><span class="col_6509-6510" refersTo="page_0402"/>Here we heard of a Bantu policy which had failed completely or which is no policy at all! The report continues (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Senator Swanepoel subsequently quoted once more from the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> which wrote that Mr. Lewis was one of the four or five liberalists of the United Party.</block>

<p>This with reference to colour policy. Sir, I am still trying to find out who are the other four or five liberalists on my right who, like the hon. member for Umlazi, can be expected to cross over. He went on so say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The same newspaper also wrote that Mr. A. H. du Plessis was in the liberal camp of the National Party. I sat in the same caucus as Mr. Lewis and I know that he is a liberalist. He could not give full expression to his liberal ideas in the United Party.</block>

<p>Sir, these views which the hon. Senator expounded in Windhoek surely do not accord at all with the acccusation of heartlessness against the hon. the Minister which we have been hearing here since yesterday; it does not accord at all with the complaint which we heard yesterday, and again this morning, about our policy having failed. I cast doubt on the <i>bona fides</i> of the United Party as such, where it claimed to be the party which placed its confidence in the Whites, but when we hear these contradictory statements I can only ask: Save us from the day when that party has to administer Bantu affairs in South Africa and South-West Africa.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Windhoek will excuse me if I do not reply to him. He has dealt with a large number of speeches from the Opposition side and I have my own private quarrel with the hon. the Minister and the Deputy Minister and there is very little time in which to have that quarrel. First of all, before I go on to those hon. gentlemen I want to say to the hon. member for Wolmaransstad that he has not cited one thing concerning this Vote that we are dealing with here to-day. We are not dealing with white perquisites; we are not dealing with white advantages; we are not dealing with the security of the white man to-day; we are dealing with Bantu Affairs and we are supposed to be dealing with the responsibility of the hon. the Minister and the Deputy Ministers to whom the Bantu have been entrusted. Those are the things that we are meant to be dealing with to-day, and I think the hon. member for Wolmaransstad is right off the beat when he tells this Committee what advantages white South Africans have derived from the policy being carried out by the hon. the Minister and the Deputy Minister. I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, if I can get his attention away from the Leader of the National Party in Natal, that I for one want to give credit to the agricultural officers who are working in the homelands for their very commendable efforts to try to improve agriculture in the reserves. I wish the Government would devote all the money that it has to spend on the reserves to this sort of positive achievement. I do not deride the building of dams and the improvement of stock and contour ploughing and all the other things which the agricultural officers are trying to do. But I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that what they do is being undermined all the time by the other policy which is being carried out in respect of the reserves, and that is the putting back into the reserves of thousands of people from the urban areas, not only the so-called superfluous appendages of the Deputy Minister of Planning but also other Africans who could be employed in the urban areas and who do not have the necessary permits to seek work there. The flooding of these reserves is doing them irrevocable harm, I believe. We know that there is too great a pressure of people and of animals on the reserves. What is the point of pushing such people back and of spending a huge proportion of the amount allocated to the Bantu Trust for housing for those displaced persons? That is not the way to solve the problem. Sir; that is making the problem worse. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if he has any idea of the average family income in the reserves to-day; does he have any idea of the gross geographic product of those reserves? Sir, I would not be one bit surprised to find that the figure which the Tomlinson Commission reported over 13 years ago and which, after all, was based on surveys done several years before that, the figure that revealed an average income per family in the reserves of £40 for a family of five, and which was based not only on what the reserves yielded in the way of crops but also on the cash brought in by migratory workers, has probably gone down since then.</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Why?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because of the additional pressure of people on the reserves and the inability of the reserves even to support their own people. We are importing food into the reserves; they are not self-sufficient. Leave aside the dreadful drought periods that they have had with a loss of crops and the loss of animals. Even in the normal times the reserves are not able to support their own population. I say that there is not the forward planning that is needed, particularly in view of this policy of sending people back to the reserves. Sir, I do not care whether the hon. the Deputy Minister’s crude words, &#x201C;superfluous appendages&#x201D; are used; I do not care whether the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration says very piously that people are not suitcases&#x2014;I agree with him; that is a fine discovery he has made. I agree with him that they are not suitcases. [Interjections.] There <span class="col_6511-6512" refersTo="page_0403"/>are a few other things that he has changed his mind about and I will come back to those in a minute. I do not care, Sir, if this policy is decked out in the sort of religious or Biblical words of the hon. the Minister himself, which are mentioned in the same issue of <i>Bantu</i> that has been referred to earlier: &#x201C;Do unto others&#x201D;, he told the Netherlands Trade Mission, &#x201C;as you would have them do unto yourself&#x201D;&#x2014;fine Biblical words, Sir. The point I want to make is that irrespective of what one calls this policy, it is the same. It is the same whether you call these people superfluous appendages or whether you say that they are not suitcases or whether you use this sort of Biblical language. I want to say that there is only one policy that is being carried out; there is no difference. Only Africans presently employed in the white areas are entitled to be there. Everybody else is either there on suffrance or illegally. The point is that they are &#x201C;superfluous&#x201D;; they are surplus and they have to be moved. Sir, a departmental circular, circular No. 25, which was issued in 1967 by the Secretary of Bantu Administration to all its officers and to all the magistrates, makes this policy abundantly clear. It said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be stressed here that no stone is to be left unturned to achieve the resettlement in the homelands of non-productive Bantu who are presently residing in the European areas. The hon. the Minister has given instructions that the resettlement in the homelands of thousands of superfluous Bantu families at present residing in the European areas of the Republic must enjoy the highest priority.</block>

<p>Sir, if you add to these numbers all the people who are supposed to be illegally in the towns, i.e. the people seeking work in the towns, then we see that the policy is one of shoving these people back without any proper planning whatsoever to see that they are properly cared for when they get back to the reserves. Sir, who are the non-productive, so-called superfluous Bantu? They are the aged, the unfit, the widows, the women with dependant children. These are the words used in the departmental circular. I want to ask the hon. the Minister who has used this Biblical language: Are these not the most vulnerable, the most defenceless people in the population? Would not a community wanting to do unto others as it would have others do unto it take care of these people, rather than just shove them back into these areas where there is nothing whatever for them to do, and little provision is made even to house them properly. &#x201C;The human factor&#x201D;, said the circular, &#x201C;must never be lost sight of in the problem of resettlement&#x201D;. Sir, I say that the human factor has never been considered at all, let alone been lost sight of. In this resettlement scheme, all these people, be it the superfluous people, be it the Africans who have entered the towns to look for employment, share one common factor; they have all been uprooted; they all live in extreme poverty; they all lack employment opportunities unless they are the few lucky individuals who got the perks that are going, the trading store licences or filling station licences or possibly bottle store licences. Everybody else lives in extreme poverty. I want to say quite categorically that in many instances which I personally have seen, the resettlement has not only preceded development, as the Deputy Minister of Planning said it could do, but it has preceded the most rudimentary planning. I say that people have been put on the veld, some of them in mid-winter, and given tents which they did not even know how to erect incidentally; they were left there with no proper medical attention, no proper facilities for schooling and no proper store facilities, etc.</p>

I went to see that place and I know what it was like when they arrived. It is a little better now, but believe me it was pretty terrible when they arrived. Sir, the same thing happened in the Natal settlements. These people were not given the benefit of adequate preparation and planning. The hon. the Minister should have a look at preparations made for the Kariba Dam scheme and then he will see what real planning means before you move people&#x2014;years of planning, with district commissioners visiting the place, schools set up, clinics set up, grain provided, thatching grass ready for the people to use. All sorts of preparations were made and even then it was not done very easily. But none of this happened here. People are simply told that they are going to be moved.

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the United Party is bound to reply to certain questions which have up to now been put during the discussion under this Vote. The first question I want to put is whether the United Party is incapable of displaying a greater measure of seriousness in regard to the discussions of such an important Vote. If I regard the spectacle on that side in all honesty, then I must say that I am deeply shocked. I want to ask the hon. member for East London (City) and the hon. member for Durban (Point) the following question: Do they in all honesty think that clarity can on this basis be obtained in regard to our various standpoints? If the United Party does not want to furnish a reply to that, then I want to try to do so. Underlying this phenomenon I find the following reason: That the United Party does not argue on the basis of a principle. Sir, if any political party, <span class="col_6513-6514" refersTo="page_0404"/>in whatever form it may function, does not have a basis of principle then it has no functional pattern either. The fundamental difficulty with the United Party is that owing to a lack of a basic principle a confused functional pattern is being found here as far as the United Party is concerned. A moment ago the hon. member for Durban (Point) concluded his argument by reading something to the effect that the United Party was in favour of residential separation.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument I shall accept that; I shall accept the good faith of the hon. member for Durban (Point). But there it ends as far as the question of separation is concerned. I now want to put this question to the hon. member, arising out of the standpoint which the United Party has already stated, i.e. that they are in favour of the right of land tenure being granted in existing white areas &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>That is their policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>That is their stated policy. [Interjection.] I sat and made no comment when the hon. member was speaking. As a result of this principle, which is fundamental to differences between us and them, I want to ask that if hon. members on the opposite side want to grant Bantu the right of land and property tenure, whether they will be opposed to, and what the results will be, if the Bantu mobilize capital within the white areas on the same economic level as the Whites? What &#x201C;checks&#x201D; and &#x201C;balances&#x201D; will the United Party apply to utilize the capital which the Bantu have mobilized within the white areas as a result of the economic incorporation policy of the Bantu together with the Whites on the same economic level? What outlets are the United Party going to give that capital which the Bantu have mobilized in that way? How are they going to control it? Where is that capital going to flow to? There is another inevitable consequence as well. If capital mobilization cannot be stemmed, and it cannot be channelized away from levels of friction, from levels of economic integration, away from geographic integration in the spending of that capital which is being mobilized by economic activities, will the United Party then be able to prevent labour mobilization? After capital mobilization the right to mobilize labour must eventually be granted.</p>

<p>If the Bantu therefore begin to mobilize capital within the white areas, as this must happen according to the already stated policy of the United Party, and they begin to mobilize labour, how is the United Party going to channelize this labour mobilization? Will the Bantu be able to employ Whites? Will Bantu be able to mobilize white labour on the same economic level? These are questions which the United Party must reply to, and cannot evade. These are serious questions which I am putting here, because these are the basic components of any economic system which, according to the United Party’s recipe, has to be developed. Those inevitable results cannot be escaped.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member for East London (City) the following question. He occupied his time here with a number of minor matters which apply in any community. What he had to say about the Transkei, I can say of any white area as well. His speech contributed nothing to the acquisition of clarity in regard to the basic problem and its inevitable results. I want to place the hon. member for Houghton and the hon. member for East London (City) in juxtaposition. She is at least honest in her views. We differ radically from each other, and can never find each other. This rift has formed, and no amount of cement can ever fill it in again. This confused and colourless functional pattern which the United Party is constructing, because they have no basic principle, is in direct contrast to the National Party. If I were to compare the policy of the United Party and that of the National Party I must say that as a result of its basic principle and its colourful and clearly discernable functional pattern which is being based on it, the National Party is also able to project it into the future. The United Party can never hope to make any future projection, because any party which wants to continue to project itself into the future&#x2014;and it is essential that any party should be able to make such a projection&#x2014;must have a principal basis for its policy. I want to conclude by saying that we have here a clearly discernable, but distinguishable, expressed basic difference between that side and this side of the House. This rift exists and cannot be bridged and was not formed as a result of what is now being done in the Transkei, or the fact that there are not enough schools, or that the beginning of industrial development or the construction of an economic infrastructure is not what it should be. These things are all secondary and tertiary and not primary. The primary requirement for dealing with such an enormous problem is that the basic principle should be the right one, on which a functional pattern must be constructed, and we must be able to project on such a basic principle further functional patterns.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the theme I was developing before my time expired, and I want to say that I do not believe that the Government has done one iota of the forward planning necessary before it goes into this Herculean task, which is the only way I can <span class="col_6515-6516" refersTo="page_0405"/>describe it, a Herculean task, at which I might say lesser mortals would boggle, lesser mortals than the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Ministers, at moving these millions of people, because millions of people are involved. The 3.8 million only applies, as far as I can gather, to the so-called superfluous families in the urban areas, and also to the superfluous families on the rural farms. I do not know where the hon. member for Klip River gets the idea from that farms are not affected by this. In Natal alone, I understand, something like two million people are going to be moved, people who are considered as being labour tenants. The system has been changed so that only male workers will be allowed to stay on.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is an estimate. I will cut the figure down to one million, if it suits the hon. member better. This estimate was made in newspapers and I saw no denial of this by an official source. The fact remains &#x2026; [Interjections.] Do not try to sidetrack me with one exaggerated figure that might have appeared in a newspaper. The fact remains that millions of people are going to be moved, even if one only sticks to the figure of 3.8 million mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development. What forward planning goes into this matter? I know there is supposed to be a departmental directive that no removal scheme should be undertaken unless there is adequate housing, schools, clinics and so on, but in fact these removals are taking place all the time, without adequate forward planning having been done. The Government does not have the facts. That is the point. It does not know, for instance, what sort of income loss is suffered by rural families that are removed from the rural black spots and have to give up their livestock when they are moved. It does not know of the loss of income when people are, for example, prohibited from ploughing because of imminent removal. This happened to people at the farm Hlatikulu. Does the hon. the Deputy Minister know that? For three years these people were ordered not to plough because their removal was imminent. It took three years longer than the Government expected, because they did not find any water in the boreholes they say, and when finally they moved them did they give them any compensation for the loss of arable crops in the three years they were not allowed to plough? Was there any compensation paid for the additional year until the new crops grew? These are all factors which have to be taken into consideration. Has any consideration been given to the loss of income to families already living on absolute subsistence levels when the women are no longer able to earn a little extra money by doing casual work in the rural areas? This is one example. There is also the pattern of hygiene, the change between people living on widespread settlements, and people in the closer settlements. This is the sort of things we have to know about. The loss of family income where the so-called superfluous women and children are removed from the urban areas, is also a factor. These people all supply additional incomes to their families. Does anyone know about the cost of maintaining two households, one for the family in the reserves, and one in the towns? It involves additional costs, such as additional rents and additional basic expenses.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. The Government talks big about preserving Bantu culture. In his address to the Netherlands Trade Mission he talked about building up the Bantu’s own national identity, culture and so on. Of course, he also stressed this business about there being a minority Government in South Africa because of the different Bantu nations. I will leave that nonsense aside. This hon. Deputy Minister knows something about anthropology. Indeed, he wrote a learned thesis of about 680 pages on the evils of migratory labour when he was under the influence &#x2026;</p>

The hon. the Deputy Minister is an anthropologist and is it not obvious to him that these bleak settlements that are being set up in the rural areas are neither the normal outgrowth of Western culture on the one hand, nor are they in any way consonant with Bantu culture on the other hand. He knows they are not. They are a crude by-product of the Bantu Urban Areas Act and the Bantu Labour Act. That is what they are. The basic unit of Bantu culture was the family and the hon. the Deputy Minister knows that. The extended family was the basis.</p>

<p>Everywhere. If they are put back in the homelands and if the Government wants them to maintain their culture, they have to maintain that extended family and this does not exist any more. Not for the people who have been returned from the urban areas and not for the people who are superfluous and are being sent back. People <span class="col_6517-6518" refersTo="page_0406"/>were linked by a system of reciprocities in the old Bantu culture and the hon. the Deputy Minister knows it perfectly well. There were no abandoned orphans, deserted wives and no widows with dependent children. They were all absorbed in the huge extended family unit. There was lifelong security and everybody shared the common fate. Be it famine or be it feasting, everybody shared the common fate. This is not so now. We are breaking down Bantu culture and we are putting nothing in its place. We are not allowing these people to absorb the benefits of Western culture. What sort of conditions are these likely to lead to? I am talking on ths one side only, but what about ths residual conditions in the urban areas? Do hon. Ministers for one moment stop and think of what situations they are creating in the urban areas with this broken family life? The whole emphasis of the future labour pattern is being put on migratory labour. Do they not realize what they are building up for future generations to contend with? it is not only the Coloured problem that will have to be solved by our children, but also a vast problem of crime and delinquency that is going to have to be solved by our children, because the conditions which are being set in the urban areas of South Africa, for the African people who every hon. Deputy Minister have admitted will have to work here, are going to lead to the most terrible conditions of crime and delinquency. One cannot have a labour system based on migratory labour where thousands and millions of adult males cooped up without the benefit of family life and expect life to go on as before. One cannot then expect to have some reasonable conditions of living and expect to have parental control of children. Do hon. Ministers know of the astronomical percentage of illegitimate children born in the townships as a result of this system? Have they any idea of this? Does it not worry them? This hon. Deputy Minister who is an intelligent and an educated man has had the benefit of anthropological studies, but he deliberately sets out on this policy which he knows can only lead to the most terrible conditions in South Africa within one generation.</p>

<p>I have another matter I wish to raise with the hon. Ministers and I hope I will have an opportunity to develop it, if not now, then later and that is that there has been a great deal of fuss and bother about the tragic death of three people in a Police van. The Police have been blamed for this. I say that the Police are not to blame for this, not the African men in charge of the van and not even the white sergeant who gave the instructions. The culprits are the hon. the Minister and the Deputy Ministers of Bantu Administration and Education and of Bantu Development and also the Government.</p>

In precisely the same way they doomed our Bantu homelands policy to failure, as well as our establishment of the Republic. But, Mr. Chairman, the difference between this side and that side of the House is that we on this side believe in what we are doing. We do not believe in failures, only in future successes. Thus far we have not failed in any respect, despite the prophets of doom on the opposite side of the House. We at least have faith in the future. We believe that the homelands will develop further. There is already a measure of development, but they are going to be developed further. That hon. member is shaking his head. But can he tell me whether there is any comparison between the Transkei to-day and that of 20 years ago? Mr. Chairman, the two cannot be compared.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, they say that the truth hurts, especially if you come from Umtata. The Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council has made it its object to contribute to the development of Bantu homelands as well. While the growth rate in the Republic is about 5 per cent, it is at present still less than 2.4 per cent in the homelands. If the Bantu homelands are to provide a refuge for their population increases, the growth rate must be more than this. And this will be the case in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>A few years hence. [Interjections.] This must happen in view of everything that is being done at present for the economic development of the homelands. In order to develop the homelands a few basic requirements, fundamental requirements, must be met. I now want to mention one very important one. The Whites of the Republic will make their contribution in the form of tied capital in the homelands. I am purposely calling it &#x201C;tied capital&#x201D; because it will not be free capital. This is something which is advocated by members on this side of the House. The development of the Bantu homelands has a positive and a negative side, like a battery.</p>

<p>Delays in developments in the homelands are caused by human erosion, an erosion of brainpower. The best brainpower in the homelands is lost to the homelands because the people are enticed away to the flourishing white economy. We shall have to do something to return this brain power to the homelands. I know what I am talking about. Bantu labour on the farms to-day is of a lower standard than it was originally. With a few exceptions, this is also the case within the homelands. I want to plead for us to re-channel, in some way or other, the brain power which is being lost to the homelands, so that the black people can apply their capabilities for the benefit of their own people.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that years ago many people left the homelands to go and work in the white homelands, good labour forces, people with good brainpower. They can be used in a positive way for the benefit of their own people in the homelands. Can we do this, can we develop the homelands twice as quickly as we are doing at present. I have a great appreciation for the work which is at present being done by the Minister, his Deputies and their Department. But, with the limited human material at their disposal, can the small but valiant band of Bantu administration officials in the Transkei carry through this gigantic task which they are shouldering? We must have that brainpower in order to speed up development, in conjunction with the officials there and with the financial assistance which the Government is giving to the homelands, otherwise it will be a slow process. I take my hat off to what the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development has thus far achieved as far as that is concerned. We believe that henceforth it could be a much speedier process than ever before, although the Opposition’s attitude is negative and will remain negative until they one day vanish. But we believe in ourselves and in what we advocate.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased the hon. member for Aliwal North dealt with the question of the homelands, because it is something which I too should like to deal with. We started off this Session with my hon. Leader completely exposing, in the no-confidence debate, the homeland myth and the separate development myth. Yesterday the hon. member for Transkei did the same. There is a saying that sooner or later there comes to everyone a moment of truth. I want to make bold to say that the <span class="col_6521-6522" refersTo="page_0408"/>year 1969 is going to be recorded in our history as the year during which the Nationalist Party Government was brought face to face with its moment of truth. For the Government there is the very unpalatable truth that after 21 years in power their much vaunted policy of separate development, a policy devised in the first instance to lend some semblance of morality to the pledge they used to get into power, has turned out to be a dismal failure. When the inevitable post-mortem is held and the Government looks around for reasons why this policy has failed, I suggest to them that the basic reason is a very simple one. This policy has failed because the Government has been unwilling to face up to a very simple and fundamental truth, the truth that in South Africa to-day the white man and black man are complementary to one another, to the extent that there can be no progress in the white areas without the co-operation and goodwill of the black man, just as there can be no progress in the black areas without the financial assistance, the technical know-how, the co-operation and goodwill of the white man. This is the stark truth of the matter and no measure of theorizing or lip service to this so-called ideal of separate development is going to change this fundamental truth.</p>

<p>One can well understand the feeling of frustration which exists within the Nationalist Party, now that they realize that after their 21st year in power there is an agitation amongst their own supporters, an agitation spearheaded by the intelligentsia of the party and their own Press for, of all things, a &#x201C;volkskongres&#x201D; to find ways and means of speeding up the implementation of separate development.</p>

<p>We have not heard very much lately about this congress. Possibly during the course of this debate, the hon. the Minister can tell us a little more about it. However, I should like to say that I do not believe any purpose would be served by a congress of this nature unless the Government in the first instance is prepared to have a good look at the whole concept of separate development and in the light of what they see, do some very serious rethinking. I do not think anything like this will happen, because we know how stubborn and dogmatic the Government can be in matters of this particular nature. We find that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration ably supported by his deputy, still makes use of every possible opportunity to use all the old worn out clichés by telling the people of South Africa that he is making progress with separate development, that separate development will eventually be successful and that it is designed for the benefit of all the people in South Africa. We are in no way doubting the hon. the Minister’s sincerity in his beliefs of separate development. However, I should like to say to him that facts and figures have proved him to be wrong. He has to realize that any policy in the final analysis is judged by what it does and not by what it says. One wonders how the hon. the Minister can really have faith in this particular policy. Surely he knows that during the 21 years of Nationalist Party rule the white population of the platteland has decreased by 50 per cent, while the Bantu population has increased by no less than 1,300,000. I think he should know too that in the city of Johannesburg, for instance, the Bantu population has almost doubled itself in 20 years. It increased from 395,000 in 1947 to no less than 774,000 in 1967. This happened despite everything the Government could do. Does anybody really seriously believe to-day that the 8 million odd Bantu who are outside the reserves can ever be accommodated there? Of course, they do not. Even if they could be white South Africa would never allow it, because if we did the economy of this country would collapse like a house of cards. The hon. the Minister and all members on that side of the House know this. My plea is that if the Government and the Minister have made a mistake in this policy, for goodness’ sake why do they not have another look at it and try to come up with something a little bit better.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister still wants proof of the permanency of the urban Bantu in South Africa, I suggest that he takes a look at the capital expenditure of the larger cities in South Africa. He will find for instance that in the city of Johannesburg capital expenditure has risen from R46 million to the colossal amount of R60 million during about five years. This is happening all the time. The Government knows they are fighting a losing battle. We know the hon. the Minister has proved himself as a hard and tough politician. I think the time has now come for him to show to the people of South Africa that he is also a statesman. He should have another look at this policy of separate development which can never work in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, since yesterday I have been listening in this House to one Opposition speaker after the other. Not one of them succeeded in giving us an indication of their policy. All they do is to oppose the National Government’s policy of separate development. They are trying to cast suspicion on and criticize the implementation of the policy of separate development. I want to tell the Opposition that we, the responsible National Party Government, every member on this side of the House, will not dispute the fact that major problems do crop up on the road to separate development. We are not afraid of them, because it is a fact that along with every task which one shoulders in this life, problems are laid in one’s way; however small that task may be, those problems are present.</p>

<p>Any farmer in South Africa to-day, and he may be the most practical farmer, will come across problems in the implementation of his farming methods, Problems which have to be solved. That is why the electorate in South Africa has so much confidence in the Government, because they know that this is the party which is capable of solving the problems which <span class="col_6523-6524" refersTo="page_0409"/>are being laid in the way of separate development. The policy of separate development of this National Government is an essential law. Through all the centuries it has always been an essential law. Through all the centuries this essential law has been implemented instinctively, not only by human beings, but even by animals. I want to tell hon. members of the Opposition that if some of them decide to visit the Kruger National Park during the winter holidays, they should observe the animals. The impala keep to themselves in separate herds, and the same applies to the blue wildebeest, the giraffes, the lions &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>This is an essential law and the process of separate development in South Africa originates from that. When Jan van Riebeeck landed here in 1652, he found the brown man here in the person of Harry Strandloper. By implication Jan van Riebeeck told him, &#x201C;Harry, you stay there and I stay here&#x201D;. As far back as that this was a law in South Africa. When the Whites arrived in South Africa, they came across the Bantu living in various population groups, each group in its own area, where it was separate and developed separately: the Basuto in Basutoland, the Zulu in Zululand, the Swazi in Swaziland and the Matabele in the Transvaal. What do we find to-day? The United Party does not only want to throw the Bantu together; they also want to throw White and Black together. Now the United Party comes along with its policy which, by implication, is integration, and it wants to throw White and Black together.</p>

<p>We have a most competent Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, Minister M. C. Botha, who, apart from his exceptionally high intelligence, his integrity and competence, is a product of the Verwoerd school, and to him we want to say that he should carry on with the policy of separate development. We on this side of the House want to say to him that he should go on spending large amounts of money on that policy. I want to remind the members of the United Party of the fact that under the United Party Government they argued, in 1939 and in the five subsequent years, that our survival here in South Africa was being jeopardized by Germany. Then they went to the people of South Africa and asked for R1,000 million to be spent on the war effort, the reason being that, according to them, our survival had to be safeguarded&#x2014;R1,000 million, the equivalent of which is between R4,000 and R5,000 million to-day. That is why we want to tell the United Party that the people of South Africa are prepared to pay for the policy of separate development, since this is the only policy which is true to the essential laws which have been proven over the centuries. It is on the basis of that law of separate nations that white South Africa will continue to exist.</p>

<p>In a Christian manner, morally, traditionally and culturally we shall give the black man what is his due. In the implementation of the policy of separate development we find that the Government is doing its share throughout the Republic. It does that, and especially over the past 3½ years this has been the case in my constituency. In that area I have seen how, over the past 3½ years, the National Government has removed black spots from our white areas, how it has moved’1,350 families, or more than 8,000 Bantu, from the white area of Meyerton to the Bantu township of Sebokeng, how it has over the past 3½ years moved 1,633 families, or more than 9,000 Bantu, to the Bantu township of Sebokeng, how it has moved 272 families, or more than 1,000 Bantu, from Vanderbijlpark to Sebokeng, and 2,787 families from Evaton to Sebokeng. Just as the voters of South Africa have over the past 21 years judged the National Party and the United Party, so they will judge them for at least another 21 years, because the clear dividing line is there. If that party should ever come into power, then the writing would be on the wall for South Africa and one black Bantustan would develop all over the territory of Southern Africa, and that is something the voters of South Africa will never allow. That is why we, with our policy of separate development, will in the years that lie ahead continue to govern so that we may safeguard the survival of the white man here.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Heidelberg has come here with the understatement of the year, when he says that on the path to separate development the Nationalist Party has come across great problems. He said there were some problems and then he qualified it by saying there were great problems. Of course their problems are so great that the Nationalist Party has not yet left Square 1 on the path to solving them. Not yet have they left Square 1 to take a step forward towards the solution of those problems. The hon. member referred to the Kruger National Park, and he said there you have the animals of different sorts which stay separate and keep apart, but the question arises when do the lions and the kudu keep apart? They are apart at all times except at meal-times, and this is precisely the same sort of thing that goes on here in South Africa. You have separation in residential areas between White and Black, but in the meal tickets of every single white man and black man in South Africa we are permanently and inextricably integrated and we will never get away from it. This is the one problem to which the Government has no answer whatever. I want to put a question to the hon. members. I believe that the white man in this country has a mission to maintain here what we call Christian Western civilization, and I think we are all agreed in this House that that is what we are trying to do. But what I want to do now is to question the means by which the <span class="col_6525-6526" refersTo="page_0410"/>Nationalist Party is seeking to attain that ideal. It is an ideal for the white as well as for the black man and for every single race in South Africa. What we stand for as white people are the values, the standards, the way of life, and the thoughts we express here are of value to both Black and White in South Africa, and indeed, it is essential to the black man if progress of a permanent nature is to be made. I want to say straight out now that the civilizing force here in South Africa is the town, urban employment and urban residence. I want to say right here and now that what this Government is doing is to turn its back on the urbanization and the development of the Bantu population towards civilized standards, because they are deliberately turning their back on that process and attempting to force back into Bantu rural reserves the whole of the thought processes of the Bantu population.</p>

<p>Yes, it is dynamite. The Government is attempting to force back into the rural areas the whole of the development and the future of the Bantu population, and they are creating the one thing which will destroy white civilization in South Africa. They are doing this because they are denying the Bantu population a future in the white areas. They are forcing them back into the rural areas of the Reserves, and what they are doing is to create there a vast population of people who have nothing to look forward to, who have no economic hope and who will sit there and look over their borders at the white man’s land. [Interjections.] This is the one rallying cry. When the people who are turfed out of the urban areas, who are endorsed out and sent back, who are given nothing to do, who are put into Government camps, who are denied the right to participate in the economy of South Africa go back to their Reserves the one thing they will do is to sit and look over the border at the land which the white man has got, and let me tell you this, Sir. In the Russian Revolution of 1917 the rallying cry that Lenin used to divorce the peasants from their own representatives was &#x201C;Land&#x201D;. In the Mau-Mau Revolution in Kenya, the one thing which stirred up the Kikuyu against the British occupation was land, and in Vietnam the one thing which was the decisive factor was land.</p>

What is going to happen is this. We are creating the one ideal condition to encourage the greatest danger we face, namely the influence of the Chinese communists in this country. It is an old story, Sir. Let me tell the hon. member that this is the one thing which can give the black people the urge to destroy the white man, namely the cry for more land. If the hon. member thinks that the Chinese communists are going to miss this kind of chance to stir up trouble and create strife in the Bantu Reserves, he has another think coming. The whole pattern of the Chinese communist onslaught on Western society has been to exploit the peasant. I think we have to realize that we are facing a change of tactics. There is a very wide divergence between the two great communist powers, because the Russians have been concentrating on urban workers to cause agitation, but the Chinese have adopted different tactics; they go for the peasant, the man who looks for ground, and that applies so vitally to us in South Africa. This is something which this Government is deliberately neglecting.</p>

What this Government is doing is to destroy the hope and the basis for the survival of the white man in this country by their policy, because the survival of the white man is based on the civilizing action of our urban civilization, and this is the only thing which can guarantee our safety in any way at all for the future.

What this Government is doing, as I have said already, is deliberately to turn its back on the civilizing process, because it does not fit into the theory of Nationalist Party policy which says that there must be complete and utter separation at some time or other in the future and that these are the steps that we are taking now towards implementing this kind of policy.</p>

We then asked them, as the hon. member for Carletonville also did a moment ago, what their attitude was going to be if the Bantu who were living here in the white areas, built up capital and began to mobilize their capital. We received no reply to that. But my question is this: If that land should be allocated to them, is it going to be subtracted from the seven and a quarter million morgen of land, or is it going to be added?</p>

Over and above that seven and a quarter million morgen of land, and over and above proprietory rights for the Bantu in the peri-urban areas, such as Langa, Nyanga, Soweto and Kwa Mashu, the hon. member has stated that the Bantu have a legitimate claim to more land according to their needs.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the discussion of this Vote the United Party levelled a serious charge against the National Party. The charge is very clearly stated in this morning’s newspaper, where it is said: &#x201C;Separate development is a fraud and a bluff&#x201D;. Then they go on to say: &#x201C;This Government has no separate development policy&#x201D;. If that Charge contained one iota of truth, everyone who loved this country would have to reflect seriously on the matter. But there is not a shred of truth in it. Let me now inform the United Party that as far as this matter and this nonsensical allegation which they are making in the discussion of this Vote is concerned, there was much better contact last night between Snoopy and Charlie Brown than there has ever been between the National Party and the United Party. They were never even near being in orbit; that is the &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;. What is the United Party doing? They supply their own criteria, then they test our policy against their criteria and arrive at the conclusion that it is a &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and a &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;. Where has one ever seen such a ridiculous thing before? There is a &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and a &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;. But do hon. members know what the &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and the &#x201C;bluff&#x201D; is? It is the allegation of the United Party that our policy is a &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and a &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;. That is the &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;. Do hon. members know wherein the &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and the &#x201C;bluff&#x201D; also lies? To drive the United Party into a corner is the easiest thing in the world. I would just like to ask them a single question. They say we do not have a policy. Our policy is very clear. One can put it in a nutshell. We have fought elections on it, and that accounts for their present appearance. The only party which cannot split, is the Progressive Party because there is only one member. Here is our policy in a nutshell: In the white areas there must be white sovereignty&#x2014;hon. <span class="col_6531-6532" refersTo="page_0413"/>members can also use the word &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; if they want to&#x2014;'for all time, and we shall defend this with the use of force. That is our policy. In addition to that we say, as far as the Bantu in the Bantu homelands are concerned, they can develop there to the absolute maximum, to the extent to which they are able to develop.</p>

Now I want to ask them one question. Can they give the voters of this country the guarantee that Bantu will never sit in this House, the highest authority in this country, and that this House will always remain white? They cannot do it. I am now challenging them to give that guarantee in terms of their policy. Sir, do you see how quietly they sit there without saying a word? They cannot do so. In that lies the &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and the &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;, and in that lies the &#x201C;no policy&#x201D;. That is the point. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My time is very limited: the hon. member can ask me a question later on. As long ago as 1947 we envisaged very clearly our policy of protecting the Whites properly and effectively against any policy, dogma or attack which would undermine or endanger their survival. That is why there are so few U.P. members (Sappe). That is why the Progressive Party has been thinned out to such an extent that there is only one of them sitting here to-day.</p>

<p>Now I should very much like to furnish the hon. members with facts indicating how we are implementing our policy. Let me say at once that never in the history of the National Party has more rapid and more dynamic progress been made with the implementation of this policy of protecting and confirming the domination of the Whites in the white area than is being achieved at this very moment. As far as the development of under-developed areas is concerned. South Africa has, under National Party rule, already placed itself in a position where it can state without any danger of contradiction&#x2014;scientists are realizing and appreciating this to an increasing extent &#x2014;that there is no other country that has progressed so far with the development of its under-developed people than the Republic of South Africa. We are dealing here with a human problem. I am not a Roman Catholic but I would just like to quote what the Pope recently stated in his Encyclical Letter on the development of peoples. The United Party must take note of this. He stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He (i.e. man) is aided, or sometimes impeded, by those who educate him and those with whom he lives, but each one remains whatever be these influences affecting him, the principal agent of his own success or failure. The peoples themselves have the prime responsibility to work for their own development.</block>

<p>Now does the United Party expect us, and this is their criterion, to do everything for the Bantu in this country. If the Bantu are themselves, owing to the human problem, incapable of developing those homelands at a faster rate, do they want to hold the National Party Government to account for this? Then they say that our policy is a &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and a &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;. Surely that is ridiculous, Sir. We have always said that the human development of the Bantu is a different problem. I repeat, no government in the world has made further or better progress in respect of that problem than the National Party Government in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Then they come forward with their numerical story. What are the facts in regard to the numbers? Do hon. members know that only last year we removed 61,658 Bantu who were not economically active, from the white areas? That was in one year. Do hon. members know that since 1961 we have built 71,055 houses for the Bantu in their Bantu homelands in order to resettle them there away from the white area. What a phenomenal achievement in a mere eight years! Do hon. members know how many people from our whites areas were resettled in that way in the Bantu homelands? 450,373, almost a half million. Surely this is a tremendous achievement. The policy we are applying is that the Bantu must remain attached to their national assets, to their own homelands. As a result of that policy, we have succeeded to Such an extent that the position in July 1968 was as follows. This is the latest figure we have available. In the white area 1,646.777 single Bantu were working in the Republic. We do not shy away from our policy. Our policy is that this is white area. The Bantu nations each have their own country. Therefore, if they come to work here, they are here on a temporary basis and cannot acquire any permanent rights. That is why we maintain that we cannot establish the Bantu here in the white areas on a family basis. I have previously indicated to hon. members on the opposite side what would happen if they were to apply their policy. If one, as the hon. member for Transkei said here again yesterday, were to settle 1,646,000 single Bantu here on a happy family basis in our white areas, do hon. members know what that would <span class="col_6533-6534" refersTo="page_0414"/>mean? Immediately more than eight million Bantu, if it could be applied, would stream into our cities. The United Party wants an inundation, an increasing number of Bantu in the white area. Then they talk about a &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and a &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;. Therein lies the &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and the &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;. Do hon. members know what it would cost to build a house for each of 1,646,000 Bantu? At R500 apiece it would cost more than R800 million, for the houses alone. If one were also to have to purchase the land and make the services available, as I have said before, it works out, conservatively estimated, at R200,000 million, which is what the policy of integration of the United Party will cost this country, with the ploughing under of the Whites which will accompany this, if they should come into power. Then they have the temerity to accuse us of our policy being a &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and a &#x201C;bluff&#x201D;. There the &#x201C;bluffers&#x201D; and the &#x201C;frauds&#x201D; are sitting. I can quote figures to them to indicate how the birth rate figure has increased more rapidly, particularly since 1961, as a result of our strict influx control measures in our urban areas among the Bantu. This is as a result of National Party policy. We say that, as long as the Bantu work here, they must be assured of a fair <i>modus vivendi.</i> That we are doing, Sir. As a result of health and other services the position is such that between 1946 and 1951 1.8 Bantu streamed in for every Bantu born. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister knows perfectly well that the figures he quoted are figures which are misleading. They are not accurate figures. They are not the figures on which we can base any type of estimate in this country.</p>

<p>I want to return to my hon. friend from Somerset East, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, who spoke for 10 minutes here on something which I had not said. That hon. Deputy Minister attempted to put words into my mouth which I did not use. I want to put the record straight now. Anybody else who puts those words into my mouth will then be guilty of a deliberate, ascertainable lie. What I said, was, because of the policy of this Government of pushing back into the Bantu reserves what they call, &#x201C;surplus population&#x201D;, they will be creating in the Bantu reserves a population that they cannot possibly employ. They will be creating a pressure on the white man’s land. They will be creating a population which is readily accessible to the Chinese communist line that land must be given to the Bantu population. It will be as a result of the policy of this Government, Mr. Chairman, it is not me that comes here with words to &#x201C;aanhits&#x201D;, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said. It is the policy of the Government, by pushing back these people, by forcing them back into an underdeveloped area, that will create the pressure on the land of the white man. This is the one thing that will destroy white South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to go further. I want to say to these hon. members, to the Minister and the Deputy Ministers, that they have not left square one, as I said before, in the development of their policy. They have made no serious attempt to develop the homelands in order to carry this kind of population. We have heard all kinds of stories about the contour banks. I am very grateful for the contour banks that have been made, make no mistake. But this is not creating the conditions under which a growing population can be housed and fed. What the Government are losing sight of, is that all their efforts in the homelands will be swamped by the rising population. Over 80,000 new people every year have to be employed in those areas. I want to know just what these people are going to do. Sir, I have a book here. I just want to &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad the hon. the Deputy Minister reminded me of the question he asked me about the land which was to be purchased outside of the scheduled areas. It is quite clearly laid down in chapter 3 of the Bantu Trust Act, section 10 (3) (b) which says:</p>

<block name="quote">All land acquired by and transferred to Bantu from persons other than Bantu after the commencement of this Act, outside a scheduled Bantu area existing at the commencement of this Act, otherwise than under the provisions of section 17, shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Trust.</block>

<p>So land which was purchased for or transferred to Bantu from any people other than Bantu, shall be deemed to be included in the quota which is laid down in the 1936 legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to restore this debate to a rather higher level. I want to discuss <span class="col_6535-6536" refersTo="page_0415"/>with the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Minister himself the development of the Bantu homelands. I have a book here which is called &#x201C;The Economics of Poverty&#x201D; written by a Mr. Thomas Balogh who is the Economic Adviser to the British Cabinet. He is a person who has done a considerable amount of research in work of this nature throughout the world. I hope the hon. members will listen to what I quote. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">Victory in the mortal battle for development in Asia, and perhaps even in large parts of Africa and Latin America, will go to those who succeed in mobilizing the idle or under-employed rural labour force.</block>

<p>I should like to know what this Government has done to mobilize the rural labour force, because the problem that we in this country are facing, and I want to repeat it, the problem that we face is the problem of the rural poor in the Bantu areas; the people who have no employment; the people who have no hope of employment; the people whose only hope is some form of migratory labour where they may be allowed out for a while and then be put back into those reserves. If the white man wants to survive, this Government will have to find an answer to the rural poor in the Bantu areas. It is a question which goes far beyond simply creating contour walls, dams and so forth. He goes on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">Even in countries where agriculture no longer supports an overwhelming portion of the total population the mobilization of rural manpower for rural growth and the establishment of a flexible food base is of decisive importance.</block>

<p>The hon. members have been battling now for 21 years in government. They have been in control of the Bantu areas for 21 years. They cannot now say that they have established anything that looks like a flexible food base in the Bantu areas. If there is to be an expansion there with any kind of industrial development at all, the lesson of economics shows that as soon as one starts developing and a rise of income takes place within those areas, the demand for food rises immediately in those areas. But to what success can this Government point to say that in those Bantu areas they have achieved anything which looks like a rising production of food so that they can carry what is there now? I am not even talking of the increase in the population which is taking place year after year. If they are serious about their policy they must now show us that they have taken practical steps and that they are making progress.</p>

<p>In the book &#x201C;The Economics of Poverty&#x201D; Mr. Balogh goes on to say that only if the rural response is adequate, only if one can get the return from the Bantu areas as far as food and production are concerned, if productivity and income are increased and justify an increase of industry, only then could a self-sustaining upwards spiral be maintained. It has been the experience in other countries of Africa that when independence has been gained, despite the fact that many of the European administrators left, there was a certain measure of upsurge in industrial activity spurred on by the governments seeking to invest in prestige projects. But as soon as that initial spurt has taken place and tailed off, there is not within those areas the productive capacity and the capital generated to be able to build up anything which will be maintained. I want the hon. the Minister and the hon. members to tell us just where this capital will come from; on what basis will the Bantu develop these areas by themselves?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before continuing my argument in connection with the matters which that hon. member now also mentioned, I just want to tell the hon. member for Brakpan first, with reference to the matter which he raised this morning in connection with Bantu beer, etc., that we are already investigating it. We shall complete that investigation as soon as possible, because we are also of the opinion that something can be done about it. I want to give the assurance that we shall do so if it is in any way practical and feasible.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the United Party. The <span class="col_6537-6538" refersTo="page_0416"/>United Party keeps on repeating the story that we are doing nothing or very little in connection with the development of the Bantu homelands. If I were to display such a scanty knowledge of this matter as one United Party speaker after another did, I would feel terribly ashamed. I am very sorry that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not present at the moment. I want to point out that there are so many facts in connection with what has been and what can be done for the development of the Bantu homelands that the subject is so vast that one could not even deal with it in a half-hour speech, because this has become one of the major tasks of the National Party. Therefore I just want to mention one cardinal point, especially with reference to what the hon. member said a moment ago. In 1960 it was estimated that the then <i>per capita</i> income in our Bantu homelands, and I am speaking only of the Bantu homelands now, was R56.7. I have gone to a great deal of trouble and have made inquiries in order to ascertain what the present <i>per capita</i> income of our Bantu homelands is. I can give the assurance that this is calculated as expertly as we possibly can. I want to add immediately that it is a very difficult thing to do. Hon. members know that just as well as I do. There are certain points which one can take to be able to calculate an approximate <i>per capita</i> income. That we have done. We have taken a great deal of trouble. I may say, for example, that inquiries were made at the regional offices so that we could ascertain what their idea about this matter was. Now I want to mention the figure. The <i>per capita</i> income in our Bantu homelands is estimated to stand at R105. [Interjections.] Now the hon. members of the Opposition may argue about that. We know they will do so. And this brings me to the next point, although I wanted to mention how this figure compares with, for example, a country such as Ethiopia, where it is only R24, or Tanzania, where it is R39, and Uganda, where it is only R41. But I leave it at that.</p>

<p>I have now given that figure and it is up to the Opposition to prove that it is not so. I have said that it is difficult to calculate. [Interjections.] I want to add that, for example, the office at King William’s Town informed us that the average wages of Bantu in that homeland area are as follows: Unskilled labourers get R250 and semi-skilled labourers get R384. I say that we calculated the <i>per capita</i> income to be approximately R105. I can also supply other figures which only the N.R.C. &#x2026;</p>

<p>I wanted to say that the N.R.C. alone remitted an amount of over R1 million to the Transkei. Now hon. members can make a simple little sum as to what the total amount will be if each Bantu of the 1,646,000 employed in the white area were to send R10 per month to his homeland. Let me add immediately that we are working at a system by means of which it will be possible for a part of the Bantu’s earnings to be remitted to the Bantu homelands. Multiply 10 by 1.646,000 and see what the amount per month is. That is why I say that there are proofs for this figure which I mentioned, namely a <i>capita</i> income of R105 in our Bantu homelands. We have made a great deal of progress in connection with the implementation of the policy of development for the Bantu homelands. Interjections. In connection with this matter I want to mention something else. Those members are making such a fuss when you state a simple fact &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; to the best of your ability, a fact which was calculated by a department with long years of experience. I want to say, furthermore, that I discussed this figure, namely R105, with Dr. Adendorff yesterday afternoon. I asked him whether he thought the figure was correct and whether I could mention that figure here. He gave me the necessary assurance, so that I can do so, because this is his view. The Transkei is, after all, not the only homeland in South Africa. What does the United Party signify with that attitude which they adopt if one brings such a simple fact such as this to their notice? They signify that they do not want it to be R105. They signify that they do not want these homelands to be developed. Now I want to quote the father of separate development. Dr. Eiselen. He is a man who has devoted his life to these matters, and he certainly cannot be accused of having said or done things with political objectives. Hon. members must listen carefully to what he said:</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that the future of this country is bright, if we as good guardians of our Bantu peoples assist them to establish themselves as progressive, prosperous neighbours as they grow up, with due regard for their social and cultural dignity, provided we do so without unnecessary delay. We cannot, however &#x2026;</block>

<p>I address this to the United Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; accomplish this task expeditiously when so many stand by belittling and ridiculing our efforts and questioning our good faith.</block>

<p><span class="col_6539-6540" refersTo="page_0417"/>I am standing here as an anthropologist too, and it gives me great pleasure to help in doing something about this matter. I take very strong exception to the good faith of the hon. the Minister, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, the members of the Bantu Affairs Commission and the officials of the Department and my own good faith being questioned in any way by anyone. These are people who are carrying out the work in a most dedicated way, while hon. members on that side of the House are sleeping. Those hon. members are the people who ridicule this policy and belittle this attempt. I quote further:</p>

<block name="quote">That is why all men of goodwill should make it their joint venture to help the Bantu achieve that self-realization which is the ideal of all self-respecting peoples.</block>

<p>I hope those hon. members will now stop with their &#x201C;fraud&#x201D; and their &#x201C;bluff&#x201D; as far as the development of the Bantu homelands is concerned.</p>

<p>Now I want to show the hon. members how we have reduced the number of Bantu in the white areas. In 1890 there was one Bantu in the whole of the Cape Peninsula. That was long before the establishment of the National Party. The number gradually increased as a result of industrial and other developments, as well as wars. Then a very extraordinary thing happened. Last year, for the first time in 78 years, the influx of Bantu into the Peninsula was stopped, reversed and changed into a back-flow to the Bantu homelands.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know this hurts, hon. members, but just keep quiet and take your hiding. In 1967 the Bantu population of the Cape Peninsula was 113,000, and in 1968 it decreased to 109,000. For the first time in 78 years there is a place in the Republic where we can show with chapter and verse that the influx has been stopped and reversed. I pay tribute to those officials for their brilliant work and for this memorable achievement which they have accomplished in the interest of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Hon. members ask what our policy is. Our policy is plain and clear, and I shall now state my policy in respect of the urban Bantu, and the policy of the department and the policy being applied by the Government, and that is that we shall continue to carry out the undertakings which we gave to help the Bantu in their homelands out to bring them to full economic and political maturity in so far as they are capable of being carried out in practice. We shall not do it at the expense of the Whites and the white homeland. Therefore we shall not yield to the pressure of those hon. members. If we were to yield to it, we would be inundated by millions of Bantu, who, as happened in the time of the United Party, would have to live under the most precarious circumstances in and around our towns and cities. That we want to prevent as far as we possibly can. I still wanted to point out to hon. members what the influx of Bantu into our white urban areas was between 1946 and 1951. It was nearly twice as much as the natural increase of the Bantu. In the period from 1951 to 1966 it was reversed as a result of the strict implementation of the Government’s policy.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I only mean that hon. members will listen to you, Sir, if you speak to them. But I want to come to the question of the additional houses, to which the Deputy Minister referred, which are being built for the Bantu in the Bantu areas. He says that the world here is becoming whiter and that it is becoming blacker over there, but I want to ask him this: How many houses have been built in the Bantu areas, and how many have been built for the Bantu in the so-called white areas over the past few years? Would the Minister, who is such a believer in the truth, tell us how many houses he has built in these areas which are now becoming whiter and in which, according to his theory, there should now have been empty houses? How many houses for the Bantu has he built in the white areas, and how many are standing empty?</p>

<p>But that is not really what I wanted to discuss. The matter I want to raise, is this: I know it is useless, because this Government regards any concession they make as a sign of weakness. To-day we have here the case that in the Western Province we have to carry on with our farming enterprises and industries under the most difficult circumstances. We are being singled out as guinea pigs by this Minister and his Deputy, because in our farming enterprises we have to make use of migratory labourers, whom we get for a year. The Minister says he is an honourable man and he believes in the truth. I want to ask him why he does not impose on the rest of the country the same restrictions he imposes on the Western Province. What does he have against the Western Province? Why does he want to save the Western Province for white South Africa and cast the rest of this vast country to the dogs, including the area where he and his children are living? Why? I believe that this Government, if it wants to be reasonable, need not budge an inch if they believe that the Bantu coming here should come on a temporary basis, but why have they steadily reduced that period, so that it is a year at present? Indeed, they have found out that this period of one year does not pay, and now they issue one with a certificate so that one may obtain the services of that Bantu for another year. This happened a short while ago. All the employer in the Western Province is expected to do, is to subsidize the Railways by sending these Bantu to and fro. One’s labour is inefficient: one cannot speak the language of these people, and they cannot speak yours.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If I remember correctly, those figures relate to the total number of registered workers in the Western Cape. Those were the figures quoted by the Deputy Minister. But I want to come back to the hon. member for Sea Point, and I shall drop the matter of this last brush with you, Sir. The hon. member compared the figures furnished by the Deputy Minister in respect of Bantu in the Western Cape to the figures furnished by the Transkei in respect of all the white areas of South Africa, and inhabitants of the Transkei also go to parts of South Africa other than the Western Cape. They furnished those figures, but the hon. member compared them to these figures, and that is sheer ignorance; it cannot be wilfulness.</p>

<p>The hon. member should not distract my attention from the subject I want to discuss with the hon. member for Sea Point. The hon. the Deputy Minister may take that matter further with the hon. member for Transkei. I want to take up with the hon. member for Sea Point a remark he made just now. He asked me, and repeated that question by way of interjection, whether the Western Cape alone had to be saved. No, we have been engaged for a very long time in saving the whole of South Africa. But the hon. member for Sea Point asked why we did not apply the principle we were applying to the Western Cape, i.e. to decrease the numbers of Bantu, to all the white areas all over the country. This is a subject I have already dealt with here, and I am not going to dwell on it again for any length of time now, but I shall once more tell the hon. member in brief. But then the hon. member must, listen to me and not sit and bite his nails nervously.</p>

<p>We stated very clearly the reason for implementing this policy in the Western Cape. The reason for that is that the Government and the Whites as such have a gigantic task in respect of the Coloureds whose numbers are increasing very rapidly and who <span class="col_6547-6548" refersTo="page_0421"/>are present in such large numbers here in the Western Cape and for whom a livelihood has to be ensured. This is not a phenomenon which is manifesting itself in exactly this way over the whole of South Africa. We do not have, in addition to the task we have to safeguard the position of the Whites, a similar Coloured problem over the whole of South Africa. In the case of the Western Cape therefore, there is a specific reason and that is the great task in respect of the Coloureds. But I have already said here, and I repeat this now, that to me that is an ideal&#x2014;not something which I now want to implement, but something I should like to see over the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point also asked me vociferously whether we had not provided many, many more houses for Bantu in the white areas. We are, of course, building houses for the Bantu all over South Africa in the urban Bantu residential areas, where necessary, but we are doing so mainly to rectify matters and to carry out clearance operations. In the Bantu homelands as many houses as possible are being built with the funds we have at our disposal, but in the white areas we apply completely different criteria, and the hon. member for Sea Point knows that. I think I have now given sufficient attention to the hon. member for Sea Point. It seems to me his nerves are such that I cannot talk to him any longer. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Sea Point keeps on alluding to my manners. He is the last person from whom I shall accept reprimands as far as my manners are concerned.</p>

<p>I should now like to say a few words with regard to the hon. member for Transkei, who was the first to speak in this debate. Yesterday, when he opened this debate, the hon. member spoke under the most difficult circumstances under which I have ever seen him speak here. I think the hon. member for Transkei owes the hon. the Deputy Minister of Justice and of Planning a debt of gratitude, and more than that, because if the hon. the Deputy Minister had not made a speech, the hon. member for Transkei would not have been able to make a speech yesterday.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am now dealing with the hon. member for Transkei and before long. I shall come to the volcano of Natal as well. The speech of the hon. member for Transkei was in fact a grand compliment to me. to the Government, to the Department and to all of us who deal with these matters, because apart from the negative reaction to the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister he had absolutely nothing else to say. This side of the House has already made short work of those remarks of his. But I nevertheless want to say a few words about the speech of the hon. member for Transkei. The hon. member suggested that all kinds of policy announcements were made by Dr. Verwoerd in his time in connection with Bantu areas and Bantu policy, and that the people did not believe Dr. Verwoerd and that a deceitful game was being played. Sir, this is not so. The public believed the words of Dr. Verwoerd, and the public still accepts the Verwoerd policy, as announced by Dr. Verwoerd and as continued by us after his death. This is proved at every election and at the coming election it is going to be proved once again. Sir, do you think that we would have been able to do all these things if the public did not accept these things &#x2014;everything we are doing under our Bantu policy in connection with education, Bantu development in the homelands, in the white areas and everywhere? If the public did not accept these things, do you think the Government would have continued them? Do you think that we would have voted more and more funds for this work if that were the case? Surely that is a foolish allegation to make.</p>

<p>&#x2026; and that we were saying at the moment, to quote his own words, &#x201C;numbers don’t count; so we learn&#x201D;. There is no one on our side who says that numbers do not count but on the other hand there is no one on our side either who says that numbers alone count. We do not say this nor did Dr. Verwoerd. We shall see before long what Dr. Verwoerd did say. It is very easy for hon. members of the Opposition to say all kinds of unfounded things here and to ride on the back of Dr. Verwoerd in that way, they who never wanted to do anything to support him in his lifetime and who are now calling him in as their ally after his death. In a little while I shall quote to you, Sir, the words of Dr. Verwoerd in connection with the numbers of Bantu in the white areas. It is recorded in Hansard; we need not make this up. At the same time the hon. member for Transkei called in a further ally for him and he said that the newspaper, <i>Die Beeld,</i> had also said that our attitude was that the policy need not be implemented and that I and other persons were perpetrating a bluff and that we would not bluff them. The hon. member for Transkei may call as witnesses as many newspapers as he wants but it seems to me that <span class="col_6549-6550" refersTo="page_0422"/>that particular newspaper has either bluffed or bewitched the United Party and him in particular. If that newspaper is of the opinion that the policy is stagnating, as I myself had also read, it does not know what it is talking about, and if any member of the Opposition echoes those words, I say the Opposition does not know what it is talking about either. Let us hear what Dr. Verwoerd said as recently as 1964 about the aspect of numbers. Sir, let me just quote something else to you in connection with the numbers, because all kinds of fictitious things are conjured up here in connection with Dr. Verwoerd and the year 1978. Dr. Verwoerd referred to the year 1978 a long time ago, and I am now going to quote to you what he said in this connection in 1958 (column 3806)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I said that it was true that the numbers of Natives were increasing in certain places, but that we had always predicted this. We had always stated that the number of Natives would continue to increase in the white area as a result of the continued industrial development. I went so far as to mention an approximate date and I said that the turning point would be reached in approximately 1978.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>That is what I said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have already heard members saying from the opposite side: Dr. Verwoerd said in 1978 there would no longer be any Bantu in white areas; we hear all kinds of variations in connection with this matter. In the same speech he said the following, more specifically in connection with the subject of integration&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In other words, whether there is integration or separation depends on the way in which you treat them and how you fit them into your labour structure and into the life of the community.</block>

<p>And in other speeches he and I and many others pointed out that since the Bantu were present in the white areas on our basis, and since we did not have a system which made! provision for placing the Bantu workers and the white workers on an equal footing either; immediately or eventually, and which consequently allowed the Bantu here on an unequal basis in the field of labour, that did not constitute economic integration with the Whites. We have said this an infinite number of times and probably I shall have to repeat it many times more. What else did Dr. Verwoerd say in connection with this question of numbers? Let us see what he said right at the beginning of the 1964 Session, on 21st. January, 1964. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have often proved already that the mere presence</block>

<p>Sir, I shall be pleased if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will also listen to this. He knows I have been waiting for him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then we are waiting for each other. That is the only thing we have in common. Dr. Verwoerd said in 1964&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have often proved already that the mere presence of larger numbers of Bantu in employment does not amount to integration. It is only when there is intermingling of those people in social life or in the political or religious spheres that one really gets integration.</block>

<p>I now omit a short passage which is not as relevant&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1950 already I mentioned the year 1978. At that time already I pointed out that if we could succeed by the year 2000 in again having the same number of Bantu in the rural and in the urban areas as we now have, that would represent a very satisfactory long-term process of development, particularly when at the same time we can give those people their political satisfaction in a different way, viz. by incorporating them in their political units, precisely as is happening now. In other words, the fact that these figures for 1960 show an increase over those for 1950 is precisely what I predicted at the time and what we have repeated over the years. It is simply ridiculous for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition suddenly to try to use this as an argument now and to say that it proves that our policy has failed.</block>

<p>The same old words we heard to-day. At that time Dr. Verwoerd said exactly the same thing I said here earlier this year and on other occasions. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition ought to remember what was said here in an argument between the former Prime Minister and himself in this very Chamber, when Dr. Verwoerd said the decisive factor was the political system under which the Bantu were present in the white areas. Since they are not politically integrated with us, since they do not have any political say in our white areas along with us in our Parliament, that is the most important safety valve for the white man and for the continued existence of all of us in South Africa. Therefore politics play a much more important role than the numbers in which they are present, however important those numbers may be. We should like the numbers to decrease. Of course we all want that and of course it is our aspiration. That is why I said here earlier this year&#x2014;and I am repeating it&#x2014;that decreasing the number of Bantu, restricting the number of Bantu in the white areas, was an extremely important matter, <span class="col_6551-6552" refersTo="page_0423"/>but I add to that statement by saying that political control over the Bantu in the white area, i.e. the fact that they do not have any political say here, irrespective of the fact whether many or few Bantu are present here, is the most important instrument in our hands. I repeat this: It is the most important instrument in our hands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Why is any decrease in numbers of any importance if the political system is the decisive factor in this regard?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course. I gave the answer here earlier this year. It is a universal phenomenon all over the world that one wants to have as many of one’s own people as possible in one’s own country and as few people, ones who cannot be assimilated, as possible from other nations in one’s own country. Surely this is a universal phenomenon. The hon. member may write this down if he cannot remember it very well; I shall dictate it to him very slowly: As many people as possible of one’s own nation in one’s own country and as few people as possible from another nation in one’s country. Sir, if the hon. member cannot understand this I shall have to try to explain this simple matter to him in private.</p>

<p>Sir, let us proceed. The hon. member for Transkei asked whether it was no longer our intention to take the Bantu back to the Bantu areas. I think I have replied adequately to that question. Of course we want as many Bantu as possible to live in their home territories and we want to take back as many of them to those territories as we are able to do in practice, and this we are doing at the fastest possible rate at which circumstances, funds and energy allow us to do. The hon. member also referred, as other hon. members had done earlier this year, to the report of the X.D.C. and reports and writings of others. The hon. member for Transkei should listen now, because I am trying to reply to him.</p>

<p>When I see what is happening here, it is extremely difficult for me to believe that the hon. member for Transkei is listening to me. The hon. member for Transkei referred to the report of the X.D.C. as well as to the reports of other people and to speeches. Those persons, the Xhosa Development Corporation, the Commissioners-General, the people of Woord en Daad, to whom he referred, are people who one and all, as I said earlier, support our policy. They are on the same road we are on; they are following the same direction we are following. They may be in more of a hurry. Many of them are in more of a hurry. That is a very typical phenomenon.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They are following the same course we are following. The fewer responsibilities such persons have as regards the direct execution of tasks, the greater their hurry usually is. I can understand that, because they are not concerned with actual practice. But now I want to say that the kind of abuse which opponents of our policy make of such well-intended remarks, such as those contained in annual reports, speeches and writings of friends of ours who are carrying out our task, is a warning to those people of how carefully they should choose their words so that their words may not be misused by malevolent people and opponents of our policy. Sir, the hon. member also said Dr. Verwoerd was opposed to using white initiative and white capital in the Bantu homelands on an agency basis.</p>

<p>The hon. member should listen to what I am saying now. Yesterday he said Dr. Verwoerd was opposed to using white initiative and white capital on an &#x201C;agency basis&#x201D;. He can check on this. It is recorded in his Hansard.</p>

<p>The words &#x201C;agency basis&#x201D; for that technique were used by Dr. Verwoerd. It is recorded in Hansard. The hon. member may check to see whether that is so. In 1962 during the debate on the Transkei those words were used by him from this bench. To say now that he was opposed to that, surely is an absurd argument.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, our policy and the policy of Dr. Verwoerd in connection with the agency basis are identical. The hon. member <span class="col_6553-6554" refersTo="page_0424"/>may do an egg dance to his heart’s content. I know that is one of the political tricks they employ. That is their so-called &#x201C;depth psychology&#x201D; which they try to apply in order to present us to the public as people who have deviated from all the other roads. As though the Opposition ought not to be pleased about something like that if it were to happen in reality!</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei also said, when he discussed section 10, that Dr. Verwoerd was the person who saw to it that section 10 was placed on the Statute Book in 1952 in its present form. With reference to that I want to put a question to the hon. member. The hon. member maintains that to-day we are inclined to deviate from the road of Dr. Verwoerd. Does the hon. member want to see that we deviate from the road of Dr. Verwoerd also as far as section 10 is concerned?</p>

We do not get the answer. Yesterday evening the hon. member for Transkei concluded his speech by referring in brief in the limited time at his disposal&#x2014;I concede this&#x2014;to what policy they would implement. But I should like to state it much more to the point for the hon. member, I can very easily refer to their policy in vague generalities just as the hon. member for Durban (Point) did earlier to-day. It seems to me the hon. member for Transkei has now become the chairman of their group.</p>

I put these questions to other people before, but apparently they did not feel like replying at that time. The hon. member for Transkei now has the responsibility and he must reply to this. Will the hon. member tell me this: If the United Party were to come into power would the United Party be in favour of making provision for each Bantu worker to be present in the white area with all his dependants on a family basis, and would those Bantu be accommodated in houses? [Interjections.] That is my first question. My second question to the hon. member is: If the Opposition were to come into power would it see to it that each Bantu occupier of a house in an urban Bantu residential area, as well as on farms, would acquire ownership of the land on which they were living?</p>

<p>I shall leave the matter at that fervently hoping that we shall later hear more about this in proper speeches from that side. The hon. member for Transkei should listen now, because I still have a third question I want to put to him. He is prepared to reply to the first two questions now. I should also like to have the third reply please. The third question I want to put to him is: If the United Party were to come into power would it accept any other reason than employment in white areas as the basis on which Bantu could come here and remain here? In other words, would they simply allow Bantu to come and live here because they preferred the scenery here or because it was nicer here or because it was closer to the sea, or would employment be the only criterion as it in fact is under our policy? I should like to have replies from him to these three questions.</p>

<p>With that I shall leave the hon. member for Transkei. I notice that he is in a good mood, and I hope he will give me clear replies to these three questions. They need to be answered. I now come to the hon. member for King William’s Town. The hon. member for King William’s Town said the X.D.C. stated in its report that the concessions in respect of border industry areas in certain circumstances actually were insufficient for industries within the Bantu homelands. What the hon. member for King William’s Town wanted to bring to my attention is nothing special. Evidently the hon. member was not present here earlier this year, when the hon. the Prime Minister said the same thing. We have been saying this for a long time. Recently when I addressed the Chamber of Industries I made the same statement. The Government adopts the attitude that it may be necessary to grant more concessions <span class="col_6555-6556" refersTo="page_0425"/>within the homelands so as to assist industries in the homelands, than those granted in the case of similar industries in the border areas. What the hon. member tried to chase up was not a hare. We accept that this will possibly be necessary and the Government bodies concerned are giving the necessary attention to this matter. However, these border industry benefits were made applicable to the homelands only a few months ago. The hon. member wants there to be, even at this stage, one smoking chimney after the other all over the homelands.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands asked, &#x201C;Must all Bantu in the white areas be here on a basis of migratory labour?&#x201D; I shall reply to his question now and at the same time I remind him of the question I have just put to the hon. member for Transkei. I now put the same question to the hon. member for Pinelands. Are they saying that all Bantu should be present here not on a basis of migratory labour but on a family basis with a right of land tenure, etc.? My reply to the question of the hon. member is that at present it is the practice that large numbers of Bantu are already present here on a family basis. However, we do not encourage this at all, as a matter of fact, we disapprove of any further influx of Bantu to come and work here on a family basis. As far as I am concerned, the ideal condition would be if we could succeed in due course in having all Bantu present in the white areas on a basis of migratory labour only. This is our line of thought. We are thinking along those lines, while the United Party is thinking along the lines of a family basis with a right of ownership and all the Other things which that involves.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands thought he was putting a difficult question to me when he asked whether the Bantu in the urban areas accepted the policy of separate development of the Government as that policy was being implemented in the white urban areas. He asked me to furnish proof of that as the Government of the Transkei was not accepting it and was even asking for more and more land and more and more rights. Sir, one cannot hold that against the hon. member for Pinelands. He is a man who had a very nice blue-eyed-boy education here in the city always close to his mama. He does not know the Bantu as well as we know them.</p>

<p>Also close to my mama. All the same, I learnt a great deal more about Bantu than that hon. member did. After all, it is no more than customary. I do not know why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is objecting to this now. I have always thought of the Leader of the Opposition as someone with some sense of humour, but it seems to me he no longer has even that. The hon. member for Pinelands and I understand each other well. We do not get the least bit upset about such matters. If the sense of humour of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is such that this upsets him, there is something wrong with him. I want to tell the hon. member for Pinelands that this is a typical phenomenon. It is a characteristic of the Bantu that where-ever he comes across one he asks one for something. Even when he does not meet one he still asks. The requests never stop.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased the hon. member challenged me on this point of acceptance. As far as the Bantu are concerned, they may be divided into two main categories, i.e. those in the homelands and those in the white areas. In all the homelands we have already placed the Bantu an on active basis of self-government in terms of our policy. They have accepted that unanimously. Under a year ago an election in the Transkei was won by the Transkeian Government on the basis of separate development, as introduced by us and as accepted by them. Also in the other Bantu areas this is the case. Recently, in December, with the establishment of the Tswana territorial authority at Mafeking we heard from the mouth of the chief executive councillor, Chief Lucas Mangope, an off-the-cuff statement that the acceptance of our policy by them was something in which they believed implicitly. This holds true of all the Bantu areas in South Africa.</p>

<p>Let us examine to some extent the position in the white areas. Here we have much more evidence of the acceptance, broadly speaking, of our policy by the Bantu in the white areas than we have of the acceptance by the Bantu of the policy of the Opposition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. the Minister? The hon. the Minister must please explain how he can say that the Bantu, even the party of Matanzima, are accepting a policy in terms of which they are taking what they can get but are demanding much more?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There is, after all, only one clear test of this under the sun, and that is whether the Transkei is peacefully proceeding with the implementation and realization of this policy, as entrusted to them by us in their Constitution, and whether the other Bantu authorities are doing likewise. They are doing this everywhere. Never before have we had such peace and co-operation from the <span class="col_6557-6558" refersTo="page_0426"/>Bantu authorities in the homelands as we have been having during recent years. Now, will the reason for that be that they are not accepting the policy, and want more and more? Or will the reason for that be that they are implementing what they can get within the limits of the policy?</p>

<p>I want to read to hon. members a statement made in the urban Bantu residential area of Mamalodi in Pretoria after the advisory boards of those townships at Pretoria and from other places in the white areas had undertaken an organized tour through the Bantu homelands and the urban Bantu residential areas in the white areas and had investigated many things. On their return the following statement was made, which I am quoting from a Bantu newspaper, <i>The World,</i> of 28th May, 1965&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In its official report the Board praises the Government left and right on what it has done for Africans of the Republic (not only &#x201C;of the homelands&#x201D;).</block>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I said it was the Mamalodi board of Pretoria. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The report also sings praises about the housing facilities, modern universities and their results, irrigation schemes, industries, etc.</block>

<p>This is one piece of evidence. I cannot read everything. I do not have the time to do so. I shall now read another piece of evidence of a recent date, i.e. 16th October, 1968, dealing with a matter about which hon. members opposite are trying to arouse strong feelings, and that is the plan which has been put into operation at Pietersburg to have all the Bantu workers employed in the white town of Pietersburg live and sleep in the Bantu homelands and no longer in the backyards of Whites. The report reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bantu support White Nights of the North. (This is the newspaper heading). The management of the town’s Bantu residential area wrote a letter to the new Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, Dr. Piet Koornhof, in which it gave its full support to the plan of the town council to keep domestic servants out of the back yards of the town at night.</block>

<p>I mention another example which deals with work in exclusively white areas and not about money spent in the homelands. I once again quote from <i>The World</i> of 30th March, 1965&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The 2,000 residents of Meyerton, the smallest township in the Vaal complex, are to be moved to the former white dorp of Residensia, in about three months, and for all the move cannot come too soon.</block>

<p>This is the clearance and removal of an old, dirty urban Bantu residential area, Meyerton, which has been moved from there to the vicinity of Evaton. In this report they say that they accept this and cannot wait to be removed. In the meantime they have been living peacefully at the new place for quite some time. These are people who support our policy. I shall read to hon. members from another letter from the chairman of the other Bantu residential area in Pretoria, i.e. Attridgeville and Saulsville. He wrote this letter to a newspaper in which he stated, <i>inter alia,</i> the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is becoming progressively clear that the Government does not have at heart only the interests of the white man, but wants to create the opportunity for a happier life for all of us. I should like to see the people who say our Government is not good to us.</block>

<p>Just listen. This man is older than one thinks. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe the previous Government could have learned a great deal from the present Government.</block>

<p>This was said in 1967. Let us now examine further examples. During the past year we had the very pleasant experience, after our department had contacted certain of the large urban areas in which profitable Bantu beer industries were in operation, that large sums of money were donated to our department, with the consent of either the Bantu advisory board or the existing urban Bantu board, to <span class="col_6559-6560" refersTo="page_0427"/>be spent in the Bantu homelands. This was done with the consent of the Bantu and those people. I have here with me a long list of places that made contributions from their profits on beer. This was done by, for example, places such as Benoni, Boksburg, Klerksdorp, Krugersdorp, Potchefstroom, Roodepoort, Springs, Welkom, Estcourt and a whole number of other places. Tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of rand were donated to carry out development work in the Bantu homelands. Do you think, Sir, those Bantu boards would have consented to the money raised there from profits on beer to go to the Bantu homelands if they were not supporters of our policy? These are all urban areas.</p>

<p>I want to read to hon. members a single case of what a Bantu business man said in 1964. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Matthews, a former Port Elizabeth municipal clerk, owns a dry-cleaning factory in Zwelitsha.</block>

<p>It should be remembered that he used to be a clerk in a sophisticated job in Port Elizabeth. Now he is sitting in Zwelitsha. I proceed&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, I have furnished evidence up to 1968 and I have evidence up to 1969. I have a great deal of evidence which is of the most recent date. Does a date matter to the Leader of the Opposition? Should the Natives be saying this for the first time to-day? They have been saying for many years that they support our policy.</p>

<p>I have here a long letter to <i>The Star.</i> This one was published. In this letter a Native from Johannesburg writes of the way in which they are supporting our policy. I have another letter as well which was addressed to <i>The Star</i> but which <i>The Star</i> refused to publish. It then had to be published in another newspaper. Apparently it was not welcome reading matter. I have here two letters from Bantu clergymen. These come from the ranks of the churches. I am not going to mention any names. I referred to one of these cases before. Here I have one from a church which is mainly of English origin. After their synodal meeting this person wrote an unsolicited letter to me. This Synod Moderator who wrote to me said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our denomination expresses its loyalty to you, Sir, and the Government of the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<p>This is what he wrote to us and I do not want to make any further quotations from this letter. I should not like to make the origin of this letter recognizable. Here I have a quotation from <i>Die Kerkbode</i> of 1967, in which a Bantu Minister of religion wrote as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that the only just policy which can benefit both the Bantu and the Whites is separate development.</block>

<p>This person writes from a white area. He says separate development can do good for specific reasons. He mentions a whole number of these reasons. I only want to quote a few of these. They are (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Its object is the welfare of the Bantu;</li>

<li>(2) Racial purity depends on the policy of separate development;</li>

<li>(3) National awareness and unity are created by means of separate development;</li>

<li>(4) It is a matter of law and justice;</li>

<li>(5) The Bantu people prefer separate development.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then he says, <i>inter alia,</i> the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Through the policy of separate development the Bantu may develop into a happy and carefree community. They must also retain their identity, language and self-respect and not become artificial, third-class white men.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban (Point), who has just made that childish remark, is known to us for his childishness. Earlier to-day the hon. member spoke in exactly the same vein&#x2014;&#x201C;What about a few furrows and a few fences?&#x201D; By saying that he wanted to give out that that was all that was happening in the Bantu areas. By doing that the hon. member is not impressing even his own people. Of course, he does impress himself and that is the only thing that counts as far as he is concerned. As far as the urban Bantu are concerned, I should like to mention to hon. members another very important phenomenon. This is a very fine phenomenon as it illustrates to a I in what way Bantu in the urban areas are promoting ties with their own homelands. During the past five to six months we experienced the promotion <span class="col_6561-6562" refersTo="page_0428"/>of ties between the Bantu in the white areas and Bantu authorities in the homelands by means of the appointment of the representatives of authorities and the establishment of boards consisting of such representatives. In this way the Venda and the Tswana have already established boards in the white areas up in the Transvaal in order to give representation on those boards to members of their respective Bantu nations who are in our white areas so as to create ties with their own homelands. There their interests are being promoted by their authorities. This is something which has been put into operation through earlier legislation we have been unable to implement before now. This is a very striking example of the way in which the Bantu in the urban areas are accepting our policy. By those means they have ties with the Bantu areas. I know members of the Opposition hate to hear this kind of thing. They will hear more and more about this.</p>

<p>Now I repeat my stock question to members of the Opposition. I have now given hon. members a whole number of examples of a great deal more evidence we have to show that the Bantu in the urban areas and in the homelands are, broadly speaking, accepting our policy. Now please mention only one example to me, either from the homelands or from the white areas, of any responsible Bantu body saying that it accepts the policy of the United Party of white leadership over the Bantu for ever, i.e. that the Bantu should be subservient for ever in a large common integrated South Africa under the white man. Prove that to me. We shall not get proof of that because they do not want that.</p>

The hon. member for Durban (Point) mentioned a few undertakings&#x2014;&#x201C;furrows here and fences there&#x201D;&#x2014;to use his words &#x2014;and asked whether that was all that was happening to cause 12 or 13 million Bantu in South Africa to develop.

<p>That was the whole theme of the farcical attack of that hon. member. I repeat, he tried to create the impression that altogether too little was being done and that were going about it in a completely wrong way. At the first signs of an election, however, he is the first to go and tell people that we are doing too much for the Black people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) as well as the hon. member for East London (City) said quite a great deal about agricultural <span class="col_6563-6564" refersTo="page_0429"/>development. In connection with agricultural matters in the Bantu areas I want to say that I in particular, but also my predecessors and our Department, attach very much value to the agricultural potential of the Bantu area as something extremely essential. Particularly those of us who deal with this matter every day, know how difficult it is to get the Bantu so far as to practise agriculture in a reasonably scientific way. There are many reasons for that, ones which I cannot discuss in detail now. I want to tell the members of this Committee that I, as well as the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, have made it our double duty, especially during the past year, to go into the agricultural affairs or the Bantu areas with greater concentration. In this way we have conducted several discussions with our officials. I should like to mention to hon. members how I and our Department see matters related to agriculture. As I have said, it is extremely essential, of course, as a primary economic activity in the Bantu areas. Therefore it is necessary to understand very well that however important it may be to develop agriculture, it cannot simply be developed in any old helter-skelter way without having regard to the fact that agriculture is closely interwoven with the political, economic, social and cultural activities of the Bantu people. It is an important inherent cultural factor of their chieftainship and their structure of government in their areas. We are nevertheless of the opinion that agriculture in those areas should be developed as well as possible. For that reason I first have to lay down certain basic policies and principles to be implemented. In certain respects I have even submitted certain innovations to be introduced in respect of agricultural development. It will behove the hon. member for Kensington and the hon. member for Houghton to pay some attention to what I am saying. The hon. member for Kensington may go and talk to the member for Houghton just now. After all, it ought to be more interesting outside than here. [Interjections.] If the hon. member listens to me, he will hear something and then I shall finish soon.</p>

I am sorry I am getting under their skins to such an extent: I did not know their skins were so thin and I thought I would have more trouble getting under their skins.</p>

<p>We have to take into account the following principles as far as agricultural development in the Bantu areas are concerned. The Bantu’s tradition of communal action has to be fully utilized in creating suitable organizations in which Bantu farming activities can best be practised. In this connection special attention has to be paid to the co-operative movement so as to make possible on this basis a proper pattern of organization for agricultural development in the Bantu areas. Linked to this co-operative idea is the principle of agricultural development, generally speaking, having to take place as a communal development. Whereas it is a good thing to develop and uplift the entire agricultural community step by step rather than to uplift only individuals who may be doing well, it is nevertheless necessary to have the individuals who can do well undergo the possible development. In addition we say active attention should be given to the provision of basic farming requirements such as tractive power, credit, etc. This should preferably be done by this cooperative movement of the Bantu. In addition we say the proposals for the provision of credit approved by me and the hon. the Deputy Minister should be carried through and taken a step further and that the necessary proclamations to do so are being prepared. This has to be done so as to enable more active steps being taken on a co-operative basis also in connection with the provision of credit to Bantu bodies in order to promote Bantu development in the homelands. Whereas the traditional system of the Bantu is tribal land-tenure and whereas this should not be destroyed as it is such an interwoven factor in their culture, it must be realized that all Bantu placed on land by the tribe will not necessarily be good farmers. In so far as there are individuals amongst them who are not successful farmers, they have to be removed from the agricultural industry and this should preferably be done by bodies established by the Bantu themselves under their system of Government.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is hardly possible for me to make myself heard. If hon. members want to listen to this, they may do so, but if they do not want to listen, they may go and have coffee. We have sufficient members here to form a quorum. That is the pathetic spectacle of the Opposition. They come here and they say that our policy has failed whereas they cannot prove that. They are not able to listen to what I am saying nor are they polite enough to do so. The Opposition may say what they like, what I have to say here, I shall say and I shall proceed as I please.</p>

<p>It is advisable that the Bantu farmers who are failures should be removed from the agricultural community, from the agricultural industry, but not necessarily from the tribal <span class="col_6565-6566" refersTo="page_0430"/>background. They should continue to have in an approved way their own residential rights, even if they have to go and work somewhere else, either inside or outside that area. The important matter in connection with the development of the agricultural industry in the Bantu areas depends on three aspects which are interwoven. These are the maximum absorption of the people into the agricultural industry, i.e. maximum activity, the participation of the people in the development programme and, thirdly, maximum agricultural production under the circumstances. It is our task to strike a balance between these matters, and this is no easy task, but one, as the Deputy Minister quoted here this afternoon from the address of Dr. Eiselen, which is definitely being made more difficult for us by the negative and destructive criticism expressed and attitudes adopted by the Opposition, as we have seen them do in this House and outside. I should like to tell hon. members opposite in a friendly and polite way that after the remarks which have just come from the front benches about the length of my speech, I shall not for the sake of the patience and convenience of the Opposition itself, reply to a single question put to me by way of interjection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton put a few questions to me. She said we allowed too great a flow of people to the homelands. &#x201C;We are flooding the homelands with Bantu without proper planning.&#x201D; She once again mentioned the Limehill area as an example. Earlier this year we dealt fully with the Limehill question, so conclusively that it has never again raised its head subsequently. On this occasion I again want to say to the hon. member what I effectively said on previous occasions, and that is that people who have to be resettled from black spots and from squatters’ conditions are not sent to the Bantu areas without there having been any advance preparations. We prepare for them the places in which they are to live. We prepare health facilities for them, even trading facilities, schools, water, etc.</p>

<p>The hon. member says this is not true, but then she does not know what the truth is The hon. member paid a short visit to Limehill. Shortly after she visited Limehill I went there, in January this year, and I want to quote to hon. members what one of the chiefs there told me himself. He is the leader and who is the person who has most right to speak to me on behalf of his people at Limehill? That person is the chief, of course, who speaks there in the presence of his councillors who will remove him, according to their tradition, if he says anything wrong. What did the chief tell me at Limehill on 17th January He said he appreciated the fact that he and his large number of people had been brought to Limehill&#x2014;and this is at Limehill itself&#x2014;by the Department, &#x201C;because, Sir, I was a squatter on an Indian’s property, and my stay there, where I came from, was painful&#x201D;. He then pointed to a school building and said one of his councillors had asked him whether that school had been built for them as it looked like a white man’s school. But the hon. member says we have not prepared things.</p>

<p>That is the last thing I shall tell that hon. member. Another thing I want to tell the hon. member for Houghton is that that same chief also made the following statement to me after he had discussed the school: &#x201C;We are here under better conditions than before; it is very much different here from before, and we thank the Government for all this.&#x201D; This he told me in front of his home where we were having a discussion under a tree. The same chief told me that we heard many stories of diseases and death amongst his people but that people spoke many untruths; we should really not believe everything. He said: &#x201C;Sir, here are even people who say they are shedding tears&#x201D;. And do you know what the chief said then? This is very significant. He said years ago there were wasted tears of people who cried about the removal from Sophiatown at that time, and that in Limehill wasted tears were also shed needlessly about their removal to Limehill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton also paid a visit to Stinkwater and Klipgat beyond Pretoria. She paid those places a visit and subsequently she came to see me and she was so confused about what she had sen there that she even pronounced the names incorrectly! The hon. member is still recalling this blushingly. [Interjections.] I want to say to the hon. member that the best advice I can give her as regards her meddling in Bantu affairs is the words of the wise apostle Paul to the Corinthians. She told me I liked to quote from the Bible and now I am going to quote from the Bible and I am not apologizing for the fact that the quotation comes from the New Testament. But the wise apostle Paul wrote the following to the Corinthians and I am making this applicable to her. &#x201C;And if they (women) will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church&#x201D;. I think the hon. member should get more information at home; she is confusing these things. </p>

<p><span class="col_6567-6568" refersTo="page_0431"/>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) only made one statement to which I need reply. In point of fact I have already dealt with this matter, i.e. his reference to the intellectuals who were allegedly agitating for acceleration. We are pleased that there are people who are agitating for acceleration. We are doing everything within our power to undertake development at as fast a rate as possible, but the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) will find no consolation in going to Woord en Daad and Sabra and those people, because these are not people who support his policy. They do not want a more rapid implementation of policy in order to arrive at his policy; they want that in order to implement our policy. But I want to say to the hon. member that he should exercise greater care in his discussions of Bantu affairs, because I have a report here in which he is mentioned as a member of the shadow Cabinet of the United Party, as the shadow Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. And do you know what, Sir? In this shadow Cabinet the hon. member for Transkei is not even mentioned as the shadow Minister of Native Affairs; evidently they did not regard him as being good enough for that portfolio. They gave him Justice.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me look again, Yes, the hon. member is correct. Here for the first time in my life I have made a mistake with regard to the Opposition. Evidently they did not even trust him with Justice, because they gave him the Interior portfolio. The one to whom they gave Bantu Administration has as yet not even attended the whole of this debate. He is Dr. Jacobs. Now this is what one has if someone finds some joy in the future of the Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River is the last person to whose remarks I still want to react before resuming my seat to the delight of the Opposition. The hon. member for Mooi River gave me a very strong suspicion this afternoon that the hon. member for Windhoek should write his name down as one of the remaining four liberalists in the United Party to whom the hon. Senator referred in the Other Place. The hon. member for Windhoek said the hon. Senator Swanepoel had spoken of five liberalists in the United Party, and it seems to me that the hon. member for Mooi River is the ringleader of the remaining ones who were not mentioned. The hon. member for Mooi River was duly taken to task by the hon. the Deputy Minister, Mr. Vosloo, but I should like to refer to two small points raised by him. The hon. member said that Bantu were forced back to the &#x201C;rural areas of the reserves&#x201D;, away from civilization and away from urbanization. I said here before and proved my statements with statistics that during the past eight to ten years we had started to create an urbanization process in the homelands by means of the work done by our Department in establishing large Bantu towns in the homelands, because the Bantu also want towns and very likely also cities, but why should those cities be the Johannesburgs and the Cape Towns and the Bloemfonteins? Those cities must be the Umlazis and the Garankuwas which are the cities and towns of the Bantu. We are doing this and therefore we already have more than 100 Bantu towns which are developing in the Bantu areas, and not all the Bantu are returning to lonely huts in the rural areas of the Bantu homelands; they also go to large towns where they can live in Bantu urban conditions.</p>

<p>The hon. member is completely at sea. He should have some regard to that aspect as well, and in those towns, I may mention in passing, the Bantu are given even land tenure.</p>

<p>The last point of the hon. member to which I want to react is his reference to land tenure when he said the Bantu ought to be able to obtain land tenure in the white areas as well, according to the policy of the United Party. The Deputy Minister replied to that.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We know, and this has been put in writing, that it is the policy of the United Party that Bantu living in the urban Bantu residential areas, such as Langa and Nyanga and Soweto, should be able to obtain land tenure of the properties they are occupying. This is the policy of the United Party, and if it is no longer their policy I want to hear that this afternoon. I shall welcome it if that no longer is their policy. But it has been recorded that that is their policy. Now I want to tell the hon. member this. He brought in the 1936 Act as support for what he was advocating, but the 1936 Act does not cover that. The 1936 Act refers to the 7¼ million morgen of land to which the Deputy Minister referred, and that land is being added to the Bantu homelands from adjacent areas. But if he wants to give all the premises occupied by Bantu in the urban Bantu areas within the white areas to the Bantu as well so that they may have land tenure in those areas, then hundreds of thousands of morgen of land in South Africa not included under the 1936 Act will be added as land for the Bantu. Does the Opposition want to make that possible? That is the direct meaning of that statement of his; that is the direct meaning of their policy, i.e. to say that the Bantu should obtain land tenure in the Sowetos and in the Langas and in the Guguletus, and I say that land is land they want to give the Bantu in addition to the 7¼ million morgen of land, and for that reason, amongst numerous other reasons, there is no prospect for them of ever making something like that possible in this country.</p>

<p>Sir, there are some of us who next week will be celebrating <span class="col_6569-6570" refersTo="page_0432"/>the fact that it is 21 years since we became Members of Parliament. I must say that in all that time I have never heard a more extraordinary reply from a Minister than we have had from the hon. the Minister this afternoon. After all, there are only three or four questions with which we are really concerned. The first is: What is the Government’s policy? The second is: Is it succeeding? The third is: What is the effect on the Bantu? The fourth is: If it is not succeeding, what is the alternative? Sir, what is the policy of the Government? We have this eternal argument about whether it is the policy of the Government to reduce the number of Bantu in the white areas, yes or no. We had a statement from the hon. the Deputy Minister of Planning on this question of numbers. Sir, where do we stand? The Minister says that numbers only are not important. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Planning certainly seemed to give the impression in a speech which he delivered that numbers did not matter.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not know what he is squealing about. If numbers do not matter, why are the Rapportryers and Professor Rhoodie so upset; why are his own newspapers so upset? Sir, all we want from this Government is something that is simple. The Minister says that numbers only do not matter; what matters is the number of unassimable people in your so-called white area. Well, fine. Now will the Government tell us this: If that is what matters, what is their programme; what is the time-table for reducing those numbers; what will it cost to reduce those numbers; what is the yardstick that is going to be applied in deciding whether or not the policy is working? What happens if the Bantu in the reserves cannot absorb development, or civilization, or whatever it is, fast enough to give employment to their natural increase and they keep flowing out? We have had no answer to this from the hon. the Minister. We have had a whole lot of vague generalizations, giving us no indication at all of the speed at which this policy is going to be developed. The hon. the Minister says that they are going to develop at the fastest possible rate, and if that rate is not sufficient to absorb the natural increase of the Bantu in the reserves, as he knows very well and as the Deputy Minister knows very well it will not be, what happens? Has the policy succeeded or has it failed? That is all we want to know. It is just as simple as that: Is the policy succeeding or is it failing?</p>

<p>Throughout this debate the Opposition’s theme for their attack on the Government’s policy was concentrated on the so-called failure and impracticability of the policy of separate development or parallel development. They have never made a proper study of the factors determining the policy. I think the time has now arrived for us to inform these hon. gentlemen better. I am now going to mention to the Opposition all the factors which the Government had to consider <span class="col_6573-6574" refersTo="page_0434"/>carefully and put straight in the implementation of its policy of separate development. We cannot simply proceed in a topsyturvy fashion. There has to be proper planning. I shall say more about this later on. We as the guardians of the non-Whites must see to it that it is possible for them to make a proper living in their homeland, and that they will also be happy there. Sir, in this House we have the strange phenomenon that the Opposition acts here as the champions of the Bantu, but when they are out there in the rural areas, they accuse the National Party Government of doing too much for the Bantu and of being nothing but a lot of negrophilists. Sir, take note of the swear-word or the term of abuse &#x201C;negrophilist&#x201D; used in this instance.</p>

<p>Sir, unfortunately I have to interrupt my speech so as to refer to what the hon. member for Pinelands said here in his speech, in which he levelled the accusation at the National Party Government that its whole Bantu policy was confused, if I understood him correctly. In my opinion the policy of the United Party is confused, and not that of the National Party. Permit me, Sir, to quote here a brief passage taken from the <i>Star</i> of 19th March, 1963. I should like to quote here what the hon. member for Yeoville said on that occasion. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party would give representation in Parliament to any group who make an economic contribution to the country and has reached a certain standard of civilization.</block>

<p>Sir, that is why we say that the Opposition’s policy creates confusion, because just listen to what they say here. Here he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the moment the United Party is prepared to give Africans 12 representatives in Parliament. In addition we promise to keep the destiny of this country in the hands of the civilized people.</block>

<p>Who these civilized people are, the Opposition conveniently omits to say. It can be anybody. According to their policy this may perhaps be a reference to the non-Whites.</p>

<p>Sir, while I am on this point, I must also come back to the hon. member for Mooi River. He also created confusion with his speech. This is also clear proof to us of how confused the United Party is in respect of their policy. The hon. member even referred to the Mau Mau when he launched this attack. He interceded for the non-Whites by telling them that they would have the right to demand more land from us. Now I want to put this question to the hon. member: Is he prepared to make, on a numerical basis, a <i>pro rata</i> distribution or allocation of the land of South Africa to all races? Is he prepared to grant the non-Whites a <i>pro rata</i> share of the land, even in the white areas of South Africa? Is he in favour of that? Would he, in terms of his policy, be prepared to hand over willingly his farm to the non-Whites? He makes a lot of statements here, and he rises here as the intercessor for the non-Whites so that they may be granted the right to make demands for more land. The Opposition goes further, and in an attempt to justify their statements they quote figures <i>ad nauseam.</i> In this regard I should like to quote what the hon. the Minister said in a previous speech. I think that this is of cardinal importance. He said (Hansard, No. 1, 1969, col. 44)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A further task is to determine the method in regard to how the separation between Bantu and Whites in South Africa should take place on a social, economic, educational, political and residential level &#x2026; We must see to it that we do the right thing and not burn the midnight oil working out figures.</block>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister referred to what had happened in 1956. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far back as 1956 no less a person than Dr. Verwoerd, who discussed those figures and dealt with those matters here, emphasized in this House, and to an even greater extent subsequently, that the figures were not the most important thing. Politics was the most important thing, as I have just outlined to you.</block>

<p>Here I want to agree wholeheartedly with the hon. the Minister. The political separation between the Whites and the non-Whites is of cardinal importance. These stories of cows which are dying of hunger and of Bantu women who have to live in huts with floors smeared with dung, are small things. These things are of cardinal importance for the survival of the Whites and for justice to be done to the non-Whites. The entrenchment of the white Government in the white areas must be ensured, and it must have preference in all circumstances. We are now speaking of a white nation. I should like to refer to a speech made by the late Dr. Verwoerd on Thursday, 17th August, 1961, on the occasion <span class="col_6575-6576" refersTo="page_0435"/>of the opening of the National Party Congress in Pretoria. This is proof of how the existence of the Whites should, according to us, be protected. A newspaper report on this speech reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd said last night that the South African nation was made up of white people&#x2014;&#x201C;but I do not say that to disparage any other racial group&#x201D;. He was opening the Transvaal Congress of the Nationalist Party in Pretoria. Dr. Verwoerd said the Republic &#x201C;has made certain that we&#x2014;all of us&#x2014;are Nationalists&#x201D;. Nationalists &#x201C;are people who believe in one nation and who love that nation and who, therefore, believe in the country of that nation. The first factor in the policy of this party in the election&#x2014;and for the future&#x2014;is to develop and strengthen this feeling of common nationhood, this unity of one nation, one white nation of South Africa&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It is our primary duty to ensure that the white civilization here in South Africa will be perpetuated. That is the big reason why the National Party is undertaking the policy of separate development with so much vigour and so much faith. If the Opposition had any formula, or an alternative policy, which they could propose or on the basis of which they could launch their attacks, they would still have a case to put forward, but they do not have it. In my opinion the Government acted very wisely in handling this whole colour question with extreme caution and singleness of purpose. If they had not done that, where would we have been to-day? We would probably have been in the same position as that in which some of our Black neighbour states find themselves. Proof to that effect is the absolute contentedness and goodwill found amongst the various population groups in our country. Whenever some or other statesman of our own country refers to that, the Opposition smiles sardonically and refuses to believe it. But allow me, Sir, to quote from a report of what a world famous person said, i.e. &#x201C;Monty&#x201D;, Field Marshal Montgomery. The report of his speech in <i>Die Transvaler,</i> read <i>inter alia,</i> as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African Government’s policy of separate development is &#x201C;a plan which is worth analysing and studying very carefully&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down has asked whether we favour a <i>pro rata</i> division of the land of South Africa. Sir, I wonder where he has been these last 20 years. Is he a Rip van Winkel? He knows that is nonsense. It has never been the policy of this party, and it is not the policy of this party. Then he said that the important thing is &#x201C;politieke skeiding&#x201D;. Sir, up to a point that is true, but where is this leading to? If it is going to lead to sovereign independence for the Bantustans, where they will have the opportunity to make treaties with Communist China and Russia, is it going to save white civilization here in South Africa? Then he stated that the important thing is to maintain white civilized standards here in South Africa. I want to say that there is no policy that places white civilization here in South Africa, in greater danger than that of this Government. That is the snag.</p>

<p>Prior to that, I think we had made up our minds to some extent as to what we thought the policy of the Government was. I think we had reached the conclusion that it was failing. We were trying to find what its effect on the Bantu was. The hon. member who has just sat down, has told us again how happy and how satisfied they all are&#x2014;with proclamation 400. Will he not make an appeal to this Minister to repeal proclamation 400? Then we shall see whether they are satisfied and happy or not.</p>

<p>Sir, this hon. gentleman is Deputy Minister of Justice, and he is talking such nonsense in this House. He has not taken the trouble to read the proclamation or the Bill. Can he tell us such absolute nonsense? Sir, let us deal with the effect of this policy on the Bantu people themselves. Let us come back to this question of the standard of living which I raised with the Deputy Minister. As I sat down, it seemed to me that the hon. the Deputy Minister said that the average income of the Bantu in the reserves was R105 per annum. Is that per earner or <i>per capita?</i></p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Now we are in very serious trouble, Sir, because the average earner supports a family of four. The income in the reserves must therefore be R26 <i>per capita.</i> Sir, I cannot accept his figure. I think his figures are totally wrong. Let us be more optimistic, Sir, Let us come back to the Chairman of the Bantu Development Corporation. May I quote what we dealt with once before in this House? I think this whole issue was raised last year. We then had great claims from various Ministers that there was development in the reserves. They talked of the tremendous improvement. We spoke about <span class="col_6577-6578" refersTo="page_0436"/>the forecast and the estimate made by Prof. Tomlinson in the years 1950 to 1951 that the average income of Bantu in the reserves, and not over the whole of South Africa, was R48 per head, not per earner. This included all members of a family. Then, Sir, last year we dealt with figures given by Dr. Adendorff, the chairman of the Bantu Development Corporation, fifteen or sixteen years later, and we find that the average income, as it worked out then, was approximately R53 per head. That is an increase of R5 per head over a period of 15 or 16 years. If one has regard to the value of money, one finds that that means their real income is less than it was 15 or 16 years ago. That is how separate development is succeeding.</p>

<p>Then we had the claim from hon. members opposite that the standard of living of our Bantu in the reserves was higher than any other state in Africa. On that account, we went and looked into various figures from other states in Africa, supplied by the Africa Institute. I said at that time, Mr. Chairman, that it gave me no pleasure whatever to give these figures. But I think they should come before this Government and this Minister. If the Minister can disprove them, I will be the happiest man in this House.</p>

You see, Sir, it is so totally wrong. When we judge whether this policy is working or whether it is not working, we have to have regard to figures of this kind.

<p>I would be so happy, because Dr. Adendorff dealt with this question and said that of the R53, R22 was earned in the reserves and R31 sent back by workers from outside. So, if the hon. gentleman can give me different figures, I would be only too happy to accept them. But this shows an extremely low standard of living. What is R53 per year? About R1 per week. How does one live on that? Is that a sign of development? Does that mean these reserves are being developed to a point where there is prosperity, where they are becoming viable? Does that show that this policy is a success? Mr. Chairman, I am afraid we have reached the stage that the only judgment we can give on this policy so far, is that it has been an abysmal failure. All the words and all the excitement of the hon. the Minister have not convinced us of anything different to-day. The time has come to find an alternative, and the only alternative is that which the United Party is providing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred here to the standard of living of the Bantu. The hon. the Deputy Minister has already quoted figures which I believe to be quite correct. If one wishes to discuss the standard of living of the Bantu, there are many other aspects which must also be taken into account. The Bantu can only raise their standard of living if the potential is created for them for developing their own homelands, and, in the second instance, if they are afforded the opportunity of developing their know-how. Only then would there be the potential for attaining a higher standard of living. Now we know, surely, that it is the policy of the Government to create, by means of the various Bantu investment corporations, sufficient financial resources and sufficient financial possibilities for the Bantu in the homelands. This is not something that can be effected overnight. The Bantu’s ability and know-how must also be developed before a rise in their standard of living may be expected. In addition, they are to a considerable extent lagging behind the Whites as far as their standard of civilization is concerned, but they are in fact very far ahead of the rest of Africa. They owe this to this Government’s policy of separate development.</p>

<p>An indirect reference was also made here to Proclamation 400, which is supposedly being implemented in the Transkei. This was supposedly the cause of there being political peace in the Transkei. But now I want to ask this question: Are such provisions for preserving peace and calm in our own White areas, in our own country, not found in our existing legislation and regulations as well? Then hon. members of the Opposition made <span class="col_6579-6580" refersTo="page_0437"/>this observation: &#x201C;What about Rhodesia? In Rhodesia a policy of apartheid is not being applied.&#x201D; But are hon. members not aware that there are much stricter regulations in Rhodesia than Proclamation 400 which is being implemented in the Transkei, notwithstanding the fact that they do not implement the policy of apartheid there? Therefore that is no argument.</p>

<p>However, I want to deal with another matter. It has always been a matter of top priority with this Government&#x2014;and we are grateful for that&#x2014;to improve the Black-White ratio in the urban and metropolitan areas all the time. Over the past few years we have had great success in doing so. I say &#x201C;priority&#x201D; since major social problems would have been created if we had not prevented that. But as a person from the rural areas and as a farmer I should like to call the attention of our Government and the hon. the Minister to the fact that we shall now have to pay serious attention to the inundation of the rural areas by Blacks. In saying this, I am being sincere. I am one of the people who believe very firmly in the policy of our Government, but I am also one of the people who would like to see our policy being implemented more rapidly. Over the past few years there has been further inundation of the rural areas by the Blacks as a result of certain events: industrial development, etc. It is being claimed that the present ratio is one to fifteen. Now, in its attempts at coping with this problem, the Government has also introduced certain measures, such as the abolition of the labour-tenant system. That was a very good measure, since this old tradition method of labour arrangements in the rural areas meant that Bantu labour on farms was not being utilized properly. In certain districts this has been abolished completely for quite some time. I can tell the hon. the Minister that the utilization of labour in these specific districts has shown a marked improvement. In the place of that we were given Bantu labour control boards. This contributed to considerable improvement being effected in regard to the utilization of labour on farms, because the local district labour control boards now adopt the attitude that the point at issue is no longer the actual number of Bantu registered with a farmer, but the number of Bantu he really requires for the agricultural activities on his farm. It is only on that basis that a determination is made of the number of Bantu who may live on a farm on a permanent basis. The members of the Bantu labour control board are nominated by the farmers themselves and appointed by the Minister. The farmers themselves are, therefore, serving on that board. In other words, they determine their own labour needs. This is a good, sound, democratic system. In the course of the past recess I had the privilege of observing another development in regard to the utilization of Bantu labour, i.e. the establishment of tribal labour bureaux. We visited a few of these tribal labour bureaux. We gained the impression that some of these Bantu tribal labour bureaux still had difficulty in functioning, as the Bantu had to be systematically accustomed to and acquainted with the administrative performance of this new function. In certain cases where the Bantu were better equipped, we found that it worked very well. I believe that this is a very great step forward, since by these means it is, in the first instance, possible to succeed in bringing together the labour needs and the labour supply. What is very important in this regard, is the fact that, particularly in respect of the agricultural industry, it will in due course be possible for us to make more and more use of this labour as migratory labour, on the basis of single persons. I know the hon. Opposition do not agree with that. They say that it is unreasonable and immoral for family ties to be broken down in that way. But what are the facts as regards the past? Being a migratory labourer is a tradition with the Bantu. These labour tenants we had, these Bantu who lived on farms in large numbers, sought work on a single basis, on a migratory labour basis. On most of our farms it was customary for such Bantu, once they have worked there for six months, to tell their masters that they wanted passes because they wanted to work in the towns. Then they went to Johannesburg, to Pretoria, to the urban areas where they sought employment as migratory labourers on a single basis, while their families remained on the farms for the following six months. Surely, this is nothing but a form of voluntary migratory labour. This is traditional amongst the Bantu. There is nothing the matter with our wanting to channel this process of migratory labour further, i.e. from the homelands to our farms, to enable us to improve our White-Black ratio in the rural areas. But in attempting to integrate this migratory labour with the agricultural industry, there is another very important factor to which we shall have to pay attention, i.e. that we should, if possible, train the Bantu in his homeland so that he may render proper service. It is no longer possible for us to employ labour in the rural areas on a quantitative basis. We shall also have to think of a more qualitative basis. In that way we shall effect a considerable improvement in the Black-White ratio in the rural areas.</p>

<p>I still want to mention another matter as well, i.e. the question of the present control we have in the rural areas. I want to make the statement that one of the greatest problems we have, particularly in areas where a great deal of mining development has taken place over the past few years, is a divided system of control. We have this system of Bantu labour control boards. In the Transvaal we have the peri-urban areas development board which also has a say in Bantu control in certain rural areas adjoining mining areas. The control exercised by these two control bodies, does not tally. It is conflicting and creates a <span class="col_6581-6582" refersTo="page_0438"/>great deal of confusion. I want to request that we look into this position in good time. I know that the Government is holding out the prospect of central control over labour in general being introduced by way of legislation at a later stage. We cannot permit this system of divided control over certain rural areas to continue. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. HEYSTEK</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased the hon. member who has just resumed his seat created the opportunity for me to spend some time discussing agriculture and labour problems. To begin with, a few ideas on emancipation. For example, when I read that in many circles the idea has taken root that the existence of separate nations is doomed and that they will be replaced by a worldwide nationless and raceless human community, then I can only come to the conclusion that the Opposition’s argument during the course of this debate was really an onslaught on the survival of White South Africa. I am not saying that hon. members did so with malice aforethought. On the basis of principle the National Party can cope with every imaginable change. It can deal with every new situation, and it can ward off every new onslaught as it will in fact ward off the onslaught of the Opposition in regard to this matter. Nothing can change it fundamentally, for it is too well anchored for that; it is too national in its origin, and its history is too clearly defined. The upliftment of underdeveloped countries has to-day become the warp and the woof in the relations between Whites and non-Whites. There are three aspects which are continually being emphasized in this connection. In our case as well these aspects are emphasized, i.e. that there is White trusteeship and, in the second place, that it is of a temporary nature, and, in the third place, that during this process of emancipation both Whites and non-Whites are in a transitional phase. In the process of emancipation there are three principles to which this process is anchored, the one is in the first instance that the individual being emancipated ought to have achieved a certain stage of development. That is what we have always been engaged in doing. In the second instance the proposed political system for the non-Whites must develop out of the past history of those non-Whites. That is also what we are basing our separate development on. In the third instance, the emancipation must to a large extent be supported by economic strength in those emancipated individual’s own area. In other words, the individual being emancipated must, in the process of emancipation, develop and be developed intellectually, politically and economically. I am using the word &#x201C;developed&#x201D; deliberately. Someone else also used it to-day. I want to state right at the outset that we must rid ourselves of the idea that the non-Whites must be carried by the Whites in this process to where they want to be. We must do away with the suggestion that the Whites alone must make sacrifices in this process. After all, it is in the interests of the Whites as well as the non-Whites. If the non-Whites know that all this is being done in his interests as well, then he must in the first instance welcome the inconvenience which it causes him as well as the Whites. He must accept it. He must grin and bear it. He can appraise and examine it critically, and even try to make his burden somewhat lighter. If there are deep waters in the course which this Government has adopted for the Whites and the non-Whites, they must also learn to swim. If there is heavy going they must bear up. If there are chasms, they must leap across. If there are heights, they must pant. If there is mud they must plod through. If there are crags they must climb. They cannot be carried to where they want to be. If there are dangers they must brave those dangers. In this instance it is also a question of reconciling speed with thoroughness. In the process both Whites and non-Whites must bear in mind that thoroughness must be reconciled with speed. It is a question of minding one’s step or one might break one’s neck, or not minding one’s step or another man may break it for you. There is a tremendous gap which must be bridged in this emancipationary process. The undertaking is so vast that the non-Whites have to develop from a purely subsistence economy to an industrial economy. That is the gap which has to be bridged. A subsistence economy, in its simplest form amounts to this; There is an antelope, you string your bow, shoot it, eat it and sleep. To-day’s programme of purely subsistence economy is precisely the same as yesterday’s.</p>

<p>After these introductory remarks in regard to the emancipationary process, I should also like to express a few ideas in regard to labour. The labour problem brings one, to use an idiom of our forefathers, grey hairs and sleepless nights. Although nobody wants to over-emphasize or exaggerate the dependence of agriculture on non-White labour, it is nevertheless clear that nobody can close his eyes to the fact that the many problems which we have in regard to labour have to a certain extent had an economically impeding effect on agriculture. The farmer is acquainted with the recruiting process. Sometimes it is perhaps more as a result of unsuccessful attempts to get that labour one would very much like, and less as a result of the success one achieves with it. We can mention quite a few reasons in this connection, without laying the blame before this or before that door. I want to mention only a few. A person who is perhaps not conversant with the procedure of recruiting the necessary labour is, through his own fault, going to have a frustrating time and achieve less success. Failure to comply with regulations, for example in regard to registration, dismissal and abscondence also creates problems. We know that there is an aversion to agricultural labour among the non-Whites. As far as that matter is concerned it is more a question of labour unwillingness than a labour shortage. <span class="col_6583-6584" refersTo="page_0439"/>A frantic search can be instituted for labour on an operational basis, but it is impossible to guarantee that labour. Unfortunately that cannot be done. In addition the rural areas find themselves engaged in an unequal struggle in their competition with the urban areas. The farmers cannot hope to engage in a wage war with industries and mines, just as the State cannot engage in a wage war with the private sector. The five day working week in the cities is also very attractive, in contrast with the farms where dairies for example require non-White labourers to accept a seven day working week. In most urban industries there is a five day working week. The result of this is that certain sources of labour might have to be reserved for agriculture. As soon as that is done it implies an element of compulsion and if there is an element of compulsion that labour becomes unpopular.</p>

<p>One can do a great deal to provide information. I just want to mention that between 2 and 5 October, 1967, I held seven meetings, together with Mr. Kellerman, in my constituency, in order to discuss these problems with our farmers. <i>Inter alia,</i> we listened to problems, explained policy and made procedure known. In 1968 I was in the company of a group of M.P.’s and officials, which the former speaker has already mentioned, on a visit to Groblersdal in order to visit the labour bureaux there. The way in which things are being done there was a very clear indication to us that once this matter is in full steam things ought to go much better with the supply of labour for agriculture. On 3rd November, 1967, I, and a number of my rural voters, attended a labour conference in Pretoria where, <i>inter alia,</i> the following persons took part, the hon. the Minister, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Justice, who was at that time still a full-time member of the Bantu Affairs Commission, Dr. Van Rensburg and Mr. Steyn. In addition continual discussions are being held. The other day I held consultations with the new permanent member of the Bantu Affairs Commission, namely the hon. member for Klip River, in regard to this matter, and numerous policy documents are continually being distributed in my constituency so that people will remain on familiar terms with these matters. After all this, the questions keep coming in and the replies keep going out. Actually, this problem is so deep-rooted that one cannot uproot it even with a crowbar.</p>

<p>I want to express my sincerest appreciation for the work the Department is doing in this connection, however, the future task of providing regular labour for our farms remains. I think it will help to a certain extent if employers do everything in their power to inculcate obedience of the law in their employees. We must not employ labourers if everything is not as it should be. This nevertheless happens and I do not want to put the blame on our farmers now. Sometimes for example a crop is ready to be harvested and the farmer is very vulnerable. Perhaps it begins to rain when the groundnuts are ripe, potatoes are beginning to sprout and sorghum is susceptible to weather damage. One gets hold of a group of workers and examines their documents. Perhaps these documents are not quite in order, but when one takes into account the crop, the threatening rain and the accounts which have to be paid, in regard to which they have already received warnings, then you decide to employ these people.

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come to another matter for a moment or two before returning to the questions put by my hon. Leader to the hon. the Minister a short while ago.</p>

<p>The matter I want to deal with is the question of the hospitalization of Bantu people and I want to deal purely with my own province. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what the position is in regard to the hospitalization of the Bantu people. Some six or seven years ago the previous practice of the province providing for the Bantu folk as regards hospital beds in Government hospitals and the subsidies paid to missionary hospitals, and so forth, was departed from to the extent that when under pressure it was suggested by the province that they should increase their hospital beds, the Department of Bantu Administration stepped in and forbade it. After some considerable period of negotiation it was finally agreed that the department itself would erect hospitals for the Bantu. Here is where I would like to get confirmation from the hon. the Minister as to whether this is correct or not, because I am willing to stand corrected if I am wrong. If I am wrong I would like to know what the true position is. As I am informed the position is the following. The Minister undertook to erect Bantu hospitals in suitable areas which he had selected for the purpose. He would also put up the capital for these hospitals to be built and they would be provided with all the necessary facilities. The province, however, would be asked to start them. The nursing and medical staff would be provided by the province. The Provincial Hospital Service would see to the staffing and the care. But the years have gone by and the pressure has built up and indeed it cannot be otherwise with the build up of the number of Bantu who are living in these areas. The greater the population, naturally the greater the total number of people who require hospitalization will be. When from time to time the province has been to the hon. the Minister’s department and has asked for permission to add beds to existing hospitals where there already is a department for Bantu, the hon. the Minister has refused. There are exceptions and I want to make it clear at once that I accept that there are exceptions. These exceptions have been wrong <span class="col_6585-6586" refersTo="page_0440"/>out of the hon. the Minister. This, as I have said, has been a case of the province having to allow conditions where Bantu patients are being put on the beds in hospitals, on the floor between beds and also in corridors because of the pressure of the number of sick, injured and dying in those hospitals. The hon. the Minister still would not give approval for the extension of accommodation in wards for these Bantu patients, with certain exceptions. I am not sure how many there are, but I believe that under pressure and after the precise nature of the difficulties in some of the hospitals has been considered in at any rate two and possibly three cases, as far as I know, approval has been given so that additions could be made. Bearing in mind the speech which the hon. the Deputy Minister Froneman made a year ago in this House, wherein he actually narrated the hospitals which had been approved for construction by the Department of Bantu Administration, I should like to know whether I am right when I say that there is not one hospital approaching completion in Natal? How many have been planned and which have not yet been started? What is the staffing problem that is going to be associated with the hospitals for the Bantu people? Is it true that the Minister is proposing to put up all the capital so that these hospitals can be built and thoroughly equipped leaving the staffing thereof to the provinces? Has an agreement been reached with the provinces on the matter of principle of staffing these hospitals? I think this is becoming a very urgent and burning question. It has been building up for some eight years. Except for approval in two or three cases for beds to be provided where Bantu hospital services were already in existence, nothing has been done to implement the undertaking by the Minister’s predecessor and the department. He gave the assurance that these Bantu hospitals would be constructed. It is rapidly reaching the stage of becoming something in the nature of a scandal because of the need for the department to care for its own sick people and not to leave them to the mercy of somebody else. I know the hon. the Minister’s difficulty of finding medical and nursing personnel. He does not have them and he cannot get them, for very good practical reasons. I am not complaining about that. If he says he has come to an agreement with the provincial authorities and that they will provide the medical and the nursing personnel, under the conditions under which they are training the nursing personnel&#x2014;and they are participating in the training of the medical personnel-&#x2014;then I can understand from a practical point of view that it is no good asking the hon. the Minister what he is going to do about staffing. I want the hon. the Minister to indicate whether he has come to an agreement with the provincial authorities. I want to know whether agreement has been reached that nursing and medical personnel will be provided by the provinces.</p>

<p>I want to move on to the question which was put by my hon. Leader. He asked the question whether the Government’s policy, that is the policy of separate development and of segregation of the Bantu in their own areas and taking them from the White areas and putting them back in their own areas, is succeeding? On the 27th of August, 1963, the late Dr. Verwoerd made the famous speech of his in Durban where he dealt with the &#x201C;policy plans for the survival of all the races in South Africa.&#x201D; According to him the principle was to separate them. He made the famous statement which I quote from time to time&#x2014;and which I want to quote again&#x2014;&#x201C;I choose partition above death.&#x201D; If the policy is succeeding, it is a case of &#x201C;partition above death&#x201D; which is the principle to which he is working as the late Dr. Verwoerd worked? I have here the speech of the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development at the opening of the Sabra Conference on the 5th of October, 1967. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government does not regard consolidation of African areas as a prerequisite to its policy of separate development or activation of the Bantu in his Self-Government.</block>

<p>The late Dr. Verwoerd has said that he chooses partition above death whereas the hon. the Deputy Minister has said that the Government does not regard consolidation of African areas as a prerequisite to the performance of its policy. The hon. Deputy Minister also took part in a by-election at Newcastle where the National majority was fortunately visibly reduced.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the course the debate on his Vote has taken so far. It is a personal triumph for him and a triumph for the National Party’s policy of separate development. In contrast, the Opposition has been proved, for the umpteenth time, to be mere plodders in the quagmire of the population mess which they advocate as a policy in respect of South Africa’s multiplicity of nations.</p>

<p>I should like to bring the problem of the unlicensed Bantu in the eastern suburbs or Pretoria which fall in my constituency to the attention of the hon. the Minister. I would just like to emphasize that I am referring to unlicensed Bantu in these areas. The best example I can give of this phenomenon appears from the fact that the Bantu buses coming from the city in the afternoon and at night are crammed to overflowing with Bantu males. However, these buses are quite empty on their return journey. In the mornings the reverse is true. Then the buses come empty from the city and return crammed full. The position ought to be the reverse. I think that this situation can be attributed to the housing shortage which exists in the Bantu areas of Pretoria. I think the time has now come for this matter to receive joint attention from the City Council and the State. I think that, with a joint effort, this matter can be solved. In the City Council of Pretoria we have a board which exercises control over a very great field of local government and which is in fact sincere in its disposition towards the Government, and which is prepared to co-operate with the Government in respect of separate development. I believe that the example which they have already set in respect of non-white management can be taken even further and can eventually serve as an example to the whole of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the example has already been set. What I am most pleased about to-day is the statement by the hon. the Minister that Bantu townships are being and are going to be developed in the Bantu homelands. I believe that this is a matter which should enjoy the greatest possible degree of priority. I view the development of such Bantu townships in the Bantu homelands as the establishment of magnets to attract the Bantu back to their own areas. To-day the young Bantu in particular are being enticed by the shining lights of the white cities. I think that they will be enticed by the shining lights of their own cities. But apart from that, the other services offered in the townships in the Bantu homelands must be such that they will make their way thence. I also believe that such Bantu townships in the homelands can in particular be developed on the borders of the homelands. Then one can imagine that such Bantu cities will become sleeping and residential cities for such Bantu as are needed in the white areas themselves. But I do think that thought will have to be given to the planning and development of a system of rapid transport for such Bantu townships in the homelands to the white areas where they must work. I think that, with a rapid transport service, such Bantu can in fact be transported within the space of an hour, and I do not think that is an unreasonable time for someone to travel from his place of residence to his place of employment. This happens everyday in the Rand areas, and between Pretoria and Johannesburg, and I think that what we expect our Whites to do, we can also expect from the Bantu. I want to advocate that this matter be given very serious consideration in the near future.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I had mentioned that the Minister dealt with the question of the lovely school built in a place like Limehill, and how he was told that it looked just like a school for white children. That is all very well, but the point I want to raise here this afternoon is the one I have raised year after year, and that is what is being done in the scheduled Native areas in my province, not in isolated spots here and there where a town is being created and urban conditions are being established for the Bantu who live there, but in the rural areas where we have the Bantu not in thousands or in tens of thousands but in scores of thousands. I have painted this picture here before when the Deputy Minister was Mr. Blaar Coetzee, and for various reasons an anticipated trip which he was to take with me fell away, the reason being that he ceased to be the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and became Minister of another portfolio. We are in the position to-day in those <span class="col_6589-6590" refersTo="page_0442"/>areas that there are scores of thousands of Bantu who are reaching the stage that they do not even have the wherewithal to build their huts. The days of the old so-called beehive hut which they built with withes and grass are gone, and they are cutting building sods from the soil around their huts and kraals and they are destroying by hundreds of acres the surface soil with the grass roots in it, because they are now using it for building purposes. They are destroying the fertile top layer of soil in their areas in hundreds of cases to-day, and it is there evident for anyone who goes to look at it. Grass will not grow again in that subsoil which has once been exposed to the air. There is not even sufficient grass to-day to roof their houses with. All sorts of makeshift arrangements are being made. What is the good of the Deputy Minister telling us about the average earnings <i>per capita</i> when these people do not even have sufficient grass to cover their huts with? they cannot plough any longer; they are not allowed to. Their cattle die in hundreds every year we have a bit of a drought and when we have a bad drought, as we had last year, they die in more hundreds. The cattle are just skeletons, skin and bone, walking around because there is no grass for them to eat. The fields produce no more crops, not only when there is drought, but monoculture has resulted in their using the same land over and over and planting it only to mealies, until all the strength is taken out of the soil. What are the Minister and his Department doing about healing that wound? This is the big issue which is facing us, and not whether there are a few Native townships being established here and there where they will build good schools, etc., and have clinics. What are they doing for the tens of thousands of Bantu who are living under these conditions? And those are the conditions under which the Bantu have to live who are endorsed out and have to go back to their homelands. What kind of a homeland is it? Is the Government proud of these homelands? The picture I paint is reality. The Minister can paint a fanciful picture here of something that is in the air, but it is time that he should go there and have a look for himself. I want to ask the Minister whether he will come down with me in the recess to look at these areas for himself?</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with the Question of water supplies. The Minister went with me to the Mkuze River, and I showed him a hole some six or eight feet deep in the bed of the river, with Bantu women dishing out water in little kettles to fill a 4-gallon drum. That was the only domestic water supply for hundreds of Bantu in that scheduled Native area. I would like to ask the Minister what the Government is doing in those areas to provide an adequate water supply for domestic purposes for the Bantu? The Minister was there and he interviewed the Bantu and he knows that his own departmental officials in that area do not know which way to turn to get assistance because of the difficulties in which they find themselves in providing water for the cattle and for the Bantu themselves. What recourse have they got?</p>

<p>What an extraordinary thing to say! What kind of a policy would it be if matters were not better in 1969 than they were in 1948! Twenty-one years have passed. I am shocked at the hon. member for suggesting a thing like that. I should jolly well think that things should be better than they were 21 years ago. What a scandal it would have been if they were worse than they were 21 years ago! And I am not sure that they are not worse in some areas, because 21 years ago there was all the water in the world in the Mkuze River and the Bantu had no trouble in getting clear water for themselves and for their cattle. But to-day the Mkuze River is a dry sand-bed. Those are the people who are suffering at present. The Minister knows. He made inquiries of his own officials and the commissioners in that area, and they have told him what the position is, but what has been done to rectify it? That is the point. We want to know whether their policy is succeeding. That is the question my hon. Leader asked, and when these things are happening I want to know whether it is success to have less and less water and less and less grazing, topsoil and building material. Is that the sign of success? I hope that the Government in the foreseeable future, with its unlimited powers and its unlimited funds, will do something practical for the big mass of the Bantu people, to help them in the scheduled Native areas which this Government calls a homeland. What kind of a homeland is the Government creating for these unfortunate people?</p>

<p>From the two speeches which the hon. member for South Coast made here, it is very clear that he does not actually have any criticism to level against this policy as such. In fact it would appear that he supports the policy. He is merely asking that we should implement it more rapidly.</p>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>He asked what was being done in respect of hospital facilities, the provision of water, etc.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to come to a few aspects which, in my opinion, could receive attention. One is that in the area around Durban there is a considerable shortage of housing for the Bantu in the Bantu areas. We are aware of the fact that it is undesirable to provide housing for the Bantu outside the Bantu areas. As you know, Sir, we have an industrial complex in the Pinetown area, in the Mobeni area and in my own constituency in Queensburgh. The position is that there is no Bantu area in the immediate vicinity of my constituency in which the Bantu who work there can be housed. I know that provision is being made for housing so that, in due course, they may live in their own area. I should like to ask here that when housing is being provided in the Dassenhoek area, provision should also be made for single Bantu, and not only for married quarters, because there are single Bantu who are working in industries or in other spheres of employment in my constituency. They will therefore not require married quarters. In my opinion it would be inappropriate to expect them to travel from Queensburgh via Pinetown, via New Germany to Claremont; in other words, that they should be housed in Claremont. I would prefer to see provision being made for housing for them in the Dassenhoek area, for those who are married as well as those who are single.</p>

<p>But then I want to go further. I want to appeal to housewives and families to abandon the practice of housing Bantu in their own backyards to an ever greater extent. In my opinion it is essential for the restrictions on the housing of Bantu servants to be applied more strictly in order to implement the policy which has already been laid down. In this connection I merely want to mention that many complaints come from numerous areas of Durban to the effect that the policy which must be implemented by the city council is not being applied strictly enough and that considerably more Bantu are still being housed in backyards than ought to be allowed. If it is still deemed necessary to employ Bantu servants, I want to make an appeal that they should be employed more on a part-time basis so as to afford them the opportunity of returning, after working hours, which should be reasonable, to their own homes, so that they may spend the rest of the day and night with their families, especially in the areas where it is possible to do this in practice. In the majority of the urban areas of Natal this is, in fact, possible. I received a letter this week from an English-speaking person in Scottburgh who said that in the mornings his servant came in by bus from a Bantu homeland area five miles away. It takes the servant half an hour to come in and at night the servant returns home. He said that it was possible in practice for all servants in that area to come in by bus in the morning and then to return in the evenings. According to this English-speaking person there is no need therefore for permission to be given any longer for the housing of Bantu in backyards.</p>

<p>Does he pay the bus fare?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>He is paid a reasonable salary so as to make that possible. I also want to advocate that we should abandon the practice of wanting cheap labour only. I am aware of the fact that as long as the facilities are available, there will always be people who will want to make use of the available facilities and who will want to employ these servants for the sake of their own personal convenience. Sir, it is detrimental to the entire South African society to grow too accustomed to luxuries. There are many people who could manage with fewer servants and with fewer services rendered by non-Whites. I want to advocate that we should do more in that direction and that, if necessary, restrictions be imposed by Government authorities so that the Whites may grow accustomed to the idea of getting along with fewer nonwhite servants or services. In my opinion it is a matter to which we must give positive attention. I am aware of the fact that it is not possible to give effect to this unless proper housing is provided for the Bantu in their own areas so that they may be housed there. We must realize that when money is provided for housing, this is done on a loan basis and that all that money must, in due course, be repaid with interest. Subsequent to that further extension can take place. In other words, this is not money which is being donated to the non-Whites; it is money which is being provided in order to establish an orderly society and to give effect to the policy of the Whites having full authority in their own areas. I want to plead for a greater measure of attention to be given to this matter.</p>

<p>Another aspect which I should like to mention is the argument which is raised by the United Party from time to time, and that is that, as a result of the employment of non-Whites in the mining industry and in our industries, it necessarily means that economic integration is taking place. Sir, it is true that the economic pattern of South Africa is based on the employment of non-Whites, but it is also a fact that Bantu from Lesotho and Botswana and even from Zambia and Malawi come to South Africa regularly on a contract basis in order to work on the mines and in the industries. If United Party supporters want to argue that economic integration has taken <span class="col_6593-6594" refersTo="page_0444"/>place because the labour pattern has developed in such a way that non-Whites are being employed in our industries, I should like to know from them whether they are prepared to interpret this on the same basis as that on which contract labourers from Botswana and Lesotho and Malawi and Zambia are employed? If they are prepared to do this, then surely we may also accept that the same principle can apply in respect of the Transkei, the Zulu area and the Tswana area, which are inside South Africa. Then this is surely not integration; it is an inter-dependence upon South Africa’s economic structure, but it is not integration. [Interjections.] We are not juggling with words; this is an aspect of principle about which the United Party could give us greater clarity in connection with their standpoint. But they would like the term &#x201C;economic integration&#x201D; to be accepted so that they may subsequently advocate, after economic integration has taken place, that we should gradually introduce a greater degree of integration in other spheres. I should like to have a reply from them on that aspect.</p>

<p>In the few minutes at my disposal I cannot devote too much time to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. He began by saying that there were obviously members on this side of the House who were now accepting the policy concerning the development of the reserves. Is he only finding this out now? I thought he knew that we have alaways accepted the fact that not only should the areas be developed, but also that this should take place more quickly. The hon. member then went further and pointed out that people from Botswana and from the Portuguese Territory are employed here on a contract basis, and he then asked why the same principle did not apply to Bantu in the Bantu areas within the Republic of South Africa. This is a strange kind of statement, Sir. The people within the country must be treated in the same way as those coming from outside! But I have no more time to devote to that.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the statement which was made this morning by the hon. member for Carletonville and which struck me very forcibly. He put certain questions to me in that connection. I asked him to return to the House and he was kind enough to do so. The hon. member for Carletonville made an alarming statement here this morning. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister and the Party opposite if this is Government policy. The hon. member said this morning that what was important was the fact that one should be able to state and project one’s policy. Then he continued and asked what United Party policy could be projected. He then said that the matters which the U.P. emphasized, i.e. how we project it, how the people must be removed and how one should treat those who remain in the white areas, were secondary and tertiary considerations. This is not the most important aspect. The most important aspect is that one has a policy of apartheid, that one implements it and can project it. Then one must prove that it can be applied. If a policy does not meet these requirements it is not a good policy. But I should like to ask the hon. member, because he will have another turn to speak, is the fact that there are 3.8 million people here, who can be removed because they are unemployed, really of secondary and tertiary importance? It it really of secondary and tertiary importance for one to speak of the removal of people and how this must be done? Is it really of secondary and tertiary importance that these people who remain in the white areas must all be migratory labourers? That they should have a foreign pass as if they came from a foreign so-called homeland?</p>

<p>Yes, so-called, because the homelands have not yet all been delimited. If these are secondary and tertiary considerations then I ask the hon. the Minister, what is the policy of the National Party? Is the predominant factor that the Government’s policy should be implemented, regardless of the cost? Do human relations no longer mean anything? Or do they mean so little that the policy must be implemented, regardless of human relations? Then someone asked me what role human relations played. When I was addressing the House earlier, I mentioned this to the Minister. He did not reply to it; perhaps he did not want to. I said that in areas such as the Ciskei and the Transkei there is not the slightest chance of absorbing additional people. People are still being removed from the Western Cape and from other areas and being sent there. On a previous occasion I mentioned the examples of Middelburg and Burgersdorp. What must we do in respect of the development within the Xhosa area? Here is the development corporation’s report. A short while ago a question was put to the hon. member for Klip River about whether the Bantu were so much better off in the Transkei and other Bantu areas than they were 20 years ago. I made the statement that they were worse off. Twenty years ago the Bantu in the Transkei and the Ciskei were living under better circumstances than to-day. It does not help to say that this is untrue. The cost of living was lower, they earned enough from their cattle, small stock and crops. No, it is no use for the hon. the Minister to shake his head. It is so. I know those areas. We have been travelling through them for years. We know what went on there. Their housing is hardly better than it was 20 years ago. I mentioned that their livestock had been thinned out to such an extent by the droughts that there was very little left. I should like to ask the Minister a question. He may reply to it at a later stage. Will he give us the assurance that it will not be necessary to supply the Ciskei and Transkei with food at the Republic’s expense this year? I predict that 10,000 bags of mealies will be sent there to feed them because <span class="col_6595-6596" refersTo="page_0445"/>they do not have the necessary funds at their disposal with which to buy it.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the question of the human relations. Apartheid must now surely be applied, because this is the Government’s policy. We are, after all, not the Government. Must human relations be disregarded altogether in applying the policy? On a previous occasion I said that I would give the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development a chance to come back to that. I said that this removal of the Bantu to the border areas, the declared Bantu homelands, was an almost inhuman process, because they are encouraged to go to the towns which are being created to house the Bantu who have been removed. I do not want to call them &#x201C;camps&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I do not object to the term camps, because at this stage they are little else. I merely call them areas which have been made available for the Bantu who have been removed, or towns, if one wants to use this term. I mentioned the various bodies. I now want to challenge the Minister to tell me whether there are not officials who travel around in order to encourage the people and to hold out the bait of free dwellings and rations. I can mention instances to him of servants who were in my employment in Middelburg, Cape, who were subsequently removed and who do not receive sufficient supplies to keep them alive. It was an old Native woman and 11 children who are living in two rooms. Five of them have already returned to Middelburg, where they were previously employed. I asked whether this was a humane way of doing it. Is it necessary to remove people there on the border areas? I do not want to argue about what is going on here in the Western Cape. Is it necessary to remove them from places where they are employed and are getting enough food and to place them where they are unemployed and are not getting enough food? That is what I want to say about the policy of that Party, on account of what the hon. member for Carletonville said this morning, because it frightens me. It is alarming to think that a member is allowed to say this on behalf of the Government. The hon. member must remember that this is for overseas consumption. He said that one must have a policy which one could project. If one could do this, regardless of how it is implemented, all else is of secondary and tertiary importance.</p>

Some of the grandchildren lived on the farm, but they were all encouraged to leave. That is the situation. There are many such instances. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows of them.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Carletonville. If that is the image he wants to project of the Government’s policy in connection with the separate development of the Bantu areas, then it is an alarming image that we are disseminating. It is alarming to say that the policy must be implemented, regardless of how it is done. It is alarming that the other considerations are secondary and that the most important, the primary consideration is to project the policy of apartheid and to implement it, regardless of the costs.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when this hon. member wants to start farming in the Bulawayo district, what does he buy first, his cattle or his farm? Where will this hon. member land up if he wants to start farming and he first buys his cattle but he does not have a farm? What is he going to do with those cattle? What is primary, what is secondary and what is tertiary? It seems to me I must talk to him in the language of a farmer because he cannot understand the other language. One has to have a definite plan for any project one wants to initiate and any policy one wants to carry out. My standpoint this morning was that the Party opposite did not have a basic plan. In the first place, they did not make any provision for the most important matter in our country&#x2014;that is what I said&#x2014;namely to deal with our Coloured problem and our Bantu people, that is, a basic plan. Where is that basic plan? It is merely a confused muddle. One finds that one group of members emphasizes the small number of houses that have been built while another group emphasizes soil conservation works which are inadequate. The one group says development is not taking place fast enough, while the other group says something else. Those people are dealing with a confused functional pattern. I said that this Party established for itself a basis of principle. On this basis of principle the Party has built and is still building a functional pattern. This functional pattern is secondary in respect of the basis of principle, which is primary. Since our primary basis of principle is correct, we are able to develop our functional pattern in an atmosphere of relative peace and quiet&#x2014; I almost said complete peace and quiet and without any interruptions&#x2014;in spite of the attempts which are made from time to time by that side and by our enemies to thwart this development. If the hon. member for East London (City) does not understand what this means, he cannot blame me for it. When the basis of principle is correct, it follows that the functional pattern which is based on it, must be correct too. What I accuse that Party of, is that it does not have any basis of principle or any basic plan for implementing their policy. It is merely a confused middle <span class="col_6597-6598" refersTo="page_0446"/>from beginning to end. When listening to them I feel myself justified to suggest that what was said by the hon. member for East London (City) and the whole argument he advanced this morning, is of secondary nature in that he emphasized matters in respect of which he has not laid down any basis. For that reason he cannot justify it. The three pillars which this party has based its policy, as I said this morning during the ten minutes I had at my disposal, justifies my saying that, as a result of our fundamental structure, we are able to make a future projection and to stand by it. But I know for what reason that hon. member has done it. There are two questions he did not reply to. That hon. member should furnish me with a reply. What are they going to do if they grant the Bantu right of possession here, as they want to do, and that Bantu becomes one that mobilizes capital in this country? Where is he going to send his capital to?</p>

<p>I remained quiet while that hon. member was making his speech. That hon. member must now furnish me with a reply to that question. That question has hurt the hon. member. Whence are they going to canalize the money which the Bantu as an owner of property in the white area is going to mobilize? To which sources and levels are they going to canalize it? If that Bantu as one who mobilizes capital, must of necessity become one who mobilizes labour, from which source is he going to mobilize that labour? The United Party must reply to those two questions, because those two questions are going to exasparate them. If they do not canalize those two mobilizing powers, those two sources from which they can mobilize their capital and labour, utmost chaos and important levels of friction will develop here in South Africa. That is the point I made, and the United Party must answer me on that point. The hon. member for East London (City) will not be able to throw up a smokescreen to dodge my question. The United Party owes us a reply to those two questions.</p>

<p>No, my time is limited. The United Party has to reply to those two questions. As a result of that two basic levels of friction will be created in the country. As I have said, the policy of this Party, with its policy of proper planning, with a proper basic plan and a structure to build on and with a future projection, has to be weighed up against the policy of that Party.</p>

<p>That hon. member should not tell me that the things I have said in this House merely serve as export articles for overseas consumption. They should not force me to point a finger at them and to show them how they have been supplying ammunition to our enemies, of whom there are many overseas, over a period of years. They have supplied our enemies with information and we on this side of the House have been surprisingly patient through the years and under provoking circumstances. We have exercised patience. We have been provoked, but we have kept quiet. They have now seized upon this minor matter which I have mentioned this morning and which the hon. member does not even understand. I want to say that I hold it against that hon. member for having done this to-day. I did not mean it that way. I did not even insinuate it in my speech. The United Party refuses wholeheartedly, continually and endlessly to relinquish their policy in terms of which they want to create common levels for both Whites and Bantu. I simply cannot understand that they have not learned that wherever in the world a common level is being established for both White and Coloureds, a level of friction is established at the same time. In terms of our whole policy those levels are being separated to prevent a level of friction from being established together with other levels. If the hon. member cannot understand this, I give up in despair and say: When will we ever have such a black day for the United Party again?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for East London (City) spoke about human relations, but that hon. member belongs to a political party which does not know anything about human relations. That is why they have only a few representatives in this House. They know nothing about human relations between Whites and Whites, not to speak of the relationship between Whites and Bantu, where we are dealing with anthropology, where we are dealing with Bantu people who are on an evolutionary level which is much lower than that of the Whites in the Republic of South Africa. The hon. member for East London (City) should be very careful when speaking about human relations. He has already cost the United Party thousands of votes and he is going to cost the party more votes still. The hon. member for East London (City) and the hon. member for Durban (Point), who wields the stick, are two brothers. In all seriousness, I do not know on what basis a debate such as this could be conducted. I do not know on what basis the hon. Minister could be exposed to conduct a debate on Bantu Affairs. When considering the whole set-up of Bantu Administration, we find that there are certain norms which must be laid down. Evidently the approach of the official Opposition simply is to make our cities blacker. Apparently they have no idea of coming forward with a positive line of thought. Something I cannot understand, is the fact that the hon. the Opposition cannot even admit one thing, namely that we are able to achieve such a great deal in a multi-racial country such as the Republic of South Africa as far as labour peace is concerned. Labour peace among the Bantu is a very important aspect. Notwithstanding the employment of Bantu in the metropolitan areas, is it not a major achievement to know that we have labour <span class="col_6599-6600" refersTo="page_0447"/>peace in our Republic, which is a multi-racial country? It has already been proved to me that we have accomplished the breakthrough to make the Bantu understand that they have an identity of their own. There is something else I cannot understand. At the beginning of the year the hon. the Minister made an excellent speech here; a speech in which the whole policy was clearly and frankly stated to the Opposition. It was made clear that we in the Republic of South Africa were making the Bantu aware of their own political rights. I believe that the hon. member for Houghton and others who talk so freely about Bantu Affairs but do not live near Bantu persons, are quite ignorant. Like the hon. member for Transkei, I live in an area adjoining a Bantu homeland. I simply cannot understand that he did not mention the question of human rights, the right to have one’s own political identity. No, nothing is said about that. All we hear, is the fact that the cities are becoming blacker. I find it ironic that hon. members say in the same breath that there should be family life. The fact that our cities are becoming blacker does not matter then; family life is all that matters then. I know why that is so. The reason for this is simply that the Opposition believes in economic integration. [Interjections.] Let us accept that economic integration means social and political integration. A great deal of imperialistic blood still flows in the veins of the hon. members for Transkei and Durban (Point). They do not regard South Africa as something sacred to us and as something which should be preserved for us. Oh no, they still regard South Africa as a temporary home, and the hon. member for Durban (Point) still stands with one of his clumsy feet on the other side, because they are still holding on to Macmillan’s speech. They probably still believe that the white man is expendable, because this is their problem basically. Let us be objective. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Transkei can make as much noise as he wants to as long as he at least admits that an enormous task is being carried out in the homelands. The area I live in, is situated next to a homeland. I can say that as far as agriculture, township development and the agency basis are concerned, all these things are being carried out on a sound basis. We have the Impala mine, where R1 million per month is spent on the mining of minerals. 13 per cent of the profits go to the Bantu homelands. However, there is not one white person living in the homeland. Every night the Whites go back to their own residential area. Not one single house has been built for Whites in the Bantu homeland. That is the foundation of our agency basis. There is no such thing that white persons are allowed to be accommodated in the Bantu homelands. It is the ideal situation. An agency basis such as the one established by the late Dr. Verwoerd and followed up by Minister Botha is fundamentally sound because there is nothing wrong with it.</p>

Hon. members can go to Rustenburg and they will see that the Department has not allowed it. That is why I say that this agency basis is one according to which the Department of Bantu Administration acts most scrupulously. It was made quite clear to the Union Corporation that it would be allowed to exploit minerals, but that it should be clearly understood that it would not be allowed to provide accommodation for white people. It seems to me as if the hon. member for Transkei has no idea of the enormous task of stimulating evolution. It seems to me as if he &#x2026;</p>

<p>He tried very hard to undermine the Government with people such as Matanzima and others. However, he must not think that the Bantu knows nothing about integration. I know the Bantu very well. When one speaks to the Bantu, it is clear that integration is one of the things they are most opposed to. The hon. member for Houghton is not welcome among them. The paramount chief of that area one day said in the presence of the hon. the Minister that we must please send his people back from the cities to come and settle in their homelands. This is the elementary concept of anthropology. It is a tradition and a pride in itself. It is not their custom to live in a city. The Bantu likes to live among his own people; he wants to realize the tradition to which he has become accustomed through the years. This story which is being spread of our cities becoming blacker, is not quite correct. The ratio between Whites and Bantu is still 1:2.1. In spite of the enormous economic boom and industrial explosion which is being experienced in this country, we are still in a position to be able to maintain the ratio of 1:2.1 in the cities. However, I want to tell the hon. members of the United Party that a shock is awaiting them. Problems were experienced as far as the development of border industries were concerned because the local authorities which had to develop <span class="col_6601-6602" refersTo="page_0448"/>the border industrial areas did not have the land at their disposal. To-day they are planning with vision in collaboration with all the Government departments and in close cooperation with the Department of Bantu Administration. [Time expired.]</p>

On what basis did he do this? He did it on the basis of extreme liberalism, namely one man, one vote. What is this Government busy doing? What has it promised all the black people of this country?

<p>Yes, one man and one woman, one vote. What is the franchise qualification in the Transkei? Anybody over 21, whether or not they can read or write or anything else, can vote. We on this side of the House believe that when one is dealing with under-developed people, the granting of political rights must go hand in hand with the economic development of those people. I want to come back to the question of economic development, because what this Government is doing is that the political development of the Bantu areas is outstripping the economic development. I want to come back to one specific aspect. Earlier to-day, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development reeled off a whole list of figures about bridges, roads, fences and dams to show what the Government is doing in the Bantu areas, as far as agricultural development is concerned. He certainly did not impress the Xhosa Development Corporation, because in connection with agricultural production the annual report says: &#x201C;Under existing conditions, no appreciable advance is noticeable&#x201D;, as has been mentioned here already. I also base this on other extracts out of the Annual Report of the Xhosa Development Corporation. They ended off by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The corporation is of the opinion that the provision of credit facilities for agriculture and economic motivation of the broad masses of the Bantu population by education, guidance and example merit early consideration.</block>

<p>Now, when the hon. the Minister dealt with agriculture in the reserves here this afternoon, he gave us a wonderful sort of pie in the sky story of about what they are going to do in the future as regards agriculture.

<p>Then the Minister has to have trained people at his disposal. That Deputy Minister says that they are training them, because when I raised this matter in the Budget debate he said: &#x201C;Ons is gedurig besig om hulle op te lei.&#x201D; But what I want to know from the hon. the Minister is what is happening to these trained Bantu agriculturists who are doing, for example, an agricultural diploma at Fort Hare where the requirement <span class="col_6603-6604" refersTo="page_0449"/>is a Senior Certificate, or are doing an agricultural course at the Agricultural College at Fort Cox, where they have a Junior Certificate requirement and where&#x2014;I quote from the Department’s report&#x2014;&#x201C;the more intelligent of them are selected for a course of further training as extension workers or agricultural advisers, while the rest are absorbed in various departmental projects&#x201D;. It sounds very nice when they say that the rest are absorbed in various departmental projects, but I think, in the light of the fact, that they are taken up for further training as extension workers or absorbed in departmental projects, then it is most disturbing to read the report which has appeared in the <i>Farmer's Weekly</i> of the 23rd April which contained a statement by one Mr. D. L. Brown who is head of the Department of Animal Science at the University of Fort Hare when he spoke at the conference of the South African Society of Animal Production at the University of Stellenbosch. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Training of Bantu students in agriculture was of vital importance to everyone, Black or White, in South Africa.</block>

<p>He went on and stressed that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Impoverished soil conditions prevail at present in alarmingly large areas of the Bantu homelands, which were largely dependent on livestock farming and the home of nearly 40 per cent of the country’s cattle population.</block>

<p>In the light of the above he added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Quite a shock had accompanied the dis-covery recently that the population of the Bantu areas may be 30 to 40 per cent greater than originally estimated.</block>

<p>He said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The problems of agriculture in the Bantu homelands are such that men of ability and vision and adequate training are needed to help uproot certain harmful customs and to devise agricultural methods specifically adapted to the present economy &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">Such men will not be recruited unless suitable work opportunities are available with salaries and status commensurate with those of other professional groups.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon member who has just sat down, drew a comparison between what this Government was doing and what was said by Mr. Macmillan when he visited this country. The hon. member said that this Government was doing the same as what Mr. Macmillan had done, and this statement of his is so far from the truth that it makes one feel ashamed. We know quite well what was propagated by Mr. Macmillan and his Government, namely that the British territories in Africa were to be handed over to the natives whether they were in a position to govern those territories or not. Whether they were trained to govern or whether they were in a position financially to do so, did not matter to them. This is not the policy of this Government. We have stated it clearly over and over again that the policy of this Government is that the nations in South Africa will be guided along gradually until they have reached the stage where they will be granted self-government ultimately. Only time will show when this is going to happen and these people themselves will have to prove when they are capable of doing so. They will not be thrown to the wolves before the time to be preyed upon as has happened in many parts in the rest of Africa. Surely the hon. member cannot get away with that kind of nonsense. In the course of this debate attempts were made to use the Deputy Minister of Planing and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development as targets. I know both these hon. members are capable of looking after themselves, but I just want to tell hon. members of the United Party opposite that every hon. member on this side of the House would prefer to have any of these two gentlemen to any member of the Opposition. As far as we are concerned, these two gentlemen are more valuable for the continued existence of the Whites and of the Bantu in South Africa than the whole of the Opposition.</p>

Hon. members of the <span class="col_6605-6606" refersTo="page_0450"/>Opposition have tried one after the other to present the Government in an unfavourable light and even in a frivolous light as far as the development of the Bantu areas are concerned. A short while ago one of the hon. members on the opposite side of the House said by way of interjection that this was also their policy. It is the policy of the United Party and since it is their policy, I cannot understand why those hon. members take such delight in presenting the development of the Bantu areas in a ridiculous light and in the light in which they, in fact, presented it in this House.</p>

<p>There are so many aspects of the matter to which one would like to reply, particularly the agricultural aspect which the hon. member mentioned a moment ago.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to another matter, namely the matter the hon. member for Pinelands has dealt with. He asked, <i>inter alia,</i> whether the Bantu accepted the policy of the National Party. He alleged that this policy was not accepted by the Bantu and he mentioned particularly the urban Bantu. Furthermore, he asked whether this side of the House could give any proof that the policy of the National Party was accepted by the Bantu. I shall furnish the hon. member on that side of the House with the proofs most willingly. I informed the hon. member that I would comment on his questions immediately, but unfortunately it may not have been possible for the hon. member to be present. The first proof of this is what was said by the Chief Minister of the Tswana territory in a speech he made. He expressed the following fine sentiments (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The melody I hear in South Africa, is a sweet one and one that is being played on black and white notes &#x2026; In 1917 the hon. J. C. Smuts foresaw that it would be necessary for the country to carry out the policy it was carrying out now. One wishes that the policy was so clearly defined at that stage as it is now. The problems we are facing to-day would otherwise not have been so problematical and extensive. To-day we are enriched spiritually as a result of a policy which we as a people with a respected personality of our own recognize.</block>

<p>This was said by the Chief Minister of the Tswana and any person who knows him can say with the greatest measure of certainty that this Bantu is not a person who is indoctrinated to present these things. I wish hon. members opposite could read some of the speeches he made when he visited the Netherlands recently. He made these speeches independently and without any assistance from anybody. The trouble with those hon. members and particularly those hon. members who are sitting against the wall over there, is that they never come into contact with these people. They never come into contact with the urban Bantu and they do not even come into contact with the rural Bantu, not to speak of the Bantu in the homelands. We speak to these people and we visit these people in their own areas and in municipal Bantu townships, and these people come and visit us in our offices. The trouble with the hon. members opposite is that they say a few clever things in this House in order to get publicity in the Press. They will do well to visit these areas during the recess and to speak to these responsible leaders. They will then find out what the position is. Let me quote an example. The hon. members say the urban Bantu do not accept our policy, and for that reason I now want to refer to an advisory council election which was actually in the nature of a minor municipal election. This election took place in Ikageng Bantu township near Potchefstroom. They drew up a manifesto. Five of the candidates presented themselves as candidates who supported Government policy out and out. There were two independent candidates and both of them were favourably disposed towards the Government and won the election with large majorities. Of the other five candidates, three won with large majorities while two were elected unopposed. These are the urban Bantu whom the Opposition say do not want to accept Government policy and they said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us build our own towns in our homelands. Let us have our own secondary schools, colleges, universities, hospitals and old-age homes. Let us be proud of our homelands, our customs and our culture like other nations. Do not be misled by rolling stones who have no policy, just moving from one block to another. What they have failed to do in one block they will also fail to do in another.</block>

<p>This election manifesto was drawn up by the candidates and they fought the election in this Bantu township under the name of the Kopano Party.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As previously announced the Government has taken the following principal resolutions in regard to Bantu taxation, viz. a Pay-As-You-Earn system will be introduced for Bantu taxation; Bantu will not be liable to payment of income-tax and provincial income-tax; pursuant upon the foregoing the Bantu taxation scales will be adjusted to make full provision for all income groups. At present Bantu are liable to payment of general and income-tax on the following basis: A general tax of R3.50 per year, paid by all males between the ages of 18 and 65 years in terms of the Bantu Taxation and Development Act, 1925. In common parlance this is called the basic general tax. In addition, a tax on incomes exceeding R360 per year which has to be paid by males and females in accordance with different scales under the aforesaid Act&#x2014;usually called the additional general tax; and normal and provincial income-tax payable in terms of the Act concerned.</p>

<p>However, this does not mean that Bantu pay double taxes, because the taxes paid in terms of the 1925 Act on incomes exceeding R360 per year, is decreased by the amount which has to be paid in respect of normal income-tax and provincial income-tax. Bantu are of course not liable to payment of provincial personal tax.</p>

<p>The additional general tax is due on 1st January of any particular year in respect of taxable income which the taxpayer received in the previous year of assessment or which accrued to him during the course of that year. A year of assessment runs from 1st March of the one year to the last day of February in the ensuing year. In practice therefore, the position is that income earned in the year of assessment ending on 28th February, 1969, is only taxable in 1970. The general tax of R3.50 is payable in one instalment in respect of a calendar year.</p>

<p>Briefly, the general tax is collected in the following way: Every individual taxpayer must, at some time or other during the course of the year, present himself at the office of a Receiver of Bantu Tax (the Bantu Affairs Commissioner, or if there is none in that particular area, the magistrate) or other tax collection points to pay his general tax of R3.50 and, if he is liable to additional general tax, to arrange for returns of income, assessment and payment. If a taxpayer does not come forward voluntarily to meet his obligations, the Receiver can and must take steps to compel payment, such as the issuing of warrants or steps to prosecute defaulters.</p>

<p>In practice the amount payable in respect of income-tax is difficult to collect and obligations are, from the nature of the case, easily evaded. In considering a new system of taxation the question immediately arises whether the basic and additional general tax should be combined into one scale based on income, or whether the present system of a basic tax payable apart from income, plus an additional tax based on income, should be retained. In this connection the following considerations are mentioned: On the present basis of collection the additional general tax must be increased at least tenfold in order to yield the same income as the existing basic and additional general tax. A system of taxation based exclusively on income means that a minimum income limit must be set for the payment of taxation. However, remuneration <i>in natura</i> comprises a large portion of the income of labourers in certain spheres of employment. A system in terms of which remuneration <i>in natura</i> has to be included would not be practical in view of the possible income and problems with returns. A very large percentage of the workers in agriculture, forestry, mines and quarries, for example, are seasonal and migratory labourers, who do not work the full 12 months of the year. Any P.A.Y.E. system would therefore, apart from the problems in regard to the determination of income, imply that records of moneys collected from individuals must be kept in order to ensure that each taxpayer contributes at least the prescribed minimum annual amount. Of course, such a system could not be applied to one group or particular groups only, and since there are at present more than 3½ million taxpayers, fulfilment of their obligations in 12 instalments per year will mean that approximately 40 million entries will have to be made annually in tax records, apart from the problems which will be experienced in determining at any given time the liability to tax of any taxpayer. If any minimum limit should be set on income for the purposes of the deduction of tax, so many employers will be involved that complicated and expensive control measures will have to be established in order to insure that taxes will in fact be deducted and paid in. For example, in the case of domestic servants, thousands of employers will be involved, while the vast majority employ only one Bantu and each will have to deduct and pay in only a small amount per month. All things considered, a system of basic taxation becomes payable in one instalment by Bantu males between the ages of 18 and 65 years; and an additional tax, which is determined according to taxable income and which has to be paid by Bantu males, and by all Bantu females over and above the basic tax, and in terms of which the additional general <span class="col_6609-6610" refersTo="page_0452"/>tax is collected by way of a P.A.Y.E. system, that is, that the additional tax is deducted by employers and other bodies from wages and remuneration of taxpayers, and paid in to the State, is regarded as being the most suitable. As you are aware, employers must make deductions in terms of existing legislation from the wages of employees in respect of normal income-tax. If a P.A.Y.E. system of taxation is now to be introduced for the present Bantu taxation, alongside the existing normal income-tax system, it will create fundamental problems. In this connection the following can be mentioned: The general tax and income-tax must be paid to various bodies&#x2014;the former to Receivers of Bantu Tax and the latter to Receivers of Revenue. Returns will have to be sent to various places because the various laws are administered by different Departments. Owing to the different methods of calculation employers will not in all cases be able to determine easily which of the two taxes a particular Bantu is liable to, apart from problems where a Bantu is liable to both and the general tax has to be reduced by the amount payable in respect of normal income-tax.</p>

<p>Since governing bodies for the Bantu themselves are now being established and formulated it is also advisable that Bantu taxation should be cast in the same mould, so that it can also in due course be transferred to the homeland authority, as is for example provided in the Transkei Constitution Act, 1963, and as provision is being made in this Bill.</p>

<p>It follows from this therefore that Bantu cannot be liable under different laws in terms of the new system, and for this reason they will in future be liable only to Bantu taxation. Consequently it is also possible at present to design a taxation system and scale which are unique to the Bantu, which take his circumstances and way of life into account and, most important of all, keep pace with the envisaged transfer of powers of taxation to the homeland authorities, because a tax is not only a fiscal measure, but also serves to confirm the subordination of the taxpayer to the authoritative body taxing him.</p>

<p>It is of course a requirement that a system of deductions should not be complicated. Otherwise administrative costs will be out of proportion and the employers who will be responsible for deductions will experience many problems, and the system which has been devised takes these aspects into account.</p>

<p>A further important consideration is, as has already been stated when I discussed the retention of a fixed amount, that the number of employers involved should not be too great because the controlling machinery will be too cumbersome and too expensive. This will become quite apparent if I mention two examples, namely if every person employing a domestic servant had to deduct taxes from the servant’s wages, or every farmer had to deduct taxes from his labourers’ wages, the administrative costs would be very high. In view of these considerations it was decided, as in the past, to limit taxation to incomes above R360 per year.</p>

<p>In view of the changes in the normal income tax scales relating to individuals and of the higher indirect taxes as announced by the Minister of Finance, Bantu taxation is also being adjusted by reducing the basic general tax from R3.50 per year to R2.50 per year and adjusting the tax on taxable income in accordance with new scales which appear in clause 6.</p>

<p>As I have already explained the additional general tax is payable in arrears. It is, however, a requirement for a P.A.Y.E. system that the taxation on income must be payable when the income accrues to the taxpayer, so that deductions can be made summarily on payment and not in arrears. Liability for the tax on income must therefore be brought forward now and in order to coincide with the normal tax year, the system cannot therefore come into effect before 1st March, 1970. The general tax levied in terms of the Bantu Taxation and Development Act, of 1925, has only been revised once since 1925, and that was in 1958 when the amount of the tax payable by Bantu males was increased from R2 per year to R3.50 per year and a tax was introduced on incomes exceeding R360 per year, and now, not merely an adjustment is being made but a totally new tax system is being introduced. I shall now deal with the various clauses of the Bill.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 1</p>

<p>In general the definitions in clause 1 are primarily repetitions of provisions of the existing Act and additions in so far as they are necessary for the P.A.Y.E. system. The P.A.Y.E. system is based on those in respect of income tax and, as appear from the definitions, the same designations are used. There are, however, a few of the definitions to which I want to refer in particular, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Taxable Income</i></block>

<p>This definition is virtually a verbatim repetition of section 2 <i>bis</i> of the Bantu Taxation and Development Act of 1925. Taxable income shall, unless otherwise prescribed by regulation which makes it possible to make adjustments which may be necessary in practice, be determined on the basis on which the taxable income of individuals is determined in terms of the Income Tax Act of 1962, with two exceptions: Firstly, the income of a husband and wife is not grouped together. The reason for this is obvious, and can be stated as follows: There is no compulsory registration for marriages according to Bantu custom, and if the income of a husband and wife should be taxed together, it would create difficulties in regard to tax evasion. A further consideration is that owing to the administrative costs the system should be kept as simple as possible. Secondly, livestock and agricultural products which have not been realized, are not taxed. The consideration <span class="col_6611-6612" refersTo="page_0453"/>here is also one of administrative costs.</p>

<p><i>Remuneration</i></p>

<p>According to clause 18 employers will deduct Employees’ Tax from the remuneration of employees, provided of course that the remuneration falls within the scales of taxation, that is, if it amounts to more than R360 per year. I have already pointed out that compensation <i>in natura</i> comprises a large part of the compensation of certain groups of employees and that it is not desirable to implicate this income. That is one of the reasons why provision is being made at the end of the definition of remuneration to the effect that an amount of income of a specified nature can be excluded from the concept of remuneration. The power to exclude amounts in this way also makes it possible to make suitable provision to the effect that, for example, compensation for the defrayal of expenses incurred during the course of services can be excluded, as is also being done in terms of the Income Tax Act of 1962. However, there is also provision to the effect that amounts can be included in the concept of remuneration. This may be necessary in respect of Bantu in certain categories of work, and who are in fact independent contractors, such as crayfish divers along the West Coast, who only work for a few months in the year and during that time earn a very good income. It is desirable that the employees’ tax be deducted from their earnings. Otherwise they disappear before they can be dealt with as provisional taxpayers.</p>

<p><i>Clause 2</i></p>

<p>The Secretary of Bantu Administration and Development administers the Act and exercises certain powers in regard to officers and administrative matters, primarily on the basis of the existing Act.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3</p>

<p>As in the case of the existing Act, provision is made in subsection (1) for the preservation of secrecy in regard to the incomes of persons. Subsection (2) empowers the Secretary for Inland Revenue to furnish information in regard to the income of Bantu to the Secretary of Bantu Administration and Development. It will be noted that in terms of subsection (1) the preservation of secrecy does not apply to the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The two Departments will therefore be able to exchange information in regard to the liability to taxation of persons under the various laws which they administer.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 4</p>

<p>Remuneration can be paid in terms of the existing Act to Bantu bodies for assistance rendered in regard to the collection of taxation. The amount of the remuneration is determined in consultation with the Minister of Finance. This provision is being expanded on a basis which will make it possible to make use of other bodies to collect the basic general tax, upon payment of a commission. This creates the opportunity for more points at which Bantu can pay taxes.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 5</p>

<p>The various taxes are being levied for the benefit of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, from which payments such as those to the Bantu Education Account, are made in terms of other legislation.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 6</p>

<p>In this clause the scale of general tax is prescribed. It will be noted that the scale for this tax on income is now the same for men as well as women. Differentiated scales were not retained because they would merely create problems with a P.A.Y.E. system.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 7</p>

<p>Provision is being made for the payment of local tax in respect of the occupation and ownership of land in separate Bantu areas and other Bantu areas which have declared to be locations, on the same basis as in the existing Act. The amount is R1 per year per hut, with a maximum of R4 per year, and is paid by the head of the family. I see hon. members are laughing, but if a man has four wives I think he must receive a slight rebate, particularly if he has run into debt with the fifth and the sixth. In Bantu areas that are not included in this, rent as prescribed in terms of the Bantu Trust and Land Act of 1936 is paid. I shall subsequently explain how the local taxation is being applied.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 8</p>

<p>Bantu who have not met their obligations by way of employees’ tax or provisional tax must furnish returns of their income and expenditure. If this provision is not complied with, a summary assessment of tax can be made, and in addition there are penalties for omitting to comply with the regulations.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 9</p>

<p>Schedules can be required from employers and others in regard to Bantu in their service, the wages and other moneys paid to Bantu, Bantu living on their land and such other information as may be requested. This is a summary of the provisions in the existing Act.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 10</p>

<p>Provision is being made for assessments, on the basis of the existing Act.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 11</p>

<p>The time when taxes become payable is being prescribed.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 12</p>

<p>Receivers of Bantu taxation can grant extension of time to Bantu for the payment of tax.</p>

<p><i><span class="col_6613-6614" refersTo="page_0454"/>Clause</i> 13</p>

<p>The existing provision dealing with exemption from the payment of tax is retained on the following basis: Bantu males over the age of 65 years are permanently exempted from the payment of the tax of R2.50 per year. Provision is being made for exemptions on the grounds of inability to earn money, caused by illness, old age, etc. Exemption can be granted on the grounds of attendance at a properly registered educational institution established by or in terms of law, if such Bantu have no income. Foreign Bantu who work in the Republic and who have paid taxes in their country of origin may be exempted.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 14</p>

<p>Authorized officers can require Bantu, whom they suspect are liable to local and basic general tax, to produce receipts or certificates of exemption or certificates of extension. This is a repetition of a provision in the existing Act, and does not have any bearing on the additional general tax.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 15</p>

<p>A new procedure is being introduced in terms of which a Bantu commissioner, an assessment officer or a receiver can summarily order the employer of a Bantu who owes taxes to deduct fixed amounts from the remuneration of such Bantu and to pay this amount as settlement of the debt. The provisions contained in subsection (3) were however also contained in the old Act (1925).</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 16</p>

<p>Provision is being made for the refund of amounts paid in excess if the claim is made within three years, but a refund does not occur in respect of employees’ tax and provisional tax if the amount was correctly estimated at the time when it was deducted, unless the Secretary is convinced that the circumstances of the case justify a refund.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 17</p>

<p>Taxes and fines which have to be paid in terms of this legislation comprise a debt to the State and provision is being made for the summary collection according to the provisions of the Income Tax Act, which can <i>mutatis mutandis</i> be applied, and by way of warrants. The latter is of course a procedure which is also prescribed in the 1925 Act.</p>

<p><i>Clauses</i> 18 <i>to</i> 39</p>

<p>In Chapter III provision is being made on the basis laid down in Schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act, 1962 for the deduction of employees’ tax from the remuneration of Bantu and the payment of amounts thus deducted by the employer, and for the payment of provisional tax by Bantu who work on their own account, and for matters connected therewith.</p>

<p><i>Clauses</i> 40 <i>to</i> 42</p>

<p>The provision in the existing Act in terms of which levies can be imposed upon the taxpayers of tribes or communities at their own request is being retained. It is based on an old custom by means of which tribal members contribute to community services.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 43</p>

<p>Provision is being made for offences and penalties in regard to the abuse of receipts and certificates, refusal or omission to furnish information for the purposes of the Act, etc.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 44</p>

<p>Certain presumptions are being created. These provisions are necessary, particularly in respect of tax legislation.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 45</p>

<p>The matters for which regulations can be promulgated are prescribed in clause 45.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 46</p>

<p>The foregoing provisions of this Act shall not apply in the Transkei or citizens of the Transkei. In terms of Item 1 of Section B of the first schedule to the Transkei Constitution Act, 1963, the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei may make laws in regard to, <i>inter alia,</i> direct taxes on citizens of the Transkei, and in terms of section 52 (1) (a) and (b) of that Act amounts paid by citizens of the Transkei in terms of the Bantu Taxation and Development Act, 1925, and an act of Parliament in regard to a tax on incomes, is paid into the Transkei Revenue Fund. However, the Transkeian Government will now levy its own. taxes on Transkei citizens.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 47</p>

<p>This clause gives effect to the resolution that Bantu individuals will not pay income tax in terms of the Income Tax Act or provincial income tax. In the 1966 tax year 2,098 Bantu were assessed for a total of R194,989. The Bantu concerned will now of course be taxed in terms of the new system.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 48</p>

<p>This clause repeats, with adjustments, existing provisions of the Bantu Taxation and Development Act, 1925 which can be applied for the collection of rent and other moneys owed by Bantu to the State in respect of the occupation of land, and provision is also being made to apply the provisions for the collection of taxes imposed by the Transkeian Government and by Bantu authorities. The intention is that the provisions concerned will be applied to collect the taxation which the Transkeian Government is going to levy. Agreement was reached with the Transkeian Government to the effect that its taxation will be the same as that for which provision is being made in this Bill, and it will consequently not be necessary for employers to draw a distinction between <span class="col_6615-6616" refersTo="page_0455"/>the amounts to be deducted in respect of Transkeian citizens and other Bantu.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 49</p>

<p>Existing laws in regard to Bantu taxation are being repealed. I shall refer in greater detail to certain provisions which are being amended when I deal with the schedule.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 50</p>

<p>I referred earlier to the fact that the existing taxation on taxable income was payable in arrears, i.e. on 1st January of a particular calendar year in respect of taxable income which accrued to the taxpayer during the year of assessment, and that taxation will be payable on the new basis with effect from 1st March, 1970. The existing Act is now being repealed with effect from 1st January, 1970, and consequently any liability to payment of taxation on income which would have been payable after 1st January, 1970 lapses, while the corresponding new taxation will only be levied with effect from 1st March, 1970. In practice it therefore means that no taxation will be levied under the existing Act on incomes during the period 1st March, 1969 to 28th February, 1970.</p>

<p><i>Schedule</i></p>

<p>With the exception of proposals in regard to the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, provision is made in the Schedule for the repeal of the Bantu Taxation and Development Act, 1925, and other statutory provisions which either amended or supplemented the latter Act in so far as they dealt with matters which either lapse now or have been incorporated into the Bill.</p>

<p>As far as the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, is concerned, the position is as follows.</p>

<p><i>Sections</i> 8 <i>and</i> 9</p>

<p>The Bantu Taxation and Development Act, 1925, contains, <i>inter alia,</i> the following provisions:</p>

<block name="quote">In terms of section 11 local tax which is collected in the territories of Bantu authorities and other approved Bantu bodies is paid to such authorities and bodies;</block>

<block name="quote">In terms of section 12 a Bantu Development Account is established, into which the local tax which did not accrue to the boards and bodies mentioned above is paid. (Formerly the entire proceeds of the general tax were first deposited therein; subsequently the proceeds were divided, <i>inter alia,</i> among the Development Account and the Bantu Education Account; and now the entire proceeds are being paid into the latter account);</block>

<block name="quote">In terms of section 13 (1) the funds in the Development Account are utilized &#x201C;for the further development and the advancement of the welfare of the Bantu&#x201D; and for the payment to provincial councils in the Cape Province of amounts in lieu of the hut and other tax which the boards formerly levied from Bantu; and</block>

<block name="quote">In terms of section 13 (2) special persons can be appointed for the purposes of the administration of the Development Account, but this is never done.</block>

<p>When the South African Bantu Trust was established in terms of the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, the Development Account amalgamated with the said Trust, but it was provided that the funds which were to have accrued to the account should still be applied for the purpose provided in the 1925 Act.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes the Development Account is now an integral part of the South African Bantu Trust and the South African Bantu Trust Fund. In the 1967-’68 financial year only about R80,000 was collected which would have accrued to the account in the past. Mindful of the purposes for which the South African Bantu Trust Fund is being applied, and the amounts which are in fact being spent for the purposes defined in respect of the Development Account, there is no reason why the Development Account should be retained. It is therefore being proposed to amend section 8 and 9 of the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, in order to provide that the moneys which now accrue to the Development Fund be paid directly into the South African Bantu Trust Fund, and that the payments which are made out of that Account will in future be made directly out of the aforesaid Trust Fund.</p>

<p><i>Section</i> 45</p>

<p>The amendment of section 45 in the Act of 1936 is purely an adjustment consequential upon the envisaged new Bantu Taxation Act.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>

<p>It is not being implied that the system for which this Bill makes provision offers the solution to all problems in regard to the collection of taxes from the Bantu. There will still be problems, and the Act will undoubtedly have to be adjusted in due course in the light of problems experienced in practice.</p>

<p>There are at present more than 3½ million Bantu who are liable to the basic general tax and a large percentage of them will also be liable to tax on income. The number will steadily increase as wages increase. Unfortunately it is not possible to determine the precise number, because information in regard to the incomes of individuals is not readily available. In making provision for the system, however, the fact that a large section of the taxpayers are unable, and that it cannot be expected of them to complete returns and to keep a record of income and expenditure, must, however, be taken into account. Also, I have already mentioned the cost factor. It would, to say the least, be nonsensical to introduce a system the administrative costs of which would be so high that it would swallow up the proceeds of taxation.</p>

<p><span class="col_6617-6618" refersTo="page_0456"/>As opposed to that, these aspects in themselves present no reason why a tax should not be levied, and a tax on income is of course the basic form of taxation, by means of which the pressure of direct taxation can be distributed evenly according to the means of the taxpayers. There was a time when our tax collections were not what they should have been. However, that was owing to various factors, but the fact remains that collection has increased from R7.6 million in 1963-’64 to R11.3 million in 1967-’68, and the amount for 1968-’69 will, it is estimated, also be approximately R11.3 million. It is estimated that approximately R1 million of the collections in each of the past two years was in respect of the part relating to income. The expectation is that the scales and system which is now being proposed, will also produce approximately R11 million, notwithstanding the decrease in the basic general tax, because many taxpayers who previously evaded their obligations will not be able to do so now under the P.A.Y.E. system.</p>

<p>Now, as far as the obligation of employers in terms of this system is concerned: An interdepartmental committee which instituted an investigation into tax matters, <i>inter alia,</i> interviewed representatives of the South African Agricultural Union, the Afrikaanse Handels-instituut. the South African Federated Chamber of Industries, the Institute of Administrators of Non-White Affairs, and the Chamber of Mines, and it appeared that, generally sneaking, there was no objection on the part of the members of the organizations who would be affected the most to a simple P.A.Y.E. system. Consequently the system was designed in such a way that it could fit in easily with the existing system of the Department of Inland Revenue, in that use was being made, <i>inter alia,</i> of the same designations, which would make it unnecessary for employers to change their registers; in that the taxation is being determined in terms of R30 units, which makes calculations in respect of groups of individuals possible and easier; and in that provision is being made for tables which employers will have to apply in the determination of amounts owed, instead of their having to calculate the amounts themselves.</p>

<p>Then, too, I want to avail myself of this opportunity of expressing my gratitude towards the bodies concerned and their members, as well as other employers who will have to comply with requirements in terms of the Act. There will probably be problems, but with mutual co-operation it will always be possible to find solutions.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened to an interesting address by the hon. the Deputy Minister in introducing this Bill. It has been a lengthy address, and it has been necessary for the Deputy Minister to address the House at length to explain exactly what is involved in this taxation Bill. I want to say straight away that although the Minister has given us this full explanation, we do take it amiss that no White Paper was issued with this Bill. The mere fact that the Deputy Minister had to take so long to explain the Bill to us is proof of the fact that a White Paper was necessary, not only for Members of Parliament but also for the public at large, for the employers who are involved under the P.A.Y.E. system and also for the Bantu themselves. I want to say at once that we on this side of the House have had the services of a member of the staff of the Department who came to address us and to advise us on certain queries we had, but I must say that a White Paper on the lines of the address given here by the hon. the Deputy Minister would have been much more useful to us and would have given us a better insight into the provisions of the Bill. Sir, we have stressed before the necessity of getting White Papers on Bills of this nature and I want to stress again now that the Government should give us White Papers instead of facing us with a measure like this and a lengthy address such as we have just had here. Sir, everybody knows that all laws affecting the Bantu are complicated, and the taxation of the Bantu is likewise complicated. The Bantu does not only pay the taxes which the white people, the Indians and the Coloureds pay; he pays other taxes as well. We know that the Bantu is relieved of the obligation to pay the personal tax in the provinces, but otherwise he pays all the taxes which the other groups pay and in addition he has to pay other taxes as well. He has his own general tax which, as the Deputy Minister has said, was introduced in 1925 and is generally known as the poll tax or the &#x201C;kopbelasting&#x201D;. Every male Bantu person pays that tax, but in addition he has tribal levies to pay and in terms of this Bill, according to what the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, he will still be called upon to pay tribal levies. The Bantu pays all the trading and other licences that other citizens have to pay; he pays our income tax, and in 1958 this Parliament saw fit to make him pay an additional tax on his income, a tax which is not paid by the other groups. At that time, in 1958, we on this side of the House opposed the introduction of that tax on the ground mainly that it was a tax on the income of the lower-income groups, the people who were least able to afford to pay a tax. We felt then that there should have been an inquiry first, that a commission should be appointed to go into the full effect that this taxation would have on the Africans. We know that there have been researches made into the income of the Bantu in the rural areas and in the urban areas. We have had different statements as to what the average income of the African is in the Reserves and outside the Reserves. We have had different statements, too, as to what it costs him to live, what the normal Bantu has to pay by way of living expenses, and we felt in 1958 that this tax should not be introduced unless a complete survey was made of his living expenses and all the taxes he had to pay in different ways before a separate tax was <span class="col_6619-6620" refersTo="page_0457"/>placed on him. We feel even more so now in this case. We know and the hon. the Minister has said that the African pays direct as well as indirect taxation. A commission was appointed by the hon. the Minister of Finance to go into this question of taxation. In the Budget speech this year we heard the result of that report. The report of the Franzsen Commission was discussed. That commission dealt with direct and indirect taxation, but it did not deal with the taxation of groups separately. We know that this was only the first report and we know, too, that representations were made by the commission about the taxation of Bantu, but we have not yet had the benefit of the Franzsen Commission’s deliberations on that aspect. All I can say is that we would have thought that the Government would have waited until the Franzsen Commission had reported fully on the taxation of all the groups before it came to the House with a measure of this nature.</p>

<p>Now there is no new principle in having a different tax for the Bantu contained in this Bill, because as I said before there is a different tax for the African. He pays an income tax now which other groups do not pay, by virtue of the 1958 Act.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I know. I say the principle of differentiation was accepted in 1958 when an income tax, which was called a general tax then, was placed on the African, but at that time he was also liable for the income tax which all the other groups pay, but the income tax he paid was deducted from the amount of his general tax. So I say the principle of differentiation is not new, because we had it in 1958, and the principle of collecting tax by the P.A.Y.E. system is not new either because it applies to the African now under our Income Tax Act. He pays the same income tax as everybody else pays and it can also be collected by means of P.A.Y.E. So the system of collection which is now envisaged in this Bill is not new either, but what is new is that you will now have one group of people put on a completely new basis of taxation from the other groups. He will no longer pay the income tax paid by the other groups; he will have his own income tax in terms of this Schedule to the Bill. Now I am not going into the question as to whether he is better off or worse off under this new system. If you try to compare the Schedule with the taxation paid by the other groups, in some cases you can argue that the African is better off, but in other cases again it is easy to prove that he is worse off. I do not intend to go into an argument on that basis at all. But one thing that must strike the African is that whereas they are taxed on income on a sliding scale with no allowances or rebates the other groups all have allowances for deductions from their taxable income. Admittedly, the basis on which he pays as laid down in the Schedule is lower than that of other groups, but all the other groups are entitled to deductions and rebates for their families. The married man, for instance, may claim rebates for his children. All the other groups are allowed to deduct from their taxable income the amount they pay by way of pension contributions, and this amount may be quite considerable in the higher-income groups. There are deductions for insurance premiums paid and for medical expenses incurred. For the African, however, there are no deductions of this nature. We have not heard from the hon. the Deputy Minister on what basis this schedule has been prepared. Officials were very helpful and assisted us in this matter. But how does this Schedule compare with the taxes paid by other groups? There has been no attempt to explain this matter. There has been no attempt to equate the tax payable under this Schedule with the tax paid by the other groups. We know there is a reduction in the general tax which the African will pay, not under the new Schedule of taxes, but because of the reduction of R1 in the poll tax which every African has to pay. But otherwise he does not seem to have had the consideration shown in the reduction of the general tax on income that has been shown to other groups in regard to income tax reductions as announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance with his taxation proposals.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed that in terms of the Transkei Constitution Act, the Transkei Government has the power to tax its own people. In fact, it is the only body that can tax its own people. The hon. the Deputy Minister has now told us that the Transkei Government has agreed that they will tax their people on the same basis as the hon. the Deputy Minister is now proposing to tax the rest of the Bantu population. We will also collect the taxes for the Transkei Government and we will collect the taxes for all the other Bantu authorities. I understand, and the hon. the Deputy Minister can correct me if I am wrong, that our arrangement with the Transkei Government is that we pay over to them a certain proportion of all the taxes we collect. I do not know if that is still the position. The hon. the Deputy Minister nods. It is therefore still the position. I think we pay over 15 per cent of the taxes we collect to the Transkeian Government.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is what I thought. The hon. the Deputy Minister has said that the Transkei Government is going to pass an Act on the same lines as the one he <span class="col_6621-6622" refersTo="page_0458"/>has introduced. If this Bill is passed, we accept the principle that every year a schedule of taxation will be laid down for the African people and that these taxes will be collected from all Bantu in the country. What would happen if the Transkei Government does not pass the Act, which the hon. the Deputy Minister expects them to pass? They have undertaken to pass a similar Bill, but supposing they do not? Supposing there is opposition in the Transkei Government to this form of taxation and that the Opposition members are able to gain the support of some of the Government members in opposition to this tax, which after all is a tax on incomes lower than is applicable to other groups? The Bantu pay income-tax on a lower income than other groups. The hon. the Deputy Minister must bear in mind that with our last Budget the sales tax was introduced. Everybody pays this indirect taxation and every African has to pay it also irrespective of whether he lives in the Transkei or in Zululand or in Cape Town or in Johannesburg. I want to mention this particularly, because during our discussion in the Budget debate on the sales tax, the hon. the Minister of Finance interrupted my colleague, the hon. member for North Rand, and he said that they will not pay the tax on most of the items they buy. That is quite wrong. If one looks through the list of articles on which the sales tax has to be paid one finds that the Bantu has to pay this sales tax on practically every article he buys except his foodstuffs. He will be affected by this tax and will be more affected than the other groups, because the hon. the Deputy Minister will admit that the Bantu are the group which on the whole earn a lower income. Although they receive no relief in respect of direct taxation and income-tax, they have to bear all the burdens of indirect taxation with the other groups. That is going to hit at them and they are going to bear in mind that their cost of living has gone up with the indirect taxation they have to pay, but that they do not receive the relief which the groups are getting by way of allowances on income-tax. This Government is going to find itself very much embarrassed by territorial authorities such as that of the Transkei and the Ciskei, which may not all agree on the rate of taxation. If this tax is to be collected on the pay-as-you-earn system by the employer, we are going to find that the employer will have to find out to which ethnic group his employees belong, and he may have to deduct a different amount for taxation for each ethnic group.</p>

<p>I point out these problems which may arise because I want to say that this measure should not have been introduced in the way in which it has been done. Far more consideration should have been given to it. After all, the Franszen Commission went into this question of taxation in general, and the Government should have waited until it has received the Franszen Commission’s report, if they are going to make a report, in regard to Bantu taxation. If they are not going to give a report on Bantu taxation and the effects of the various taxes on the Bantu, then I want to say that the Government should appoint a special commission to go into this question of Bantu taxation in general, not only the question of income-tax, but the question of all the other taxes that the Bantu have to pay. The Commission should also go into the question of what taxes the Bantu are able to pay. We feel that this matter deserves more consideration. Therefore, although we accept the principle of the collection of taxes under the pay-as-you-earn system, and although the principle of differentiation in taxation has been accepted in the past, which we opposed at the time, we feel that if there is good reason for taxing the Bantu on a separate scale, the Government should bring proof to this House as to what scale it should be and how it should compare with the taxation paid by the other groups. We have had nothing like that placed before us and the hon. the Deputy Minister has not even told us why it is necessary to tax the Bantu on a different basis from the other groups.</p>

<p>We can foresee the trouble that eventually as the Coloured Council and the Indian Council develop there may be calls by them for powers to tax themselves and eventually we shall have each of the different groups taxed separately by this House. No groups are going to be satisfied if they feel that they are paying a tax which other groups do not pay. They will not be satisfied if some groups are getting more benefit from the taxation than the other groups. If they are not taxed on the same basis, it would bring about hostility between the groups in South Africa unless a good reason is shown and proof is given as to why they should be taxed on a different basis and they are shown what benefit they will receive from that form of taxation. The Minister says that they have consulted with the Chambers of Industries and other bodies who have said that they would welcome a simpler form of taxation. The Minister says that this is a simpler form of taxation. I say that it would have been a simpler form of taxation if all the Native taxes were combined in one tax and the employer knew exactly what he has to deduct from his employee's pay. To satisfy all the taxes as regards the employee. That, of course, is not the case as the hon. the Minister himself has admitted. The general tax will not be paid monthly; it has to be paid in one lump sum; the tribal levies will be paid separately from this taxation which will be deducted by the employer. So the employer is not going to find himself any better off under the new legislation than he has found himself under the present legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has mentioned payment in kind. I take it that the farm labourer will not be taxed on his rations or any other benefits he has received in kind. I take it that that will also apply to domestic servants. Nothing given in kind will be taken in for taxation. It does not seem quite right that anything <span class="col_6623-6624" refersTo="page_0459"/>given in kind will not be taxed, whereas the Native who cannot get anything in kind, will have to pay the full tax. I am not for one moment saying that the Natives should be taxed for the food and the housing they get on the farms, but naturally there is going to be a grudge against their colleague who receives clothing, food and free accommodation while other Natives only receive their salary and have to pay for accommodation, transport, etc., and are much worse off than their colleagues who pay no tax at all.</p>

<p>I could go on and on discussing the inequities in the measure and the hon. the Deputy Minister, I think, will agree, that this is not the solution and that we can expect to land in trouble. He does not pretend that this is the solution and therefore I say before the House accepts a Bill of this nature, and the principles involved, we should have much further inquiry into this matter. The Minister should come to us with facts, which will substantiate his case. We, therefore, want to suggest that this matter should be referred to a Select Committee. All we can do is to suggest that it should be referred to a Select Committee where members of both sides of the House can hear evidence by the Bantu themselves, the employers, the tax consultants and by the Revenue Department. Let us hear the whole story and go into the matter fully. We cannot go into the matter fully in this House; we cannot take evidence and on the meagre information given by the hon. the Minister, we are not justified to accept a Bill of this nature and the scales of taxation contained in the Schedule. Therefore I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the order for the Second Reading of the Bantu Taxation Bill be discharged and that the subject of the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report, the Committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers and to have leave to bring up an amended Bill&#x201D;.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after a long argument the hon. member eventually came forward with an amendment. Throughout his entire argument no one could determine whether he was in favour of or opposed to the principle of Bantu taxation. Now, it was clear throughout his argument, and it became even clearer from his amendment, that he had not done his homework properly, because there have already been several commissions of inquiry about the whole question of Bantu taxation. I am referring specifically to the Lemmer committee of 1963, which, <i>inter alia,</i> had the following terms of reference. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; with specific reference to:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) improved methods, systems and means of collecting Native taxes;</li>

<li>(2) whether the P.A.Y.E. system should be applied to the collection of Native taxes;</li>

<li>(3) any other views in regard to the stepping up and the effective application of the Act in connection with the collection of tax; and</li>

<li>(4) whether any amendment of law is essential.</li>

</ol>

<p>This Lemmer committee did valuable work and collected valuable statistics, from which I shall quote in due course. Subsequently another commission was appointed which once again issued a report. If we now look at the legislation as it was passed, and if we have listened to the Second-Reading speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister, it is very clear that the principles of Bantu taxation are not being altered by the legislation before us, but that a new levying technique is being instituted, the P.A.Y.E. system. Certain concessions are being made. But, as I see it, the Bill is not intended for the collection of more income-tax or less income-tax from the Bantu. The Deputy Minister also said this in his Second-Reading speech. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> that R7.6 million was collected in the year 1963-’64, in 1967-’68 R11.3 million and in 1968-’69 R11.3 million as well. Despite the rebate of R1 per year for the 3.5 million male taxpayers in respect of the basic tax of R3.50 per year, it is foreseen that under the new system about R11 million per year will also be collected. This is because of the fact that more will be collected per taxpayer. There are certain adjustments. I shall come to them in due course and point them out. But there are many Bantu taxpayers who do not pay under the existing legislation because they cannot be incorporated under this system. This is what we also found when the P.A.Y.E. system was established for the Whites, i.e. that there were taxpayers who did not in fact honour their obligations.</p>

<p>The United Party does, in fact, have to answer the following two basic questions in that connection. Is the United Party in favour of education and tuition for the Bantu? If so, why do they bemoan and deplore this legislation and why are they begging for a White Paper and a Select Committee? This legislation before the House is nothing more than a simplification and a consolidation of already existing measures. If there were any additional amounts collected under this system of tax collection, who would the people be who would benefit by that? Surely hon. members know that this tax goes directly to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, from which it is paid over to the Bantu Education Account. There has, after all, been a great shortage for years. This is, in fact, what we must believe if we look at the statistics. I shall quote from the Lemmer report. In the year 1926-’27 the total Bantu taxation collected was about R2.2 million, and the expenditure on Bantu education R0.9 million. But Bantu taxation increased to R2.8 million in the year 1937-’38 and the expenditure on Bantu education to R1.8 million. In the year 1947-’48 the Bantu taxation was a mere R3.1 million as against expenditure on <span class="col_6625-6626" refersTo="page_0460"/>Bantu education of R9.2 million. In 1958-’59 the Bantu taxation was R5.4 million and the expenditure on Bantu education R18.5 million. In the year 1963-’64 Bantu taxation was estimated at R7.8 million, while the expenditure on Bantu education was R26 million. There is therefore a deficiency. If more were to be collected under this legislation than is estimated, i.e. R11 million, who would benefit by this? The Bantu, and no one else, especially in the sphere of Bantu education. I cannot understand the hon. member for Transkei’s argument in that connection at all, because the Bantu are being benefited, specifically by way of Bantu education. The Government is not being benefited. The Whites in this country are not being benefited either.</p>

<p>The hon. member touched upon a whole series of matters. It is simply not possible for me to reply to them in the time at my disposal. But in order to reply to what I consider to be the most important, I want to bring the following to the attention of the House.</p>

<p>Bantu who earn less than R360 per year now pay R2.50 in general tax as against the previous R3.50. He therefore gains R1 a year. But what about the Bantu with an income of R870 per year? He will pay R9.82 in future, 68 cents per year less than he has paid in the past A Bantu with an income of R1,230 will now pay R17.02, 52 cents per year more than he paid in the past. A Bantu with an income of R1,740 will now pay R27.22, R2.72 more than in the past. A Bantu with an income of R4,020 will now pay R173.62, while in the past, if he was married and without children, he would have paid R262.50, which entails a saving of R95.88. I am mentioning these figures to illustrate that, since the hon. the Deputy Minister said that there would be no noticeable difference in the amount, there will merely be a rounding off process in the actual payment of taxes when the proposed rates take effect, but there will not be a substantial difference in the amounts which will be paid by the Bantu. In other words, there will not be an additional levy in excess of that to which he is already liable under the legislation of 1925 and subsequent legislation. The hon. member’s plea for a Select Committee of a White Paper can therefore merely serve as an indication to me that he did not do his homework properly and that he merely moved the amendment for a White Paper in order to be able to say something.</p>

<p>He quoted from the Franszen Commission report. If he were to refer to page 39 he would see that the last sentence of paragraph 175 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As regards the expenditure pattern of the Bantu, it was found in a survey in the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage area that no less than 70.7 per cent of the expenditure of the average Bantu family was on the above-mentioned items.</block>

<p>And the above-mentioned items are those not affected under the sales duty. Therefore his entire argument that the Bantu would, by indirect taxation, be affected to such an extent that the Government would be compelled to make tax concessions, falls flat. The hon. member said that the United Party opposed the increase of the general tax in 1958. Under those circumstances one would assume that they would be very grateful for this legislation because the general tax is being decreased here from R3.50 to R2.50.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>What about the income-tax which he has to pay?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>As far as incometax is concerned, I have just proved to the hon member that there is no increase on the 1925 tax. He may make that small calculation himself, if he can. He will find that there is no essential difference between the old rates and the new rates. Sir, the hon. member said: &#x201C;The collection system is not new.&#x201D; It is definitely new as far as the Bantu is concerned. The Bantu has never been compelled to make monthly payments under the P.A.Y.E. system. The principle of Bantu taxation is not new; it was accepted a long time ago. The principle of specific rates is not new either; it was accepted a long time ago. This legislation results in no essential difference in rates. The hon. member said that the levying technique, the P.A.Y.E. system, is not new. Why he is therefore asking for this Bill to be referred to a Select Committee I find altogether inexplicable. He said that what was, in fact, new, was, as he described it, &#x201C;the introduction of a system whereby one part of the population pays on a different basis from the other&#x201D;. But, Sir, this is not new either. In terms of the 1925 Act the Bantu were already paying on a different basis to the Whites. Then he asked: Why can the Whites be favoured by certain deductions while the Bantu taxpayer is not favoured. But surely the hon. member received his reply about this. The answer is that there are several concessions granted to the Bantu which are not granted to the Whites. There is the concession that compensation <i>in natura,</i> compensation by way of housing and food and even livestock, is not taxed until it is converted into capital. This is a concession which the white taxpayer does not receive. There is the additional concession that husband and wife are taxed separately under this measure; their incomes are not added together. This is an important concession; this is a benefit which the Whites do not enjoy. There are certain concessions which are not granted to the Bantu, but this is more than offset by the compensation granted to the Bantu in this Bill.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member pleaded for a setoff of the tax which is payable by various groups of the population. I take it that he means that the tax which is payable by the Bantu in terms of the new rates should be set-off against the tax which would be payable <span class="col_6627-6628" refersTo="page_0461"/>by the Whites. Let me immediately concede that there are various reasons why such a setoff would not be fair and justified. At this stage it is not possible in practice either because the Whites, <i>inter alia,</i> pay provincial tax, as the hon. member should know, and the provincial tax for the four provinces has not been announced yet, with the exception of that for the Transvaal, and, I think, the Cape. But I have certain statistics before me which I want to quote for the hon. member’s information so that he will not feel so sad about the lack of a White Paper. An unmarried white person with an income of R870 pays R19 and the married white person pays R2. This includes the Transvaal provincial tax at the new rates which were announced last week. On the other hand, in future, the Bantu will pay R9.82 An unmarried white person with an income of R1,230 will pay R56 and the married white person R11, as against the Bantu’s R17.02. An unmarried white person with an income of R1,740 would pay R133 and the married white person R53, as against the Bantu’s R27.22. The unmarried white person on an income of R4,020 would pay R409 and the married person R281, as against the Bantu’s R173.62.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member must listen. This set off which, according to the hon. member, justifies the reference of the Bill to a Select Committee, indicates that the Bantu’s rate compares very favourably with that at which the Whites will be paying in the future, i.e. after the hon. the Minister of Finance has announced the new rates. This ought to console the hon. member. The hon. member also asked what would happen if the terrible problem of the Transkei Government not accepting this taxation Act were to crop up. The hon. the Deputy Minister has surely given us a reply already. He pointed out that taxation is not merely a fiscal measure, but also a measure which denotes the subservience of a person to the people, to the nation and to the State to which he belongs. In the light of that, particularly in the light of the second leg of that argument, I can see no reason why the Transkei Government would not pass similar tax legislation. Does the hon. member want to claim that the Transkei Government does not want to affirm that subservience, that loyalty, of the Transkei citizens to the Transkei with, <i>inter alia,</i> legislation which makes those Transkei citizens liable to pay tax to the Transkei Government? The hon. member is now sitting there without saying a word. I say that that argument has already been dealt with sufficiently by the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Transkei made a strange plea at the end of his speech. He came along here with what I would almost call a stupid request that all taxes which the Bantu pay should be united in one tax. Let us at least be realistic. What does the Bantu pay under the taxation Bill which is now before us? In the first place he pays the basic general tax of R2.50; this applies to males between the ages of 18 and 65 years. In the second place, he pays, if applicable, a local tax of R1 with a maximum of R4 if he has four huts. Furthermore, he pays the tax according to the rates before us and, if so determined by the tribal authority, he pays a tribal tax. Let us review those four different taxes individually. It is immediately clear that one tax could never make provision for the needs which must be met by each type of tax which must be levied. Let us suppose that a tribal authority decides to purchase three tractors. Does the hon. member then want to suggest that an Act should be passed by this Parliament which assesses the entire Bantu population of the Republic at 5 or 10 per cent per male member in order to buy those three tractors or, say, five lorries? Is that what he is suggesting?</p>

<p>No, he is not suggesting that, but he is pleading here for all taxes to be combined into one tax. The hon. the Deputy Minister explained that there are 3.5 million male Bantu between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are liable to taxation and who now have to pay R2.50 per year. The hon. member has said that this must be combined in one tax.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>That is what the hon. member was asking for; he said, &#x201C;All taxes to be combined in one tax&#x201D;. That request by the hon. member would entail at least 42 million entries having to be made. If the hon. member were to think of the cost of that, it goes without saying that it could never be considered, as the hon. the Minister has indicated.</p>

<p>I want to repeat that the legislation before us contains no new principles. The principle of the tax liability of the Bantu was decided many years ago. It now implies the P.A.Y.E. system for the Bantu. It simplifies the existing legislation and creates the channels through which Bantu, who were liable to taxation in the past in terms of the 1925 Act and did not pay the tax, will now also have to contribute their share in terms of this Act, not for the Whites or for this Government, but exclusively for the benefit of the Bantu Education Account. If hon. members of that side agree that it is, in fact, necessary for Bantu education to get money, what objection can there be? Do the hon. members want to say that Bantu education must not get money? Now they sit there without saying anything.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>If this then implies that this Act will provide that those Bantu who are liable to taxation and who have in the past evaded their responsibilities, will now have to meet these obligations and that the funds so obtained would strengthen the Bantu <span class="col_6629-6630" refersTo="page_0462"/>Education Account, what is the hon. members’ objection? There can be no objection, because the whole matter of Bantu taxation has to my knowledge already been investigated by at least two commissions. The legislation before us is quite clear and the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister has shed even more light upon the matter. I now merely ask for what earthly reason the hon. member stood up here to ask for a Select Committee by way of an amendment I think that these are merely delaying tactics on the part of that side of the House and I want to tell the hon. the Minister that, while we realize that such a new collection technique may give rise to problems, this legislation is a courageous attempt to call upon all Bantu taxpayers to meet their responsibilities. On behalf of this side of the House I want to thank the Minister and his Department for introducing this law.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid the hon. member who has just sat down did not understand what my colleague, the hon. member for Transkei, was saying and that has led him into missing the point altogether in so far as my hon. friend’s speech is concerned. The result is that he is criticizing what was never said.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei moved that this Bill should be sent to a Select Committee now before the Second Reading. In the light of the advantage that Parliament has gained through adopting that procedure in the past, I want to ask the Deputy Minister in charge of this Bill to give very serious thought indeed to this request which has been made. Let us go back for a moment to some of the history of Bantu taxation and have a look at it, bearing in mind that events like the Bambata Rebellion of 1906 stemmed directly from the imposition of a poll tax on the Bantu of Natal. This is a matter which from time immemorial has caused difficulty. The initial tax first levied on Natives in South Africa historically was merely a replication of a tax which was really the paying of tribute to the chief. That was the historical basis of taxation in South Africa. The first taxes were based on the historical concept among the Bantu people of paying tribute to the chief. The Deputy Minister, who knows Bantu history, will probably agree with me that that was the basis upon which those taxes were founded. When once the white authority became the supreme chief, it was entitled to tribute. From that it went on, for various reasons. Taxation was increased from time to time, so that to-day we have a mixture of an old historical concept and a modern concept of the need to pay taxes for the purpose of carrying on the government and to pay for the various services rendered by the Government of the country. But I want to suggest that this was an appropriate occasion to have gone into the whole question of Bantu taxation. I say that for the reason that together with other sections of the people, the Bantu are gradually getting a much higher level of money wages paid to them. They are getting much higher wages or salaries in money payments, at a level which 20 or 25 years ago would probably have been unthinkable. The whole shift in the basic economy of South Africa is working towards an increase in salaries and wages for the Bantu along with other folk on the lower economic strata. There is a general lifting of salaries and wages. That is bringing the Bantu, who in the past were on a very low level in so far as actual wages were concerned, gradually higher up the salary ladder to a point where they become now, as it were, equated with members of other groups. We have seen even in recent weeks cases where professional people who are Bantu will be drawing in the region of R3,000 or R4,000 a year. When I was a boy that was unthinkable. My old grandfather and people of his generation would have wanted to put a wet towel around their heads and rest in the shade for a few hours because they would have thought they were suffering from sunstroke if we had talked like that in those days, but to-day we just take it for granted. At this time then in our economic history, as well as in our political history, it is perhaps a fitting time for the whole matter to have been reviewed. Here I want to support the hon. member for Transkei when he says that we surely to-day are not going to waste any time debating whether under the new Schedule more or less tax is going to be paid by the Bantu. That is really not the issue before us. It may be an issue which may become important, but it is not the issue before us, I submit, in the debate on this measure.</p>

<p>What we are concerned with here is not what the hon. member who has just sat down said, when he said that these are old taxes and this is merely a new method of dealing with them. This is not a new method of dealing with them. This was a golden opportunity to investigate the whole matter <i>ab initio,</i> to hear what the people concerned had to say, and there are many people vitally interested, and then to come with a measure which would have had a degree of permanence. I want to emphasize that point. The Bantu people as a whole, the 13 million or 14 million of them, are conservative people; they are like me; they are &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D;. They are conservative. We do not like too many sudden changes, particularly in taxation. None of us likes changes in taxation, especially if, looking at it from our own point of view, we consider that it will hit us and that we will have to pay more. That is a fatal basis for any taxation&#x2014;I will have to pay more. That is fatal. No kind of taxation proposal can appeal to the taxpayer if he has to pay more. But I repeat that the Bantu people are conservative and they do not like change. That is why I suggest that before this change was made piecemeal, there should have been a thorough investigation so that what is adopted now, subject <span class="col_6631-6632" refersTo="page_0463"/>to any change in the rate, could have been the system of taxation for a long time to come. Not only so far as the Bantu people are concerned&#x2014;I will come to that in a moment&#x2014;but in so far as they, as a race, are concerned with taxation it would be a longterm method of taxation, the rate itself being probably subject to change. I am leaving out the historical reason why we have different taxes paid by the Bantu and why personal tax is paid by the white people but not by the Bantu and that sort of thing, because I do not think it is really germane to the subject. The principle, then, that I would like to see would be basically that an income tax in South Africa, subject to whatever the rate may be and subject to whatever rung on the taxation ladder the tax may start at, it should be one tax applicable to everyone throughout South Africa. The Deputy Minister shakes his head. I am putting forward a proposal here which could be thrashed out before a Select Committee. The fact that the Deputy Minister shakes his head while I feel just as strongly that I am right, while he believes strongly that I am wrong, is a good reason why the matter should go to a Select Committee, because both of us ought to know what we are talking about, and I do know what I am talking about.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Heaven forbid, Mr. Speaker. I was never more serious and earnest in my life. The hon. the Minister of Social Welfare knows nothing about Bantu taxation, nor about the Bantu. He knows nothing about it at all. He did not even write a thesis about it as the other hon. Deputy Minister did, however wrong that thesis may be. But let us come back to the point. Where do we go to when we depart from the principle? Because we now have an opportunity of dealing with the principle, a long term principle, for Bantu taxation. As my hon. friend has said, we are running the risk that the different ethnic groups, as and when they reach the stage where the Transkei is to-day, are bound to demand their right of taxation. Similarly with the Coloured people who inevitably, as surely as the sun rises, are going to ask for the right of taxation. I think they are being given R20 million to-day to handle as expenditure. Sir, I was a provincial councillor and had to do with provincial administrations long before I came to Parliament. Those hon. members of this House who were provincial councillors, the hon. member for Klip River is one of them, will know that through the years there has always been the tendency to come down harder and harder on the provinces’ rights of taxation; there has always been a resistance on the part of the provinces at losing their spheres of influence and their rights to taxation, i.e. the avenues through which they can tax. Here there is continually the crunch between the provincial administrations and the Government, on the question of taxation, the sources of taxation. History has warned us that that is the position and it ought to warn us that that will be the position and that the Coloured group, the Indian group and the other eight Bantu ethnic groups will each press for the right to levy their own taxation. The Government’s ideology is bringing them up against a stone wall, and this they have to surmount, not us. As a matter of fact, the Government may rest assured that every time they slip and skin their noses on that stone we of the United Party shall tell them, &#x201C;We told you so; see what a mess you are now making of things&#x201D;. From the political point of view we are going to take the fullest advantage of it. On that point I want to be quite clear.</p>

<p>The measure we are discussing now is going to fail and it is going to fail for two very good reasons, and when my hon. friend suggested that it be referred to a Select Committee, he was suggesting something in the interests of South Africa and in the interest of a good fiscal measure to apply to all races at all times. Surely, that is not party politics; it is only a broad South African outlook and as such should be lauded by the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development. But let me give the two reasons why this legislation is going to fail.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Bantu are not identifiable to-day. I am not talking about the man in permanent employment in towns; about the man who has got a fixed job with a boss who knows him and for whom he works year after year. It is not these I am talking about; I am talking about those who come in from the Bantu areas, work for a time and then move on. In some cases they work for a week, even for only one day and then move on. And are these there in their hundreds or thousands or are they there in tens of thousands? They cannot be identified. That is why the general tax to-day is so far in arrears. Every one of us who works with the Bantu and comes from Bantu areas, knows of the Bantu who comes along with a smile on his face and admits that he hasn’t paid his tax for five years, or <span class="col_6633-6634" refersTo="page_0464"/>eight years, or as the case may be, and is quite happy about it. This happens because they cannot be identified. In the so-called Bantu areas there is no method of identification of the Bantu. That is the first point, i.e. you cannot identify them for the purposes of this tax. This tax will be collected from the employer who employs more or less permanently the same Bantu month after month. He has them in regular employment and you can collect the tax from him. As far as this is concerned, there is going to be no great difficulty. The Government is not collecting this tax; they are putting the onus on the employer to collect it. But as soon as you come to the shifting mass of the Bantu people then tax collecting will fail.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is going to fail because there is not the staff to administer it, and to administer this particular measure is going to call for far more staff than what we have at the present moment, if only to keep the records up to date and for no other reason, the records in the tribal areas and the records in the white areas. When the Deputy Minister was speaking just now, he said he knew this was not a solution and that there would have to be amendments to this Bill. And how right he was. However, it is unnecessary. He is saying the very thing that frightens me. He is saying to the Bantu that there will be chopping and changing as far as their taxation system is concerned; that it will have to be amended. Thereby we are doing the one thing we ought not to do with the Bantu. Instead, we should lay down the position clearly, distinctly and let it remain there. We should not go back again and chop and change so that the Bantu is continually in a ferment wondering what is going to be the next change in regard to his taxation. However, this is what the Deputy Minister has forecast. That he himself has said. And this is one of the cardinal weaknesses in this measure&#x2014;it has none of the elements of substance, of permanency. Here, then, lies the big difficulty. In dealing with the changes that may be made, let us look at the Transkei for a moment. Let us look at the Transkei Constitution Act, No. 48 of 1963, particularly at section 37 dealing with the legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei. It has the power &#x201C;(a) to make laws not inconsistent with this Act in relation to all matters appearing in part B of the first schedule of this Act&#x201D;. Let us now have a look at part B. Section 1 of part B says &#x201C;direct taxation on citizens of the Transkei, whether resident within or outside the Transkei &#x2026;&#x201D; So, the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei can make these laws. In 37 (1) (b) it says that &#x201C;to provide in any such law for the amendment or repeal of any law, including any Act of Parliament &#x2026;&#x201D; But let us go further and come to subsection (3). Leaving out the exclusion, it says, &#x201C;no law made after the commencement of this Act &#x2026; which relates to any matter referred to in subsection (1) shall apply in the Transkei &#x2026;&#x201D; But there is an exclusion which I have left out and this I should now like to read. What law, then, shall apply in the Transkei, the law that has been excluded? It is the law made by the Legislative Assembly &#x201C;as is referred to in subparagraph (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 52 &#x2026;&#x201D; Let us have a look at section 52 (1) (a) (ii) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All moneys payable in terms of any Act of Parliament imposing any tax on incomes &#x2026; by any citizen of the Transkei who is ordinarily resident in the Transkei &#x2026;</block>

<p>Subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (a) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in respect of the estate of any citizen of the Transkei who at the time of his death was ordinarily resident in the Transkei.</block>

<p>So, what is the net result? The net result is that in regard to these taxes applicable to a resident in the Transkei, the Transkeian Assembly cannot amend this tax. However, in respect to the taxes applicable to a citizen outside the Transkei, the Transkei Legislative Assembly can amend it. That is the position. Here we have little chickens coming home to roost. Here sits the Assembly of the Transkei and in terms of our laws it can make a law which is in respect of its own citizens outside the Transkei, but in the white areas it can repeal a tax, amend it or exempt its citizens from it. But in respect of their own citizens in their own homeland, they can do nothing about the matter. We fix the tax for its own citizens in its own homeland. There is nothing it can do about it. It must accept the dictates of our Parliament in regard to its own citizens in their homeland. But in regard to their own citizens who are in the white homeland, they can amend, change or do with it whatever they like. There is nothing we can do about it in Parliament. That is the point.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>We can pass an Act to-day dealing as we will with those Transkei citizens outside the Transkei, in white areas, and it is not applicable. It can be repealed at once by the Transkei Legislative Assembly. This is how it works. That is why the hon. member for Transkei said that these various governments of the future may make changes in the application of the laws; in the rate of tax; in the rungs of the taxation ladder and there is nothing that the Deputy Minister can do about it.</p>

<p>Now let us have a look at the position of the employer who will have to collect the tax. In that case he does not only have to watch and see what the law is made by the Transkei in respect of its citizens outside the Transkei; what the law is made by this Parliament in respect of the citizens of the Transkei outside <span class="col_6635-6636" refersTo="page_0465"/>the Transkei, but also what the position is in regard to a citizen of the Transkei normally domiciled in the Transkei who comes out of the Transkei and wants to work. What kind of a position are we placing the employer in? This is only one homeland with that kind of government. We have eight of these ethnic groups. If they are not to be given kindred powers, then there is cause for trouble immediately. We are now, because of the passed legislation, getting ourselves into a real fiscal mess. Reference has been made in respect of the purchase tax and taxes of that kind. Here again the question arises as to how far legislative functions and legislative powers run in regard to these matters. We will now continually be caught between the upper and the nether millstones in respect of taxation measures passed by the Transkei and hereafter by the other non-white governments as they come into being and their own parliament as we are sitting here in Parliament assembled. I say that this is all wrong and needless. Let the Deputy Minister send this to a Select Committee. Let us get together and see whether we can work out, firstly, a measure which will be fair to all, taking into account their economic status, their capacity to pay, any fringe benefits they may have. Let us see whether we cannot make it applicable and make it in such form that it will have a degree of permanence so that when the Bantu are told that this is the new system of taxation and the new scale of taxes and that it is likely to remain, they will know that they will now have to settle down, because there are the taxes. The Government must also carry out a proper method so that the taxpayer can be identified if he is a Bantu. This is not possible at the moment. Many years ago I sat on a committee. We laid down as one of the first principles for statehood, for which we were trying to find out an answer to, it should be possible for a government to be able to identify citizens without difficulty and for the citizens to be able to claim the protection of the Government without difficulty. At the present time that does not apply as far as the Bantu are concerned, particularly where one gets the Transkei coming into the picture and other people of that kind may hereafter have citizenship attaching them to other Bantu states. These are the main principles, the simple things which we should like to have done. It can be done round the table of a Select Committee. There the appropriate folk can all come to give evidence. They can be examined and we can hammer out something really worthwhile putting on the Statute Book.</p>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the address made by the hon. member for South Coast about the problems the hon. the Opposition is seeing in the implementation of this legislation. It seems to me as if I have to agree with the hon. member for Wonderboom. I simply cannot do otherwise. The Opposition has not made a proper study of this matter. Now they want to bluff themselves that no one else has gone into this matter, and that the hon. the Minister has come here without understanding the implications of this legislation. They pretend that the Minister simply wants to force legislation onto people without understanding what it is about. Now they would like to acquaint themselves with the matter. The only way to be able to do this, is to get a Select Committee appointed on the subject. It seems to me that this is what it is about. In any event, I cannot dwell long on the arguments. The hon. member for South Coast said that this legislation would be a failure for two reasons. In the first instance, the Bantu could not be identified and, in the second instance, there would not be enough staff, because this legislation is too cumbrous. The hon. the Deputy Minister explained here that efforts have been made to make it as concise as possible. I really think it is. The whole question of tax collection is problematic, especially when one is dealing with the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast told us that he knew the Bantu and also the conditions in which they resisted the original taxes, etc. In my opinion he wants to make the matter more cumbrous than it in fact is. In any event, I think we have reached the stage in this country where the Bantu have become used to and acquainted with certain basic systems of democracy as practised by us. We must not try to make these Bantu imitators of the Whites, not even as regards our taxation system. The hon. member suggested that we should have one system of taxation. I do not want to dwell on this in detail. There may be a certain measure of similarity among the Bantu, the Coloureds, the Indians and us, so that we can place them on the same footing as regards taxation. However, with the best will in the world I cannot see how the hon. member can say that he knows the Bantu, the Bantu’s circumstances and history, and then still wants to suggest that we should simply have only one system of taxation, and that the Bantu should be placed on the same footing as the Whites. There are so many cases where the Bantu should be treated differently. We are dealing here with people who differ from us to a large extent. The point of view of this side of the House is that we should accept those differences. Everything we do is based on the individual identities of the races concerned. As regards taxation, it is important in my opinion that we should take the specific needs of the Bantu into account. Here we have a case where 3½ million out of a total population of 12½ million are liable to taxation. I agree with the hon. member for South Coast that their income has increased during the past number of years. But simply to say that we must make their system of taxation the same as ours without taking into account all the complications, is to my mind something which cannot be considered at all. In the first place I want to revert to the question of Bantu education. It was laid down as a principle by this side of the House that a certain amount, <span class="col_6637-6638" refersTo="page_0466"/>i.e. R13 million, would be voted for that annually. The rest of the amount was to be collected by way of taxation to be paid by the Bantu. If we look at the Bantu Education Account, we see that there is an annual shortage. In my opinion, therefore, this Bill is very welcome at this stage because it will afford us the opportunity of collecting possibly larger amounts. I think it is only right that we should take into account that the Bantu must make his contribution, and that we should stand by this principle, also as regards his education. If we take into account the entire question of the development of the country, it should be realized very clearly that in the first instance we have to deal with less developed people. They have to be taught and guided from the beginning to make a contribution in their own traditions and circumstances. In other words, to a large extent they are a limiting factor. We cannot move too rapidly because the material with which we are working is of limited capacity. On the other hand we cannot say that the Bantu should pay the same as the Whites, and so abandon this principle. We must take into account the Whites willingness to contribute to the development of the Bantu, and this is important. In a certain South African trade publication it is said, for example, that 34.5 per cent of their total labour force is derived from the Bantu population. If we go into this whole question of Bantu revenue, we must accept that the wages, benefits and consequently the income of the Bantu who are rendering these services in the commercial field have, as has been mentioned by hon. members, increased. In my opinion it is a sound basis that is set out here, i.e. that those who earn more than R360 per annum, must contribute progressively more &#x2026; The only way in which a hold can be obtained over these people is by bringing the employer into the matter. That is basically what is envisaged with this system. The employer has to be brought into the matter and he has to fill in the forms. In cases where Bantu work for short periods, such as when it is a monthly wage which exceeds a certain fixed amount, and he has bound himself to work for a certain period, deductions, calculated on the total excess at the end of the year, have to be made in any case. The result is that that Bantu will now make his contribution. I know that the task of finding the 3½ million Bantu who will now have to pay taxes, will be a very difficult one. The only way out is, therefore, the basis I have mentioned here.</p>

<p>I cannot see how we can expect a select committee to conjure up methods out of the air to combat this basic problem we have been struggling with all these years. I feel that we, as the hon. the Minister said, will come up against problems. As we develop we can give attention to these matters and then we can see where we can improve the system. The problem in this case, will be to get all the employers to fill in their forms and to see to it that these particulars are made available to the Department concerned. I think it is very important that direct Bantu taxation should definitely be given attention in the way it is getting attention here. In a rural constituency such as mine we have the difficulty with the Opposition that they do the rounds and say, &#x201C;Look what the State is doing for the Kaffirs! Look what is being done in the Bantu areas; and what contributions are being made by these people?&#x201D; This is the one story which they spread on the platteland. If we seek a sound approach for the collecting of taxes, they feel that the matter should first be referred to a Select Committee, and in the process the whole undertaking is delayed. I want to give a reason here why I welcome the fact that Bantu who earn more than R360 per annum will now be subject to this scale of taxation, and that the employer is going to be brought into the matter and will have to accept responsibility for the worker. Because the position in this country is that we have developed so rapidly and that the wages of the Bantu have increased so rapidly during the past number of years, the Bantu have in fact been unable to keep pace with the development of the country. Instead of increasing their standard of living the Bantu decided in many cases that they were earning so much that they should work less. This is one of the problems we have to cope with in the Lowveld, where we have to do with intensive farming. The Bantu go to the Witwatersrand complex to go and work in the industries in particular. Now the farmers have the difficulty that many of them go and work in the industries for six months, and then sit at home for the next six months. I think it is the duty of the State to make those people realize that they must contribute their share to the development of their own areas and to the education of their children. The image that is created by the Opposition in my area, i.e. that the Whites are simply pumping in the money and developing the Bantu, and that they are in fact better off than the Whites, must be stamped out. In my opinion the hon. the Minister should try to have this legislation implemented as effectively as possible, although we will undoubtedly have problems.</p>

<p>In view of what has been said here I cannot see why there should be any delay and why there should be another Select Committee discussion. To my mind we could have come forward with legislation such as this a few years earlier. Then we would have been in the position that we could have determined from our experience where the bottlenecks are, and we could already have been eliminating them now. I can assure hon. members that the legislation before us now, will be welcomed in my community. Actually I would very much have liked to see that we had a compulsory payment system for the entire 3½ million, and that the employers could have been brought in there as well. From the speech made by the hon. the Minister I understand, however, that that is not possible, and that it would not justify the administrative work on <span class="col_6639-6640" refersTo="page_0467"/>account of the large numbers. Consequently it will not be possible to apply it. But provision is at least being made now for Bantu persons who earn more than R360 per annum to make their contribution to the development of the Bantu, not only in the homelands, but especially for their education throughout the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one of the points which seems to be worrying the hon. member for Nelspruit is the fact that the Official Opposition often uses the argument that too much money is being spent on the Blacks, particularly during election periods. If this is so, I cannot help having the thought that the hon. member is thinking of a good answer to this accusation. The answer that he is going to trot out is going to be the Bill which is before the House to-day. He is going to say, &#x201C;There you are; it is not true; we are going to levy much greater taxes on the Bantu people and therefore we can ignore the accusation that we are spending too much of the white taxpayer’s money on the black man&#x201D;. The other argument he used was in part the same as the argument used by the hon. member for Wonderboom. He has said that the main beneficiary of the increased amount of tax collected by virtue of this new taxation measure is going to be the Bantu Education Account. Thereby they are both reaffirming what to me is the essentially unsound principle that the Africans should pay for their own educational services. Of course, if one carries this to the most ridiculous extreme, it would mean that in every case the poorer members of the community must be expected to finance their own services in all regards.</p>

<p>That is not true.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>But this is exactly the argument that is used, namely why should it be expected of the Africans to finance their own education when it is not expected, for instance, that the poorer members of the white section should not receive all the benefits that the richer members of the white community get, namely free and compulsory education. One can carry this argument to an absolute ludicrous extent such as to say that certain constituencies contribute more to the Consolidated Revenue Fund than other constituencies. I dare say my own is a high contributor towards the Consolidated Revenue Fund, but who on earth could use the argument that therefore certain members of the community should be entitled to greater benefits? This is nonsense. No modern state recognizes the principle that the poorer section of the community should be expected to finance its own essential services. It is largely because this Bill carries still further that principle which has been adopted in this House in many regards, that I am entirely against this Bill.</p>

<p>I will of course vote against it in principle at the Second Reading. I do not believe, in any case, that one should consider the Africans who are integrated economically in our country and two-thirds of whom earn their livelihood in the white areas of South Africa, as a separate entity for the purposes of taxation. The hon. the Deputy Minister himself says that in most communities taxation is levied according to a person’s ability to pay. Of course that is the one and only principle that should concern this House when it is considering taxation measures. It should be an equitable form of taxation based on the principle that nobody should pay who is unable to pay. To my mind this Bill goes completely against that principle and it goes against that principle in one particular respect, namely that it starts the taxable income as far as Africans are concerned at a much lower level than the taxable income starts for white, Coloured and Indian taxpayers. I am leaving aside the question of the poll tax which Africans pay and which white people do not pay. It is true that Africans do not, and white people do pay provincial tax, but again on an income level. But instead every male African, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out, from the age of 16 to 65, irrespective of income, pays a poll tax which has this year been reduced by R1. This is considered by the hon. member for Wonderboom first of all to be an example of the Government’s magnanimous gestures towards the African people.</p>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. member that that R1 saving is completely swallowed up many times over by the sales tax which was imposed on everybody and to which Africans, of course, are also liable. During the Budget debate I showed that on one item alone, namely an essential commodity such as cleaning and washing materials, 2½ times the amount of the saving of the poll tax is going to be paid by Africans. This is the additional cost as a result of the sales tax. This estimate was not worked out by any liberalistic organization, but it was one which was worked out by the University of South Africa, which undertook a large number of cost-of-living surveys a few years ago for the different racial groups. I think these figures were based on surveys made in 1965 and 1966. On one budget item alone, 2½ times the R1 saving in poll tax is going to have to be paid by Africans, with the result that the African is not going to be better off as a result of this saving.</p>

<p>I will come to some of the specific provisions of this Bill in a moment, but I think this is quite a good opportunity for exploding some of the fallacies which are rife in South Africa about Africans generally and their taxes in particular. One of them of course is that the African pays less tax than the white person. One hears this over and over again and it is always a justification for the obvious discrepancies in services supplied to African people. No less a person than the editor of <i>Dagbreek</i> two or three weeks ago stated that the African pays less tax. That is, of course, because he earns a much lower income. It is not because he is allowed to pay a lower tax, <span class="col_6641-6642" refersTo="page_0468"/>but because he earns a lower income. Africans earn a lower income because of the many restrictions which are placed on them by various laws which prevent them from earning more money, and earning a taxable income. There are restrictions on their mobility so that they cannot sell their labour on the market that pays the highest price.</p>

<p>There are also restrictions as far as the jobs they are allowed to take up and also the skills they are allowed to acquire. All these restrictions are hindrances placed on the African’s ability to earn a taxable income. I will have absolutely no objection whatever to the African paying precisely the same amount in tax that any other taxpayer has to pay, but of course at the same taxable income level and not at a taxable income level which is lower than the level applicable to any other group in this country. There is another matter that has been pointed out by the hon. member for Transkei, namely that the African contributes a great deal towards indirect taxes in this country by way of the articles he buys on which a tax is levied. I am not only talking about the sales tax, but in the past as well Africans also had to pay for articles which carried an excise duty. The amount paid in indirect taxes has been estimated by the African Institute at about R28 million per annum. The poll tax also yields about R11 million per annum. The amount paid by Africans in ordinary income tax, according to the last available figures, was something like R1.3 million. All in all it is therefore not true to say that the African does not pay any tax at all. He does, and he pays a considerable amount of tax according to his very low earning capacity.</p>

<p>If one looks at the table given on page 291 of the Minutes of Proceedings namely the table applicable to ordinary taxable income as far as Whites, Coloureds and Indians are concerned, one sees that where the taxable income does not exceed R1,000 the tax is 5 per cent of each R1 of taxable income. Since every married white, Coloured and Indian person is allowed an immediate rebate of R50 it means that no person in that group actually pays tax. Five per cent on a R1,000 is R50 and it therefore means that no tax is paid on R1,000. If one looks at the tax tables on page 10 of this Bill one sees that where the taxable income exceeds R360 but does not exceed R480, the tax begins at R1.20 and it goes up quite steeply &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister; it is only low when one has a high income, and it is high when one is already living below the poverty datum line where every single penny of income counts and where every single penny of expenditure is an extra hardship. This is what hon. members do not realize. The poverty datum line was estimated a few years ago at R56 per month for a family of five living in an urban township. On a previous occasion I pointed out that the average earnings in the manufacturing and construction occupations for unskilled workers who are of course all Africans, are an average of only R46.11 per month.</p>

<p>The poverty datum line is R56. The average wage in the manufacturing and the construction industries is roundabout R46.11 per month. A survey which was done not so long ago in Soweto revealed that 33 per cent of families earned less than R56 per month, that 30 per cent of families earned less than R50 per month; that 30 per cent earned between R50 and R75 per month and 20 per cent between R75 and R100 per month, only 20 per cent over R100 per month. I might say that if one takes R56, which is the poverty datum line, and multiplies it by 12, one gets R672 per annum. One then sees that a large number of the people who are now going to pay up to R4.32 per annum in tax under the new schedule, are people below the poverty datum line, and that is why this tax, although it appears to be low in absolute figures, is very high comparatively.</p>

<p>Hon. members may remember that some 15 or maybe 17 years ago there was a bus strike in Johannesburg, where Africans for ten solid weeks walked into town every day from Alexandra Township, a distance of about nine miles, and back again because an additional fare of one penny per journey was about to be levied by the bus companies. They considered that one penny to be an enormous imposition on them. Every additional African who is brought in under this new tax schedule is going to feel exactly the same way about this sort of thing. Sir, I want to agree with what the hon. member for South Coast said earlier on. He said that taxation was always one of the burning issues with the African people. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that the dock workers’ strike, which was recently concluded in Durban, had as its basis the fact that the pay envelopes handed to Africans contained less than they had expected because of the reductions for tax about which they had not been informed. Their wages had gone up but the tax was deducted and the net amount which the African received in his pay packet was less than he had expected. The result was that there was an instantaneous strike.</p>

<p>No, it was not due to agitators.

I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has taken the psychological aspect of this Bill into consideration. It is all very well to sit here in the hallowed, insulated atmosphere of Parliament, as we do, and pass laws without thinking the matter right through to their implementation. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has thought of what is to happen right throughout the country next year (because this only comes into operation in 1970) when Africans are going to be presented with pay envelopes containing less than they had expected. How is he going to make this information available and try to explain the position so as to lessen the blow? He should start giving his attention to this very important matter now. He must not think that it is just a matter of passing a law and then expecting everybody to accept it. They are not going to because as it is they have great financial difficulty in attempting to meet the rising cost of living with wages which in any event are far too low to maintain the average family at any decent level of subsistence. I want to ask the hon. the Minister too to give special attention to the exemptions which he is allowed to grant under clause 13 of this Bill.</p>

<p>Under the regulations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think clause 45 empowers him to make regulations but they have to be in conformity with the provisions of clause 13, as I read the Bill. There are certain cases where apparently immediate relief may be given&#x2014;not necessarily shall, but may be given. That is firstly if a person is indigent. I should certainly hope so because how on earth can an indigent person be expected to pay any tax? Relief may also be given to a person who is prevented by reason of age, chronic disease or other cause not within his control from paying the tax. That gives the hon. the Minister very wide scope and I am going to ask him here and now to interpret that as widely as possible. I want to bring to his attention two specific types of people I have in mind. The first is the position of widows with children. Under this Bill all Africans, males and females, are going to be liable to pay this general income tax. The hon. the Minister has told us that husbands and wives are not going to be jointly assessed; that the wives’ income will not count in this respect, but I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that he should give a special concession to widows who do not have their husband’s income to help meet household expenses and who have dependent children to rear, because under this Bill no allowance at all is made for dependants. Every white taxpayer immediately gets a dependants’ allowance, if there are children or other dependants. Nothing like that is allowed for in this Bill, and I ask the hon. the Minister to give special thought now under the regulations which he is going to frame, in terms of clause 45, to widows with dependent children.</p>

<p>Then there is also the question of unmarried women with children. Sir, the townships to-day are full of unmarried women with children. This is a very important issue. It is a natural result of the migratory system. It is no good closing our eyes to it. The fact that there are thousands of men in the towns without their wives has led to a great increase in the illegitimacy rate in the townships. It is part of the system; nobody condones it; nobody wishes to encourage this but we must take cognizance of its existence, and it exists to a very great degree, as any sociologist who has worked in the African townships will tell the hon. the Minister. The number of unmarried mothers with illegitimate children in the townships to-day has reached frightening proportions, and I ask the hon. the Minister to give special consideration to children’s allowances for these women, irrespective of whether they are married or not.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of implementation of this measure. I have mentioned before that it is much easier to pass a law than it is to implement it. How the hon. the Minister proposes to implement this measure is beyond me. He is going to need another army of policemen because under clause 14 anybody who cannot produce his tax certificate to show that he has paid his tax is liable to immediate arrest. I think my reading of this provision is correct. It provides not that the certificate may be required, but that it is required. Any policeman can stop any African at any time of the day or night and demand his tax receipt. I know that he can also do it under the present law; he can look into the reference book&#x2014;I will not call it a pass book, because I was told by the Chief of Police the other day that there is no such thing as a pass. The registration book has to contain a tax stamp; otherwise the African can be arrested immediately for non-payment of his tax. But, Sir, this makes it even more complicated because here it is not the Department that has to put the stamp in the book; it is the employer who has to give the employee his tax receipt. The duty is laid on the employer to give the employee the tax certificate. You tell me, Sir, how any employee whose employer has neglected his duty in this regard is going to force the employer to do this? It is going to be very difficult. I know that in numerous cases people have been arrested because employers have not signed them off when they have dismissed them; they have had a row with the servant; they have kicked him out on the turn and they have refused to comply with the law. Just because they know that it is doubly difficult for a man to be re-employed unless he is properly signed Off, they do not bother to do it. Sir,. there are Careless employers. I i know that under this Bill the law will come down on the employer <span class="col_6645-6646" refersTo="page_0470"/>as well, but I am taking the actual case of the African male in the street who is stopped by a policeman and made to produce his tax certificate. Sir, what on earth is going to happen? We are going to get more arrests under this system; we are going to get more crowding of the prisons. I foresee the most tremendous difficulties in administering this law. I might point out to the hon. the Minister that according to the last report of the Department of Police for 1966-’67 there were over a quarter of a million arrests for non-payment of tax. What is the point of going on like this and trying to implement an absolutely impossible law under tremendous administrative difficulties? Apart from the police side of it, I think the hon. member for South Coast also mentioned the shortage of staff and the tremendous amount of book work involved in this system and, of course, the fact that the migratory labour policy is going to make it even more difficult to keep track of employees who are moving backwards and forwards between the reserves and the industrial areas. All in all, Sir, I think this is a thoroughly bad Bill. It is a Bill which introduces still further differentiation between African taxpayers and the taxpayers of other races.</p>

<p>I disagree with the hon. member. I am entitled to use my own terminology. [Interjections.] I admit that the original Act did too, but this principle is now carried all the way through. There is quite a difference in the administration of this system now. The administration is made more difficult by this Bill. I think we ought to have a Bill applicable to everybody, an income tax Bill which recognizes all the principles accepted by all modern states. That is that one pays tax according to one’s ability to pay and not according to the colour of one’s skin, and that one gets allowances according to a system of equity which the State considers should be applicable to its citizens, irrespective of their colour. I think the administration would then be easier because the tax would start at the level of income enjoyed by the skilled and semi-skilled workers in this country. There would then not be this difficulty of tracking down the employee, of rendering returns or anything of that nature, because such people tend to be permanent workers. They tend to have acquired skills, and in order to acquire skills you have to be in a job on a stabilized basis. I say therefore that the rate of tax as applied to our White, Coloured and Indian citizens, is the rate of tax that we should apply to our African citizens. For all these reasons I shall, of course, oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton is against this Bill in principle. We accept that, because that fits in with her ideology. Our views and hers differ like day from night. However, we are at least able to say in her favour that she is always consequential and honest in her views. Basically she is opposed to this Bill as it differentiates between the various population groups as far as levying taxes is concerned. Of course, she wants every one&#x2014;White, Brown, and Black &#x2014;to be treated alike; she wants a single Taxation Act. She does not want to recognize the system of ethnic grouping. She is advocating the western liberal view as regards the existence of this country, but that is the very point on which we differ basically. We see the development of South Africa in a different light; we recognize the various ethnic groups because each has its particular needs, and that is why we have this Bill before us to-day. It is very clear to us that the standard of living and the needs of the Bantu differ completely from those of the Whites, and for that reason the tax levied on the Bantu differs from that levied on the Whites. Sir, I have said the hon. member represents the liberal Western view. Our view is definitely that of Africa. We hold a view which can be made applicable to Africa and which can work here, not one imported from overseas which cannot work here. That is the reason for the introduction of this Bill. Sir, what did the Official Opposition do in this case? The Opposition, through the mouth of the hon. member for Transkei, asked for a Select Committee to investigate this matter further. They do not want to say either &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;. They want this matter to be investigated further and in addition they asked why there was no White Paper. But why should there be a White Paper? What does this Bill contain which the previous legislation did not contain? The only other thing that has been included here is the system of P.A.Y.E., a different way of administration, but nothing else. What is there to be investigated? But politically they are very clever. They do not want to take up a standpoint. They do not want to say the Bantu should pay tax.</p>

<p>Yes, they do not want to be one or the other so that they may engage in double talk at the next election. That is what they want to do. This legislation does not contain any new principle. They want to bring the Franzsen Commission into this matter and they say the Franzsen Commission should bring out a report first. What did the Franzsen Commission do? The Commission did not say anything as regards the principle of legislation; it investigated new methods of <span class="col_6647-6648" refersTo="page_0471"/>taxation. I cannot say whether the Franzsen Commission will make any contribution. But if this Bill is passed and accepted in this form and if it appears in practice that changes have to be introduced, changes will in fact be introduced. [Interjections.] This Bill merely introduces a brand new scale of taxation which makes it different to the white scale of taxation as it used to be. You will notice from the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister that there were more than 2,000 Bantu who were entrepreneurs under the previous system of income tax, and therefore it is essential for tax to be levied, except as regards the basic amount, on income as well, because the Bantu is developing, and as he develops and his economy becomes more sophisticated, this legislation will be adjusted to that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei went further and complained about the indirect taxation which would be levied on the Bantu. But it is very clear that the indirect taxation is a tax which is going to be levied inside the Republic of South Africa on products produced inside the Republic, and the Bantu who are here in the Republic will have to pay that tax. But if it happens that the Transkei develops and produces products within its own territory, those products will not, after all, be taxable here. I do not believe this is an argument which should be advanced with regard to this legislation, because that is an entirely new principle of taxation, which will also be applicable to the Whites. But to me this legislation very clearly is a further step in the direction of the emancipation and the development of the Bantu. A nation’s system of taxation usually is representative of the stage to which it has developed. The reason for the introduction of the P.A.Y.E. system here, is that it is very clear that the vast majority of Bantu still are employees at the moment because of the industrialization of the country, and this system has to be introduced now in order to throw the net much wider. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I think that after this legislation has been put into operation and the net has been thrown wider and all employers have introduced the P.A.Y.E. system, we may perhaps find that the estimate of R11 million, which is the amount anticipated to be collected, will be exceeded substantially, because I believe many Bantu have escaped paying tax before. This Bill makes all the other legislation much more streamlined and easier to implement. Surely there is no point in passing an Act which is so difficult to administer that it is incapable of implementation. As we know, the Bantu is a difficult customer at this stage as far as taxation is concerned, but in time and with patience and application he will be educated. He must be educated in this direction so as to make him realize that he has to pay tax and that the white man alone cannot for ever remain the one liable to tax. He will have to learn to help himself in future. It is the duty of the Whites to impress this on them and to explain to them that if they ever want to exist as a nation and want to have any right of existence as a nation and if they want independence eventually, then they have to learn to pay taxes so as to contribute to the welfare of their peoples.</p>

<p>This side of the House has never opposed the taxation of the Bantu people because we think it is fundamental that people should be taxed on their ability to pay. The rate of taxation should be commensurate with their ability to pay and that is why we are asking for a Select Committee to get more information than was given to us by the Minister in his speech. The previous speaker took exception to the fact that we asked for a White Paper. Surely it is an ordinary courtesy in this House that with a Bill of this nature there should be a White Paper, an explanatory memorandum. We appreciate the Minister’s courtesy in letting us have a copy of his speech at the same time that he spoke this afternoon. That is a courtesy which could very well be followed by other Ministers in important matters. During the course of his speech the Minister referred to the fact that he had been in touch with the Chamber of Industries and other organizations in connection with this tax, but what he did not tell us was whether they approved of this Bill, and whether they were satisfied with the mechanics of this Bill. He did not tell us that; he just said that he had been in touch with them. I doubt very much whether they approve of the method of collecting this tax. The Minister and other previous speakers referred to the report of the Franzsen Commission. I have that report before me and it says in paragraphs 141 and 142&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From an administrative point of view, there is not only the extra work involved in the application of different principles, for example, age, place of residence, etc., but the implementation of changes in taxation (through the P.A.Y.E. method of tax collection) is delayed because the announcement of provincial budgets (which usually occur after the State Budget) has to be awaited. In the case of employers who have employees in different provinces, and wherever transfers take place across provincial boundaries, the differences in taxation in the various provinces create many problems in the deduction of taxes according to the P.A.Y.E. method.</block>

<p>I am sure the Minister has read that report. The Franzsen Commission is all in favour of streamlining the position. In fact, it goes so far in its final recommendation as to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(a) The rights of provincial authorities to level personal taxation and income taxation on individuals be withdrawn and (b) that provincial authorities share in the revenue from taxation collected by the Central Government on the income of individuals, as is already the case with company taxation.</block>

<p><span class="col_6649-6650" refersTo="page_0472"/>The Minister of Finance has not accepted that principle, but the Commission referred to the difficulties.</p>

<p>Now, we have a further difficulty with this Bill. We already know that the Minister of Finance only has two-thirds of the officials on his establishment. Roughly, half of the establishment are permanent staff, and about 20 per cent are temporary staff, and the other 20 per cent consists of unfilled posts. Under this Bill we are establishing an additional register. Already under the Income Tax Act we have established a register of employers and now we have to establish another register for the registration of employers under the Bantu tax. So there are two registers to be established, two offices to which communications must be addressed, resulting in a duplication of work and of services. We have gone a long way since the days of pen and ink and making records, and I am quite sure that the Minister, if he has to do this job, has a computer in his department in order to provide the records of some 3.5 million cases, 3.5 million taxpayers. All these cases will require programming, so you have a different programming system for the Bantu taxation as against that for white taxation. There is a different programming technique for Bantu taxation as compared with white taxation, and that in itself involves additional work. In a country which to-day is desperately short of computer programmers, we have to have further programmers taken on to do this special work in order to get the records lined up with the employers. Unless there is a link between the employer and the employee tied up with the register, the Minister will not get the control he envisages, because he is throwing the responsibility for the collection of this tax on to the employers, and the employers have to be on his register and in turn the employees will be tied to that register. His difficulties will continue to the extern to which the employer has temporary employees. Once there are temporary employees there will be further troubles. So, there is the difficulty of identifying the employers with the employees and the additional technical work that is required in order to get 3.5 million people on the tax register. So that there will be duplication of staff. The staff which has been doing this work in the Inland Revenue Department will not be available to the Department of Bantu Administration, and both departments will be competing for the same type of employees. And then this tax system does not cover all the taxation. It covers the taxation of the employees under the graded taxation, out the general tax will not be deducted.</p>

In other words, despite the introduction of the P.A.Y.E. system &#x2026; Bantu males will still be personally liable to pay the basic fixed tax and will still have to carry their receipts for such tax around with them and will still be liable to summary arrest in respect of non-payment of such tax on non-production of receipts therefor.</block>

<p>Now the employer will not be concerned with the deduction of the one tax; he will only be concerned with the graded tax, and this will be a further burden on the employer. I am certain that the Chamber of Industries have not supported this Bill because of the difficulties they find as far as the mechanics are concerned, and this is one of the reasons why the Bill should go to a Select Committee.</p>

<p>If they told the Minister something different he should have brought that information to this House this afternoon. This is a matter of public interest. If the Minister has other information, he should give it to us this afternoon. We have not seen the Chamber of Industries this afternoon, but we had information from them last week. Is the Minister suggesting that the Chamber of Industries is entirely satisfied with this Bill as it is now? There are additional difficulties and it is for these reasons, that it should go to a Select Committee. The Bill as it now stands indicates that there is always the question of discrimination. I support the hon. member for South Coast that there should be a common basis of taxation above a certain level, because you will always find friction where there is a different rate of taxation for different groups, the more so when the rate of taxation of the one is increased and perhaps not of the other. The Bill as it now stands is incomplete. Only the departmental aspect has been considered whilst the interest of the general public has not been considered. For that reason the Bill should be sent to a Select Committee before its Second Reading.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg replied rather effectively to the request made by the hon. member for Transkei for a White Paper in regard to this legislation. A similar request was addressed to me before, and subsequent to that I went through the Bill once again. But, really, Sir, I did not see <span class="col_6651-6652" refersTo="page_0473"/>my way clear to drafting a White Paper which would be more clear than this piece of legislation is. We are dealing here with legislation which was for the most part adopted as far back as 1925. It was in fact amended in 1958, but basically it is still the legislation of 1925, drafted in Dutch, and I am sure that not one of the hon. members opposite could understand it better than I could, and I could not understand it. The English text, on the other hand, was clear to all of us. In addition to that we had the Income Tax Act of 1962. This legislation was drafted on the basis of these two Acts, and to my mind it is as clear as any White Paper in the world could be. For that reason I did not see my way clear to drafting a White Paper.</p>

<p>I want to deal first with the hon. member for Transkei. He held forth on the various taxes the Bantu had to pay&#x2014;income tax, and so forth. But I want to tell the hon. member that no change has been effected. For instance, the hut tax, which has existed over all these years, is still being levied, and the same applies to the tribal levy. All of this is still being recognized by this legislation. The only change that has in fact been effected, is that relief has been granted in respect of the scales of the lower income groups in particular. The hon. member also admitted that there had been differentiation over the years. No new principle is therefore being introduced here. The new principle which is in fact being introduced here, is that of a P.A.Y.E. system, and the relief which is being effected particularly in respect of the lower income groups. The hon. member objected to cases where the Bantu were remunerated in kind, and said that this should not be taken into account. But I thought the hon. member would welcome that. I am also saying this for the benefit of the hon. member for Houghton. It is true that there are Bantu who are given an acre of land, for instance, to plough; similarly, there are Bantu who have grazing rights. On the one hand the hon. member complains about there being differentiation, and, on the other hand, he does not want to admit that the privileges which the Bantu do enjoy, privileges which are not taxable, are to their own advantage. He wants us to bring them into calculation as well. In my Second Reading speech I said that we did not want to introduce a system which would eventually be more expensive to administer than the benefit we would derive from it. The hon. member for Transkei, who knows the Bantu and who knows that under this system they are often remunerated in kind, will appreciate that at this stage of the development of the Bantu it would be an impossible task to bring the remuneration received in kind into calculation as well.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also asked a question about the Bantu in the Transkei. The hon. member for South Coast elaborated a great deal on that. He objected and wanted to know how we were going to identify all these people. He noticed all the problems, for instance, that the Transkei would possibly not want to levy this very same tax.</p>

<p>Not only the Transkei Bantu, all the Bantu.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us confine ourselves to the Transkei first. This does apply to the others as well. In my Second Reading speech I said that before this legislation we had already come to an agreement with the Transkei. But if we had adopted the premise the hon. member for South Coast wanted to adopt, and had assumed that they did not want to levy taxes, we should bear in mind, surely, that this is for their revenue fund; then we say: &#x201C;Fine, if you do not want to, we shall not collect your taxes either. In that case you will simply have to manage without them; you will simply have to do without them.&#x201D; But in that case it will also be to our advantage. If the Bantu come here, we shall tax them here. We are now discussing all the possibilities. You know, Sir, if the skies should fall on us, we would all be wearing blue caps. But I cannot spot all these difficulties which the hon. member has brought to the fore. We entered into this agreement, and I cannot see why we shall not enter into further agreements in future. Basutos from Lesotho and Bantu from Malawi, Botswana and other places come here, and they have different systems of taxation. Why should all of them be identified now? This legislation already provides that, in cases where such a person has paid taxes over there, such taxes may once again be taken into account when he has to pay tax here. No, Sir, I do not see all the difficulties which hon. members are seeing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei referred to all the problems which could crop up. Every one of those members spoke about the problems. They said that I had allegedly said at the very outset that I would have to introduce amendments once again. I admit that there are problems in this regard, but one has to start somewhere. If there should be problems today in regard to collecting this tax under a P.A.Y.E. system, should we then say: &#x201C;Good gracious, no, it will simply be too difficult. Problems will crop up. We would rather do nothing.&#x201D; What I did say, was that it was not being suggested that the system for which this Bill makes provision would afford the solution to all the problems experienced in regard to the collection of tax from the Bantu. I am just as aware as hon. members are that problems will in fact crop up; but we have to start somewhere, and we must start this year. Then we shall overcome these problems as we meet them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei also said that we should appoint a Select Committee to inquire into this whole problem; this Select Committee is to say whether or not there are reasons why the Bantu should be taxed separately. Sir, this is after all a principle which was adopted back in 1925 and which we have <span class="col_6653-6654" refersTo="page_0474"/>implemented all these years. We carried on with it for certain reasons. Those hon. members did not convince me that there should not be differentiation. In fact, my first conclusion from the speech made by the hon. member for Transkei was that he agrees that there should in fact be differentiation. He wants us to go back once again and to decide whether we want differentiation here in South Africa or whether we shall pursue the policy of the hon. member for Houghton, who wants one tax only, i.e. the tax as determined by the Minister of Finance, which applies to Whites, Coloureds and Indians. The United Party must now tell me whether they also share that view with the hon. member for Houghton. I do not think they do, because they have never intimated that they are not agreeable to differentiation being applied in respect of the Bantu, with all the other privileges they are granted, and to their being taxed, apart from income. It was an old principle of ours to collect, apart from a Bantu’s income, R3.50 from every male Bantu between the ages of 18 and 65 years. It was a principle that Bantu earning R360 per year and more, men and women, had to be taxed on a rising scale, a scale which we have actually reduced now in respect of the lower income groups. No, Sir, I really do not know what justification there is for the request that a Select Committee should now go into the matter and tell us whether we should follow the system of taxation proposed by the hon. member for Houghton, or whether we should continue with the system of differentiation, which has been in operation over all these years.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member wanted to know why the Franzsen Commission had not investigated this matter. I want to refer him to the message to the State President on page iv of the report of the Franzsen Commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission was also in close touch with the Department of Bantu Administration and Development in connection with the way in which the Commission’s present recommendations, especially those in connection with a broader base of indirect taxation, might affect the overall tax liability of the Bantu and possibly also the revenue of the Bantu authorities. The Commission also took due note of the fact that the above Department contemplates considerable reforms in the existing taxation in respect of the Bantu in order to obtain greater simplicity in the form and administration of the present direct taxation payable by the Bantu.</block>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I did not make interjections while the hon. member was speaking. The Committee Stage still lies ahead. If the hon. member wants to ask questions later on, I shall reply to them with pleasure. The hon. member must now afford me the opportunity of rounding off my arguments. Should there be matters which the hon. member raised and to which I did not reply, I should like to do so, for I have nothing to hide. I should like to come up with a good Bill.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the hon. member for Wonderboom came out with interesting comparisons, which already give the Opposition an indication of how the scales are going to work. I just want to add that one should read those comparisons of his in this light, i.e. that when it comes to the higher scales, there are additional taxes as well, such as provincial tax and income tax, which have to be added to these scales. In other words, the scales we are comparing are those which the Bantu have in the first instance been paying under the additional tax, as against those which they are now paying in additional tax. Then it is true that in the higher scales they are paying more than they did before. But then it should be borne in mind that previously they used to pay an additional income and provincial tax as well, which in respect of all the provinces, with slight variations, came to more or less 33 per cent of the income tax. And if one were to compare that with the tax paid on R1,740, it should not be forgotten that over and above that amount, a small amount in income tax was payable if that person did not have a number of children in respect of whom he received a rebate.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the hon. member for South Coast for the historical background he furnished in regard to the way these taxes originated. I do not think it was the hon. member who asked me whether I knew what the psychological effect of this would be. It may have been the hon. member, but I think hon. members also referred to that. What the psychological effect is going to be, is something which I have duly taken into account, especially if I obtain the co-operation of every organization. There is one thing which causes the Bantu to feel aggrieved, and this came very clearly to the fore this afternoon. I do not want to pretend to be an expert, but I <span class="col_6655-6656" refersTo="page_0475"/>think I can justly claim that I know the Bantu as well as the next man does. There is one thing a Bantu dislikes, and that is unjust or unfair treatment. That Bantu whom one may have caught for failure to pay his tax, would say to one: What about that other person who has not paid any tax for ten years? Then he is dissatisfied. The psychological effect this is going to have is that one Bantu will say that he has paid his tax and that the other person will not evade his either. In fact, in this respect the Bantu do not differ much from us. When we had a Select Committee on a P.A.Y.E. system for income tax, one of the things which gave the greatest measure of satisfaction was the fact that there would be fewer cases of tax evasion in future. That is actually what provision is being made for in this Bill. It also has a further effect. The hon. member for South Coast must help me. I know he can. The hon. member for Transkei must help me. I know he can. I shall help, too. Tell the Bantu that the basic tax of R3.50 which he used to pay, is being reduced to R2.50. Tell them that those people who went free and evaded the payment of tax, will no longer succeed in doing so. Those who did not pay their additional tax, will no longer succeed in doing so either, because their employers are now going to deduct it from their remuneration. Therefore I have duly taken into account the psychological aspect of this matter. I feel absolutely sure that, if these people are not going to be given the wrong impression, i.e. that their pay sheets are now being reduced because they have to pay a new tax, I cannot see how we shall promote dissatisfaction. It is as important for the Bantu as it is for the Whites to have a P.A.Y.E. system. Surely, we are not demanding more money from them. I am still charging the same amount, but I am doing so in monthly instalments, just as it is in the case of the Whites. We are now bringing it into line with that of the Whites. No matter what a person’s income may have been, he would in any case, once he has been discovered by the Receiver of Revenue, have been liable to paying in any outstanding amounts. And sometimes, as hon. members often say, this goes hand in hand with hardships and trying circumstances, because he has to raise that amount all at once. Now we have a P.A.Y.E. system and he virtually does not even notice it. However, this would not be the case if we were to tell people, as the hon. member for Houghton did, that there was a strike in Durban &#x201C;because the pay checks were smaller, as the tax was deducted&#x201D;. If we are going to adopt that sort of attitude, we are not going to do well. Many of these Bantu are at present being informed by teachers, ministers of religion and by Radio Bantu. These bodies and persons will inform them that this is not a new tax which has been thrust down their throats. They will be informed that this measure is also bringing them relief, and that the amounts previously paid by a number of Bantu who were subject to income and provincial tax, will now be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, out of which this money will eventually be spent on Bantu Education.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I shall make propaganda, because propaganda is being made against this Government. Propaganda is being made, as the hon. member once again did here this afternoon, by saying that these poor people, who are the poorest amongst us and are earning the least, are being taxed. The fact of the matter is that the tax paid by those people is being reduced. If that propaganda is being made, my Department and I shall also employ other methods of making propaganda in order that these people may be correctly informed.</p>

<p>I think I have already replied to the question of Bantu who are dissatisfied about taxpayers who are in arrears and the fact that there is a bigger possibility now of getting hold of such persons.</p>

<p>I spoke here about all the obstacles, all the difficulties, that were being seen in the way. We are supposed to have a staff shortage, and so forth. Hon. members may safely leave that matter to us. We have heard that before. I do not really know whether, as far as income tax is concerned, taxpayers remain undiscovered for the reason that we do not have sufficient staff. We shall make use of other organizations, as is being provided in the legislation. This will even be done on a commission basis. We shall also make it easier for the Bantu by creating more tax collection points. When the Bantu fail to pay tax, it is not always a case of their trying to evade tax. Sometimes it is very difficult for them. Those Bantu may quite possibly be working from Monday morning to Friday evening. The offices where they can pay their tax, are closed on Saturdays. We want to overcome those difficulties and we are going to create more tax collection points. We can do so, even on a commission basis, by getting, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, other organizations to collect this tax. The basis will always be that people will not pay too much or too little.</p>

<p>Now I come to the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member for Pietersburg said that it is unlikely that we would ever agree, in spite of the fact that both the hon. member and I have been members of this House for as long as 16 years. Now the hon. member wants to know why the basis on which the Bantu have to pay for their education, is different from all the others. Surely, this is a half truth. Surely, this is not the whole picture. Surely, this is not the only money which is being paid into the Bantu Education Account. In fact, the hon. member knows that apart from these taxes other <span class="col_6657-6658" refersTo="page_0476"/>amounts are being paid into the Education Account.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether it is your intention to afford the hon. member another opportunity of making a speech, or whether she will be afforded her next opportunity at the Committee Stage. You know, Sir, she and I will sing together rather well, but I do not think that it is possible for us to talk at the same time. That has never worked out well, because I have some difficulty in hearing and I do not hear everything she says. It seems to me as though she does not really want to hear what I am saying. She should allow one of us to speak at a time. I do not want to pause at the fact that the Bantu start paying on lower scales. It is a fact that as from his 18th year a Bantu person&#x2014;if such person is a male, is not sickly and can work&#x2014;pays R2.50 until he is 65 years of age. This is an exception, Sir. This position has been in existence since 1925. This afternoon the hon. member availed herself of this opportunity in order to raise this matter. She did not do so because a change had been effected; in fact, this afternoon she had the opportunity &#x201C;to thank the Minister&#x201D;, and she let that opportunity slip. She availed herself of that opportunity to state her views on something which has over the years been accepted as such. This afternoon she availed herself of this opportunity to ask, &#x201C;What about the 250,000 Bantu who have been arrested for failing to pay their taxes?&#x201D; In my Second Reading speech I mentioned the difficulties we had experienced in regard to the collection of these taxes. This is not as a result of the fact that there were so many taxpayers, but because there was a vast number of people who were evading tax. I told her that over the past three years we had increased the number of Bantu from whom we collected taxes, and that we had increased the amount from R7 million to approximately R11 million. My Department’s ideal is to make every taxpayer pay his tax. That is just. That is honest. That is honourable. It is a pity that we had to arrest a quarter of a million before they paid their taxes, but do you know what we have achieved, Sir? After all, I also work with my own Bantu. Nowadays, shortly after New Year’s day, this is the first thing they ask me: &#x201C;Sir &#x2026;,&#x201D; but my Bantu still call me &#x201C;master&#x201D;. They say to me: &#x201C;Master, please pay our taxes now. We do not want to have any trouble&#x201D;. We have educated the Bantu, and we are training them in the realization that they are taxpayers, too, just as I and every other person are. It is not my intention to break down what has already been built up.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown also saw imaginary difficulties lurking ahead. He referred to a new register which employers would now have to keep in respect of their Bantu employees, etc. We experienced those difficulties when we introduced a P.A.Y.E. system for ourselves. The hon. member and I both served on the Select Committee which went into this matter at the time. I might have seen even more problems than he did. At that time the hon. member was very zealous. He believed at the time that everything could be surmounted. Sir, at present employers are finding it much easier to handle this P.A.Y.E. system than they did before. I do not know why there would be so much extra work for them in the form of new registers, etc. It may happen that they will only have to add new columns in their registers. By means of block systems, etc., we made the scales as easy as possible in order that the whole system may <span class="col_6659-6660" refersTo="page_0477"/>be as easy as possible for the employers. But the employers can still come to us. We do not sit in closed offices and we do not have blocked ears. If the employers approach us with acceptable proposals, and not with proposals which would only benefit themselves and their groups, we shall listen to them. By way of regulations which we can issue, we can put many things right. This can be done as soon as we have gained experience of this legislation. There will still be time to put such things right. However, since difficulties may crop up, we shall not sit still and do nothing.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me a question. He asked me whether I was sure that the Chamber of Mines accepted this Bill, as it reads at present. I can tell him, as I said in my Second Reading speech, that when we appointed the departmental committee, we were in touch with all these bodies, such as the Chamber of Industries, the Chamber of Mines, Sakekamers and others. They told us that they would be agreeable to a simplified P.A.Y.E. system. Now the hon. member says they are pointing out that there are still two systems of taxation, i.e. the basic tax of R2.50 and then the P.A.Y.E. system. Sir, in my Second Reading speech I said that if we had to collect all these taxes by means of one scale, that scale would be so high that these people would be affected to a much greater extent, especially if our object were still to collect R11 million. The hon. member must tell me on some occasion or other whether he is in favour of there being one scale only. However, if he does so, he should propose an alternative system in terms of which it will be possible to guarantee me at least R11 million per year. That is the amount we want to collect from the Bantu. I want to follow up the hon. member’s question further, and I want to be perfectly frank with him. This Bill has laid upon the Table for a considerable time, but one of my officials told me on Friday that the Chamber of Industries wanted certain information. In this case I said what I also said when the Opposition wanted information, namely &#x201C;Give them that information&#x201D;. At 1 o’clock on Friday it was brought to my notice that the Chamber of Industries had raised certain objections. I considered these objections, and I am definitely of the opinion that they can be surmounted. But what I find striking, is that the hon. member has a memorandum which was handed over to him. The hon. member must tell me whether I am wrong. Such a memorandum was not handed over to me or to any other member on this side of the House. As far as I know, there is no such memorandum. If there is one, I should be pleased if the hon. member would let me know of it. I do not have that memorandum. I think that if there were such a serious objection, there was sufficient time for forwarding such a memorandum to me. If that had been done, I would have investigated the matter. Sir, I do not see my way clear to this legislation being delayed any further. To my mind there is nothing to justify its being referred to a Select Committee.</p>

<p>I want to extend my sincere thanks to hon. members on this side of the House, who have obviously made a thorough study of this legislation, for having facilitated my task by replying effectively to most of the proposals.</p>

<heading>MEMBERS OF STATUTORY BODIES PENSION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 1 deals with the definitions. Therefore it is an important clause as it provides for those persons who will benefit by the proposed legislation. Clause 1 (iii) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;final salary&#x201D; means the amount of the annual salary payable to a member on the date of his retirement or death together with the amount of any allowance regularly paid to him annually in respect of special services rendered by him to the statutory body concerned.</block>

<p>It then goes on to explain that such an allowance excludes any allowance paid in respect of subsistence and transport expenses or entertainment expenses. I have raised this matter at the Second Reading. However, I am afraid I am still not clear as to what type of allowance the particular paragraph provides for. It mentions purely the question of an allowance regularly paid annually in respect of special services tendered to the statutory body. We would like to know what actual allowances are envisaged in terms of this clause to make such a provision, as these allowances will substantially affect the benefits that are payable in terms of a further clause. Have these allowances been taken into account for the calculation of the benefits payable? In respect of this clause the definition of &#x201C;member&#x201D; means any person serving on a statutory body in a full-time paid capacity, or a person serving as a Commissioner-General in terms of the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act, 1959. It then makes a further provision, namely a person who in the opinion of the Minister is rendering full-time paid service to the Government in a similar capacity. I want to refer to this additional provision whereby the hon. the Minister extends the position as far as the Commissioner-Generals are concerned also to include persons who in the opinion of the Minister are rendering fulltime paid service to the Government in a similar capacity. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will be good enough to inform the Committee as to the basis upon which such service is envisaged in terms of this provision.</p>

<p>There are also two other items on which we on this side of the House feel that further clarity is necessary. In paragraph (x) it is stated that &#x201C;service&#x201D; also means service by people who rendered similar service in relation to a statutory body immediately prior to the commencement of this Act and that it will also be taken into consideration. Here it appears that it will have a retrospective effect in regard to the persons who are already serving in a full-time capacity in such statutory bodies. I would therefore like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he can give an indication as to when he expects this Act to come into effect. I ask this because it is evident that provision is made that previous service prior to the commencement of this Act will be taken into account. It is therefore important to know when this Act will commence as this will also have a considerable effect on the pension scheme if such previous service is also going to be taken into account as pensionable service. In paragraph (xi) (b) the hon. the Minister also defines a statutory body for the purposes of this Act. During his Second Reading speech the hon. the Minister mentioned some of the bodies concerned, who are classified as statutory bodies. This is, however, a further extension which states that at such a body’s request it will be designated by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance as a statutory body for the purposes of this Act. Here too, we would like some further information as to what types of bodies the hon. the Minister envisages would also be entitled to join this pension scheme which is provided for by the Bill now before us.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the first place, the hon. member asked a question in connection with allowances. The definition contained in this clause does not include an allowance in connection with the question of subsistence and travelling expenses or entertainment expenses, and so forth. In other words, this is not an allowance which has been introduced for those specific purposes. There are, however, cases where people do receive certain allowances. Where a member of a statutory board is instructed to carry out a particular task, to which he devotes more time, and where he has to give special attention to a particular matter, such a member is compensated by means of an allowance because in this respect he has to give more attention to a particular matter than other members of the board.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Is this an annual allowance?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is an annual allowance.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Final salary&#x201D; is very clearly defined as the amount of the annual salary payable to a member on the date of his retirement or death <span class="col_6663-6664" refersTo="page_0479"/>together with the amount of any allowance regularly paid to him annually in respect of special services rendered by him. The allowance has to be paid regularly to him annually; that is the crux of the matter. In other words, it does not include a temporary allowance or an allowance which is paid suddenly and arbitrarily, it has to be a permanent annual allowance which is paid to the member in the form of a salary.</p>

<p>Arising out of clause 1 (iv) (b), the hon. member referred to the position of persons serving as Commissioners-General or who, in the opinion of the Minister, are rendering full-time paid service to the Government in a similar capacity. As I said from the outset, this Bill covers the cases of persons who are not covered by existing pension schemes. This Bill does not affect people who are members of existing pension schemes because under such existing pension schemes one is able to calculate their pension in advance, because there is a certain measure of order and regularity in the service of those members&#x2014;they are appointed on a certain date and they retire on a certain date. This Bill affects people who cannot be covered by the normal pension schemes. A situation which we are unable to foresee at this stage might arise in future and if this happens we do not want to come back to Parliament to effect a further amendment; that is why it is laid down in this Bill that a member may also be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, renders full-time paid service to the Government in a similar capacity. In other words, if a member of a board which is not included under this definition renders full-time paid service to the Government in a &#x201C;similar capacity&#x201D;, such member may be included under this definition without any further amendment having to be effected to this measure.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the definition of &#x201C;service&#x201D;. The definition gives effect to the intention that the scheme will only apply to members who are in service on the date of commencement of this Act or to members who are appointed after the commencement of this Act. Continuous service immediately prior to the said date will count as service, but it is not the intention to count as service any periods of service prior to that date in respect of which a person would in any case have been excluded under the existing scheme which was introduced on 1st January, 1963. Persons who have retired under the existing scheme, would have received the benefits under that scheme. Since people may also receive annuities now and such annuities have to be discontinued when they become members again, because they cannot be allowed to draw a pension while earning a pension for the same purpose, it is necessary in those cases for their periods of service&#x2014; although they are not continuous periods of service&#x2014;to be consolidated when they subsequently retire. However, this is being done only for this purpose, and for no other. In other words, if a person has served as a member of a board for a certain period and then retires and receives an annuity because he has completed nine years’ service, and is again appointed to a statutory board after a period of two or three months or even a year, the annuity lapses for the duration of the period he is serving on the board again. He cannot receive the annuity and serve on the board at the same time. The annuity lapses in the meantime but when he retires again, his previous service plus his new service are added together for the purpose of calculating the annuity he has to receive after that. This is why this specific provision is being made.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked which other bodies we proposed to include under &#x201C;statutory bodies&#x201D;. According to the definition contained in paragraph (xi) (b) it will include any body which has, at its request, been designated by the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, as a statutory body for the purposes of this Act. In this case the same principle applies as the one I referred to a moment ago. In other words, we are providing here for future contingencies which cannot be foreseen at the moment, namely that a body might be established which might apply to the Minister to be treated as a statutory board. It is impossible for us to foresee what developments might take place in future. However, I want to give the hon. member the explicit assurance that the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, will deal with the matter and that hon. members will always have the opportunity of calling the Minister concerned to account if they do not agree with the classification of the board. To my mind this provision is essential in order to prevent us from having to come back to Parliament unnecessarily to effect a further amendment to the Act in order to meet new circumstances which might arise.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I refer to subclause (2) of clause 2, in which it is provided that a pension payable in terms of this Act shall be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The hon. the Minister knows that I welcome that. But I am rather anxious to know how the Vote will be provided for. For example, will there be a sinking fund under the Revenue Fund? If not, will it be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund every year? If that is the case, which seems preferable, will a man who has served, on a statutory body of the Native Affairs Department for example, receive his pension under the Bantu Affairs Vote; will the man who has served on a statutory body of the Finance Department receive his pension under the Finance Vote or will the hon. the Minister, as Minister of Pensions, have all this provided for under his own Vote? I am curious to know how this will be budgeted for.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from><span class="col_6665-6666" refersTo="page_0480"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>This clause, which provides for the establishment of the scheme, appears to make the provision that the benefits will be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Where the statutory body is a provincial statutory body, the money will then be recovered from provincial revenue in terms of paragraph (a) of subclause (3), and from the Territory Revenue Fund as far as South-West Africa is concerned. Paragraph (b) then provides that in the case of any person who was a member of a statutory body referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition clause, the pension payable shall be recoverable from such statutory body. The point that I would like to raise with the hon. the Minister is, what happens where a statutory body which has been classified as such by the hon. the Minister in terms of the definition of a statutory body is dissolved as a result of a change of administration? The Minister would then have to recover any pensions paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund from that statutory body. Is the Minister satisfied that this clause gives him sufficient power to recover such moneys from that statutory body which has been classified as such by the Minister as a special privilege? If he cannot recover the money, will the Consolidated Revenue Fund then continue to pay an annuity that might have been earned by a person, in spite of the fact that in terms of the clause before us the Minister is required to recover such moneys from the statutory body concerned which is then no longer in existence?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like first to reply to the first question put by the hon. member for Kensington. Subclause (2) provides that all pensions shall be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. If the hon. member looks at the definition of &#x201C;Consolidated Revenue Fund&#x201D; he will see the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Consolidated Revenue Fund,&#x201D; in relation to any payment to be made out of that Fund, means moneys appropriated by Parliament for the purpose of such payment.</block>

<p>Parliament will therefore appropriate funds every year in a case which will be earmarked for this particular purpose. The pensions will therefore be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. I hope this is clear to the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo also asked how these funds would be recovered in case problems should arise. Subclause (3) empowers the Minister to lay down the conditions according to which and the manner in which pensions shall be paid, and also, <i>inter alia,</i> the manner in which payments will be recovered from the Provincial Revenue Fund or from bodies which find their own funds. The possibility even exists that it might be required of the latter bodies to make advances so that the money may be recovered from such advances in case any problems should arise, but I am convinced in my own heart and I am satisfied that we have adequate powers here to be able to ensure that the matter will be dealt with in a proper manner.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time. Section 7 of the Iscor Act provides at present that Iscor’s authorized share capital consists of 500,000 A shares of R2 each, which in terms of the Act have all been taken up by the State President, and 27,000,000 B shares of R2 each. So far 25,680,364 of these shares have been taken up by the State at R51,360,720 (nominal value) plus a total premium of approximately R32,400,000. A further 219,636 of the B shares have in terms of the Act been converted into 7½ per cent cumulative preference shares and issued to private persons. Iscor can therefore create an issue another 1,100,000 B shares.</block>

<p>Under section 10<i>bis</i> (1) Iscor has unlimited borrowing powers upon provision of its own securities. If, however, the Corporation raises loans without State guarantees, the Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance may for this purpose furnish State guarantees to a total amount of R50,000,000 without prior parliamentary approval having to be obtained. So far Iscor has raised State-guaranteed loans to a total amount of R34,600,000. This therefore leaves a balance of only R15,400,000 which can be obtained with State guarantees without prior parliamentary approval. In passing it may be mentioned that, apart from bank overdrafts, Iscor has made little use of its borrowing powers without State guarantees so far. The reasons for this are obvious&#x2014;loans under State guarantee can be obtained on more advantageous terms.</p>

<p>It is generally known that Iscor has undertaken considerable expansions during the past number of years, and is at present on the eve of further major expansion. It is the intention to increase its present production capacity of 3,521,000 ingot tons per annum to approximately 6,600,000 ingot tons per annum in 1975-’76, and approximately 8,700,000 ingot tons per annum in 1979-’80. In addition the creation of facilities for iron ore exports of between 10 million and 15 million tons per annum is being envisaged.</p>

<p><span class="col_6667-6668" refersTo="page_0481"/>All these expansions, including the necessary additional housing and mine development, will require a capital investment of approximately R1,500 million from the present until 1980. The creation of facilities for ore exports alone, which I mentioned a moment ago, will require a capital investment of approximately R120 million over the year 1970 up to and including 1973. This amount is included in the total expenditure of R1,500 million.</p>

<p>In the past Iscor financed its expansions to a considerable extent out of profits. Although it would have liked to continue on this basis with its further expansions, it would inevitably have resulted in increased steel prices, and requests made by the Corporation in this connection up to now have as far as possible been opposed by me. The idea is that Iscor should rather make use of cheaper financing methods, in other words, borrowed capital. The result is that after a series of discussions with Iscor it has begun to follow this method recently, and intends to do so as far as possible in the future.</p>

<p>From the point of view of sound financing policy, however, Iscor would not like to see its borrowed capital at any stage amounting to appreciably more than 40 per cent of its net assets. In this connection it may be mentioned that Iscor’s net assets as at 30th June, 1968, amounted to R381,773,000 and were financed as follows:</p>

<table>

<tr>

<td><p>Share capital</p></td>

<td><p>R52,800,000</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Share premium</p></td>

<td><p>R32,400,000</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Reserve for increased replacement costs</p></td>

<td><p>R101,674,000</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>General reserve</p></td>

<td><p>R194,000,000</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Profit and Loss Account &#x2026;</p></td>

<td><p>R899,000</p></td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>Against this background it is now the intention to amend the Iscor Act as follows in order to finance Iscor’s expansion programme&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) to authorize the Board of Directors of Iscor to increase its authorized B share capital from time to time, with the approval of the State President, to a maximum of R250 million. Clause 1 of the measure before the House is in connection with this; and</li>

<li>(b) to remove the restriction of R50 million on the powers of guarantee of the Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance, provided, however, that the Minister of Economic Affairs will in future have to table a report in Parliament in respect of each State guarantee furnished by him for an Iscor loan, From the point of view of parliamentary control this provision will make better provision than is the case at present, while at the same time ensuring that Iscor will not, as at present, be restricted during parliamentary recesses to raising State-guaranteed loans not exceeding R50 million. Clause 2 of the Bill makes provision for this.</li>

</ol>

<p>The intention is then, if this Bill is approved by Parliament, that Iscor will finance its expansion programme by the following means&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The taking up of B shares by the State at a rate of 10 million per annum (R20 million) over a period of seven years, as from 1969. This gives a total of R140 million.</li>

<li>(b) The raising of loans to an amount of approximately R400 million, from 1969 to 1976. These loans will be covered by State guarantees, and it is hoped that, as from 1976, only replacement loans will be necessary.</li>

<li>(c) The procurement of the remaining amount of R960 million out of profits and write-offs in respect of depreciation.</li>

</ol>

<p>From the foregoing explanation hon. members will notice that the Bill makes provision for authorized B share capital of R250 million, while Iscor, according to present estimates, will only require R140 million of this amount from the present until 1976. However, this does not mean&#x2014;and I want to make this point clear&#x2014;that, after Iscor has issued B shares to a further amount of R140 million to the State, there will remain B shares to an additional amount of R110 million to be issued. The R51,360,728 which has been provided so far by way of the taking up of B shares, plus the amount of R32,400,000 which has been paid by way of premium on these shares and which the Government intends to have converted into B shares, must be taken into account here. This then gives a total of approximately R227,761,000 which will have been taken up by 1976, leaving a balance of R22,239,000 which it will be possible to obtain by way of B shares after 1980. There are other reasons as well why the amount is being put higher than the actual requirements, as estimated at present. In the first place it is not certain how much Iscor, even with State guarantees, will be able to borrow, and accordingly there has to be a measure of flexibility. In addition it is not advisable to come forward with amendments to the Act every now and then in order to increase Iscor’s authorized capital. Furthermore it should be borne in mind that the larger the authorized capital for which the State can subscribe, the more it reinforces Iscor’s position as a prospective borrower on the foreign money market. In the third place there is the share premium account of R32,400,000, which, as I have indicated, the Government wants to convert into B shares. I believe hon. members will agree with me that there is little justification for the State having to take up its shares with <span class="col_6669-6670" refersTo="page_0482"/>Iscor at a premium. This would decrease the State’s earnings by way of dividends, as prescribed in the Act, and accordingly it is the intention, as soon as the proposed amendment to the Act has been approved by Parliament and has been promulgated, to arrange for this accumulated share premium also to be converted into B shares.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>We support this Bill because it is quite clear that Iscor with its present development, quite apart from the very great developments which we know are in prospect, at the moment is under-capitalized. The hon. the Deputy Minister has quoted figures which I doubt whether most hon. members have been able to follow in detail unless they have studied the balance sheet and the annual report very closely, but it boils down to this that we propose here to increase the authorized capital of Iscor some fivefold. It seems a large increase, but when you consider the figures mentioned by the Deputy Minister, such as the 10-year programme involving an expenditure of some R1,500 million, and you realize when looking at the balance sheet that at the moment Iscor has capital commitments in regard to expanding existing plants amounting to something like R94 million, then the figure asked for in this Bill to increase the authorized capital to R122 million as far as the B shares are concerned, is not so excessive. The existing B shareholders will have the option to take the shares up, and of course the only shareholder as far as the B shares are concerned is the State President, and he will remain the only shareholder. The share premium account, to which the hon. the Deputy Minister referred, stands at some R32 million, and at the last issue I think the R2 shares were issued at a premium of some R13. I do not know whether the intention is that future B share issues should also be issued at a premium. The value, according to the report, was based on the fixed assets of the Corporation and of course if that is so the Corporation will be able to raise a good deal more than the actual par value of the shares which we are now asked to authorize the issue of. This, of course, is a very large increase in the share capital and it is a very large programme the hon. the Minister referred to for the next 10 years. It highlights once again the lack of parliamentary control over Iscor. This is not the time to discuss that, Sir, but in view of the very large expansion and the very great importance of the industry I think it is pertinent to ask the Minister, or to ask hon. members generally, how many of them have the slightest idea of what Iscor looks like; how many of them have visited the Iscor plants or have any conception of the vastness and the importance of this undertaking. The Defence Department has been very good, while they are spending a great deal of money, in arranging for hon. members to visit various places where expansion is taking place. Sasol has done the same thing at times, and of course the Chamber of Mines organizes periodic visits for members to see the mining industry and the Railways do the same thing. I do think that more should be done to encourage members to know more about the activities of the various undertakings which are growing so enormous and which are financed by the State, like Sasol, Iscor, Phalaborwa, and so on. I would ask the hon. the Minister, who I see has now graced us with his presence for a few minutes, whether he cannot take into serious consideration the possibility of organizing more frequent tours for members to some of these undertakings. It would mean that Parliament as a whole would know more about what they are talking about when it comes to examining the reports laid on the Table and it will lead to a much better understanding of these undertakings. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Association could be drawn into organizing visits of this sort. Visits abroad are extremely important, but it is also important to know what is going on in one’s own country. I would like to take this opportunity of putting the idea to the hon. the Minister that something more organized should be done to acquaint hon. members with what is going on, so that they will have a better understanding of what is going on in these huge State undertakings.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the hon. member for Constantia that the Opposition’s support of this measure is appreciated. In connection with the future issue of B shares, I can inform the hon. member that they will not be issued at a premium. On the contrary, it is the intention to convert the premium which Iscor obtained from the issue of previous B shares into ordinary B shares at par. I think that answers his point.</p>

<p>Then I also want to assure the hon. member that we will keep his suggestion in mind about members of Parliament perhaps being invited to pay visits to Iscor and other of these State-owned corporations. I think it is a good suggestion. It was done, I think, some six years ago. Members of Parliament were invited to pay a visit to the Iscor works, and some availed themselves of this opportunity. In any case, I think it is a good suggestion and it will be conveyed to the hon. the Minister. Perhaps we could start off by inviting some of the leading spokesmen and people who are especially interested, on both sides of the House.</p>

<p>Fortunately this is a very short measure, it is not controversial, and hon. members have <span class="col_6671-6672" refersTo="page_0483"/>already had an opportunity to read the explanatory memorandum in connection with it. I intend dealing with clauses 1, 3 and 4 first. The change proposed in clause 1 follows on the design and development of a vehicle which travels on an air cushion between the vehicle and the surface of the land or the sea. It is the air-cushion vehicle of which the already familiar hovercraft is an example. The International Civil Aviation Organization amended it definition of &#x201C;aircraft&#x201D; to exclude such an air-cushion vehicle, and our legislation will now follow the example of that organization. For the sake of interest I may just tell the House that in America I saw developments in this connection in the field of Railways. They are considering a train which would run on an air cushion and which they hope will be able to achieve a speed of 500 miles per hour.</p>

<p>As far as clause 3 is concerned, provisions already exist which authorize the Minister to regulate the lighting or marking of any obstruction exceeding a prescribed height and situated within a prescribed distance from an aerodrome. The proposed provision will make it possible to issue regulations for the regulation of the lighting or marking, for the purpose of ensuring the safe operation of aircraft, of any obstruction exceeding a prescribed height, irrespective of the distance between the obstruction and an aerodrome. The necessity for such authority is obvious. What comes to mind here is, for example, a power line stretching right across a valley with its suspension towers at the tops of both sides of the valley.</p>

<p>The provisions of clause 4 are necessary to bring about uniformity in the Afrikaans versions of the Principal Act and the Aviation Regulations, 1963. By using the word &#x201C;lugvaartuig&#x201D; throughout as the more comprehensive concept, that is to say, as the equivalent of the word &#x201C;aircraft&#x201D;, it becomes possible to use the word &#x201C;vliegtuig&#x201D; in the Afrikaans versions as the equivalent of the word &#x201C;aeroplane&#x201D;. Sometimes there are different regulations and requirements in respect of aircraft (which, for example, includes a helicopter) and aeroplanes.</p>

<p>As far as clause 2 is concerned, tenders were invited in 1968 for the right to sell liquor in bottles to outgoing international passengers in the transit area at Jan Smuts Airport, that is to say, the right to run a so-called duty-free bottle store. After tenders had been received and before they were considered, it was found that the Minister did not have the power to grant such a right, and the tenders were then cancelled. The proposed amendments will now enable the Minister to grant this right. The provisions as printed in the Bill are virtually self-explanatory. I may just say that when this measure has been passed by Parliament and has been promulgated, the opportunity will again be given to interested parties to tender for the right to conduct the business concerned in the transit area at the Jan Smuts Airport.</p>

<p>Clause 5, which envisages an amendment to the Liquor Act, 1928, is a consequential amendment to ensure that the provisions of section 5 (3) (b) of Act No. 30 of 1928 do not become applicable to the liquor trade which is to be conducted in the transit area. I think, Mr. Speaker, that hon. members will agree that this measure contains no controversial provisions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support this legislation and we take pleasure in the fact that the long expected duty-free shop at Jan Smuts Airport can now become a reality. This is a matter which has often been discussed and which we have always supported. We are glad that we have now reached the stage where we can look forward to the coming into operation of that shop. It appears from the introductory speech by the hon. the Minister that it has been decided to place this shop in the hands of private initiative and not to control it departmentally.</p>

<p>That is why we are calling for tenders.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether the first tender was advertised, or whether private notice was given to tenderers, or in what way it was made known.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Tenders were advertised publicly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am asking this question because there were the usual stories going round in connection with the names of firms which were supposed to have received this privilege. As long as these tenders are public and everyone gets the same opportunity to tender, there can be no objection, unless the Department itself wants to run such a shop. It would create the opportunity of making a profit and possibly reducing the losses suffered by the Catering Department. I also want to ask whether arrangements have been made for that new legislation in connection with sales duty to make provision for goods sold there to be exempted from sales duty. At such a shop not only liquor will be sold. There are other South African products which ought to be sold there, for example dried fruit and other typical South African products which are exported, and on which sales duty will have to be levied. I hope that these products will be exempted from that duty.</p>

<p>Another point which I should like to mention, while we are amending the Aviation Act, is the question of the present restaurants at the various airports and the restrictions placed on them by the liquor provisions. The present restaurants which are under private control in terms of section <i>6bis</i> (1) (b) have very limited rights. We have previously, during the discussion of the Vote and on various occasions, suggested that the restaurants at the airports should be allowed to serve the travelling <span class="col_6673-6674" refersTo="page_0484"/>public with drinks on closed days. It is very easy to determine who is a passenger. Each passenger must have an air ticket. I see no reason why such a restaurant, which is open in any case, and which must be there in any case for serving other refreshments, cannot also sell liquor to such travellers and the persons who are with them on a closed day such as a public holiday or a Sunday. As soon as one boards the aeroplane one can buy a drink. But it is unfortunately the position that aeroplanes are often delayed. Travellers sometimes have to wait as long as five hours. It has often happened to me that I had to wait up to five hours at an airport on a Sunday. When this happens one has to wait until mealtime to get even a cooldrink. I hope that the Minister will say that, because we are modernizing and are now in the Twentieth Century and have duty-free shops at the airports, we shall also be able to enjoy such a Twentieth Century commodity at the airports.</p>

<p>Albert will object.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I shall be sorry if objection is raised against it, but I think that the vast majority of our people, and especially those who use the Airways, will agree with me.</p>

<p>The last point I want to mention is in connection with the serving of such drinks. I am mentioning this specifically, because it relates to the clause we are now discussing. I think the time has come that the people who undertake such services at the airports should be allowed the same right as any restaurant or hotel in a city to decide whom they want to employ. There is no doubt that there are many complaints about the service at these restaurants. These complaints come from all who use them. I have taken the trouble to talk to three such restaurant managers. I asked them why the service was deteriorating. Their simple reply was that it was impossible to find suitable white staff. I really think the time has come that, when we provide such a service, we should not restrict the person who is going to undertake that service, with all sorts of rules and conditions as to whom he may employ, etc. As I have said, the owner of each hotel and each restaurant in South Africa has the right to decide who is going to work for him. There is no person who does not go to a hotel or a restaurant because he does not like being served by a non-White. There is no person who objects to his luggage being carried by a non-White at the airport. It is part of the service which such a passenger receives. I think the time has now arrived also to consider this attitude in connection with the catering service at the airports, and to withdraw the restrictions. With these few words I want to support this Bill on behalf of the Opposition. I hope that it will lead to an improvement, not only in this one case, but in respect of all the cases I have mentioned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is becoming clear to us that air travel is more and more becoming the channel for traffic between South Africa and the rest of the world. In saying that, you also realize that our international airports are more and more becoming the gateways through which the traffic from one country to another flows. I want to express my thanks to the Deputy Minister for this legislation, which makes it possible for typical South African products, such as the products of the vine, our cigarettes, etc., which can also serve as a means of publicity for South Africa, to be sold duty-free in the transit area at our international airports. But in this connection there is an interesting point which comes to the fore, namely the legislation in connection with our wine industry, which provides that the Co-operative Wine Growers Association, better known as the K.W.V., can only sell its products abroad, and not in South Africa. I do not want to quarrel with that specific legislation. However, I just want to point out that since we are in this legislation dealing with a transit area, when people have gone through the customs they virtually find themselves in an international area outside the South African controlled area. It occurred to me that it may be desirable to give attention to the possibility of products of the K.W.V., which are virtually the hallmark of what is best in the South African wine industry, also being made available duty free and under all circumstances to travellers in this transit area, so that they can then go overseas with a special symbol of what is good in South Africa. I think many people can testify to the quality of the products of the K.W.V.</p>

<p>I shall not yield to the temptation of taking this matter too far. I just want to point that it is rather anomalous that the K.W.V. may not sell its products on the domestic market. Here, however, we have to do with an area which is in fact an international one. I want to plead with the Deputy Minister for attention to be given to offering the products of the K.W.V. in this transit area.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to thank the Opposition for their support. I do not want to reply to the hon. member for Durban (Point) in detail, because he was only working a fast point. He spoke about the local and existing restaurants, which are not covered by this Act at all.</p>

<p>Do they not function in terms of this clause?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, this clause is only to grant us authority to open a shop in the transit area where we can sell products free of customs duty. It has nothing to do with the present shops and restaurants. In any case, I have taken note of what he said. The hon. member also put a question in connection with the sales duty and asked whether provision was being made for these products to be exempt from sales duty as well. This is a matter which we shall have to discuss with the Treasury and the Minister of Finance. I want to accept straight away that he made a point, because if one sells products free of customs duty in this case, it actually amounts to this, that one does not want to levy further duty on the man leaving for overseas.</p>

<p>I made some further inquiries in connection with the question raised by the hon. member for Stellenbosch. It appears to me as if there is a provision in the Act relating to the K.W.V. that it shall not sell its products under its name in South Africa for consumption in South Africa. If, however, the Act reads that it may sell its products within such an area for consumption outside South Africa, it may possibly be considered. But in the first instance, if the Act does not stipulate that, the K.W.V. itself will have to amend its Act. The K.W.V. Act also makes special provision in regard to Rhodesia.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban (Point) raised here the question of the Weenen emergency camp. Now I want to say at once that the Weenen emergency camp is a temporary measure. At present consultations are being conducted between the Department and the local farmers’ association with regard to the establishment of a Bantu township somewhere in the district of Weenen. Until such time as this matter has been settled, they will be accommodated in that camp under much better circumstances than those under which they lived before.</p>

<p>They used to be squatters on the common and at present they are concentrated in an emergency camp, which will be of a purely temporary nature.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>No, definitely not.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethal delivered a plea for something to be done about the presence of increasing numbers of Blacks in the rural areas; for this state of affairs to be combated. I want to say at once that one of the major and important steps which has been taken in this regard, is the abolition of the labour tenant system, which contributed greatly towards the presence of larger numbers of Blacks in the rural areas. I must say, however, that the co-operation given by the farmers’ associations and the agricultural unions does not as yet come up to our expectations. The present position is that the Transvaal abolished the labour tenant system in 25 districts on 31st December, 1968. This system has been abolished in the whole of the Free State; in Natal it has been abolished in three districts, and in the Cape Province in two districts. Let us warn at once that problems will arise during the period of transition to full employment. The Bantu are not in favour of changing over to full employment. To many of them this is an old tradition. The farmer himself has become used to this system and therefore I want to warn that problems will be experienced. At the same time, however, I want to give the assurance that the hon. the Minister and his Department will do everything in their power to make this matter come off smoothly. In cases where we have started this process and in cases where farmers’ associations have changed over, the Department has gone out of its way to do everything in its power to assist those farmers. I believe that the problems which have arisen in this regard can be overcome.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterberg pointed out that the Bantu on the farms have a seven-day working week, as against the five-day working week of the industries. Therefore the industries are much more attractive to the Bantu. To this I want to add that the industries pay much higher wages than most farmers do. We as farmers will simply have to realize that the days when the farmers and the mining authorities used to be biggest employers of Bantu in the Republic of South Africa, are over once and for all. South Africa’s development into an industrialized country has been rapid and dramatic. As a result of this, the Bantu will now be attracted by the industries. I therefore want to urge our farmers to plan their farming operations in such a <span class="col_6677-6678" refersTo="page_0486"/>way as to make do with the minimum amount of Bantu labour to maximum advantage. I want to say here and now that the farmer may always rest assured that he will have the co-operation of the Department as regards the process of bringing this matter into line, so as to allow of the Bantu adapting himself in this process of changing over. However, I do have this consolation to offer the farmers. The Bantu homelands cannot carry much more livestock than they do at present. Therefore the farmers who are planning to retain their best Bantu, will be in a position to extend privileges to those Bantu living on his farm in the form of grazing rights and land. In this way the farmer will be the only one who will still be able to offer the Bantu a place to which he can trek with his livestock. It will be in the interests of the farmer to offer in this way to the Bantu, who is very attached to his livestock and wants to retain them, a place to which he may go. This will happen if the farmer makes the necessary arrangements in this connection and provides the other facilities so as to attract the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana referred here to the large-scale squatting within the Durban complex. Now I want to say at once that large concentrations of Bantu squatters are most definitely to be found all over this belt surrounding the Durban complex. In recent years they have been moving from the hinterland, the homeland, to Durban because of employment opportunities in that complex. One reason for this, <i>inter alia,</i> is the tremendous industrial development of this complex. This development has been attracting these people because of the employment opportunities this offered them and at the same time Natal has been experiencing an unprecedented drought in recent years. This has caused an increase in the numbers of Bantu looking for new places of employment. The largest numbers of squatters concentrated at places where industrial development has taken place, places such as Amanzimtoti, Pinetown, New Germany, Hammarsdale and Cato Ridge. Everyone of these districts border on the Bantu homelands with the result that the largest numbers of squatters moved precisely to those points of employment and consequently squatted in their own homelands. This was a dramatic migration with which no one could cope, in other words, the influx was greater than the number of houses that could be provided. Here I want to give the assurance that the Department has taken steps, and has done so immediately, to deal with this problem. A township such as Ntuzuma, consisting of approximately 10,000 premises, has been planned by the Department. This township is planned to be situated on the farms Dalmeny and Richmond, which are adjacent to Kwa Mashu. When it is developed, it will offer housing to many of the squatters who concentrated at the borders. A further two or three thousand premises will be found on the Trust farm Phoenix, where it will be possible to make provision for some of these squatters. The township Mpumalanga has already been planned and will eventually be able to house 12,000 families. Expectations are to have 4,000 houses ready as soon as the end of the financial year. More than a thousand houses are already occupied at Hammarsdale and houses are being completed at a very rapid rate. All the squatters along the railway line at Hammarsdale have been removed. If sufficient funds are available each year, it is expected that the squatter problem at Hammarsdale will be solved in the foreseeable future. There are other places where the Bantu are to be housed, which are being developed in that complex. The farm Rietvallei is being acquired by the Trust in order to establish a township there. It will be used, more particularly, for the settlement of the Bantu in the Cato Ridge complex. We are expecting further development in Clermont this year. Therefore it is perfectly clear that these schemes are being undertaken by the hon. the Minister and his Department with a view to combating the belt of squatters around Durban. The farm Dassenhoek in the Pinetown district has also been planned. In addition, the Bantu Affairs Commission are at present giving attention to the possibility of acquiring land in the Kloof-New Germany-Pinetown complex and between the Isipingo and Umbogintwini Rivers. All these extensions are under consideration.</p>

<p>Therefore it is very clear that we are doing our utmost to cope with this dramatic influx, this population explosion which is being experienced. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the very limited time at my disposal, I do not want to comment on what the hon. member for Klip River, who has just resumed his seat, has said, but I cannot help thinking that he is taking a trial run here this afternoon to try to gain something for himself. [Interjections.] The hon. the Deputy Minister must now keep quiet. He gave us a lecture a short while ago about interjections and my time is very limited. To-day happens to be the 26th of May and I was expecting someone to remind us that to-day is the 26th of May and that 21 years ago the Nationalist Party took over the government of this country. Imagine that after 21 years of Nationalist Government we find ourselves in a very much worse position than we were 21 years ago. I do not want to delay this House or use my time by reminding hon. members of the manifestos which they used 21 years ago and of the wonderful promises they made during the 1948 election. What has happened to all those manifestos and promises? Absolutely nothing has happened. In fact, the opposite has been taking place. We have heard so much about migratory labour during the last few years, and the moving of Bantu labour from one part of South Africa to another, but as far as we are concerned they are all still in South Africa, regardless of where they were moved from or where they may have gone to. We have heard so much about Bantu being moved from West of &#x201C;the <span class="col_6679-6680" refersTo="page_0487"/>line&#x201D; to East of &#x201C;the line&#x201D; and I only wish I had more time to discuss this problem further. What is worrying me is that I represent a part of South Africa which is at the receiving end of this labour force. While the Government is busy moving or repatriating Bantu from certain areas, no employment is being provided for these people. The Government brings the Bantu labour back regardless of whether they have employment in the Eastern Cape, on the borders of the Bantu reserves, and in the so-called Bantu homelands. At night in towns and villages of the Eastern Cape one will find crowds of Bantu roaming around, burglaring, not looking for motor cars and radios, but looking for food and money because they have no employment to earn money to buy food. The tragedy is that this problem is coming back on the householders who own valuable properties and are not only paying high municipal rates on their properties, but also high Divisional Council rates, which no other province is paying. It is only in the Cape Province that these Divisional Council rates are payable. House-owners now find that their &#x201C;house-holders’ premiums&#x201D; have been raised as well. This is done because of the activity of burglars in the area. Let me quote what one of the insurance companies has written to the householders who have to pay premiums on policies&#x2014;</p>
