Due to this state of affairs and also the fact that uniform diet scales have been introduced, the Department found it imperative to increase the fees to a uniform level so that these hostels could function as economic units. It may, however, be mentioned that full or part exemption of boarding fees are given to indigent pupils at schools and study bursaries to students at training colleges.</li>

<heading>UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AFRICA (PRIVATE) AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>I am introducing this legislation at the special request of my Alma Mater, the University of South Africa, where I obtained a modest M.A. degree in Constitutional Law years ago. There is indeed nothing contentious in this Bill. The fact that a private member is introducing this Bill, can merely be ascribed to our Parliamentary procedure which requires that a private Bill or an amendment thereof must usually be moved by a private member. However, I may inform the House that these amendments are moved with the full knowledge and approval of the Minister of National Education.</p>

<p>The Bill comprises the amendment of four sections of the principal Act, the University of South Africa Act, Act. No. 19 of 1959, as amended by Act No. 13 of 1964 and Act No. 53 of 1967.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is being provided that a chancellor be elected for a period of five instead of ten years. The reason for this is obvious. It is usually a person of advanced age who is honoured with this high office. However, over a period of ten years such a person&#x2019;s health and/or mental health may deteriorate to such an extent that he may no longer be able to carry out the duties of a chancellor in a proper manner. The risk is a much smaller one if the period of office were five years only.</p>

<p>Secondly, the principal Act provides in section 7 that the &#x201C;duties&#x201D; of, <i>inter alia,</i> the rector be defined in the statutes. In the first instance, in the opinion of the council of the University it is undesirable merely to have the duties of one official defined by statute and not those of the other members of staff, but what is particularly important, is that it is so difficult to define duties properly. The council prefers the &#x201C;functions&#x201D;, and not the duties, to be prescribed by statute, and in effect this amendment merely envisages the substitution of the word &#x201C;functions&#x201D; for the word &#x201C;duties&#x201D;. Thirdly, it is being provided in the principal Act that the manner of appointment of additional members of the senate shall be prescribed by the statutes. This provision is considered to be redundant.</p>

<p>Finally, it is being provided in the principal Act that the times of meetings of convocation shall be prescribed. The convocation of the University of South Africa does not form as closely-knit a unit as do the convocations of residential universities, and over the past 50 years nobody has ever insisted on such a meeting. Owing to the provision that in the statutes provision should be made for the times of such meetings, the university would have to convene meetings for which there is no need. Consequently the provision in regard to the times of meetings is being deleted in terms of the proposed amendment.</p>

<p>I trust that hon. members on both sides of the House will consent to this proposed amendment, and I shall furnish additional information or explanations with the greatest pleasure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we had an amendment to the University of South Africa Act two years ago, a very thorough amendment, but one realizes that in the special circumstances of the University of South Africa it may be necessary to bring about further amendments bcause it is not a residential university; it is a university having courses conducted by correspondence. We have no objection to any of these clauses. We think we can give the hon. member our full support. There are only one or two small points that I would like to mention about the possibility of the chancellor becoming senile. I do not think that is the real danger although I think it is rather better to provide for a period of five years instead of ten. Whatever the age of the chancellor, I think it is an excellent thing to do that, because it is a great honour for any citizen to become a chancellor of a university. Therefore I think it is an excellent thing that that honour should go round. I think there are many distinguished professional people, university people, who could hold that office. I do not think it is right that one man should hold this office for as long as ten years. We therefore agree to the shorter period of five years.</p>

<p>With regard to clause 3, I think this amendment brings about a real improvement; it gives the Council the right to decide what they are going to do about members coming to the senate.</p>

<p>The final clause deals with Convocation. In <span class="col_3419-3420" refersTo="page_0197"/>the case of the University of South Africa this is a hot potato and it will continue to be so. We have had discussions on Convocation over the last few days in this House, and we would not object to any amendment that the Council wish to bring about to adapt Convocation to their special conditions. We realize they have this difficulty, and since this institution is a university we think they should have autonomy; that is our policy and we will therefore support this provision. We give the Bill our wholehearted support.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit the definitions of &#x201C;advisory council&#x201D; (i) and &#x201C;advisory senate&#x201D; (ii) and to substitute the following definition: (i) &#x201C;convocation&#x201D; means the convocation of the University, referred to in section 12;.</block>

<p>In the case of previous Bills we had some difficulty about introducing convocation in the constitution of the universities, and here we have acted on suggestions we have received that there should be a convocation. There are two parts to my amendment. The first is to omit the definitions of &#x201C;advisory council&#x201D; and &#x201C;advisory senate&#x201D; and the second part is to give an additional definition, to the effect that &#x201C;convocation&#x201D; means the convocation of the university referred to in section 12. I will not labour the point, but the Minister knows that we do not like the idea of an advisory council or an advisory senate for this university for the Indians. We have explained it at length in the case of the other Bills and <i>a fortiori</i> in the case of this Bill it is less necessary than for the others. They do not require it at all. We discussed that in the Second Reading. That is the first point.</p>

<p>The second one is in regard to convocation. We think it is essential to have a convocation for this Indian University. There are hundreds of graduates and there will be hundreds more in future. As I pointed out during the Second Reading yesterday, they have more students than the three Bantu colleges put together. Therefore I think it is essential that provision should be made for convocation in this university.</p>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 33 and 34, to omit &#x201C;Durban-Westville&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;Westville&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I submit that the description of the University of Durban-Westville is misleading, because the university is not in Durban; it is to be established in Westville and the Minister&#x2019;s amendment to a subsequent clause shows that he realizes that the description in the original Bill is misleading. It is described as Durban-Westville and that is wrong because it is neither in Durban nor in Durban-Westville. The community at Westville, the Mayor of the town and the Council, have passed a resolution asking that this university be described as the University of Westville. The members of the staff and the principal of the university are in favour of its being described as the University of Westville, and many members of the Indian Council are also in favour of it. Therefore, as the university is to be established at Westville, at Reservoir Hill, which is an Indian group area, as the Minister knows, and several million rands will be spent on this university, it being in the course of construction now, I suggest that this is the right time for the Minister to think again on this description of the university and he should accept my amendment, namely that the university be described as the University of Westville.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown now wants to substitute &#x201C;Westville&#x201D; for &#x201C;Durban-Westville&#x201D;. We know that the activities of the Indian community are concentrated around Durban and the name of the university relates to the geographic ties it has with that part of the world. How are people elsewhere in the country who are not familiar with Westville but who know Durban, to know where this university is, unless the hon. member proposes that the name &#x201C;Indian University&#x201D; be added. This we cannot do, because we did not do so in the case of any of the other university colleges. I want to ask the hon. member whether he is ashamed of the fact that the University for Indians is to be established in Durban&#x003F; I should like to suggest to the Minister that these words be left as they are.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I think probably, if I reply to the hon. member for Pinetown now, he will understand the position, because there is no intention that this Bill should be altered on the lines suggested by him. I wanted to point out to him that originally this university college was the university college for Indians in Durban. It was recognized throughout South Africa and even other countries who understand the international position and who are interested in South Africa know that Durban particularly is regarded as the hub of commerce for the Indians and as the hub of their educational institutions. Then when it was changed to a university college, it was the university college of Durban. So naturally the association with Durban is a very intimate one as far as the Indian population is concerned, also in regard to their educational institutions. Therefore to describe this as the University of Westville would really not signify what it is intended to signify. This matter was discussed at length with the all Indian Advisory Committee, and that committee was rather in favour of its being called the University of Durban, but it was pointed out to them that to call it the University of Durban would bring it into conflict with the University of Natal, which has a branch at Durban. It is known as the Natal University, Durban, which is almost the same as the University of Durban. So after a long discussion it was agreed that this was the best method of describing this university, namely the University of Durban-Westville.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to my amendment in clause 2, but that is purely geographical. It is an incorrect statement geographically in clause 2 which I correct in my amendment. But it had nothing to do with the choice of the name, and the hon. member for Koedoespoort is correct. The whole background of that name has been Durban, and the fact that it is being built in Chiltern Hills, which is in the Westville area, makes it necessary to give some recognition to Westville. Therefore I cannot see how there can be any objection to a name which meets all sides of the problem. That is what I put to the hon. member, who was good enough to talk to me about the matter. I put it to him that the basis on which an agreement was reached between the Department and the bodies interested, was that this should be the name.</p>

<p>May I just answer the hon. member for Kensington. He moved, firstly, the deletion of the advisory council and the advisory senate and of course he was ruled out of order in regard to the convocation. But the hon. member for Kensington knows our attitude about the advisory council and about the permissive right to appoint an advisory senate. We stand by that, and there can be no argument about it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort objected to my proposed change in the name of the university, but might I suggest that probably he would be offended if we called the University of Stellenbosch the University of Stellenbosch-Cape Town, because Stellenbosch is a small place and Cape Town is a big one. The arguments used by the Minister are ludicrous, because it is neither Durban nor is it Westville; Westville is not in Durban but outside it, and the people of Westville are prepared to have it called Westville. Furthermore, there are members of the Indian Advisory Council who have made representations to us asking us that this university be called the University of Westville. The hon. the Minister however, says that he has received the necessary assurances to call this institution the University of Durban-Westville. We have here the extraordinary position where the hon. the Minister says that the council has requested this name, but that representations have been made to us to the contrary. Obviously someone is talking with two voices and I have a suspicion as to who it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to tell the hon. member that he cannot get away with those remarks with me. I am not talking with two voices. I said that the council itself had this matter before it. The hon. member may have received an isolated representation from a member or members of the council. But I consulted the council and they agreed with the name as it is here. I am not going to be browbeaten by the hon. member or any other hon. member on that side of the House as to what this University should be called. The fact that the hon. member may have had representations from the Westville Borough Council is something that I also appreciate. He showed me the letter, but I have given the hon. member the reasons why this university will be called by that name. I therefore resent his remarks when he said that he knew who is doing a double talk on this matter. He insinuated in his remarks that I was talking in a double way. I am not prepared to stand for this from the hon. member. [Interjections.] Hon. members on the other side laugh, but they cannot get away with this.</p>

This is not a name which reflects the character of a university for Indians at this stage. Until such time as something of this nature can be done, we should be prepared to accept the compromise. The public knows the entire Westville area as a white residential area of Durban. As such it would be incorrect to give the name of Westville to a university for Indians. It is also known now that one-half of the northern section of Westville is an area for Indians, but this area links up with the area for Indians north of Durban and even with the area for Indians on the North Coast. As this area develops a character and geographic concept of its own, the university might in due course be given another name to comply with the requirements of the hon. member for Pinetown.</p>

<p>No, it is called the University of Natal. There was a feeling that it would be wrong to have a University of Durban while there would be another university, namely that of the University of Natal, which was also referred to colloquially as the University of Durban. This is the reason why the university was named the University of Durban-Westville.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River referred to the fact that Westville is outside the boundary of Durban. Of course I know that it is outside the boundary of Durban. I also know that there have been representations and discussions, not necessarily initiated by the Borough of Westville&#x2014;they do not have a town council, but a borough council&#x2014;that Westville might eventually be included in the Durban Municipality. These are factors which have to be considered. The name Durban-Westville was therefore one which was arrived at after considerable discussion and thought. That is why I say that the atmosphere which hon. members are trying to develop over the name of this university is not justified. The hon. member for Mooi River is correct. It might be that we will have to, at some time or another, come to this House with an amendment to change the name of this university. For the present, however, it will be called the University of Durban-Westville. I tried to explain these reasons to the hon. member for Pinetown and I was surprised at his outburst later on about the double talk.</p>

Nobody will talk about the University of Durban-Westville, not even the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. If ever I heard nonsense in this House, it was spoken by that hon. member.

The name of the Victoria College was changed to the University of Stellenbosch. The name of the Transvaal University College was changed to the University of Pretoria.

<p>I have a completely new point to argue now, Mr. Chairman. The Victoria College became Stellenbosch University when it became a university. In the case of U.C.T. it used to be a college and then it was named the University of Cape Town when it became a university. It was first S.A.C.S. and then it became U.C.T. They first sang about S.A.C.S. and then they sang about U.C.T. The same thing happened in the case of the University of Pretoria. I remember the T.U.C., Transvaal University College, and when it became a university it became the Pretoria University. Now we are creating a university of this institution and now is the time to change the name. The hon. member there says the name is not important&#x2014;what&#x2019;s in a name&#x003F; That which is called a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet &#x2026; that is not true.

<p>I also want to support the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington where he asks for the omission of the definitions of &#x201C;advisory council&#x201D; and &#x201C;advisory senate&#x201D;. The Minister&#x2019;s attitude was that &#x201C;we&#x201D;&#x2014;as he explained, the royal &#x201C;we&#x201D;, the Government&#x2014;have <span class="col_3429-3430" refersTo="page_0202"/>have decided that these bodies are to remain in the constitution of this University. If we examine the five Bills dealing with the proposed new universities we see that what has happened is that the Ministers have produced identical Bills, identical constitutions for every one of these five proposed universities. That is what he means, namely that the Government has decided that in fact all non-white universities shall have exactly the same constitution, regardless of the population group that they are to serve. As the hon. member for Kensington so eloquently pointed out during the Second-Reading debate, as far as the Indian population is concerned, there are so many differences between the Bantu in higher education and the services required by and given to &#x2026;</p>

<p>Order! What has that got to do with the definitions&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>It has everything to do with the definitions, Mr. Chairman. My argument is this. The Government has decided, and the Minister said so, that this is the pattern for non-white universities, and I am saying here for Indians it is an entirely different matter. The argument of the Minister is that for all these universities for non-Whites there shall be an advisory council and an advisory senate, and I am saying that so far as the Indians are concerned you cannot apply the same test, for all those excellent reasons given by the hon. member for Kensington during the Second-Reading debate.</p>

<p>We have already in this regard a mixed council amongst the Indians. We will deal with this in greater detail later, but I want to mention this at this stage. The Minister said during the Second-Reading debate that this is the policy of the Government, that there is going to be separation, that we are not going to have these people in the same body. Despite all that, when it comes to the advanced technical education for Indians, which is higher education in terms of the definition of &#x201C;higher education&#x201D; in the Act, they have a mixed council, but for this university, also dealing with higher education, they are not going to have a mixed council, they are going to have an advisory council for the Indian people to sit on. What is the policy of the Government&#x003F; Does it change with Ministers&#x003F;</p>

<p>I hope the Minister will indicate to us what exactly he meant when he said &#x201C;we&#x201D;&#x2014;the royal &#x201C;we&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;&#x2026; have decided that we are going to have this Bill exactly as it stands, that we are going to have the same pattern throughout, and the same policies throughout&#x201D;. Why is it that he as the Minister responsible for Indian Affairs does not distinguish on their behalf between the treatment given to the Indians and the type of institution provided for the Indians, and that which is provided for the other race groups&#x003F; They are different and surely the Minister appreciates that. The contribution of the Indian people themselves to higher education is greater <i>per capita,</i> I should think, than the contribution of any other group in the Republic. This is an insult to the Indian people; it is an insult to their contribution to higher learning that when you provide a university for them and say that in respect of the council and the senate they shall not sit on the council but shall only sit in an advisory capacity together, while the white people rule their university, but they sit in a separate body and advise from there.</p>

<p>Will the Minister not confide in us what sort of consultation has he had and why does he&#x2014;he, the Minister in charge of Indian Affairs&#x2014;want the Indians to have exactly the same sort of university, the same processes, and the same sort of Bill, as the Bantu and the Coloureds&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Opposition is really making a nuisance of itself this morning. When it comes to giving something a name, there are quite a few considerations which may apply when one wants to give anybody or any institution or whatever it may be a name. One may link the name to the geographical situation, or one may give the name as a result of certain cultural associations, or one may give a name which is linked to a particular person or group of persons, or one may link the name to a particular event, or one may borrow the name from another language or from another cultural group.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>This name we have here, namely the University of Durban-Westville, was derived from the particular geographic situation, the particular environment. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said the name was far too long, but, surely, there are other universities which have equally long names. There is the Rand Afrikaans University, the University of Pretoria, and so forth. If we count the letters in the various names, I think we shall find that there the number of letters is more or less the same. I therefore cannot see what the Opposition hopes to gain by having the name changed at this stage. If one accepts this name and if we give this institution the opportunity of developing its history, and if the people to whom this university belongs and who are associated with it now, feel 10 or 20 or 30 years hence that they want to give this institution some particular name or a different name, it will always be possible to do so. It corresponds with what the hon. member for Koedoespoort said in connection with the University of Pretoria.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday when we were dealing with the Second-Reading debate, the hon. the Minister did not answer the question we put to him arising from the speech of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana in connection with the advisory council which our amendment now proposes to omit. The advisory council which we want omitted is appointed to advise the all-white council which the Minister has appointed. Our amendment proposes that the advisory council shall be omitted. Yesterday during the Second-Reading debate we asked the Minister whether he would explain to us the relationship between the advisory council and the council itself in order to give us some idea how the change-over which is proposed and which is implicit in the idea of the advisory council, will take place. We want to know how the change-over will take place between the council itself and the advisory council which it is intended, in the Minister&#x2019;s own words last year, will take over as the ruling council of the university in time. I asked the Minister yesterday to explain to us. I asked him when did he consider it would take place. He immediately got somewhat upset and said I was trying to set the time-table. What I was trying to establish were the steps that would be necessary, and I think when we are dealing with this amendment which proposes to omit the advisory council, the Minister could well take advantage of this opportunity to explain to us how this will take place. Also, does he agree with the statement of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, namely that when the Indian council itself can pay for the running of the university it is the policy of the Government to allow the advisory council to take over from the all-white council which the Minister has appointed&#x003F; I think we could well clear the air at this stage if the Minister would reply.</p>

One such local authority already exists in Verulam. This Government has acknowledged that the Indian community has the degree of responsibility necessary for it to run their own local authorities. In fact, this Government forced the Natal Provincial Council to. accept this principle and to establish these local authorities. Now, in regard to this Bill, the hon. the Minister says that the Indians do not have the degree of responsibility necessary for them to sit on the council and that they do not have the necessary qualifications to sit on the senate of this university.</p>

The Bill before the House makes no mention of the composition of the advisory council, the council, etc., as far as the different race groups are concerned.

I want very briefly to ask the hon. the Minister a question.

The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked me whether I would reconsider the name of this university. I should like to say to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that this legislation was presented to the all Indian advisory council. I do not at this stage want to deal with the composition of the council. I merely mention this point for the benefit of the hon. member. The whole Bill was conveyed to the council and they discussed the name of the university fully. They decided unanimously that the name of the university should be that which appears in this Bill. I, therefore, regret that I must tell the hon. member that I am not prepared to reconsider the name of this university. I am not prepared to make an amendment to this effect in the Other Place because I would be misleading him if I told him that I was prepared to do this.

The hon. the Minister knows and I know that there is a clause, namely clause 22, which allows the hon. the Minister to admit a Coloured person or for that matter a Bantu person to this university. But I feel that having regard to the nature of these two groups, namely the Coloured and Indian people, this university should not be reserved entirely for the Indian people as this clause purports to do. The main aspect with regard to the Coloured people is the considerable distance from Durban, the seat of this university, to the seat of the university which is to be established for the Coloured people in the Western Province. It would be a hardship on the Coloured people of Natal to compel them to go to the Western Cape for their education by leaving out of this clause a word which really does not mean very much, from the point of view of the Indian people. But from the point of view of the Coloured people and possibly from the point of view of the Bantu people, this could mean an awful lot, and I ask the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment and to widen the scope of this university to include other groups as well, always subject, of course, to clause 21.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) knows full well that he should read clause 2 with clause 22. He was told to do so on several occasions during the other debates in this House. Clause 22 makes provision for exactly what the hon. member is asking in his amendment. That clause very clearly provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) of section 2 but subject to the provisions of section 21, the council may approve the admission as a student of the university of any person not classified as a member of the Indian Group as contemplated in that subsection &#x2026;</block>

<p>I think it is very clear that this clause does make provision for what the hon. member is asking in his amendment. I think his amendment is quite unnecessary, as, in fact, were all the other amendments previously moved by him in this connection.</p>

<p>I want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister to give this matter his serious consideration, because at the Durban Medical School we have an example of such a mixture, if I may call it that, working perfectly satisfactorily. When the Durban Medical School was established under the control of the University of Natal, the instructions to the university there were that the Medical School was established primarily for the Bantu. I am not sure, Sir, whether I am pronouncing the word &#x201C;primarily&#x201D; correctly or whether the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) pronounced it correctly, but I will look it up.</p>

<p>There has always been a preponderance of Bantu at that school. The position is that the Medical Council has slowly increased the number which the Medical School is permitted to accept. There has always been some difficulty about obtaining sufficient Bantu students to fill the available places. The students who are admitted are selected matriculants; they are actually selected personally; there are not enough Bantu students who are suitable for medical training and if there is room for the admission of further students, those places are given to Indian or Coloured students. I taught there for a long time and my experience is that there are one or two Coloureds and at most perhaps four Indians are accepted, as opposed to something like 30 Bantu. This works satisfactorily. The Indians and the Coloureds who are admitted live in Durban and it makes an immense difference to them if they can live in their own homes in and around Durban. They are not wealthy. The choice is left to the University of Natal. It is just red tape to put it any other way. There is no difficulty about it. The University of Natal and the University of Westville, I hope, as ordinary decent people, will carry out the provisions of the Act and the instructions given to them in terms of the Act. This will cut out all the red tape, and it is the simplest thing in the world to leave this to the university officials. I can assure you from my own personal experience, and you can find out from the University of Natal that that is so; there is not the slightest difficulty about first filling up your class with, in this case, Indians and allowing the odd Coloured and the odd Bantu who are in Durban to attend that university. I would like the Minister to give it serious thought, because it is in the interests of all these people.</p>

<p>The hon. member said his purpose was to widen the scope. But the point I want to make is that I am quite satisfied with the scope, which lies in clause 22, and from my point of <span class="col_3439-3440" refersTo="page_0207"/>view I see no justification for any further widening of it. The same point applies to the hon. member for Durban (Central), who talked about the Medical School. Of course the Medical School is not under discussion here, but he said there was no objection to the odd Coloured or the odd Indian at the Bantu Medical School. But clause 22 conveys the same idea. It says that the council can decide that other non-Whites can come in, provided that the Minister gives his consent. So it is really clause 22 the hon. member should discuss and object to. But the whole basis of this matter is that this is an Indian university and there is this clause which to that extent widens the scope of admission to the university. I want to tell the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) that that is as wide as we consider necessary. When the hon. member says the effect of his amendment will be to widen the scope, I am satisfied that clause 22 makes it wide enough. Therefore the University will serve persons classified under the Population Registration Act, as members of the Indian group as defined in terms of this Act, and that is sufficient for our purposes.</p>

What has it got to do with the Minister if someone leaves property or money in his will to this university&#x003F; Why should, he have to approve&#x003F; Goodness knows what the policy of the Government is in this regard. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us in this regard, but when it comes to Indian advanced technical education, a subject which is regarded as being higher education in terms of the Act, we find that the technical colleges which can be set up there are to have, in terms of section 8, a council which includes one or two persons as the. Minister may from time to time determine, elected by local authorities which according to. any regulation are donors by virtue of donations made by them to the college. Nowhere do you find in that Act that for a donation to be made there should, be the approval of the Minister. In fact, when one looks at section 3 of that Act one finds that it is only in respect of the selling, exchanging or alienating of immovable property that the Minister&#x2019;s approval is required at all for any of the financial dealings of this institution of higher learning.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but not in the discussion on this particular Bill. Whatever I said during the discussion of any other Bill is not relevant here. If the Government chooses to bring five Bills with identical working to this House we will necessarily have to use the same arguments. It is not my fault and I am merely doing my duty as I see it. If you are bored by it, Sir, you can well imagine how difficult it must be for some other people. Here we have an hon. Minister who has never heard these arguments. The difference is that as far as this Minister is concerned and the Indian people are concerned we have these provisions in regard to an institute of higher learning. In the Indians&#x2019; Advanced Technical Education Act there is a provision that as far as these Indian technical institutions are concerned, like the M.L. Sultan Technical Institute, for instance, they do not have any control by the Minister in their dealings with finances except&#x2014;and this is my point&#x2014;where they exchange or otherwise alienate their immovable property or if they let it for more than one year. Only in these circumstances are they subject to ministerial control. Here we have the case of a university, which is also an institute of higher learning, and which would have, one presumes, a status higher than that of a technical college, where every dealing of that university in respect of financial matters is controlled by the Minister, including the ability to receive donations. As far as the Indian people in Natal are concerned one can find many examples of their generosity in giving money to their institutions. The hon. member for Pinetown will be able to tell this Committee to what extent this goes on.</p>

<p>In the technical college, as far as the Indians are concerned, it is provided that they may in fact do anything they like without any ministerial approval, as is set out in section 3 of the Act I have mentioned. Why does the hon. the Minister want to have the power to determin&#x00E9; whether or not someone should be able <span class="col_3443-3444" refersTo="page_0209"/>to donate money to the university&#x003F; Surely this is a matter for the council to decide. There may be certain conditions attached, but it is a matter for the university to decide and not for the hon. the Minister. Will the hon. the Minister please explain to us why he wants that particular power&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, some people find it difficult to listen and do not want to hear. This is in fact a new Bill, but it is the same hon. member moving the same amendment as he moved previously. As I did on a previous occasion, I should once more like to read out to the hon. member that this same subsection that he wants deleted is contained in the legislation of other universities. The hon. member is looking around unnecessarily now. Section 4 (2) of the Rand Afrikaans University Act contains exactly the same words as the hon. member now moves should be deleted. This subsection reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The university shall not without the approval of the Minister let, sell, exchange or otherwise alienate its immovable property or grant to any person any legal right therein or servitude thereon.</block>

<p>Does the hon. member now want this clause in the Bill under discussion to be deleted while the same clause must remain in respect of the white universities&#x003F; This is a very far-fetched argument which the hon. member has used. Subsection (4), which the hon. member wants deleted in the last portion of his amendment, provides that the purchase and use of stores and equipment shall be controlled in such manner as the Minister may determine. Surely this is a very reasonable and understandable proposal. The Minister is responsible for the expenditure incurred in connection with the maintenance of the university. The stores of a university do not consist of slates, exercise books and pens, as the hon. member has already put it. I have made investigations regarding the items purchased for this university college in the past three years. R329,000 has been spent on the purchase of these items in the past three years. These articles include, <i>inter alia,</i> microscopes, highly specialized equipment for research purposes, electronic computers, etc. If the Minister has approved the acquisition of these articles in principle, for which provision must be made in the Budget, he then leaves it to the council to determine the use to which they will be put. Since from then onwards the council exercises control over them, I therefore really do not know why the hon. member is moving this amendment at this stage.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if this university is to be a success, we would like to place it on the same basis as the Indian Technical College. I think the hon. the Minister knows that the Indian community in Natal consists of two main groups, namely the Mohammedan and the Hindu. As far as the Mohammedan group is concerned, I want to say that in many cases they do not work as individuals. Many Mohammedan Indian family trusts are established and it is these trusts that give donations. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has ever attended a family trust meeting, but I have on many occasions. In these family trust meetings one generally finds one particular person who has been asked to approach the family trust for donations. A family trust meeting then starts in the evening at 7 o&#x2019;clock and one will be lucky to get away from there at 3 o&#x2019;clock or 4 o&#x2019;clock in the morning. If at the end of the meeting they decide to give a donation to this new Indian university and the university says that they cannot accept the donation before having obtained the Minister&#x2019;s approval and there is another member of the family trust who is pleading for a donation for the Indian Technical College, he will use this fact as an argument. He will say that the college does not need the Minister&#x2019;s approval for donations and that the technical college should receive the donation. These people set great store on ceremony with donations of this kind. The family trust meets that evening, the next day they get hold of the chairman or a member of the council to arrange for the ceremony to hand over the cheque. The person is garlanded, photographs are taken and although this ceremony will receive no publicity as far as the daily Press is concerned, as far as the Indian families are concerned, it is a great occasion. In this way they satisfy their religious convictions and have then indicated in terms of the Koran that they have given money for educational purposes to these institutions. With this provision we are putting the whole of the Indian community in the position that those who want to give donations to the university do not know where they stand until they have received an answer from Pretoria. On the other hand, if they go to the Indian Technical College the matter can be settled the same day and there is no difficulty whatsoever. I suggest that as far as donations are concerned, the Minister is placing this Indian university at a distinct disadvantage if he should refuse to accept the amendment.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members are conjuring up spectres here which they are lustily firing at and which in actual fact do not exist. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana yesterday very clearly indicated the difference between the development of this University and the College for Advanced Technical Education. The hon. member pointed out very clearly how the Indian population themselves virtually had financial control in the development of the college and therefore had a greater say in it. The basic fact that no one can deny is that the Minister is financing this university fully. It therefore goes without saying that the Minister should also have a full say as far as the control of the University is concerned. It is surely not true that the Indian community will hesitate <span class="col_3445-3446" refersTo="page_0210"/>to make donations to the Indian university because they now have to obtain the approval of the Minister. As I know the Indian community, they will be much keener to make donations specifically because they may be able to make them directly to the Minister. They like to honour people and they will feel flattered that they must make these donations through the Minister, as it were. That is how we know the Indians. Surely hon. members opposite know that Communist organizations to-day have large amounts of money at their disposal which they would very much like to make available to any institution if they could achieve some purpose thereby. This measure is simply aimed at exercising control over this &#x2014;and I think that the Indian community also knows this. The Department will then also know what amounts are coming in and what amounts must still be made available. This measure is also for administrative purposes. If one does not know what funds are being made available, one surely cannot know what is still left over.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) speaks of books and pencils when dealing with the stores of the University. The stores of a university to-day consist of highly specialized equipment which can cost hundreds of thousands of rands. How on earth do hon. members opposite expect the Minister to exercise financial control over an institution without being able to say what may be purchased&#x003F; A university may, for example, need a computer. This may cost hundreds of thousands of rands and a council over which there is no control with regard to financial matters could easily make such a decision because they need the equipment. However, they will not know whether the money is available or not. For this reason it is necessary that control be exercised. There is nothing sinister or diabolical contained in this measure. Any university, and also any white university, has the decency to inform the Minister of the position so that he knows about it whenever sales or purchases involving large amounts of money are to be made. This arrangement is nothing extraordinary.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is unfortunate that the hon. member was not here last night when we replied to the remarks by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. He would then not have repeated the inaccuracies, because we made it quite clear to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana that most of the money for the M. L. Sultan College does not come from the Indian community. While a big portion of the money comes from the Indian community, the money comes from various commercial concerns, industries, the City Council of Durban and many European friends of the Indians. All these made donations to the M. L. Sultan Trust. This trust has given hundreds of thousands of rand for Indian education in the other Indian territories. Other trusts in Natal also made donations. To suggest that we are opposing this measure because money may come from Communist sources, is ludicrous. Surely there will be Treasury control if the money should come from overseas. If there is no Treasury control then there is something very seriously wrong with the Treasury. I have every confidence in the Treasury of South Africa that it is able to make sure that funds coming from overseas are controlled.</p>

<p>So far as the council is concerned, what did all the other universities do&#x003F; The other universities have their annual accounts and their balance sheets, and a copy of the council&#x2019;s balance sheet and the auditor&#x2019;s certificate are sent to the hon. the Minister of National Education. [Interjection.] In that case why does the hon. member not support our amendment then&#x003F; Because in effect the Minister is advised. Our point is they cannot accept a single donation. The Minister is going in completely the opposite direction to what another Minister did in connection with the Indian Technical College. The Indian Technical College is in an advantageous position. We have an Indian Technical College for Higher Learning and it is in a more advantageous position as far as donations are concerned than this proposed University. It is in a more advantageous position for receiving money from Indian trusts. At a family gathering of a trust they can decide to give a donation to the technical college and the following day give it a cheque, but as far as the University is concerned, as I said in my earlier remarks &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pinetown made a great fuss about the amendment and said that we did not trust them and that we presumed that they wanted to allow money to come in from Communist sources. This provision that money or property may be received &#x201C;with the approval of the Minister&#x201D; does not exclude money or property being received. Money can indeed be received. The fact that they moved this amendment indicates that they have no confidence in the Government&#x2019;s intentions whatsoever. If a donation is made and everything is quite in order, they must surely accept that there will be no obstacles placed in the way. This university is altogether a State undertaking, and surely it is quite normal for the State or the Minister to have some say in respect of the receipt of money while it is a State undertaking. Surely this is a logical state of affairs and I cannot see what the Opposition&#x2019;s objection can be.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, had the hon. member for Umhlatuzana been in the House while the hon. member for Pinetown was speaking he would have known more of what he was speaking about. The point is the following. To suggest that the University would be accepting money from communist countries is a gross reflection on the council of the University itself, a council which is appointed by the Minister. For the hon. member for Algoa to say the Minister must have this control over the council to see that money does not come from communist countries is, I think, irresponsibility of the highest order. The reason why we want to remove the Minister&#x2019;s control over, donations which are given to the University, is to give the University the status which a university deserves. As we pointed out, the Indian Institute for Higher Technical Education is able to receive donations without let or hindrance from the Minister, and surely to, goodness the whole idea of creating this. university is to create something of the highest standing possible, and this is one of the great distinctions between a university and a technical institute in every country of the world, A university has a higher status, a higher standing in educational circles throughout the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to reply to this point for the simple reason that my control over this aspect does not have a sinister motive, as was mentioned by the hon. member for Algoa. The hon. member for Mooi River said donations cannot be granted except under the control of the Minister. Of, course the clause does not read that way. Subsection (3) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The University may with the approval-of the Minister &#x2026;</block>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Well, of course. May I point out to hon. members, who have been so anxious that I should consult Indians&#x2019; bodies, that this clause was also decided upon in consultation with the Indian body. It was done in consultation with them, and I will tell the hon. member why. Because there were donations made or suggested which would have involved the University in annual costs which were quite out of proportion. In view of the fact that the financial burden of running this university is borne by the State, this clause was inserted. The hon. member opposite is scratching his head over it. A substantial donation involving a. piece of land was offered to the University which would have involved the Government in considerable expenditure year after year to carry out the conditions attached to the donation. It was not an unconditional donation. Therefore it is not unreasonable for the Minister to say: &#x201C;Well, I have to ask Parliament for the moneys required for this University, so I must also have the right to give my approval, or otherwise, if a donation is offered the acceptance of which would involve a lot of expenditure because of the conditions laid down by the donor.&#x201D; What is so sinister in that&#x003F; As I say, the matter was discussed with the Indian body. My Department tells me the Indian body suggested whether we should not limit it, to R20,000 or R10,000, and eventually this clause was decided upon.</p>

He asked for the omission of subsection (2), and that is where immovable property comes in. I was going to say to the hon. member for Durban (North) that this was the reason why this subsection was inserted, and I am not prepared to accept an amendment to omit it. The hon. member for Koedoespoort indicated it covers a large amount of expenditure. Hon. members opposite may make debating points by referring to text books and slates, and so forth. However, over the past three years the expenditure of this institution averaged over R100,000 per year. The Minister must give his approval to the letting, selling, and so forth, of immovable property. Point two concerns the matter of donations, which I have already dealt with, and point 3 concerns stores. I think the matter of stores has been replied to already and so I have no intention of holding up the Committee on this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think in view of what the hon. the Minister has indicated I am quite prepared to withdraw part of my motion. With the leave of the Committee I will withdraw that part of my amendment which proposes to omit subsection (2) of this clause. The Minister has indicated that this resides in fact in other university legislation and in those circumstances I do not want to continue with this part of my amendment. I think the Minister said there was an example where someone left a lot of money subject to certain conditions which would have involved, the State in a great deal of expenditure every year.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I said ground was offered to the institution.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Surely, Sir, this is a factor that the council can have regard to. After all, I assume the members of the council are all astute businessmen, although I do not know who they are. They are, at any rate, all appointed by the Minister. He gave us an interesting example and perhaps the Minister can give us an indication as to how this is going to arise. I find it difficult to understand how the acceptance of the ground could involve the Government in a lot of expense so as to make a donation of this sort not worthwhile.</p>

<p>The Minister says this control of his does not have a sinister motive, and he said &#x201C;as the hon. member for Algoa had said&#x201D;. But as I understood the hon. member for Algoa, he said this was needed to stop money coming from communist countries. The hon. the Minister of Police is sitting here and he can tell us that he has sufficient powers to deal with this sort of thing. Surely we have enough legislation to deal with communism and file suppression of communism. If they thought that money might come from some communist country for some subversive purpose&#x2014;well, Sir, it is really stretching the limits of one&#x2019;s imagination as to what could happen. We have enough legislation to deal with this. If a condition attached to the donation is that it should be for the teaching of Marx or Engels &#x2026; [Interjection.] Well, I do not know, I think those subjects can be looked at abstractly in an academic way, but that is not the point. The point is the Government could stop it from being done. So one wonders just why the Minister wants that control.</p>

<p>The Minister has not indicated to us why this power over stores has to reside in him. Why can the council of the university only deal with its stores in a manner to be determined by the Minister&#x003F; I trust the Minister will give us an answer to both these points. I think the example of the ground which he could not accept is something we should like to hear more about. As I said, with the leave of the Committee I withdraw that part of my amendment which proposes to delete subsection (2).</p>

<p>First amendment, with leave withdrawn.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I think it might help the Minister if we could explain where we think difficulties may arise with bequests. He can then amend this clause in order to meet what I think will be objections from the part of the donors. Our object from this side is not in any way to hinder bequests. I can well understand the example the hon. the Minister gave us, though I do not understand why he needs this to prevent such things happening. After all, the whole council is appointed by him. Surely, these will be persons of sufficient intelligence and integrity to go to the Minister first whenever they receive a bequest with a condition attached to it which is unreasonable and which they cannot fulfil. Our object was very well put by the hon. member for Pinetown. We want to see the council being empowered to accept any bequest, no matter what conditions are attached thereto. If the Minister were to reword this section so as to make provision for him to agree only to the condition, the council will be free to accept the money, subject then to the Minister&#x2019;s approval of the conditions. If he does that, the difficulties which we foresee will be obviated.</p>

<p>We do not want to place a donor in the position where, if he wants to give this university an amount of money, he has to be told by the council that they would first have to get the Minister&#x2019;s approval before accepting his donation. Instead of that, we say, let the council accept the money with the proviso that any conditions which may be attached to the gift shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. From this point of view this clause is very badly worded. As it reads now, the council shall first have to go to the Minister and get his approval before accepting any donation. It is like giving somebody a piece of bread and he says he does not want it without cheese. Well, if he is hungry, he will take the bread only. Therefore, we should like the Minister to word this clause in such a way <span class="col_3451-3452" refersTo="page_0213"/>so as to make it possible for the council to accept any gift straight away and only to make the conditions attached to that gift subject to the approval of the Minister.</p>

<p>While I was listening to the plea of the hon. member for Durban (Central) for the Minister to accept any bequest, the first thought which flashed through my mind was that the Minister apparently wants jam on it. However, on second thoughts I thought the Minister might not want to accept our amendment because there is no provision here for either the university or the council to handle money. If you read clause 3 (1), you will see that the university shall be a body corporate, capable of suing and of being sued and of purchasing and otherwise acquiring, and alienating movable or immovable property. No mention at all is made of money. I wonder whether the difficulty under which the hon. the Minister is labouring does not lie here because if he were to allow this university to accept bequests it could not be allowed to handle the money.</p>

At some universities there are chancellors apart from vice chancellors, for instance at Stellenbosch. My amendment makes it permissive, i.e. a rector &#x201C;may&#x201D; also be the vice chancellor.

In the case of the amendments which I moved to the Witwatersrand University legislation last year, I asked that the rector be called vice chancellor in order to get away from this difficulty.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subsection (1) and to substitute the following subsection:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) The rector of the University shall be appointed by the council in the manner prescribed by statute and his powers and duties shall be as thereby prescribed.</li>

<p>I do this because our attitude throughout the discussion of this Bill has been to give to the council of this university some real, meaningful, power in relation to the control of the university. Here you have the appointment of the rector, one of the key figures, the person who will give this whole university its character by reason of his leadership and his attitude towards his students. It is something of the utmost and intimate concern to the university. We feel that here you have a council appointed by the Minister; persons in whom he places the fullest trust. Then an advisory council is appointed in which the hon. the Minister also places his trust as he has explained to us on many occasions in this debate. These two bodies, we feel, should consist of persons who should be trusted by the hon. the Minister with the appointment of the rector of the university. For that reason I have moved the amendment to this clause which will give the council the right to appoint the rector in the manner prescribed by the statute of the university. This statute will itself be approved by the hon. the Minister. Here you have a succession of actions which are taken from the very first appointments by the Minister to the council and to the advisory council and the approval by the Minister of the statute; a most responsible body and an advisory body being set up to appoint, in our view, the person who will be the most intimately concerned with the character, the direction, the development and the future of the university. We feel that this can be left in the hands of the people whom the Minister is appointing, the people who are to serve on the advisory council and who are representatives of the Indian community, who are most responsible people, and the list of names, which the Minister has not yet read out to us, of the council which is appointed by the Minister. Similarly, in lines 45 and 46 we should provide that &#x201C;the council may from time to time&#x201D; without the Minister having the absolute right after consultation with the council, as it is the case throughout the whole succession of Bills. We feel that a council has now been established to the point where it can take responsible decisions for itself. For that reason, I moved the amendment.</p>

The amendment states that &#x201C;the council shall appoint &#x2026;&#x201D;, and we did not think it necessary to say &#x201C;in consultation with the advisory council&#x201D;, because that is what the advisory council is there for; they are there to advise the council. [Interjections.] Yes, perhaps they are not; perhaps the Minister will tell us whether in fact this would be a proper function of the advisory council. The Minister will agree that the Indian community has acted most responsibly throughout the years in relation to the education of the Indian people, and here you have a form forced upon them. I would like the Minister just to explain to us in what way, by accepting our amendment, he would be relaxing his control over the university which it is the intention of his Department to control&#x003F; To say that he is not prepared to accept the amendment is evading the issue, because what we are intending here is that the council which he appoints is going to take a decision which is going to affect the whole future of the university. I think this is a most important point and I do ask the Minister to give us some reason rather than merely setting his face against the whole suggestion made by us.</p>

Now we come to the details of what I said in the Second Reading, and this is one of the points of detail. It is not a question of what the Government has decided for the Indians and the Bantu.

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the House adjourned for lunch I was replying to the hon. member for Kensington on the matter he had raised. He talked about the previous Act. I should like to point out to him that that Act provides for the establishment of colleges for advanced technical education for Indians, for control, administration and regulations at such colleges and for matters incidental thereto. This Bill is to provide for a university, a university described in this Bill. Therefore, these are the conditions of the charter of this university. I am not going to get myself involved. (Interjections.] Of course not. I realize that the whole object of hon. members on that side of the House is to delay as much as they can and to argue on clauses for the sake of arguing. They are not prepared to argue on the point. This is the clause as it appears in the Bill. This Bill provides for a university and on that we are basing our council. That is all I have to reply.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I was saying before the digression, so far as the Financial Relations and the Constitution Acts are concerned in South Africa, under the umbrella of higher education both university education, with which we are dealing, and the colleges defined in the Advanced Technical Education Act resort. I was going to address the Minister on the following points. He feels that a university council should not have the powers in terms of the amendment by the hon. member for Mooi River. We have suggested to him that it is quite reasonable that the university council should have that authority, because that authority is given to an institution which, in the opinion of the Minister, is a lesser institution. That institution already has that power. A council of an advanced technical institution elects the rector of that institution. I cannot understand why I must come back to the hon. the Minister and to ask why that power should be denied to the council of a university, particularly when it is a university for the Indian people, who, in the words of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana yesterday evening, are the most advanced of our non-white peoples in this country. They are at the present moment, so far as a lower form of education is concerned, sitting on a mixed white and Indian council. That mixed council has these powers.</p>

<p>I wonder why the hon. the Minister cannot accept that a purely one-race council for the university, which will be appointed by him, cannot have those powers which he is prepared to give to an integrated council at a lower level of education. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>As I have said, this is the best we can do within the limit of a membership of 11. We have drawn our inspiration for this from the council of the college for advanced technical education established last year. I gave the constitution of that council in my speech on the Second Reading of this Bill. It includes representatives of boroughs, of towns, that are interested and are donors, of individual donors and of ex-students. The constitution of this council therefore rests on a broad basis.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, the hon. the Minister has adhered to the council which has been held to be good enough for the Bantu colleges. The council is, in fact, nominated by him in other words, it is his own council, it has been said that the council, as we want it, makes provision for Whites or Indians, that Whites or Indians will have the right to sit on the council, as in the case of the council of the college for higher technical education. The hon. the Minister, when discussing the previous clause, said to us that that might be all right for the higher technical college but that the Government was no going to accept anything like that for a university. But, Sir, the reverse is true. Where you have mixed councils, it will be in the higher echelons, not in the lower echelons. We plead for a mixed council in the higher echelons, in the universities, like there is one for the higher technical college. If you are going to agree to one such council for the higher technical college, then the more so you must agree to one for the university. There is no possible objection to it. I want to say that when we dealt with higher technical education of the Indians, the hon. the Minister said that he would have from 15 to 30 members, on one condition, and that is that the majority was to be nominated by him. We accepted that at this stage of development, for the simple reason that he would be providing the money. Therefore, Sir, I wish to move this amendment with the confidence that the hon. the Minister will realize that the attitude he took up on the last clause cannot be maintained and that he, therefore, will accept my amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to support the hon. member for Kensington in the amendment which he has moved here. This is consistent with the attitude we have taken up all along. Our attitude is to establish <span class="col_3467-3468" refersTo="page_0221"/>a university with a council, and here we come to a sticky part of this Bill. Here we have a council which is to he constituted to undertake the government of this university. The proposal of the hon. member for Kensington seeks to bring about a situation where the South African Indian Council can nominate two persons on to the council of this university.</p>

<p>We have been attacked by hon. members opposite, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana amongst others, who said that this was a means whereby we sought to introduce integration. I want to know how this can come about where you have a university for Indians established in an Indian area under the control of the Minister for Indian Affairs&#x003F; Here we wish to have white people to act as the guiding agents, because the whole trend of the thoughts of the Minister, of members on the other side, and of members on this side, is that the white people of this country have to act as the guides, as the guardian, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana puts it, of the Indian community as this university develops to full university status.</p>

<p>Our contention is that this can only be done by as close a contact as possible between the groups concerned. Here we seek to bring it about. Moreover, this is the form chosen by the Minister and the Department themselves. They have decided that there shall be an Indian university; we accept that. They have decided that there shall be a council to run the university; we accept that, but we feel that here where there is a council it shall be with the majority in the hands of the white people who are the guiding agents and that the Indian community must learn from their contacts with the Whites. Surely, Sir, this cannot be called integration, and surely the hon. member for Algoa and other members on the other side who allege that we are integrationists at this level, are talking the utmost nonsense, because here an opportunity is being created to do exactly and precisely the thing on which the Department has set its heart, and that is to allow the white man as the guiding factor to operate at the level of university education to bring the Indian community along to the point where they will be able to accept full responsibility for this university.</p>

<p>Sir, that is the intention of the hon. member for Kensington in introducing this motion, and I believe that hon. members opposite who say that the fact that we are introducing this amendment is evidence of a desire on the part of the United Party for integration, are talking irresponsibly, because they are not accepting the fact that the white man has to lead and to guide in the closest possible consultation, which this amendment of ours makes possible.</p>

<p>I shall return once again to this point which we discussed in the Second Reading debate. The fundamental difference between the United Party and the National Party is that the United Party aims at an integrated authority, and they proved once again by moving this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am discussing nothing but the amendment and the object of the amendment. The National Party accepts that close consultation has to take place, and there has always been such consultation between the white population group and every non-white population group in this country. But with this amendment the United Party once again seeks to establish an integrated authority for this University. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the technical high school established last year &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; as that technical college had existed before and had a council on which Whites as well as non-Whites served. This University also existed before, but had a traditional council as well as a traditional advisory council. Traditionally the council consists solely of members of the white population group and the advisory council solely of members of the Indian population group, and the only thing that is happening with this change-over to full university academic status is that past tradition in this specific university is being retained as it was in the past, and for this reason we on this side are not prepared to establish a new mixed body of authority.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this is a very interesting approach by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, because in 1968, when we debated the Indian Advanced Technical Education Act, which deals with an institution of higher learning as this university is, the statement made by the then Minister of Indian Affairs differed somewhat from the statement made here to-day by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. The hon. member says that the difference between that Act and this Bill is that this university has a tradition, a three-year tradition! This is what can happen when hon. members on that side speak about things like this: &#x201C;This tradition will begin next week, or whenever the Bill is passed&#x201D;. This is really what the hon. member is saying.</p>

Sir, the hon. member for Kensington read this out during the Second Reading debate and I think one is entitled to remind the hon. the Minister of this once again so that he can once again reply to this, because he did not reply at the Second Reading. This is what the hon. member for Kensington said&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is the case says the hon. member for Kensington, because the hon. the Minister nodded his head. Sir, there is much more to this. The deliberate policy of the Minister was that this should be a council of Indians and Whites sitting together, a mixed council. In fact, this is what the hon. member for Kensington said in the Committee Stage on clause 8 (col. 1123, vol. 22)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Clause 8 (1) (b) makes provision for the election by local authorities of one or two persons to the council. What I should like to know from the Minister is how many of these local authorities there are. The Minister mentioned some when he introduced the Bill.

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">Minister of Indian Affairs</person>:</from>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Sir, this was the policy in 1968, last year. This was the policy of the Government in respect of the council of an institution of higher learning for the Indians, so far as technical education was concerned. Now suddenly this is completely repudiated. What has happened, Sir&#x003F; This hon. Minister says that the Government &#x2014;he referred to the Royal &#x201C;we&#x201D;&#x2014;has decided that there should be a pattern as far as all non-white universities are concerned; that they are going to start a tradition of non-white universities as soon as the Other Place assents to these Bills. Sir, there it is in Hansard, and this was not a hundred years ago. One is entitled to change one&#x2019;s mind, but is one entitled to change one&#x2019;s mind about higher education from one year to the next&#x003F; This is not a case of changing their minds. The provisions of the Advanced Technical Education Act of last year still remain the law, and in terms of that Act you have a mixed council, not consisting of people who are elected to it but appointed by the Minister. He says that he is going to appoint members of both race groups, Indians and Whites, to this council. Sir, what is the policy of the Government&#x003F; It is all very well for the hon. the Minister to follow, as he said, the course of the flood of Bills that we have had to deal with different people. This was recognized last year. Sir, surely, in principle there is nothing wrong with the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington. I wonder whether the hon. member for Umhlatuzana will indicate what he feels about the principle instead of talking about traditions that are going to exist some time in the future. The argument that was addressed to us from that side of the House, when it was moved before that we should have a council which was representative of the various interests involved, including the people themselves for whom the university was to be established, was this: &#x201C;The difference between this side of the House and the other side of the House is that we believe in separation and that you believe in integration&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I thought someone would say that, Sir. It is not true in respect of the Government because although they provide in the Statute that there are going to be two councils, in fact they find that they can only operate by getting together and having a discussion together in one chamber, so that is not integration!

<p>In any event, I am sure that if he did say that, he probably said that it was not relevant. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can explain this. Here we are dealing with two institutions. He cannot advance the argument that this is against policy. This is the whole point; this is really what we have been talking about; this is what the hon. member for Kensington introduced right at the beginning of the Second Reading debate when he said, &#x201C;This Bill is something quite different from all the Bantu Bills that we have been dealing with&#x201D;, and then he listed all the differences between the approach that you should have to the Indian population and the approach that you could have towards the Bantu population.

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, when we discussed this clause earlier in relation to a similar institution, the then hon. Deputy Minister was under the impression that it was written into clause 8 that the council should consist of white persons. He subsequently realized that it was not written into the Bill as such. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will indicate to us what the position is. It is not written into the Bill in clause 8 that persons other than white persons should not be appointed to the council. Is it the policy of the hon. the Minister that this council shall consist of Whites only&#x003F; I ask that, Sir, because one has some difficulty in foreseeing how the progressive development of this university to a full autonomous state will take place. If the council is to remain fixed as a council of white persons only, with an advisory council of non-Whites, then when the time comes for the Indians themselves to take over control, is it to be a case of the eight or ten ladies and gentlemen who form the council and who are White, walking out of one door of the council chamber while the other eight walk in because the two must not meet inside the council chamber&#x003F; Is that what we have to envisage at the handing over of authority&#x003F; Or, alternatively&#x2014;and I hope the Minister will be frank with us; I am sure he will&#x2014;is it not purposely left out of this Bill, because the Minister realizes that if he was restricted to white, persons for all time then the progression of handing over control to the Indians could never be carried out effectively, and that, therefore, it must be left open, because whether it is now or in a few years&#x2019; time, there will have to be a gradual sitting together of the Whites and the Indians on this council, in the transition period of handing over control. I know the Minister is in a difficult position. He is a member of a party which says that if you sup at the same table or consult at the same table, you are integrating. [Interjections.] But we have had that all along. We cannot sit and consult in the same council except if one is in the council and the other is in the advisory council and then only through a grid. That is the difficulty I believe the Minister is in. Will he tell us&#x003F; Is it purposely not stated here that they shall be White, because the Minister knows that the transition will bring about a time when Whites and Indians must sit together; and if he does not accept that, will he explain to us how that transition is going to take place, except, as I say, that literally and metaphorically the white councillors will walk out by one door and the Indian councillors will walk in by the other door to take their seats&#x003F;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking to you now. The basis is that they have consistently said that you must have mixed councils for all the universities, whether it was Bantu or Coloureds; there had to be a mixed council of Whites and non-Whites. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Durban (North) is a most garrulous member. Not only does he talk, but he always interrupts when someone else is talking. The hon, member for Green Point wanted to know where the difference was; did I just not declare that they should be White because in due course I was going to make it a mixed council&#x003F; That is, of course, where we consistently think differently from the hon. members opposite. We are going to have, and we have established, without any statement directing us in the actual Bill, that we will have a white council, and when it comes to the advisory council it does not say that it must be an Indian advisory council. It could have been a mixed advisory council. <span class="col_3473-3474" refersTo="page_0224"/>But we have consistently nominated an Indian advisory council. The intention of the Government, which has been stated, is that with regard to this university, it will in due course hand the council over to an all-Indian council and the process will take place at a pace which the Government will decide, but it will not be on the basis of a mixed council. That is where we differ. I am not going into all the ideology of integration. All I would say to the hon. members is that I think they protest too much, because right throughout they have been trying to break down this line of thought.</p>

<p>I do not want to run away from the points raised by the hon. member for Green Point. He spoke about higher technical education and the situation there. I looked through the Act to see whether it referred to higher technical education, and although every hon. member referred to higher technical education I found that the Act itself refers to advanced technical education. But I was ruled out of order when I wanted to say that I am handling a matter here which is described in the Bill. I am not prepared to meander all over policy matters. I am telling you the exact position as far as this Bill is concerned about the university council, the advisory council and the senate. That is what the position is. After all, I realize that in a Bill of this nature arguments can be used which were made on a previous Bill, but this is a new Bill and I know the whole situation.</p>

<p>I would say to the hon. member for Kensington that he will appreciate that under (e), because the S.A. Indian Council is all-Indian, it would be Indians who would be put on the council chosen by the Indian Council. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Kensington indicated that there would be Indians on the council.</p>

<p>Yes. I would also say in regard to (f) that here it stipulates one person to be chosen by the University of Natal. It makes it obligatory, in fact. My department has spoken to them and they say that on the university council there is a professor of the University of Natal. He may not necessarily be chosen by the University of Natal but he is from the University of Natal and I will obviously bear this point in mind when any re-appointment to the council occurs. I must say to the hon. member for Kensington that I do not feel that I have learned anything from the arguments that I should definitely have to choose one person from the University of Natal. In regard to the four persons appointed by the State President, the only difference, of course, is that this Bill says eight and I abide by it.</p>

<p>The object of this Committee. I am sure, is to try to improve this Bill. That is why we debate it and I think the Minister should give us credit for that being our intention, and that being so, he should not start off, as he obviously did today when he came into this Committee, by deciding that in all circumstances he was going to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;. He apparently is much nearer to the communists than we are, because Molotoy was famous for the fact that he always said &#x201C;No&#x201D; in the Security Council of U.N. He was known as &#x201C;Molotoy No&#x201D;, and I would hate the Minister of Indian Affairs to get that same nickname. He should at least give us credit for trying to improve the Bill. I want to suggest that if he cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington, particularly that part dealing with the two people chosen by the S.A. Indian Council, could he not accept the two white persons chosen by the S.A. Indian Council&#x003F; Because the S.A. Indian Council has a knowledge of which white persons&#x2014;and I do not count myself amongst them particularly&#x2014;are interested in and know the wants and the wishes of the Indian people. What is more, these two white persons would necessarily consult with the S.A. Indian Council about any particular resolution which they feel should be known to the S.A. Indian Council. This will serve as a further link between the Minister, who, obviously, is going to control the council and the S.A. Indian Council without him having to contaminate his fingers by coming into contact with these people. I put that to him for his consideration.</p>

<p>Sir, you have been concerned this afternoon about the time taken up by the Committee in this debate. I would respectfully suggest that if the hon. the Minister dealt with the arguments raised by this side of the House and answered the points raised by us, it would be unnecessary for speaker after speaker to get up to ask him the same thing. The point made by this side of the House to the Minister and the question put to him is this: If in terms of the Indians Advanced Technical Education Act, his side of the House, the Nationalists, were prepared to appoint not only Whites to the council but Indians also, why is it that in terms of the present Bill before the House his Government is not prepared to appoint Indians to the council&#x003F;</p>

If that is not their answer, will they please tell this House, in words of one syllable, without any wriggling, and without any equivocation, what the difference is between the council under the Indians Advanced Technical Education Act, in terms of which this Nationalist Government last year was prepared to appoint Indians to the council I have mentioned, and the council for which provision is made under this Bill. Now, in 1969, a year after the passing of the Act I have mentioned, the Government says that not a single Indian is to be appointed to the council. Now I shall sit down.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, asked me a question. I shall tell him what the reply to it is. This side of the House does not adopt the attitude that there are no Indians who are qualified to serve on such a council. But do we adopt the attitude that this university was established through the initiative of the Whites in South Africa in terms of the policy of providing separate university institutions for Whites as well as non-Whites in this country. Because this university was established by the Whites, as a result of White initiative, and is being financed by White initiative, the authoritative body will be staffed by Whites. We accept that there are Indians who are in fact competent and qualified to exercise similar authority.</p>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>We adopt the attitude that this university has nothing to do with the technical college which was established by law last year. That technical high school was simply an extension of an already established Indian higher education institution, which was established through the initiative of the Indians themselves, and not through the initiative of the Whites. That technical college is financed for the most part by the Indians. It is administered for the most part by the Indians. It was then simply placed on another basis by means of legislation. In that case the same controlling body was retained. This new university is also an extension of an organization which had already been established and which has been in existence since 1961. That institution had a purely White council. The same basis is being proceeded on now. That is the fundamental difference. It does not mean that we do not accept the competency of the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="col_3477-3478" refersTo="page_0226"/>We do accept it. Nor does it mean that no consultation takes place, or that, when consultation does take place, that consultation cannot take place in one room. It does in fact do so. Consultation does not take place only by means of correspondence or a telephone. It means, however, that the authoritative body at this stage will be in the hands of the Whites. The advisory body will be controlled by the Indians. But at one stage or other, as I said yesterday, it will be possible to effect a transfer. It will then be possible for the authoritative body to become a non-White body. Perhaps there can then, as an interim measure, be an advisory body, consisting of Whites. But it is not necessary that there should be a mixed authoritative body in the interim, during the transitional stage. That is the difference between our points of view.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to take the matter which was raised by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana a little further. It is a question which I raised with the hon. the Minister last night. It has not yet been answered. The hon. the Minister stated, again during the Committee Stage, that the change-over would be made on the basis of the whole council and the whole of the advisory council. The council would become the government of the university, and the advisory council would be taken over in an advisory capacity. When the change-over takes place at the time which is fixed by the Government, whenever that may be, the Indian body will become the government of the university. The white body will then remain in an advisory capacity, or it will fall away altogether. But we now come back to the point raised by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. The whole distinction he drew between the Indians&#x2019; Advanced Education Act and this Bill was that the Indians, to a very large extent, paid for the M.L. Sultan College themselves. What it boils down to is that, if one has enough cash, integration is all right. That is what it boils down to, and nothing else. That is the only distinction which can be drawn between the one case and the other.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana went further last night. He said that when the Indian council is in a position to pay for the expenses of the university, it will be ready to take over full control of the university. I asked the hon. the Minister then, and I ask him now, and I also ask the hon. member for Umhlatuzana: Is the Indian council going to become a tax raising body to put it in a position to pay for the cost of this university&#x003F;</p>

<p>It is not in the Bill, but the hon. member and the Minister have stated that a change-over will take place at some stage in the future. There has been no indication whatsoever in this regard. The reason why we are moving this amendment is because we wish the leadership to be given by the Whites in the body of the council itself. The Minister has stated that there will be a change-over at some time in the future. I think it is a fair and just question to ask, in this academic atmosphere in which we debate these matters, whether the hon. the Minister will tell us that what the hon. member for Umhlatuzana said last night is in fact correct. He said that the time of the changeover from the one to the other would depend upon payment by the Indian council.</p>

<p>I am coming to it. I will reply as I think I should, not as the hon. member for Musgrave thinks I should.</p>

<p>Now we come to this university council. I quite understand the point the hon. members on that side of the House have raised with regard to the fact that it should be a mixed council. However, I say quite definitely that the Government has. decided that it shall not be a mixed council, although the Bill does not stipulate it. The. Government has nominated the council itself as an all-white council and it has appointed the members of the advisory council as an all-Indian council. Whereas the hon. member for Mooi River said that in due course they can get the experience and gain the leadership in the mixed council, our view is that through an advisory council they can gain experience, because the policy of the Government is that the Indian advisory council will eventually form the council of this university. He asked me whether this had anything to do with a special taxation on the Indians. It is not a matter that, appears in the Bill. It is not a matter that, I think, has ever entered the minds of any members of this Committee. [Interjections]. No, I know when it was raised. It was with regard to the M. L. Sultan College. But I am talking about the situation as it is in this Bill. Let us be quite clear about the facts. I tried to explain these facts to the hon. member. The hon. member for Musgrave said that I do not answer the questions. I have been sitting here and answering every question that could be answered, until the matter got quite out of hand. I am prepared to carry on. I am prepared to consider points. I wish to say to the hon. member for Kensington, I listened to every point he raised. I disagreed with probably all of them, but, at least, I knew that the hon. member had made a study of it. He was not standing on his feet just to use those 10 minutes. He was trying to put the point of view he had. That is the difference between my approach and that of a lot of hon. members on that side of the House. It is not due to the fact that I am unwilling to answer questions. I am willing to answer questions. It is due to the fact that the whole objective is not constructive.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall try to put. the position as I see it, logically. The hon. member for Durban (North) quoted from a debate in Hansard that took place in 1968. The pattern for, the university education we had in mind for the non-white races in this country took shape in 1959. So, it is not a matter of &#x201C;that was in 1968; this is 1969&#x201D;, and that we made a big change. The pattern we laid out was that the non-white universities would eventually be essentially non-white, with non-white councils. That is how we intend to do it.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the following amendments&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (c) of subsection (1) and to substitute the following paragraph:</block>

<ol>

<li>(c) the professors of the University and such lecturers of the University as the council may from time to time designate.</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">; in line 32, to omit &#x201C;the Minister and&#x201D;; and in lines 35 and 36, to omit &#x201C;after consultation with the Minister&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It is very simple and is clearly stated. Paragraph (c) of clause 10 (1) says&#x2014;&#x201C;such professors and senior lecturers of the University as the council may from time to time designate for the purpose &#x2026;&#x201D; and I propose it should read&#x2014;&#x201C;the professors of the University and such lecturers of the University as the council may from time to time designate &#x2026;&#x201D;. In other word, the professors will take their seats in the senate without the council having to designate them. I propose that all professors shall sit in the senate, and, in addition, such lecturers as the council may from time to time designate. That is my first amendment. I come now to my second amendment.</p>

<p>If this is adopted, paragraph (b) of clause 10 (2) will then start off as follows&#x2014;&#x201C;Such persons shall be so appointed by the council after consultation with the other university institution concerned &#x2026;&#x201D;. In other words, we do hot say there should be consultation with the Minister. It is not necessary to have the Minister come into this at all.</p>

<block name="quote">Such persons shall be so appointed by the council after consultation with the other university institution concerned, and the number of persons so appointed in respect of any particular faculty shall from time to time be determined by the council.</block>

<p>I think it is perfectly clear we do not want the Minister to come into this at all, and I am sure he has no desire to do that. After all, he appoints every member of the council; two of <span class="col_3483-3484" refersTo="page_0229"/>them come from the senate, of course, but it is all within his gift.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subsection (1) and to substitute the following subsection:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) The establishment at the University shall be determined by the council after consultation with the Minister.; and to omit the proviso to subsection (2).</li>

</ol>

<p>This amendment merely seeks to reverse the order. The clause, as printed, reads that the establishment at the university shall be determined by the Minister after consultation with the council. My amendment merely seeks to change the order so that the establishment shall be determined by the council after consultation with the Minister. I feel that this is surely something which the Minister can accept; that the council shall be charged with something which is part and parcel of the organization, of the day-to-day administration of the university. When a university is established the council is charged with the running of it; the council is the body in control of the day-to-day running of the university, and it must surely be within the power of the council to be responsible for the establishment at the university without the Minister taking this power unto himself and then consulting with the council. I can see no objection whatsoever to this. I know that this has been the pattern which has been followed in all the other Bills, but here is a concrete example where the power of the Minister, in my submission, is misplaced, because the establishment at the university is not a matter of policy; it is something which is related to the physical running of the university and I feel that the Minister can, without any loss of face, accept this amendment. I move it in that spirit.</p>

<p>The proviso reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that the appointment, promotion, transfer, secondment or discharge of teaching and administrative staff in such posts as the Minister may determine shall be subject to his control.</block>

<p>I move the omission of this proviso in the same spirit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I have studied the amendment moved by the hon. member for Mooi River, and I do not think the matter is as simple as he considers. For one thing I would point out to him that the major portion of the budget of the university is the staff establishment item. In view of the fact that I myself have to be responsible for the staff establishment and the financing thereof, I think it is quite right that I should be accountable to this House as far as the establishment is concerned and as far as the cost of the university is concerned. Sir, I always understood that hon. members were very anxious that they should be allowed to hold the Minister responsible, so I do not know why the hon. member now raises difficulties and why he wants to reverse the procedure. He wants the clause to provide that the establishment at the university shall be determined by the council after consultation with the Minister. We say that it must be determined by the Minister after consultation with the council. That is how we feel it should be done. With regard to his amendment to omit the proviso, all I can say is that this proviso must remain as it is; this is the basis on which we intend to administer this Bill when it becomes an Act. The proviso is part and parcel of our thinking of this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the hon. the Minister quite understands that if he were prepared to accept the amendment of the hon. member he would still have the power that he wishes to have, because if the council were to create new posts without his approval, it would be the easiest thing in the world for him to say: &#x201C;I am not prepared to finance those posts&#x201D;. That happens in the case of white universities. They may not create a new faculty without the consent of the Minister; we all know that. Our best universities are in that position. I cannot see why the hon. the Minister wishes to labour this point. He has this power without stating it in the Act. It is as simple as that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not as simple as that, because it means that if the council makes a decision and consults me, I have to go against the decision of the council. I would rather have the power to determine the establishment after consultation with the council. I do not think this is such a terrible power to have. I think that is the proper way in which to conduct things.</p>

<p>In terms of paragraph (b) a female member of the staff of the university can be discharged <span class="col_3487-3488" refersTo="page_0231"/>on account of her marriage. Sir, just by chance I was looking through a list of new books which have come into the library of Parliament.

<block name="quote">Vroue van alle lande word deur een van Europa se knapste vroulike joernaliste bespreek en as die nuttelose geslag veroordeel.</block>

<p>I am beginning to wonder whether this is not perhaps the attitude which is being taken up here in regard to the female establishment at the university when a member of the staff who is a female can be discharged on account of her marriage. This matter has been argued here, by other Ministers in dealing with other Bills, and the point was made by other Ministers that this is purely permissive because the wording is that a female member of the staff &#x201C;may&#x201D; be discharged, but the permissive part is entirely in the hands of the Minister. The female member of the staff has no discretion in this matter at all. She is positively liable to be discharged for having undertaken the simple act of marriage.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not a simple act; it is an extremely complicated act. I agree with the hon. member for Koedoespoort, and in many cases it may be an ill-advised act for a woman who is qualified well enough to be a member of the staff of the university to get married, but I fail absolutely and utterly to see the reason for this provision in the Bill that because a woman marries she should <i>ipso facto</i> be liable to be discharged. Surely to goodness it can be left to the discretion of a woman, who has attained the educational standard which enables her to become a member of the staff of the. university, whether it is the library staff or the teaching staff or the administrative staff, to decide for herself whether or not she is going to leave the university. It is not necessary for the Minister to have this absolute power over the future of such a person. I feel that there are enough disabilities under which women suffer in our modern society without adding another disability, particularly in the case of persons who are engaged in a particularly important function in our national life. I have heard nothing from any hon. member or any. hon. Minister in the debates on the other Bills to. justify the provisions of paragraph (b), I would be grateful if the Minister could tell, us just why he needs this power, and why he cannot leave it to the good sense of a woman who gets married while ill the employment of the university to resign the position that she holds, as people do in normal commercial occupations. There are girls working in offices throughout the length and breadth of the country who get married; some of them leave immediately after their marriage and some continue to work. In fact in our modern society the fact that a young wife works enables the couple to maintain the standard of living to which the two were accustomed before their marriage. I feel that this is an unnecessary provision and I move that this paragraph be deleted. Para, (e) says that if the discharge of a member of the staff who has been appointed permanently will in the opinion of the council facilitate improvements in the organization of the university by means of which greater economy and efficiency will be effected, such a person can be discharged. I fail to see that there is any real justification for a provision of this nature. I admit that here the council has a discretion in the matter, but I feel that the position of the members of the staff will be strengthened if these two paragraphs are deleted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I want, firstly, to reply to the second point raised by the hon. member. This is a matter which has been found necessary and advisable to insert because such cases have occurred. A case was mentioned to me where certain arrangements were made for developing playground facilities at the university and when they were established the job was redundant and the council decided to get rid of the person. So there is nothing sinister about this clause.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with the position of married women. This matter was discussed with the Indian Advisory Council. It is not as simple as the hon. member thinks. We already have the problem with school education where an Indian woman teacher married the inspector and it caused any amount of trouble because the argument was used by other teachers that this woman was getting special treatment from the inspector who was her husband. These are the practical points that crop up. The hon. member talks as if the whole thing is so easy, but at the university the same sort of thing could apply. But it is a purely permissive clause, and if there are no problems naturally. such a person can continue in employment. But if there are problems they must be decided at council level, and where the Minister has a sort of prerogative they will come to the Minister. That is all that the effect of this clause is. It has nothing to do with the general employment of married women. This provision is there just to deal with a position which might be an embarrassment to the university.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Firstly I do not like the word &#x201C;dismissed&#x201D; in line 3. Later, in line 10, in the English version, they use the word &#x201C;discharged&#x201D;, which I think is much more suitable. In the Afrikaans text they use the same term <span class="col_3489-3490" refersTo="page_0232"/>for both, &#x201C;ontslaan&#x201D; en &#x201C;ontslag&#x201D;. I think the word &#x201C;discharge&#x201D; is a better word.</p>

<p>Now I come to the amendment of the hon. member for Mooi River. The explanation the Minister has given in the case of a married woman is not because the woman became married but because she married an inspector. That was the objection he had. Therefore he should not make a general rule of this kind, that she can be dismissed if she commits the offence of getting married. The whole modern world is opposed to that. People do not do that nowadays. I am not objecting to the Minister making certain regulations to deal with the difficulties he has. The council would approve of such regulations, but it is certainly wrong to say in the law that a woman can be dismissed on account of her marriage.</p>

<p>Now we come to paragraph (e). We say here that a man can be discharged if it will give greater economy. Of course it always gives greater economy if you dismiss a person, because then it costs less to run the university. I think it is most unfortunately stated here. I think the hon. member for Mooi River has moved an excellent amendment here and I suggest that it be accepted.</p>

<p>I do not agree that the amendment to omit paragraph (e) is so good and I am therefore not prepared to accept it. In regard to what the hon. member said about the words &#x201C;dismissed&#x201D; and &#x201C;discharged&#x201D;, all I can say is that I will go into the matter. I appreciate the point he raised and if there is no complication of a legal nature after I have had discussions with the law advisers I will be glad to consider changing the word. I just want to point out that there is not much difference between discharging and dismissing a person, but I will go into the matter.</p>

<p>It is not a general rule. Universities do not have to get the permission of the Minister in order to decide on their fees. The white universities do not do that. It is not a practice established in South Africa at all. The obvious thing is to leave that to the council. Should a university ask fees that are much too high, there is always provision made for an appeal to the Minister who can discuss the matter with the council. I think the amendment of the hon. member for Mooi River brings the position into line with general practice in South Africa. I do not see why the Minister should insist on this rigid control when it is completely unnecessary.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>It is not at all necessary for me to go into details as far as the importance of artificial insemination for the building up of healthy and highly productive dairy herds in our country is concerned. The Amendment Bill which is now being submitted to the hon. House is, for the most part, merely intended to rectify certain administrative matters.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<p>Provision is being made for the control of bulls which have up to now been used for the collection of semen. What is being envisaged for the most part here is deep-frozen semen, because increasing use is being made of this practice. Because there is greater scope for the use of deep-frozen semen, which can be stored for long periods of time, than semen <span class="col_3493-3494" refersTo="page_0234"/>which is collected and utilized almost immediately afterwards, it is of great importance that such bulls, which sometimes change hands repeatedly should be selected and that the Registrar of the Artificial Insemination Act should deem the use of such bulls to be suitable. The use of poor bulls or bulls which have been contaminated by a certain disease which can cause great damage, will be restricted by means of this control. In addition clause 1 provides that persons in the full-time employ of an owner can apply insemination, which is something essential in practice.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<p>A reconstitution of the Artificial Insemination Board has become necessary because it was felt that the members of the present Board are not representative of the entire animal husbandry and dairy industry. So, for example, there are two representatives of the milk producers as well as two representatives of producers who apply artificial insemination, which fundamentally do not differ much. Nevertheless duplication has to a certain extent taken place, while the artificial insemination cooperatives, which are in practice and which render the services, are not represented. In this way the South African Stud Book Association, specifically, and the South African Society of Animal Production, whose aim is the improvement of the animal husbandry industry, did not have specific representation in terms of the Act. The number of council members, i.e. 16, remains unchanged.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<p>A longer period of office, of two to three years, appears to be desirable for council members in order to effect better continuity.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<p>An amendment according to a request from the Board so that it could function to better effect has resulted in the amendment of clause 4. The amendment contained in the Bill bears the stamp of approval of the Artificial Insemination Board and the South African Agricultural Union.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the hon. the Minister who moved these proposed amendments that we on this side of the House have no objection to them. I can also inform the hon. member that we have also submitted his legislation to leading persons in the stock-breeding industry. They have no objection to this Amendment Bill either. Consequently we support the amendments to the Act which have been submitted here by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are only one or two important amendments in this Bill. The first is in connection with the fact that farmers today leave artificial insemination to their employees in any case. This amendment in fact legalizes the present practice. We have no objection to this.</p>

<p>It is in no way necessary that we should emphasize the importance of artificial insemination in this House, since everyone who is concerned in the agricultural industry is in fact thoroughly aware of the important influence of artificial insemination on the improvement of livestock. Consequently, if the farmers themselves are asking for such changes, we are not prepared to raise any objection to them. In any case, this Bill does not result in any changes of principle.</p>

<p>There is also a change in respect of the constitution of the Artificial Insemination Board, a change which is welcomed by the bodies concerned. Consequently, Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasant task to state that we support the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendments in this Bill.</p>

<heading>NATIONAL PARKS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The National Parks Act, 1962, grants specific powers to the National Parks Board of Trustees in regard to the control and management of national parks in the Republic and the maintenance thereof, and that in order to achieve the aims as defined in section 4 of the Act, for which purpose also the Board is able to spend its revenue.</p>

<p>The object of a national park is described as follows in the Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The object of the constitution of a park is the preservation and study therein of wild animal, marine and plant life and of objects of geological, archaeological, historical, ethnological, oceanographic and other scientific interest and the benefit and enjoyment of visitors to the park.</block>

<p>Hon. members are aware of the recent controversy which has been raging in regard to the proposed Kruger statue in the Kruger National Park, and that it has been suggested, <i>inter alia,</i> that the erection of the statue in a <span class="col_3495-3496" refersTo="page_0235"/>national park would be outside the ambit of the powers of the National Parks Board of Trustees in terms of the Act in question, and that the Board was exceeding its powers by receiving donations for the erection of such a statue.</p>

<p>It appears from various legal opinions obtained by the Board that the legal experts are not agreed on this matter. Of great importance, however, is the standpoint of the Controller and Auditor-General, who supports the opinion that the Board does not have the power to erect monuments and that the Act does not make provision for the receiving and spending of money by the Board for the erection of the envisaged statue, and that any action in this connection will not be covered by the Act.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that it is general knowledge that the Board has in fact received donations in the present connection, it is also a fact that in the past a statue of Stevenson-Hamilton was erected in the Kruger National Park; that is apart from the library which bears the latter&#x2019;s name, as well as other memorial tablets, museums, etc. Under the circumstances it is clear therefore that it is necessary to effect a suitable amendment to the Act in order to give legal effect to the actions of this Board which it has performed in all good faith, as well as to make provision for future actions in the present connection.</p>

<p>The Bill before you has as its purpose therefore the expansion of the object of a national park as defined in section 4 by adding the function of establishment. This comprises wider powers to the Parks Board in not only being able to establish and maintain a park, but also to introduce into that park what belongs there. The provision has a general purport and is in fact intended to state beyond any doubt that the Parks Board is, <i>inter alia,</i> able to establish an object which relates to a contingency or the history of a park. The fact that this legislation is being piloted through must, however, not be interpreted as meaning that the Government supports a specific form of honouring any person in a specific national park.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the most important part of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s speech was the last part. Consequently I want to confine my remarks in respect of this Bill to that aspect as well. I am actually deputizing now for the hon. member for South Coast, who would have supported this legislation, in question with great pleasure, as he put it. However, I want to say that we on this side of the House can find no objection to the fact that the Parks Board should have the right, for example, to honour in a fitting way a person who had a great deal to do with the establishment of such a park. But I find it strange that something like this was not spotted in the past, during earlier amendments of the Act. In any case, the amendment proposed here is of importance.</p>

<p>The point I would like to make is the same as that made by the Deputy Minister in the last part of his speech. It is that we should not deduce from this amendment Bill that the Government agrees with a specific way of doing honour to a person. I think that, since we are now discussing this Bill, it is also necessary to address a word of warning to the Parks Board, which is now being granted this power. They must foe very careful in regard to the way in which they honour a person who had something to do with the establishment of a specific park. They must foe extremely careful when it comes to the way in which such a person is honoured. We do not want to unleash a reaction among the public, which can subsequently to a large extent make what is almost a farce of a matter in the Press, etc. This happened, for example, when it was envisaged to carve out a statue of President Paul Kruger&#x2019;s bust in the Kruger National Park. One does not want anything like this. In other words, the National Parks Board must in this respect act with the greatest circumspection and care. Consequently it will always be necessary, before something like this is done, to consult the public in the right way and as far as possible. The United Party has no objection to homage being paid, in a fitting way, to national leaders and founders of such parks. Consequently we support the principle contained in this Bill. We also support the fact that the Bill will be with retrospective effect, to 1965, so that legal effect will be given to what the Board has already done.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to give the hon. member for Newton Park the assurance that great care is being taken in this respect.

I am highly appreciative of the fact that the Opposition are adopting this attitude and that they are not opposed to this statutory amendment.</p>

<heading>Salaries of non-White doctors employed in provincial hospitals</heading>

<from>Mrs. H. SUZMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of the Interior:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether representations on the question of salaries of non-White doctors employed in Provincial hospitals have been made to him; if so (a) by whom and (b) on what date;</li>

<li>(2) whether consideration has been given to the representations; if so, with what result; if not, why not;</li>

<li>(3) whether he will make a statement on the question of salary scales of non-White doctors employed in Government and Provincial services.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_the_interior" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a) The Administrators of the four provinces.</li>

<li>(b) 4th November, 1968.</li></ol></li>

<li>(2) Yes. An increase of 15 per cent in the existing salary scales of non-White doctors, with effect from the 1st April, 1969, instead of the 15 per cent increase by way of allowances spread over the following two years which was announced initially, has, as an interim measure, been approved.</li>

<li>(3) The salaries of non-White doctors were considered since the 4th November, 1968, and possible basis for improvements within the framework of the salary structures applicable in the Public Service, were formulated and submitted to the Administrators for their comments. In this regard it should be understood that adjustments to the salary scales of public service and provincial officers/employees are in the nature of things, a relatively complicated process. Before such adjustments can be effected, the Public Service Commission and the Treasury must, in terms of the provisions of the Public Service Act, respectively, make recommendations in respect of the salary scales and approve of the expenditure which will be required to implement such recommendations. In respect of the salaries of, <i>inter alia</i> medical personnel, it is for obvious reasons essential that uniformity in respect of the remuneration of public service and provincial officers/employees should be maintained and the Public Service Commission cannot, therefore, make recommendations in respect of the salaries of, e.g. non-White doctors, unless proper co-ordination among all concerned, has taken place beforehand.

<ul>

<li>On the 14th May, 1968, the M&#x00FC;nnig Committee was appointed by the Minister of Mines, of Planning and of Health to investigate the salaries of professional personnel in the Public Service and statutory bodies. The Committee soon came to the conclusion that professional personnel could not be dealt with in isolation but that its investigation should go much wider. The Committee&#x2019;s findings point to a general pattern of remuneration for all groups of Public Service personnel and, therefore, of necessity also for provincial employees. At the time of considering the question of salary scales for non-White doctors (on the 7th March, 1969) the Cabinet Committee took cognizance of the fact that the report of the M&#x00FC;nnig Committee would shortly be made available to the Cabinet. In view thereof it was decided to increase the salary scales of non-White doctors by 15 per cent with effect from the 1st April, 1969, as an interim measure. The Administrators were informed accordingly. The M&#x00FC;nnig Report will shortly be considered by the Cabinet and salary scales for all divisions, within the framework of the pattern of remuneration, will be announced. As is known the provision of funds for this purpose, has already been mentioned by the Minister of Finance. It is obvious that the Government cannot allow itself to be influenced by agitation which leads to rash decisions, which may disturb the salary pattern.</li>

<p>Whether any person is entitled to obtain from the Registrar of Births against payment of the appropriate fee an unabridged copy of his of her birth certificate or of that of any minor child or ward; if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_the_interior" to="#murray">

<from>The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:</from>

<p>The Regulations promulgated in terms of the Births, Marriages and Deaths Registration Act provide <i>inter alia</i> that a full birth certificate (i.e. an unabridged birth certificate) shall not be issued unless the issue of such a certificate has been authorized by the Minister of the Interior or an officer authorized thereto by him. In terms of this provision the then Minister of the Interior ruled in 1941, as departmental policy, that full birth certificates shall not be issued to members of the public. If such certificates are of necessity required for purposes of citizenship, passports, visas, inheritance or other legal purposes, the issue thereof will be approved on the condition that they will be forwarded by the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths direct to the authorities concerned and that they will be retained in the records of such offices.

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I said the other day when this debate was started that this appeared to be a rich man&#x2019;s budget, and I think that is largely true. It is certainly true that under the Budget the well-to-do will benefit substantially and the less well-to-do will have to pay more than they are paying at the present time, in order to live as they are now doing. Sir, apart from what one might call conventional adjustments, the hon. the Minister in his Budget speech proposed two major changes dealing with the tax structure. We have had time to examine them and our conclusion is that in principle they have merit but when it comes to the ways proposed by the hon. the Minister to implement them, it is obvious that they are open to very serious criticism, criticism which has already been widely voiced throughout the country since the hon. the Minister spoke. It seems to us that in some respects these proposals are based on quite inadequate information, without full and proper consideration of the burden to be placed upon the great majority of the population, both White and non-White, and without any well-based accurate estimate of the revenue which he expects to derive from them. Furthermore, it seems to us that the Budget, as it was presented, gives no indication as a whole that the Government is applying itself urgently to some of the major problems facing the economy of the country, particularly the growing shortage of skilled manpower and the future of the farming industry. I want therefore to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill because the Government&#x2019;s Budget proposals <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) shift an unreasonable burden of taxation onto the working men and women of South Africa, typifying the Government&#x2019;s growing indifference to the great body of citizens who deserve more consideration; and</li>

<li>(b) fail to grapple with many of South Africa&#x2019;s urgent problems including the shortage of manpower and the plight of the agricultural industry&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s speech falls, I think, into three parts. First of all he gave us a review of the economic position. Secondly he gave figures of the past year&#x2019;s revenue and expenditure and his estimates for the coming year. Thirdly he made proposals for tax reforms. I propose to apply myself particularly to the third part of his speech. The review he gave, of course, is very important because quite obviously it must cover the Minister&#x2019;s approach in framing his Budget and also the approach of a responsible Opposition. The Minister tells us that the economy is buoyant and that he expects it to remain so. He said the balance of payments is satisfactory and he can deal with it. He also said he expected a surplus of R58 million on revenue and a credit balance of R28 million on his Loan Account. On the whole the hon. gentleman gave the House from a fiscal point of view a bright and a promising picture. One might say that he expressed the opinion that from his point of view the climate was set fair. He admitted there are clouds in the sky, the first cloud being, of course, the question of inflation. The Minister said he felt bound to continue the Government&#x2019;s anti-inflationary policy for the present. Provided that is kept flexible we agree that under present circumstances it is unfortunately necessary, especially as the Budget which the hon. the Minister has introduced undoubtedly contains serious inflationary seeds. He is going to put a great deal more money into the hands of income-tax payers which they may or may not spend, and he is imposing new taxes which must affect the cost of living to an unknown degree.</p>

<p>The second cloud is what the Minister called the persistent shortage of skilled labour. There is no indication in this Budget that the Government has any idea of how to cope with this problem. Apart from immigration, the obvious urgent need is for the education and training of the available white manpower. If we look at the Estimates of Expenditure, we find that we are being asked to vote R51 million for Higher Education. That is an increase of R12 million, which seems a lot. But it is not so significant when we compare it with some of the other votes. If we look at the Police Vote, for instance, we find that we are asked to spend not R51 million, but R85&#x00BD; million, an increase of R13 million. Under the Prisons Vote we are asked to spend R25 million, an increase of R3.3 million. In other words, we are being asked to spend R110 million under the Police and Prisons Votes, as against R51 million on Higher Education during the coming year. I suggest that that is not a very encouraging comparison. It gives one food for serious thought as to how seriously the Government is viewing this very urgent problem.</p>

<p>One aspect of the manpower question is the Public Service. The hon. the Minister has made certain proposals in the Budget with regard to the Public Service, but this is really only patchwork dealing with certain aspects of the <span class="col_3519-3520" refersTo="page_0247"/>Public Service and proposing certain steps. But there is no sign whatever of the radical reform that is obviously necessary if the efficiency of the Public Service is to be restored and maintained.</p>

<p>The position is similar in regard to the farming industry. There are certain <i>ad hoc</i> proposals dealing with devaluation and the drought, but there is no indication of longterm planning to restore stability to this vital industry. We will deal with these matters in the course of this debate.</p>

<p>In regard to the Estimates of Expenditure, the Minister is asking to be allowed to spend a total, after the various adjustments in connection with expenditure, of R1,665 million and R1,046 million from Loan Fund, a grand total of R2,711 million for the coming year. We shall discuss the details of that in the course of this debate. When we come to the revenue, the hon. the Minister breaks new ground altogether. He proposes important changes in the tax structure. He points out that direct tax on individuals is only paid by 8 per cent of the total population. Of that 8 per cent, 6 per cent pay two-thirds of the total income tax and 94 per cent pay one-third. Of the total of R356 million which is yielded by individual income tax two-thirds is paid by 6 per cent or 8 per cent of the population. The Minister proposes changes which will reduce his revenue from that source by a total, after various calculations, of R115 million. That includes compensation of the provinces for their loss in income tax. The hon. the Minister thinks that that is too much for the Exchequer to bear and he therefore proposes a 5 per cent surcharge on income tax for this year to reduce the loss. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s aim is to alter the existing balance which is now about 58 per cent to 42 per cent between direct and indirect taxation. We agree that a reasonable shift of the burden of taxation from direct to indirect, especially in view of the figures which I have quoted, is desirable. The hon. the Minister proposes to bring it about firstly by a reduction in the rate and the progression of direct taxes on individuals, and secondly, by broadening the basis of indirect taxation by what he calls, a selective sales duty. Some people might prefer to call it a purchase duty, but that is a matter for discussion. For the purpose of this discussion since the hon. the Minister calls it a sales duty, I shall continue to do so, but that does not mean that I think it is the best term. The hon. the Minister has acted very largely on the first report of the Franzsen Commission. The Franzsen Commission, in making their recommendations, made this point&#x2014;they made it more than once&#x2014;that any change should be made as painless as possible and that the burden on the lower income groups should be as light as possible. I am quite sure that the hon. the Minister will agree with that. When it comes to the selective sales tax the hon. the Minister told us that he proposes to get a R100 million from that source. How the hon. the Minister arrived at that figure, is quite obscure. I doubt very much whether the hon. the Minister will be able to lighten that obscurity in his reply to this debate. The Franzsen Commission, in dealing with this point, say that private consumption expenditure in 1967, excluding food, clothing and services which are excluded in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s proposals as well, amounted to R3,300 million at retail prices presumably. If one makes allowance for the profit margins between manufacturer and consumer, one can take the figure at R2,200 million. Five per cent Overall, tax on that will give the hon. the Minister R110 million. One can go on making estimates throughout this debate and I do not know who will be right when we have finished. I must say that the hon. the Minister has been commendably frank on this subject particularly in an interview he gave when he attended the Rand Show. He gave his views to the Press and I want to quote from what he said during that interview. He said that he cannot say at this stage whether the taxation imposed is too much or too little. He said that if the departments encounter problems which they cannot solve, they will have to come back to his department and they will decide.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>That is a nice way to tax.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>He said that there will be many problems which will be solved in due course. He also said there was some guesswork involved in formulating the new taxation. The Government did not know how it could affect taxation. Lastly he said that they could be out by a certain percentage&#x2014;I must say it would be much better if he said that they would be out by an uncertain percentage &#x2014;and that they would have to see what this percentage was during the course of the year. He did not offer any comment as to how the taxpayer is going to suffer while he is carrying out his experiments. The hon. the Minister will forgive me if I say that this is a very airy-fairy way to approach a major change in the tax structure of the country. One can almost call it a shot in the dark. The hon. the Minister might quote not Ecclesiastes, but Longfellow who said, &#x201C;I shot an arrow in the air, it came to earth I know not where&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear from what the Minister has said, and I think he will concede the point, that these proposals are sketchy and that they are superficially thought out. We on this side of the House are prepared to approve in principle of a selective sales tax as part of the Minister&#x2019;s proposals, but it must be very selective. The imposition and the incidence of such a tax should be carefully worked out, particularly in order to spare as far as possible that section of the population to whom it will simply mean additional taxation and an increase in the cost of living without any benefit from reduced direct taxation because they pay no income tax; this section consists of 92 per cent<span class="col_3521-3522" refersTo="page_0248"/> of the whole population. The White Paper which was laid on the Table says that this tax is to be levied on luxury, semi-luxury and durable goods. Well, Mr. Speaker, we shall deal with that in greater detail in the course of this debate. But for the moment I should like to say that the actual list of duties and taxable goods with which we have been supplied bears little relation to the definition of luxury, semi-luxury and durable goods. Another matter which has been raised by the Franzsen Commission is that when we talk of a taxation rate of 10 or 20 per cent, one has to remember that by the time it gets to the consumer, to the taxpayer, the tax is likely to be 10 instead of 5 per cent, 15 instead of 10 per cent, and 25 instead of 20 per cent. It is quite clear that while these proposals in essence may have merit, they have not been fully worked out. We believe that we should not be expected to accept, and the country should not be expected to accept, them as they have been put before us.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, this is a serious matter affecting the whole population. I agree that it is not sufficient simply to be destructive especially since we do not oppose the principle. We should therefore like to suggest what we think should be done. We wish to be constructive and helpful, and we would like to suggest that, pending the final adjustment of the income tax scales&#x2014;the hon. the Minister gave us reasons why he was unable to fully implement the Commission&#x2019;s report at this stage&#x2014;and pending a thorough examination of how and to what extent the sales tax will be applied, the House and the country should be asked to accept his proposals in principle and that we should regard this year as a year of experiment and research. The hon. the Minister, in his interview at the Rand Show, said that this year would give all the information and experience required.</p>

<p>If we accept that, then the question arises how the Minister is to deal with his present Budget. If I may, I shall deal separately with his Budget and the sales tax proposals. Sir, the Minister requires R1,665 million. Without the sales tax he expects to receive R1,567 million. That leaves him with a deficit of R98 million. To finance this deficit the Minister has at his disposal a surplus of at least R53 million. Then he has a credit balance of R28 million on his Loan Account and a Stabilization Fund of R341 million&#x2014;a total of R422 million, plus the surplus which it has become customary for us to expect. We suggest that during this year of experiment the Minister should apply the surplus of R53 million, then take R10 million from the surplus in his Loan Account and borrow R35 million from the Stabilization Fund as a temporary loan. To us this seems to be a perfectly reasonable proposal, one which is quite safe. The Minister has tremendous reserves at his disposal. As regards the temporary loan from the Stabilization Fund, surely this fund is there for exactly this purpose, i.e. to cusion any sudden change in our taxation system. Consequently, it is in our view quite proper to draw on that fund temporarily when we are dealing with a massive change-over in our tax structure. Such as the Minister now proposes to do. As I say, this would give him a balanced budget and time for a calm, thorough and methodical examination of the sales tax proposals, an examination which certainly has not yet been done up to now.</p>

<p>As far as this sales tax, or purchase tax is concerned, we suggest that the Minister should institute this system by, in the first place, imposing a luxury tax&#x2014;a tax on luxury goods of 15 to 20 per cent&#x2014;plus a minimal tax of, say, 2&#x00BD; per cent on other things, things on a restricted list, very much more carefully selected than the one the Minister has put before us. This should yield enough to enable the Minister to reimburse his Stabilization Fund at the end of the current year. Furthermore, this procedure will give his department, commerce and industries and the consumer public time to solve the many problems to which the hon. the Minister has referred, problems which are cropping up from day to day all over the country, as painlessly as possible. At the present moment everybody are tearing their hair in an endeavour to make head or tail out of the proposals which have been thrown at their heads. It is difficult to imagine anything more painful than the way in which the Minister is going about it. As far as the 2&#x00BD; per cent is concerned, the idea is to enable the system to be put into operation painlessly, because I believe the 2&#x00BD; per cent will almost certainly be absorbed between the manufacturer and the distributor and therefore would be no burden at all to the consumer. I think competition would certainly see to that. The hon. the Minister referred to competition keeping prices down, but when it comes to 15 per cent or 20 per cent or 25 per cent competition cannot be expected to cover the whole of that. But a minimum tax could be imposed without any burden at all on the consumer in the current year while we are making this experiment.</p>

<p>Our proposal, therefore, would give the hon. the Minister a balanced budget without any headaches in regard to taxes at all. It will establish the principle of the sales tax and it will put it into practice as painlessly as possible. It will give him the necessary revenue to reimburse his Stabilization Fund if he wishes to do so. It will give the country time to adjust itself to the new system properly and with much less pain than what the hon. the Minister proposes to do. Lastly, it will put the Minister in a position to frame his budget for next year with far more hope of being reasonably accurate than he has at the present time with this budget.</p>

<p>The only counter argument which I can see being advanced is that the Minister might say that our proposals might lead to inflation. My answer to that would be. first of all, that it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black, <span class="col_3523-3524" refersTo="page_0249"/>because the budget he has introduced is certainly inflationary at both ends, inflationary from the point of view of the large sums he is putting into the hands of the well-to-do and inflationary because it will increase the cost of living to an unknown degree for the great bulk of the consumers in the country. Secondly, the hon. the Minister must remember that quite apart from the sales tax, he is taking R45 million in extra taxation from the people in his budget while the sales tax we propose should bring in at least R50 million. Therefore my reply to the question of inflation is that the risks under our proposal are probably much less than they are under the Minister&#x2019;s budget. In fact, I think that under our proposals the risk is negligible. I believe our proposals would achieve the Minister&#x2019;s purpose and I believe they would be acceptable to the country and I hope very much that he will be prepared to accept them and that he will not hesitate to do the right thing even if it is &#x201C;the devil who is prompting him&#x201D;!</p>

<p>To-day we heard, through the mouth of the hon. member for Constantia, what objections the Opposition have against this Budget. I must say at once that the hon. member for Constantia adopted a responsible attitude. He put forward certain positive suggestions; he was not sharp, but unfortunately I cannot compliment him on having made a tremendous contribution on behalf of the Opposition as far as this Budget is concerned. I also think that his criticism as a whole was, as I shall prove presently, very weak. Sir, the hon. member mentioned the question of a manpower shortage on previous occasions. To-day he himself quoted figures indicating that in respect of higher education alone the Government would be spending over R12.5 million more than had been spent in the previous year. This is almost 30 per cent more than the amount that was spent in 1968 as compared to an average increase of 9 per cent in the 1969-&#x2019;70 expenditure. Can the hon. member mention to me any other Vote in the Estimates which reflects such a major increase&#x003F;</p>

<p>Does the hon. member want to suggest that the Government should have spent much more&#x003F; Whereas the immediate rise is only 9 per cent, the increase is more than three times as much. Can the hon. member still say under these circumstances that the State is not paying enough attention to the question of the manpower shortage&#x003F; Surely, that is not logical.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the agricultural industry. On ever so many occasions we have stated in this House what this Government has done for the agricultural industry, and I am not going to repeat it to-day; I shall leave that to my colleagues, but let me ask the hon. member for Constantia how the agricultural industry did when they were in power. I have before me the information in respect of the average annual rates of growth of the real contribution of the industrial sectors to the gross domestic product for the years 1941-&#x2019;45. Do you know, Sir, what happened to the agricultural industry in those years&#x003F; The contribution of the agricultural industry did not increase; it decreased at an average rate of 1.1 per cent per year. However, under National Party regime there has been an average increase of 3.1 per cent in the real contribution to the gross domestic product, not a decrease. Under National Party regime the contribution of the agricultural industry to the total national income showed an increase of almost 25 per cent in 1967, and in 1968, despite the fact that in certain years there was a decrease owing to droughts, over which the Government does of course have no control, a high level of production was nevertheless maintained. Does that side of the House therefore have the right to say that the Government is neglecting the agricultural industry&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the Government was not tackling the problem of a manpower shortage, in the Public Service. Surely, the hon. member knows better than that. The hon. the Minister calculated that the concessions he had made would cost the country R100 million per year over the next few years. The Government has also made provision for cheaper housing. Has the hon. member taken the trouble to calculate what a decrease of 2 per cent or 2&#x00BD; per cent in the interest charges would mean in the case of a house which costs R10,000&#x003F; If the hon. member worked that out, he would see what a tremendous concession the Government is making to public servants. Provision has also been made for better conditions relating to pensions. I want to ask the hon. member whether the past few years were the only years during which the Public Service has experienced staff problems&#x003F; I could quote to him what was said in 1945 and also what was said in 1950 before the relevant select committee on the Public Service (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Resignations are still taking place and the Public Service Commission is not in a position to fill the vacancies.</block>

<p>Suitable temporary officials could not be found either. As far back as 1950 they were also talking about this serious staff problem in the Public Service in general. We know that the problem is a serious one, but this Government is definitely paying attention to it. As time goes by more and more attention will be paid to making the Public Service as a career more attractive to its people.</p>

<p>I should like to say this in connection with the Budget. It is significant that in its 21st year <span class="col_3525-3526" refersTo="page_0250"/>of being in power it is possible for the National Party to present such a structurally changed budget. Basically the whole country accepts the structure of the Budget, including the hon. member for Constantia and the whole Opposition. Is this not telling proof of a virile Party&#x003F; Does this have no significance&#x003F; Is this not a sign of refreshing, original thinking&#x003F; The National Party, after being in power for 21 years, is not out of date. A party which has governed for such a long time and is still new in its thinking, will continue to govern. This is the reason why we have already been in power for 21 years and will still be in power for at least 21 years.</p>

<p>This Budget can be described as a renaissance in the history of budgets in South Africa. In assessing a budget such as this one, one can approach it from several angles, especially from the functional angle, and I should like to refer to that. I want to refer to the expenditure, to the extent of the expenditure and to the priorities of expenditure. Secondly, I want to refer to the revenue and also the extent thereof, as well as the priorities. Thirdly, I want to refer to the most important aspect, and that is where the Opposition fails. They think we are still living in the times of 21 years ago; they are still living in the olden times as far as economic life is concerned, not in modern times. To-day the primary function of a budget is to give direction to the economic and financial life of a country, and that is the basis of this Budget. That is what the Opposition fail to appreciate; that is where they are making a mistake. This accusation of theirs, i.e. that this is allegedly a rich man&#x2019;s budget, proves to us to what extent they are making a mistake, as I shall indicate later on. This Budget represents a major structural change and we accept it, but it is necessary because we must have regard to the structural change which has taken place in the economic life of South Africa, a change which has principally been brought about by the National Party. It was said here that this Budget was a rich man&#x2019;s budget and figures in respect of inflation were quoted here, but I shall prove later that this is not a rich man&#x2019;s budget. I do not understand the hon. member for Constantia. He maintains that the Budget is inflationary on both sides, but I can point out many things which the Government has done and which are anti-inflationary. There is the purchase tax on durable goods and on luxury class articles which is an anti-inflationary measure, especially because there has been a substantial increase of more than 12 per cent in the consumption of durable consumer goods over the past year.</p>

<p>A tax has been levied on the spending of money, which will bring about a saving. Large amounts have been withdrawn from the liquid market, so that R341 million has been frozen. The Opposition itself said that all these steps were anti-inflationary. The Opposition itself said the Government collected an additional R30.6 million in taxes from the public. This is anti-inflationary. In the past six consecutive quarters the Government conducted its financing in a disinflationary manner, according to the Reserve Bank report. This system of taxation will bring about increased productivity, and that is what hon. members opposite debated at such length. They asked for a system which would bring about increased productivity. The hon. member for Constantia himself said that higher taxation hampered productivity. This is one of the reasons which they advanced for their wanting a reduction in taxation for the higher and middle income groups. This was their plea, because, as they said, it did not stimulate initiative and productivity sufficiently. Now they are opposed to it in their speeches. The hon. member says that the Government should use the 1968-&#x2019;69 surplus of R58 million instead of levying additional taxes. Is that not inflationary at this stage&#x003F; Why do hon. members contradict themselves to such an extent&#x003F; No, Sir, this Government will not do that, because the poor man and the worker will be prejudiced. It would increase the cost of living.</p>

<p>Let us take a closer look at the story of a &#x201C;rich man&#x2019;s budget&#x201D;. It has already been said that 90 per cent of the population pays 41 per cent of the taxes; 9.2 per cent pays 35 per cent, and 0.8 per cent pays 24 per cent. According to the Franzsen Commission the tax concessions affect all groups: those under R5,000 between R5,000 and R14,000, and above R14,000. To what extent are they being affected&#x003F; Those under R5,000 receive 29 per cent of the tax concessions, the middle group 42 per cent and the topmost group 29 per cent. Is this not proof of a reasonable, proportionate distribution of concessions, especially if regard is had to the fact that that side of the House has so often said that the rich man and the middle man were being taxed too heavily&#x003F; But the Government has gone further than that. If hon. members were to analyze the recommendations of the Franzsen Commission, they would see that the Government&#x2019;s concessions are even more favourable to the lower income groups than was recommended by the Franzsen Commission, because the Government is duly taking that into account.</p>

<p>The other point is that the taxation still remains progressive as far as the higher income groups are concerned. Only the undesirable and excessively high progression has been removed. There has also been a higher incidence of tax avoidance, as the Franzsen Commission also found, particularly amongst those groups, bodies and persons who pay a higher marginal scale of taxation. They sought all kinds of methods for avoiding taxation. Those loopholes have now been plugged through the tax on undistributed profits, which has also been made applicable to public companies whose income consists largely of dividends <span class="col_3527-3528" refersTo="page_0251"/>received of other companies. Do hon. members know what the effects of this are&#x003F; The majority of the larger companies are owned by well-off people. In the first instance, that company pays 40 per cent of the taxation. The remaining 60 per cent is distributed between dividends and the ploughback of profits. Those dividends are paid out to the other companies, which are often bent on avoiding taxation. They are now being forced to distribute at least 75 per cent of those dividends. If they do not do so, they will pay tax on them. If they are distributed, those dividends, in the hands of the persons who receive them, can be taxed to a maximum of 60 per cent. Therefore the production company pays 40 per cent of the taxation whereas a marginal maximum of 60 per cent is payable on 75 per cent of the dividends. Therefore you can see, Sir, that it may eventually mean that 80 per cent would be paid as a result of the measure the Government is taking now. Does that look like a rich man&#x2019;s budget to you, Sir&#x003F; In addition I want to point out that the purchase tax is mainly, although not exclusively, applicable to luxuries and durable consumer commodities. If you analyze the position, Sir, you will find that this tax is mainly applicable to goods falling in this category. I expect that in the days that lie ahead hon. members opposite will come forward with smaller and less important items day after day and hour after hour, but they will not tell us by what these goods should be replaced.</p>

<p>I have already said that the suggestions you put forward would have an inflationary effect and are therefore unacceptable to us. It would prejudice the value of the rand further, and this while hon. members opposite are the very persons who have recently had a great deal to say about inflation and its adverse effects. In spite of that they come forward here with proposals which would have the effect of stimulating inflation.</p>

<p>Under this Government employees have been much better off, particularly over the last few years. Salaries and wages, as a percentage of our national income, have risen considerably. In 1960 this was 60.6 per cent of the total national income, and in 1968 it was 63.4 per cent. As against that the profits of companies have shown a downward trend. Over the past five years there has been a decline of 11 per cent in the net profits of industrial enterprises, expressed as a percentage of the total share-holders&#x2019; funds. As regards gold mines there was a decline of 6 per cent, and in the case of coal mines it was 32 per cent. Does this look like a rich man&#x2019;s government to you, Sir&#x003F; Is this a rich man&#x2019;s government if salaries and wages as a percentage of the national income have risen and profits have declined, as I have now indicated here&#x003F; Sir, to level an accusation such as this one at this Government, cannot be considered reasonable, surely. We claim that this Budget is bringing major benefits to the average person. After all, this is what the United Party also asked for, not so&#x003F; To-day there is no longer any mention of the &#x201C;tax bulge&#x201D;. And was this tax bulge not to the detriment of the average person in particular&#x003F; And what about those in the lower income groups&#x003F; It is in regard to this group that the United Party has objections against the Budget. As the Minister said, a Budget such as this one cannot be painless. Such a structural change cannot be painless. Therefore there will be problems. Hon. members opposite laughed when the Minister said that, but where does one find such a major change without pains&#x003F; Even the United Party&#x2019;s own newspapers sang the praises of this Budget. The <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> for instance, called it a &#x201C;bold&#x201D; budget. They say that this is a good Budget and that the Minister was brave to dare to undertake such a change.</p>

<p>This Budget has raised the starting-point for normal taxation. The starting-point for a married person with two children used to be R1,851; now it is R2,143. The revenue value of rebates on the lowest levels for a second child was R438; now it is R559. The additional tax on an income of R2,500 is only R2, purchase tax having been taken into account. And then the other side of the House refers to a &#x201C;rich man&#x2019;s budget&#x201D;. Do they know that on an income of R2,000 a concession of 53 per cent has been made, the biggest concession&#x003F; That is higher than the concessions in the case of any other income group. Does this look like a rich man&#x2019;s budget&#x003F;</p>

<p>Apart from these there are better social services to the lower income groups&#x2014;subsidies, pension benefits, and so forth. In order to keep the cost of living down, subsidies will amount to almost R60 million this year. In addition further benefits have been granted to working wives, especially to those in the lower income groups, to those wives who have to work as a result of the meagre income of the breadwinner. Is this a rich man&#x2019;s budget&#x003F; Eighty-five per cent of a family&#x2019;s budget is exempt from purchase tax. But the most significant benefits which this Budget brings to those in the lower income groups, are not direct benefits, but indirect benefits. They will, for instance, stimulate greater savings as well as increased productivity. They will also create more lucrative opportunities for work&#x2014;all of this to the benefit of those in the lower income groups. In addition these benefits will lead to have the effect that less use will have to be made of excessive&#x2014;I emphasize &#x201C;excessive&#x201D; &#x2014;monetary measures such as excessive credit restriction and high rates of interest. In future the Government will be able to make more extensive use of the purchase tax as an instrument <span class="col_3529-3530" refersTo="page_0252"/>for bringing about economic stabilization. Who benefits by this&#x003F;&#x2014;it is mainly those who are in the lower income groups who will benefit by this. Before I proceed to my next point, I should just like to give the House an indication of the purchase tax which exists in other countries. I am doing this so that hon. members may see how fair the taxation is here in South Africa. In Britain, for instance, there is a tax of 12&#x00BD; per cent on household requirements; 20 per cent on ice-cream, soft drinks and pastry; 33&#x2153; per cent on motor cars, motor cycles, refrigerators, washing machines, and so forth. On luxuries and less essential goods, such as furs, jewels, gold and silver watches, the tax is 50 per cent. In France there is a tax on basic products, such as milk, food and agricultural products. The tax on these is 6 per cent. On wines, gas, electricity, passenger transport, and so forth, the tax is 13 per cent, and on the rest it is 16.6 per cent. On radios, motor cars and tobacco there is a tax of 20 per cent. In Canada there is a basic tax of 12 per cent plus a retail sales tax of 12 per cent in the provinces. That brings the total tax to 24 per cent. In most countries a purchase tax is levied on the basic necessities of the average family. In South Africa, on the other hand, 85 per cent of the average family budget is being excluded. Is that not fair&#x003F; Where does the story of a rich man&#x2019;s budget come in now&#x003F;</p>

<p>Reference was also made to the Bantu community. It was calculated that the total effect of this purchase tax on a Bantu person would be R9 per year. One of the greatest problems of this country is that such a small percentage of its population has to contribute towards the funds of the State for the purpose of maintaining the machinery of State and providing essential services to the community. This is one of our greatest problems. In 1929-&#x2019;30 only R6.5 million was collected in taxes from the Bantu. As against that the total amount spent was R4.3 million&#x2014;in other words, the percentage of taxes collected in relation to the expenditure was 151 per cent. Less was spent than was collected in taxes. In 1964-&#x2019;65, according to the Africa Institute, the total amount of taxes collected was R38.7 million. The total amount spent came to R215 million. In other words, the taxes represented only 17.7 per cent of what was spent. If there has ever been proof which could invalidate any argument advanced by the Opposition in respect of this small sales tax on a large percentage of the non-White population, then it is these figures. In some way or other the whole country has to make a contribution towards keeping the machinery of state going and providing and maintaining basic services. If we cannot accept the Opposition&#x2019;s recommendation, i.e. to finance in an inflationary manner by making use of that surplus and by confining the purchase tax to a limited number of commodities, it would mean that the Government would have had to impose a very heavy tax on a number of commodities. The Minister will also point out that, for obvious reasons, he cannot do that. Instead of an income-tax bulge, we would then have had a purchase tax bulge. We would then merely have exchanged one bulge for another. But if we do not do this, we would have to incur debts in order to meet the expenditure. Then we would have another bulge, namely a debt bulge.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to point out to the Opposition how considerable their debts were while they were in power. In 1938 the public debt amounted to 70.4 per cent of the net national income. In 1948 it had increased to 71.6 per cent. Last year, in 1968, in 20 years&#x2019; time, it had dropped to 46.2 per cent. When that side of the House was in power they did not only impose heavy taxes, but also taxed all future generations very heavily. This Government lightened that burden considerably. Sir, this Budget is not a rich man&#x2019;s budget. It is a budget for all layers of the population. The direct effect of this Budget, particularly as far as those in the lower income groups are concerned, is worth much more than is the purchase tax on certain goods.</p>

<p>Nor is this Government a rich man&#x2019;s government. It has proved over the years that it is a government for the workers. It is also a government for those in the lower income groups, because those people form the foundations of our whole economic life. But the Government also believes that, after Caesar has been rendered his due, it should not tax the enterprising type of person too heavily. It should also create opportunities for increased productivity, because the entrepreneur is to a very large extent the person who has to take the initiative in developing the country economically. That is the basis of our system of private initiative, which lays the foundation for our whole economic life. We must not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. We must see to it that she also gets her just share. But we must also see to it that the rest i.e. the workers, get their share directly and especially indirectly. This Budget, which is a mirror of the country&#x2019;s finances, reflects a very favourable sign of the recent past. It reflects the virile economic strength of our country. It also reflects, as far as the near future is concerned, an even more glorious epoch than the one this country has experienced under 21 years of National Party regime.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Florida was at a disadvantage this afternoon because he spent his time answering a speech the hon. member for Constantia did not make. The direction taken by the hon. member for Constantia was not anticipated by him and so he made his speech criticizing a line which was never taken during the course of that speech. I must remind the House that it is that hon. member for Florida who a year ago, when we criticized the bulge and advised the Minister to smooth out the taxation curve, criticized us severely, but now that the Minister <span class="col_3531-3532" refersTo="page_0253"/>has done so, he has changed his line. Only a month or so ago in the debate on the Part Appropriation Bill further criticism came from that hon. member. Now he has gone back to 1945, but what we are concerned with to-day is the young man who is about to get married and who has to face the future. It is no good talking to him about the 1945 budget. What he wants to know is what he must now pay for his furniture and his stove and all his household necessities. Those are the root matters of this budget which the hon. member for Florida has failed to answer.</p>

<p>He has failed to answer the criticism of the hon. member for Constantia in regard to the sales tax. We supported the reduction of direct taxation and we agree with the principle of the sales tax, or rather the purchase tax, which is probably a better name. The Minister has made a revolutionary change in his policy by changing the incidence of taxation. He has lowered direct taxation and he has increased indirect taxation. We will have an opportunity later of discussing these items in detail and I am quite sure that other hon. members will go through this list of articles item by item and show how unfair the burden of this taxation is on certain members of the community. We recognize that the budget is the Minister&#x2019;s weapon for shaping economic policy and thus influencing all sections of the community. The hon. member for Florida has said that. The budget has an influence on the growth of the national economy by altering the distribution of income among the taxpayers.</p>

<p>For several years now we have advocated taxation reform and we are indebted to the Franzsen Commission for its report. I think both sides can join in congratulating the Franzsen Commission on a report which was well done and thoroughly done, but we will hear from the Minister later to what extent he proposes to follow the advice given by the Franzsen Commission in regard to matters with which he has not dealt in his Budget speech. As I said, the Minister&#x2019;s change of policy is based on the first report of this commission of inquiry, and while in general terms the Minister has followed the advice given in the report, there is much with which we can disagree. I should like to know from the Minister whether, following the advice of the Franzsen Commission, he intends to take away from the provinces the right of taxation, as was recommended in that report. That is an important matter and the Minister was silent on these matters during the course of his Budget speech. We are interested to hear from the Minister what his policy is in regard to that recommendation. The Franzsen Commission said on page 7 of its report that if the bulge were removed its removal would result in a loss of approximately R60 million and it went on to say that although this concession would partially benefit those with incomes falling within this bulge, it would also provide some measure of relief to taxpayers with an income above R14,000. Those were the tax payers to whom the hon. member for Florida was probably referring.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida has not yet satisfied this House that this budget does not help to make the rich man richer and the poor man poorer. That point he has not yet answered. This view was expressed by the Franzsen Commission and it further confirms our attitude last year particularly when we asked for the removal of the bulge. Had the Minister accepted our advice last year, he would have sacrificed revenue to the tune of R60 million but he would not have had a R58 million surplus because he would have had a balanced budget, roughly speaking. The R58 million which is the surplus for this year as announced in his Budget speech, would almost have balanced the R60 million he would have lost by removing the bulge. So the public has been overtaxed during the last 12 months to the tune of R60 million, which could have been avoided had the Minister foreseen the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s report. We foresaw it. We recommended it last year, and in now accepting the advice of the Franzsen Commission the Minister is actually accepting our advice.</p>

<p>It is clear that not only were we right in giving the Minister that advice, but the Minister should have given this concession last year. [Interjections.] The budget showed the largest surplus for many years and apart from transferring the surplus to Loan Account, he has built up, at the expense of the ratepayers, a substantial stabilization fund. We have had many years of overtaxation by this Minister and his predecessor. In the light of the report of the Franzsen Commission, in so far as it affects last year, there is no doubt about it that the Minister should have removed the bulge last year.</p>

<p>But the recommendations of the Franzsen Commission go further. The report says that private domestic consumption, with the exception of food, clothing, footwear, the cost of housing and certain health expenditure and certain excisable goods, should be the basis of the sales tax. It is obvious that in making a change of policy the Minister has had to give consideration to the question of secrecy. That is his difficulty. He has had to give consideration to the question of secrecy and so he has had to keep this information within a very small circle. That is why we have a list which was hurriedly compiled and with which the public finds difficulty, and not only the public but the Department itself is finding itself in difficulty. There is no doubt that the items on the list have been hurriedly compiled and that there is an incidence of taxation which goes beyond the recommendations of the Franzsen Commission.</p>

<p><span class="col_3533-3534" refersTo="page_0254"/>In the short term, despite what the hon. member for Florida said, this budget is inflationary, and for the hon. member to suggest that it is anti-inflationary is ludicrous. In my view any item which has the effect of increasing the cost of living is inflationary and it needs very little imagination after examining the list of items covered by the sales tax to see that the cost of living will be increased. I have with me a document showing goods cleared since the tax was inflicted. If the Minister will refer to page 10 of his explanatory memorandum, he will find that the value for sales duty purposes of such goods imported into the Republic will be the free on board price or the domestic value, whichever yields a higher amount of sales duty, plus 15 per cent of such price.</p>

<p>This is the way the Customs are dealing with the matter. They take the value for duty purposes of a particular item of goods which comes within the framework of the definition at R248 plus customs duty of R37.20. That is the ordinary customs duty to which this item is subject, and then to calculate the sales levy they take R248 plus 15 per cent, namely R37.20 plus the customs duty of R37.20. So it is not 10 per cent on the home consumption value. It is 10 per cent on the home consumption value, plus 15 per cent. So the price of this item, which had a value of R248 for duty purposes, when it gets to the importer&#x2019;s warehouse, is not increased by 10 per cent but by 13 per cent. And this is a document stamped by the customs and cleared on 28th March. This is the tax to the importer; we have not got to the consumer yet. That has still to come. That is why I say that any item which increases the cost of living is inflationary. On the other hand the effect of the budget on the middle and other income groups will be to encourage productivity, since there is now an incentive which had been virtually killed by the incidence of the previous rates of taxation. As the Franszen Report says, the rates of tax were so high that the incentive was not there and schemes for tax avoidance were increasing every year to the embarrassment of the Minister.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that some eight years ago when Sweden revised her system of taxation and spread the taxation so that the burden of direct taxation was eased and that of indirect taxation was increased, a meticulous and careful study was made of the effect of taxation at all levels. Consideration was given to the effect on rents, wages and salaries so that as far as possible the change in direction had the effect of spreading the burden equitably over all sections of the community. There was not the opportunity to do this here, or the Minister did not do it, and if the Minister will accept the advice of the hon. member for Constantia he will have a year in which to try out the system. The hon. member for Constantia has made a good case and we could possibly learn from what has been done in Sweden. The Minister can also learn from the hon. member for Constantia, as he has learned from advice that we have given him in the past.</p>

<p>I am informed that a new tax in Madagascar has produced a sudden rise in prices which the Government has so far been unable to control. On 1st January of this year wholesalers were ordered to pay a 12 per cent tax on all sales. The result, which nobody seems to have foreseen, has been a sharp rise in the price of luxury goods, cars, clothes, imported foods, petrol and gas. The Government has declared the rise illegal and an army of tax officials has been despatched to try to trap people who have tried to use the new tax as an excuse to put up the prices.</p>

<p>Under the Minister&#x2019;s present proposals he is giving with the one hand and taking with the other, and in the taking process he asks the public to contribute an additional R30 million for the current year. In my opinion, the estimate for sales tax is a gross underestimate and next year will prove whether my opinion is right or wrong. I was right last year when I predicted a surplus of R50 million for this past year; I was only out by eight million and I did not have the Minister&#x2019;s facilities for estimating revenue. I am sure that the rate of taxation and the wide choice of items is such that the public will have to bear a substantial burden of over-taxation during the coming year, a burden which they would not be called upon to bear if the Minister had made less onerous impositions of indirect taxes. One presumes that the object of the taxation proposals was to assist the Minister in his fight against inflation. Long-term the sales tax may be deflationary but short-term it is inflationary. The tax will be added to the importers&#x2019; costs or to the manufacturers&#x2019; costs.</p>

<p>For example, an article which had a &#x201C;markup&#x201D; of 33&#x2153; per cent prior to the sales tax would be charged out by the importer or manufacturer at 100 cents. The retailer would add 33&#x2153; per cent and would sell the article at 133&#x2153; cents or more likely, in round figures, 135 cents. Now, after the sales tax, the article would be costed at 100 cents; the sales tax of 20 per cent will be added and the retailer would be charged 120 cents; to this he will add the same mark-up of 331 per cent, i.e. 40 cents, and the public will be charged 160 cents. Thus, on this simple example the public will face an increase of not 20 cents but 261 cents.</p>

<p>It appears that in his choice of change of direction the Minister is tending to abandon fiscal control for monetary control. If that is his policy, then we would have expected him to have had a tighter monetary control than was demonstrated in the past year.</p>

<p>The Minister in his Budget speech said that, excluding agriculture, the gross national product, after adjustment for price changes, increased at the rate of approximately 6 per cent. If one examines the statistics for the past year, one sees that the amount of money and <span class="col_3535-3536" refersTo="page_0255"/>near-money has increased substantially more than 6 per cent&#x2014;I think the Minister said in his Budget speech that it had increased by 21 per cent. One is entitled to ask the Minister whether he has abandoned former methods of control and intends to rely entirely on monetary control. The Minister has referred to the activity in the share market and the property market in the course of his Budget speech. One cannot help but gain the impression that some people in the market have not only discounted the future but I think they have discounted the hereafter as well. The increase in liquidity and the effect of taxation on the lower income groups provide the necessary ingredients, short-term, for projecting a new inflationary move in the economy. We have already had evidence of this, Sir. If you go to various factories in some of our cities in South Africa you already find that the lower income groups are demanding increased wages. I have in mind one particular factory where there has been a request for increased wages. This company has a committee system under which it keeps in touch with the leaders amongst its wage earners to ascertain the views of the workers. They were told only recently that it would be essential within the next month or two to give all their Bantu workers an additional R1 per week. As far as this company is concerned, it will cost them something like R331,000. The Bantu people who are making these representations have indicated which items in their daily budget have gone up in price. The increased sales tax will result in demands by labour for increases in wages. In view of the demand for labour and the buoyancy of the economy, despite hard bargaining, despite labour negotiations, and despite the fact that the non-European has no bargaining power as he has no organization with which to bargain, the pressure will be maintained and the request for an improvement in wages and salaries will probably be met, because most employers in commerce and industry recognize that stability of labour is essential for economic growth. If they think that the demand is reasonable, they will meet the demand rather than run the risk of strikes. Talking about strikes, we know that only last week there was a strike of Bantu dock workers in Durban. We do not want an increase in strikes, particularly amongst the Bantu workers, because those strikes are generally put down by the police.</p>

<p>We will thus find that the cost structure will rise, and the increase in the cost structure will encourage still further demands in the higher income brackets until such time as there is a resistance to price rises, first on the export market and later in the internal market. There is a possibility that a resistance to price rises may come earlier if the sales tax plus the added mark-up reaches a figure which the public is not prepared to pay. The market may be saturated to such an extent that it will start first in the export market, and people importing from South Africa will find that the cost structure rises so severely that there will be resistance, but that will be transferred later to the internal market. The result of the announcement of the sales tax so far has been mixed in consequence. In some quarters there has been confusion; in others the opportunity has been taken to push sales at pre-taxed prices&#x2014;we have seen advertisements in the Press announcing that goods will be sold in particular shops at pre-taxed prices&#x2014;and in other cases the opportunity has been taken to exploit the public, not in the leading shops but in some of the smaller shops. The Minister counters this by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A sales duty that is levied at an early sales stage, as proposed, has the disadvantage that a profit percentage is sometimes added to the tax by commerce so that the retail price eventually rises by more than the amount of the tax. It can be expected that competition in the trade will combat this tendency, but nevertheless my colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, will keep a close watch on unfair price increases.</block>

<p>Our comment is this: Will he and how will he do it&#x003F; Sir, I hope the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs will listen now because this concerns him. I do not question the good intentions of the Minister, but he knows to where good intentions pave the way! The Minister of Finance has an inadequate staff to collect direct taxation and I submit that the Minister of Economic Affairs is in a still worse position to administer price control. I wonder how many members the Minister of Economic Affairs has on his price control staff&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I have a question on the Order Paper and the Minister has conveniently postponed his answer. A few days ago I put a question to the Minister of Finance asking how many posts there were for assessors in the Department of Inland Revenue, how many were filled by permanent staff, how many by temporary staff and how many were vacant. The reply showed that barely 60 per cent of the posts of assessors were filled by permanent staff and that nearly 20 per cent of the posts were vacant. Either taxes which should be collected are not being collected or the collection is being delayed or the staff in the Minister&#x2019;s Department are being grossly overworked. If this is the state of affairs in the Department of Inland Revenue, which is primarily responsible for collecting direct taxation, what is going to be the position with price control&#x003F; There will be thousands of investigations. Many people will submit complaints, and the further you get away from Pretoria the more complaints there will be. It will not be so difficult to exercise control in Pretoria and Cape Town, but how <span class="col_3537-3538" refersTo="page_0256"/>is the Minister going to ensure that fair prices are charged after the introduction of the sales tax&#x003F; I am afraid he will be a watchdog without teeth. He can growl and not bite and the public will soon find out. The hon. the Minister knows that price control, even with a substantial staff, is very difficult to administer. During the war years price control was administered to a certain extent, but even then we had the assistance of many hundreds of voluntary workers in commerce and industry. These men were prepared to give their time to help the Government in administering that very important task. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s staff is very small. I have asked a question, and I have a very shrewd idea as to what the answer will be. How the hon. the Minister is going to administer price control to take care of the sales tax increases is difficult to understand.</p>

<p>I have in the time available dealt with some aspects of the tax proposals and their effect on inflation. I now come to the problem of inflation which we have inherited from the past as a direct result of Government policy. For several years we have criticized the Government severely for the inflation and the effect it has had in reducing the value of the rand. This is the real test. The general public does not understand the word inflation, but they do know that the rand buys less to-day than it did last year or the year before. After this year one will be able to buy even less with a rand. This year our arguments have been confirmed by the First Report of the Franzsen Commission. On page 4, paragraph 18, of the Report the Commission reports as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the basis of evidence and observation, the Commission is of the opinion that during a period of overspending a particularly large part of any increase in income taxation is paid out of savings rather than consumption. The more progressive the rates, the more pronounced this effect becomes. This means that a tax increase with a view to the financing of larger Government expenditures might actually have a strong inflationary effect both on the side of costs in the form of new wage demands, and on the expenditure side, because a larger volume of Government expenditure is added to a volume of consumption expenditure without the latter being essentially reduced by the tax. A tax increase would lead, namely, to a shifting of a portion of the savings of the private sector to the public sector without necessarily decreasing the level of spending in the private sector correspondingly. Other disadvantages of high progressive rates are the discouraging effect they have on work effort on the one hand and the encouraging of tax avoidance on the other.</block>

<p>I am sure the hon. the Minister has read this paragraph of the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s report. It confirms completely what we have said on the Government&#x2019;s tax policy over the past few years and the effect it has had on inflation. So here we face the fact that the Government is directly responsible for the inflation which is consuming the earnings of the people. To the inflation caused by the Government policy, we also have to add the problem of the large inflow of capital&#x2014;which also promotes inflation&#x2014;due to the world-wide uncertainty in currencies. The hon. the Minister said it was also a testament of foreign confidence in South Africa. If this is so and the hon. the Minister is satisfied that it is so, why is he hesitant about relaxing exchange control&#x003F; If he has some doubts as to the wisdom of relaxing exchange control, then surely he must concede that the net capital inflow may not be due to foreign confidence in the country, long term, but due to overseas finance wishing to get the temporary benefit from movement of funds to this country so as to avoid pressures in their own country. Is this not the real reason&#x003F; If this is not the real reason there is no case for not easing exchange control. I do not doubt that there is considerable overseas confidence in South Africa, but the hon. the Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot claim a testament of foreign confidence in the country when he feels that a relaxation of exchange control will result in the flight of funds. I know that it is very difficult to measure what funds come into the country as a result of world-wide uncertainty in, currencies and that it is purely guess work, like the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s guess as far as tax is concerned. It is also very difficult to measure what funds have come in on the basis of long-term investment, but I think a case can be made for allowing South African industrialists to invest on a selective basis outside South Africa, particularly in neighbouring African countries to the mutual benefit of both. When we see from the Reserve Bank figures that money and near-money have increased by 21 per cent, then there is ample evidence that inflation has not been contained, and we must recognize the excess liquidity which is noticeable in the financial sector.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that there are warning signs of renewed inflation. What is he going to do about it&#x003F; On his own spending programme he shows a 10 per cent increase. The printed estimates provide for R1,602 million on Revenue which is R147 million more than the revised figures for 1968 and 1969. This is an increase of more than 10 per cent on national expenditure for the current year, when the gross national product has only increased by six per cent. How can the hon. the Minister justify an increase of 10 per cent on national expenditure when the gross national product has only increased by six per cent&#x003F; He still calls upon us to contain inflation. If the Prime Minister addresses the people over the radio and asks the people to save and this is the example he gives, namely to increase national expenditure by 10 per cent when the gross national product has only increased <span class="col_3539-3540" refersTo="page_0257"/>by six per cent and the man in the street has to follow in the same pattern in the climate of his spending, there is only disaster at the end of the road. If the Minister advocates caution&#x2014;and he does so in his Budget speech&#x2014;it is time that he should set the example. I submit that an example is better than precept and the onus is upon the hon. the Minister to set the example for the country. While the hon. the Minister may be congratulated on making an attempt to reform taxation procedure, his Budget has failed to contain the fires of inflation about which we are so concerned. We have made constructive proposals which will give the hon. the Minister an opportunity to reconsider his whole programme with regard to the sales tax. While he has given an incentive to the White worker to work harder, he has done little for the Bantu whose earnings are in general far too low compared with the White worker. He has imposed a sales tax which indicates a hurried random selection of items which gives an unfair distribution of the tax burden. It is a patchwork budget and we feel that the constructive proposals made by the hon. member for Constantia should be given very serious consideration by the hon. the Minister. We will give the hon. the Minister time to tidy up his Budget, to get over the experimentation period and to do something constructive. He has introduced a revolutionary method and is trying to do everything at once. We feel that in his own interests and in those of the country, this is a matter over which time should be taken.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened to a great many speeches made by the hon. member for Pinetown and the hon. member for Constantia in the course of Budget debates. I have seldom found so many examples of contradiction as I found this afternoon.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Pinetown are very concerned that the public will be exploited with the introduction of sales tax. They are of the opinion that dealers will add more to the price of goods than the 5, 10 or 20 per cent sales tax being levied. In the same breath, however, the hon. member for Constantia stated that if the sales tax had been only 2&#x00BD; per cent, trade and industry would have absorbed it and the public would not have paid more for goods. In other words, the traders would not have added more to the price of goods than the amount of the tax. If this tax were 5 per cent, however, according to the member, the traders and the industrialists would suddenly not bear the percentage themselves, but would add the 5 per cent tax to the price of the goods which would then have to be borne by the public. Have hon. members on the opposite side lost all faith in the power of the market mechanism&#x003F; Are they quite socialistically orientated to-day&#x003F; Do they no longer believe in the powerful operation of the market mechanism in keeping prices low&#x003F; Do they no longer believe that competition will result in the public not being exploited&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs will not need a plethora of officials to apply price control. I believe that the power of the market mechanism of free competition will fulfil this function and will make sure that no more than the required tax percentage will be added. The hon. member for Pinetown came forward here and read out paragraph 18 of the Franzsen Commission report to us, and tried to imply that it was the Government&#x2019;s fault that this country had experienced so much inflation. Because, as he said, if we had ironed out the tax bulge in the past we would not have had this measure of inflation. But this Budget does iron out that tax bulge, and yet the hon. member still states that this Budget is inflationistic. Do hon. members opposite not realize that this sales tax, together with an increase of 5, 10 or 20 per cent, as the case may be, will also have a curbing effect on the demand and will therefore work in the opposite direction to inflation&#x003F;</p>

<p>I listened attentively to what the two hon. members have just had to say. On the analogy of the Minister who quoted several times from Ecclesiastes, I also thought of a proverb of the Preacher&#x2014;&#x201C;Answer not a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit&#x201D;. But because I do not want to insult the hon. member for Pinetown and the hon. member for Constantia in this way, I looked for another suitable proverb. Then the following proverb from another Preacher came to my mind: &#x201C;How long halt ye between two opinions&#x003F; Choose to-day whom you would serve.&#x201D; The same applies to the hon. Opposition. How long are they going to halt between two opinions&#x003F; On the one hand they would so much like to champion the cause of the working man and woman, and they would so much like to look after the interests of the poor man. On the other hand, however, they plead for the accommodation of the middle and higher income groups. Of course, I have no fault to find with that. I have no fault to find with their advocating that the bulge be ironed out. In fact, I advocated that myself. As recently as 26th February, I referred to the professional man who was no longer working to full capacity. It no longer paid him to do so because he had to pay too much tax. That is why I have no fault to find with the fact that the hon. the Opposition put in a plea for these middle and higher income groups. After all, a large percentage of these people within the R5,000 per year and higher income group are in a position to choose whether they want to work harder or not, whether or not they want to work harder in order to earn more. That is why I also advocated that this bulge be ironed out. I want the Opposition to adopt a clear standpoint to-day and state whom they would serve. They must no longer halt between two opinions. There are things we want clarified. Perhaps their attitude is attributable to the fact that they have been in opposition for so <span class="col_3541-3542" refersTo="page_0258"/>long that they have for that reason completely lost or allowed to deteriorate the positive approach of a governing party. That is why they are always on the lookout for a few miserable votes for their party. However, the Opposition must take care that they do not, for the sake of the votes of a few aggrieved people, or for the sake of a little political gain, destroy the prosperity of our Republic. It is our economic prosperity and our ability to buy and to pay in the world markets that guarantees our safety. The Afro-Asian countries make no secret of it at the U.N. that they do not think they will be able to get at us, because the Western countries will not take steps against us, and the Western countries will not take steps against us, because we are good trading partners. Our prosperity is our strength and our guarantee against irresponsible attacks on us, and that is why I want, once again, to make the following appeal to the Opposition: Do not endanger our prosperity for some meagre political gain. All factors indicate that the Opposition should now be making progress. After 21 years in opposition that side of the House, according to all political laws, ought to be making great progress now. If they are not making that progress they have only themselves to blame. In my opinion one of the most important reasons as to why the Opposition cannot make any progress is in fact their irresponsible behaviour. The poor man, the man for whom the Opposition ostensibly wants to take up the cudgels now, has always trusted this Government. The poor man knows that he can trust this Government for, after all, his own survival is more important to the poor man than these financial promises of the Opposition. The poor man, the less well-to-do South African, will not exchange his safety and his continued existence for the mess of pottage of political promises of the United Party. This Government has always been the friend of the less well-to-do; this Government has always had the interests of the less well-to-do at heart. But at the same time this Government has always had sufficient courage to do the unpopular thing if it was in the interests of the nation of South Africa as a whole. We on this side of the House are probably a very representative cross-section of the South African nation. We are not a party of wealthy men. We know what it is to be poor; we were also poor. We know only too well that all our people are not equally gifted. But I want to state very clearly that I, and I believe also my colleagues on this side of the House, have very little sympathy with that man who has not made use of his one talent, who has not developed it, but who has hidden it under a bushel. It is that man who is too lazy to work. The Opposition must take care that it does not become the intercessory for that type of man. I am speaking of the man who does not want to develop his talent, but who is continually standing with cupped hands and evinces dissatisfaction when other people, specifically the Government, do not put enough into them. I maintain that the hon. Opposition must be very careful that they do not encourage this type of disposition among our people, because we would then be heading for disaster. It would be disastrous for the growth of a spiritually strong and economically prosperous nation. The motto which the hon. the Minister of Finance gave us last year is to my mind a striking one, namely &#x201C;Work and Save&#x201D;. With this Budget he gives effect to that motto; he implements that motto&#x2014;&#x201C;Work and Save&#x201D;. I maintain that with this Budget he is encouraging those two objectives. With generous income tax concessions he is saying to every man and woman in our country: &#x201C;You can work harder and earn more; I will not tax away the bulk of those increased earnings. I also want to encourage you to save a greater part of your increased earnings.&#x201D; This the Minister is doing by means of various measures as announced during the Jubilee Savings Campaign. &#x201C;Work and Save&#x201D;&#x2014;what a wonderful motto for a nation that wants to grow and develop.</p>

<p>I also foresee this Budget having a great influence on our immigration attempts. Not only is the citizen of this country now free to display greater industry, but the enterprising young potential immigrant will feel more attracted to South Africa because it has been his experience in his own country that the welfare state draws off so much of the cream of his income that he in fact has very little left. In contrast to that he can work as hard as he wants to here, he can earn as much as he likes, and the State will not draw off the cream of his earnings in the form of excessively high taxes. There are welfare states where the thrift and industry of the diligent is being taxed to such an extent that they are losing their thrift and industry. Now citizens as well as enterprising young immigrants will find that they can work just as hard as they please, that they can give free rein to their spirit of enterprise, that they can earn just as much as they want to, and the State will not tax away the cream of their earnings. In this way we will grow; in this way our economy will prosper and offer opportunities for employment to all those who want to work. In this way we will attract the diligent and find a solution to the shortage of trained manpower.</p>

<p>I asked the hon. Opposition, &#x201C;How long halt ye between two opinions&#x003F; Choose to-day whom you would serve&#x201D;. This side made its choice a long time ago. This side does not take the part of the poor man.</p>

<p>The hon. member is saying &#x201C;There you have it&#x201D;. I repeat: This side of the House does not take the part of the poor man, but it does not take the part of the rich man either. This side puts the interests of South Africa first. We made this choice many years ago: fifty years ago this party made a choice&#x2014;&#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;. But the predecessors of that side said &#x201C;The Empire first&#x201D;.</p>

<p><span class="col_3543-3544" refersTo="page_0259"/>I just want to repeat the following: The hon. Opposition must not, for the sake of obtaining the votes of a few aggrieved persons, endanger our security and our prosperity.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the Franzsen report. In my opinion the work of this commission will be known in history as a very searching and thorough piece of work. I want to join with the commission and the hon. the Minister of Finance in admitting that the radical changes of this Budget are not painless. Nor can that be. But this report will still become a standard work. I think it is an outstanding piece of work. Now the hon. member for Pinetown has said that when Sweden wanted to impose a sales tax it first made a very thorough study of the matter. Did we not also have a very thorough study made of the matter by means of the Franzsen Commission&#x003F; Is it not this very report we now have before us which forms the result of that thorough study and which, as far as it is humanly possible, predicts what is going to happen in terms of this Budget and how it is going to affect the nation and its economy&#x003F; The Government&#x2019;s acceptance of this report gives the go ahead to all who want to work and make progress. I am convinced that this Budget is going to usher in a new era of industry and prosperity in the Republic.</p>

<p>Of course this Budget is not without fault. After all, who of us in this world are without fault&#x003F; Who is perfect&#x003F; One thing is certain; this is a radical Budget which creates an entirely new pattern of taxation. During the course of the years further changes and improvements will be made. After all, nobody stands still.</p>

<p>I can also point out to the Opposition a few anomalies which we still find in our Budget system, if they cannot spot them themselves. But it does not detract from the amazing value of this Budget as the inception, the creation of a new era in our system of taxation. I concede that there are faults, not so much in this Budget as in our system as it still exists. I just want to mention one, namely our system of bonuses on old age pensions. In this connection I would be pleased if I could have the attention of the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions. In my opinion our system of bonuses over and above old age pensions is obsolete, because we find this anomaly that whereas this Budget encourages us to work and to save, this system works in the opposite direction. A man who has R530 of his own income after retiring, or a married couple who have twice as much, namely R1,060 of their own income, are worse off now than the man or the couple who saved far less While they were still working. For example a man who has while he was working saved so little that after retiring he only has an income of R192, will after 1st October have a total income of this R192 of his own plus his R336 basic pension, plus a bonus of R60, which is a total of R588; whereas the man who saved more while he was working, so that he now has his own income of R530, must be satisfied with that R530. This is obviously an anomaly. It cannot be reconciled with the spirit of this Budget which encourages us to work and to save. But I have every confidence in our very active and brilliant young Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, and trust that he will devote his attention to the matter and that he will eliminate this anomaly. The solution is quite obvious. Instead of allocating an additional bonus of R12 per annum to a pensioner, the means and pension limit must be increased by that R12. In other words, the means and pension limit must always remain the same as the total pension, bonus included, received by a pensioner. The means and pension limit must never be less than the pension received by a person from his basic pension plus bonuses. In other words, the bonus system must be abolished and instead of allocating additional bonuses, the means and pension limit must be adjusted each time a change is made in the pension.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>If there is no means, he must still receive the maximum pension as determined from time to time by the hon. the Minister of Finance. He will never receive less than the maximum.</p>

<p>I want to refer with very great appreciation to the concession made by the hon. the Minister of Finance in respect of post-graduate study courses, since he is making a concession to engineers and natural scientists in regard to their post-graduate study costs. But I should like to see this principle being extended much further afield. In fact, as long ago as 1963 I put in a very strong plea that all post-school study costs, up to a specific maximum amount, should be dealt with in this way. I still feel that that should be done. The American Department of Commerce made a study a few years ago of the earning capacity of three categories of workers, and their findings were as follows: Men with primary school training only earned an average of 4,800 dollars a year; men with high school training earned an average of 6,300 dollars per year; and men with university or college training earned an average of 9,300 dollars per year. Of course there were exceptions to this rule but on an average the man with higher educational qualifications earns much more than the person with lower educational qualifications. Consequently, seen from an investment point of view, it pays the State to make an investment in the form of these educational costs. It would pay the State to accommodate many more students and/or their parents in respect of study costs, because the State can subsequently recover those costs twice over when those people begin working, earn much more and are consequently able to pay much more in the form of taxes.</p>

<p><span class="col_3545-3546" refersTo="page_0260"/>In addition I want to avail myself of this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the hon. the Minister and his Department. Hon. members know of course that a parent can even make a deduction for children over the age of 18, if they are full-time students and are fully dependent upon the parent. Now, over the years the Department has interpreted this concept of &#x201C;fully dependent upon the parent&#x201D; in such a way that such a student could not receive bursaries and/or loans in excess of R250. I now understand from the Department that this figure has been increased to R450. I want to thank the hon. the Minister very sincerely for this, because it also has this result that we will be able to afford our children a better education and will in this way enable them to earn more so that they can become greater taxpayers. In other words, it is simply good fiscal policy on the part of the State to enable parents and students, by means of financial accommodation, to prepare themselves better for life and to study further, because in this way they become greater earners and better taxpayers.</p>

<p>With these few words I should like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to our hon. the Minister for this brave attempt to give us an entirely new system of taxation, a system which I believe will usher in a new era of industry and prosperity for the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Paarl expressed the opinion that competition would keep prices down. I hope to deal with that point a little later. He also said that it was time the United Party should choose whom they were going to serve. The United Party chose a long time ago, in fact, they chose in 1910 whom they were going to serve. They chose to serve the public of South Africa, not sectionally, but everybody in South Africa. I think the hon. member should know that.</p>

<p>I doubt whether any budget presented by any Minister of Finance has been the subject of such general acceptance as this Budget. But it was, in the opening words of the Book of Genesis, only in the beginning, because when sufficient time elapsed to enable a proper study of the Budget to be made and for all its implications to be understood, then a crescendo of criticism seldom heard in South Africa burst upon the Minister of Finance. It was criticism from all sources; from the housewife, the working man, the trade unions, commerce and industry, the Coloureds, the Bantu, the Indians and those who spoke for them. There was one sector from whom no criticism came: the bulls and the barons.</p>

<p>To evaluate this Budget and its effect on the individual it is essential that we appraise the broad spectrum of our economic position. An assessment of the national economy for the whole of 1968 can be misleading, for the results of the last quarter of that year were in many respects very different from the first three quarters. A real growth rate of 6 per cent was achieved during the year if we exclude agriculture, but an acceleration in growth took place in the second portion of the year. Although the total value of merchandise exports reached a record figure for 1968, the figure for the fourth quarter dropped sharply. Merchandise imports, which had risen moderately during the first three quarters of the year, grew sharply in the fourth quarter of the year. During the first three quarters of the year private fixed investments declined. The decline, however, was arrested in the fourth quarter of the year. Inventories which had fallen in the second and third quarters of the year showed an increase in the fourth quarter. 1968 saw an increase in employment with an overall increase in salaries. This was particularly so in the second half of the year. During 1968 reserves increased by R536 million, despite a deficit of R44 million on Current Account during the fourth quarter of the year. During 1968 the consumer price index increased by 2.7 per cent. But what is important is that the increase for the second half of the year was 3.4 per cent. We know that a 2 per cent annual increase in the consumer price index has come to be considered safe, and that a rise of 4 per cent is regarded as the critical point. If we take into account all these factors, the position revealed in the fourth quarter of 1968, particularly the high level of domestic liquidity, the scarcity of skilled labour and the steady rise in the consumer price index, would indicate that it is not unlikely that we are once again reaching the inflationary critical point and that perhaps we are again poised for a further measure of inflation. These factors. to a certain extent, govern the Budget itself.</p>

<p>The overall impression of the Budget is that it is half-baked, hastily thrown together and not considered in any depth. For example, the hon. the Minister has provided an additional R15 million for improvement in conditions of service in certain categories of the Civil Service. But how these improvements are to be applied and to whom the benefit is to accrue, the hon. the Minister does not yet know. He tells us that the matter is complex and that it may take a little while before the Government can announce its decisions. A further grant of R3.5 million has been provided for housing for public servants. Again the hon. the Minister does not know how these funds will be allocated. The hon. the Minister tells us that further study is necessary before he can announce details of the scheme. Details of the new sales tax were announced by the hon. the Minister in his budget speech of 26th March. Last Monday, six days later, according to a report in the <i>Cape Times</i> to which the hon. member for Constantia has already referred, the hon. the Minister was constrained to say that he could not say at this stage whether the tax was too much or too little, and that there was some guesswork in formulating the new taxation. That there <span class="col_3547-3548" refersTo="page_0261"/>was some guesswork is abundantly clear. But the unfortunate thing for the public is that the guesswork is always in favour of the fiscus and never in favour of the taxpayer. The hon. the Minister told us that he needs R2,073 million on the 1969-&#x2019;70 Revenue and Loan Account, but because of the inflationary pressure which is building up again, and I quote the Minister, he is going to make as little use as possible of bank credit and accumulated balances on the State Accounts. I am not arguing this point, but I think it should be made clear what these accumulated balances are. They amount to R457 million. The balance on Revenue Account for the year ended 31st March, 1968, was R35 million, and the surplus for this year is R58.5 million. This is quite a difference from the original surplus of R5.1 million which the hon. the Minister expected. That gives us R93 million. The balance on the Stabilization Account was R83 million. This year we transferred to the Stabilization Account R258 million and we had the balance on Loan Account of R27.7 million. This gives us a total of R462 million. Of course, we have to transfer R5 million to the Economic Co-operation Account. That leaves the balance unspent on the 31st March, 1969, at R457.9 million.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, for the present fiscal year the hon. the Minister has budgeted for a surplus of R2.8 million after having transferred, quite unnecessarily, R10 million from Revenue to Capital Account. If past experience is a guide, as the hon. member for Pinetown has pointed out, we can anticipate a revenue surplus of say R50 million for the year, so that on 31st March, 1970 the accumulated surplusses should be of the order of R500 million. Of this amount R140 million would be on Revenue Account. The hon. the Minister counters any deflationary effect by proposing to increase his spending on Revenue Account by R147 million and by increasing his expenditure on Loan Account by R91 million. The hon. the Minister has conceded that he is spending large sums and that the increases are greater than he would have liked them to be. But he assures us that all the proposed expenditure is urgently necessary for the basic services of the country. I am going to surprise the hon. the Minister by agreeing with him. I am going to agree with him that the expenditure he proposes is urgently necessary because services are deteriorating to an alarming degree in many of the Government Departments. Something has to be done urgently to put them right. But I must bring these important factors to the attention of the hon. the Minister. Firstly, much of the expenditure should have been incurred in previous years with costs anything up to 100 per cent less than they are to-day. Secondly, if there had been proper long-term planning instead of <i>ad hoc</i> planning on an emergency basis, much of the money now asked for would not have been required. If there had been proper planning vast sums of money spent at random on, for example, agriculture and water affairs for temporary alleviations of urgent problems, could well have been spent as a permanent solution to these problems. In this way, we could have saved considerable amounts, which are now being asked for.</p>

<p>This year the hon. the Minister is asking for R6 million more for public works, but for years the condition of many of our public buildings was and still is appalling. I wonder how much money has been wasted on patchwork improvements and additions which have no permanent value. Thirdly, we are not at all satisfied that we are going to get full value for the money it is intended to spend. Again it is a question of proper planning and full co-operation between Departments. In the past there have been far too many cases where the accommodation provided has been hopelessly inadequate, and in many cases quite unusable for the purpose for which it was required and eventually the expenditure has come to be regarded as fruitless. Fourthly, capital and revenue expenditure on Indian, Coloured and Bantu Affairs is nearly R200 million. Now let me make this quite clear. We have no objection to this amount of money being spent on the non-white section of our community. It is its purpose that we question. The Prime Minister has told us that the Government has no solution for the Coloured problem; he is leaving it to our children. The Bantu policy has been clearly demonstrated to be an illusion and has failed completely. There is no blueprint whatsoever for the Indian problem. It seems that the Government&#x2019;s fiscal non-white policy is spend and pray instead of plan and spend. The time has come for this Government to shed the vistas of theory and to accept the confinements of reality. I do not propose dealing with the tax relief measures introduced by the Minister&#x2014;they have already been covered in some measure&#x2014;but I do want to deal with the tax proposals.</p>

<p>I want to commend the hon. the Minister for his courage in breaking the shackles of the past and radically changing the whole basis and incidence of our tax structure. I would also like to add my word of praise for the work of the Franzsen Commission, which I believe produced an outstanding report in a very short time. You know, Sir, it is said that a genius is a man who plans his work and then works his plans. Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to be able to stand up in this House and tell the hon. the Minister, for whom I have the greatest regard, that he is a genius. But unfortunately I am not able to do so. Because although he plans his work well, he fails in working his plans. The Minister has not realized that planning is a process of formulating goals and developing the correct commitments to attain them and that many of the conscious objectives and unintended consequences as well as many of the means required for goal formation, implementation and evaluation are not only economic <span class="col_3549-3550" refersTo="page_0262"/>but also social, cultural and political. Now I know that the hon. the Minister was in a difficult position.</p>

<p>The Franzsen Report on which the Budget was based, I understand, was only received by the hon. the Minister some four months ago. It was a comparatively short period of time in which to prepare an evolutionary budget. But we will help the hon. the Minister. We are always keen to help him. He has already had some expert guidance from the hon. member for Constantia and also from the hon. member for Pinetown. If he takes note of what we say, he may still be able to alter his budget and to produce the perfect plan.</p>

<p>What was this plan designed to achieve&#x003F; Firstly, to remove the tax bulge which was bearing onerously on the income group earning over R5,000 a year; secondly, generally to abate the high rate of tax which was stultifying energy and initiative, discouraging married women from working and encouraging every tax avoidance imaginable; thirdly, to shift the incidence of tax from direct to indirect taxation and to ease, if not the burden, at least the pain, of the tax payments; fourthly, to create a tax climate which would encourage a high rate of economic growth.</p>

<p>Now let me reiterate. We are well satisfied with the proposals to eliminate the tax bulge, to encourage the working women and to reduce the incidence of direct taxation, but we are not at all satisfied with the scope or incidence of the new sales tax; nor are we satisfied with the extent to which it has been imposed; nor are we satisfied that in our own particular circumstances the change of a large part of the tax burden from direct to indirect taxation will achieve greater national production or encourage economic growth.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Pinetown have already dealt with the impact of the sales tax on that section of the population earning under R5,000 per annum, and the hon. member for Constantia has already suggested in his guidance to the hon. the Minister how the tax might be better imposed. I want to support the hon. member for Constantia wholeheartedly. You see, Sir, this new system of taxation will deprive the Government of R115 million per annum in taxation. But there is an additional tax on companies which will produce R34 million and there is the additional tax and duty on marketable securities, which will yield another R12 million. But this is not the whole picture. There is much more to it. The Minister has budgeted for an additional R100,000 from the tax on undistributed profits. It may well be that because of the time lag only R100,000 will be received this year from the application of this new tax to public companies, but the Minister has acknowledged that it will broaden the basis of his individual income tax, and this will improve his position very considerably.</p>

<p>Also, I believe, and it is mentioned in the Commission&#x2019;s report, that in a full year this tax could bring him in something between R10 million and R15 million. Another factor is that because of the lowering of the tax rate the necessity for tax avoidance has ceased to be significant and this could also provide the hon. the Minister with a great deal of additional income. Nor was it essential, with R369 million in the Stabilization and Loan Accounts, for the Minister to provide for the transfer of R10 million from Revenue to Capital Account. In any case, the Minister has no shortage of funds. Even if the Minister only achieves his budgeted surplus of R2.8 million this year, which of course is most unlikely, he will have a credit balance on Revenue Account of R93.75 million to cover any possible contingencies that even the Minister can possibly think of. It is clear, therefore, that the Minister can without any prejudice to the basic form of his budget, accept the proposals which were made to him by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>If we look at the Minister&#x2019;s proposals objectively, we can come to only one conclusion, namely that the change in our tax structure will benefit only those in the upper income groups. Their taxes have been drastically reduced and their share and land dealing profits remain untouched, and for them this is really a champagne budget. The Minister has said time and time again in this House that the market is overheated and that speculators will burn their fingers, but now by his own action he sparks off another share market boom. He wants investments in fixed interest-bearing securities, but as a result of this budget there is more and more investment in equities. The rich are getting richer, free of tax. [Interjections.] The worshippers of Mammon make obeisance to the hon. the Minister. But it is the lower income groups, including the non-Whites, who, hedged in by the web of sterile ideologies and suffering the clutch of poverty, will absorb the full impact of this budget. There will be no champagne for most people. The Minister has completely ignored the class composition of South Africa. The Bantu gets no tax alleviation until March, 1970, so the poorer section of the community, whose income is low, whose income is irregular, whose income is undependable, is being double-taxed this year, and I say this is a sorrowful thing. We can only hope that the hon. the Minister, in the light of the remarks he made in Johannesburg and the power he tells us he hopes to take to reduce the incidence of the tax, will move quickly to right this obvious wrong. The population of South Africa is approximately 18 million or 19 million, of whom some 1.5 million are tax-paying units. Take three people to a unit and you have 4.5 million people. Therefore if you eliminate all the taxpayers and their families from a total of 18 or 19 million, some 14 million to 15 million people are adversely affected by this budget because they get no tax relief, because they pay no tax. This Government may well be daunted by uncertainty, as the Minister <span class="col_3551-3552" refersTo="page_0263"/>says, but they should certainly be daunted by the magnitude of the burden they are now imposing on the least privileged sections of our community.</p>

<p>We also have to examine the budget from the economic point of view. It has already been said that by levying the sales tax at source a chain reaction must be expected and that by the time the ultimate retail price is fixed the increase will not be 5 per cent, 10 per cent or 15 per cent, but a great deal higher. The hon. member for Paarl said that in his belief competition would keep prices down.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But he did not believe that there was a bulge in income tax.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Now, it is true that in some cases competition may keep prices down, but I doubt it. On some items that the discount stores are at present selling, the markup is as low as 10 per cent. So when the prices to the discount stores rise by the 10 per cent to 20 per cent in tax, they are forced to put up their prices, or to sell at a loss. No businessman sells at a loss, and therefore a rise in prices is inevitable. The hon. the Minister of the Interior shakes his head, but I will give him some examples if he likes. The Minister is correct when he talks about uncertainty, he may well be initiating a chain of events which will aid inflation. With our increase in money and near money which are up this year by 21 per cent, and with full employment and with fuller pay-packets the demand for products must increase and the seller&#x2019;s market must remain. Prices have been rising despite competition and the inevitable rise in the price of those articles which are now subject to tax could quite well start off a general rise in prices.</p>

<p>But there are also socio-economic problems peculiar to South Africa. It is generally accepted that the incentive by way of tax reduction can lead to a higher rate of economic growth through increased production, and this in turn can lead to better living standards for the people. This is a productivity budget, but it is one which is obstructed by our inability to satisfy the labour demand. The normal criteria do not apply to South Africa. Here we have the situation where the advancement of the non-White is circumscribed not by opportunity but by legislation, even though he has the ability to work harder and a deep desire to better himself. The realities of our life are a higher private sector demand generated by the white sector, which will harm the non-Whites who as an unorganized labour group are unable to keep up with the rise in prices. In his position the non-White must adopt a passive attitude to change. He is subject to decision and environment.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to consider where the economy can grow, particularly without inflationary side effects. If our economy does grow, does the hon. the Minister think it will grow in the border areas; does he think it will grow in the homelands, or does he think it is more likely to grow in our present growth areas&#x003F; I think these areas will show the major expansion as a result of the new incentives. The hon. the Minister rightly says that economics is not an exact science and nobody can say with certainty what the effect of the new system of taxation will be on the national economy. I agree with him. But it is also true that we cannot be tied to the past; we have to progress or we will retrogress. Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, with our problems of excess liquidity and with the ultimate fate of our gold still undetermined, with our inability to use our labour to maximum potential and with all our major problems still unsolved, we have embarked on a very hazardous course. I still believe, however, that the course set is the right one. If its implementation is adjusted to take cognizance of our own special circumstances, I believe that it can succeed. However, if it is not adjusted to the particular needs of South Africa, it may well fail. It was Albert Hirschman who said: &#x201C;When economists build models of growth, they, typically, do not give explicit independent roles to the ability or motivation to solve the problem of public policies.&#x201D; Our basic problem, Sir, is that although the hon. the Minister gave this Budget a Biblical theme, he forgot to give it a moral content.</p>

<p>There still is just one important technical point that I must raise with the hon. the Minister. As he no doubt knows, many shop leases provide for an increase in rental if there is an increase in sales. There are other leases which provide for an increase in rental if the cost-of-living index rises. The hon. the Minister will realize that the imposition of a sales tax must push up the cost-of-living index and that it must also push up turnover. Tenants are therefore going to be burdened with increased rentals as the result of these two factors over which they have no control, and I hope that when the hon. the Minister replies next Monday he will be able to tell us what provision he is making to protect these two classes of tenants.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. H. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Although South-West Africa is in a somewhat different position to that of the provinces of the Republic of South Africa, I should not like to create the impression here that a representative from South-West Africa is not prepared to or not capable of looking further than the borders of South-West Africa. However, Mr. Speaker, I think you will accept that at a moment such as the one in which I now find myself, one is inclined to want to venture upon familiar terrain, and therefore I have thought fit to make this speech about the economic position of South-West Africa, of which I am at least supposed to have a reasonable knowledge. Sir, it is disturbing for any person to have a name or a reputation which he realizes he is not worthy of or realizes he cannot measure up <span class="col_3553-3554" refersTo="page_0264"/>to, and when I as a South-Wester listen to public opinion in South Africa, I come to the conclusion that South-West Africa, as far as its economic position is concerned, to a very large extent has a reputation in the Republic which it will only be able to live up to with difficulty. In some circles here South-West Africa has the reputation of being a wealthy territory; that it is a territory of diamonds, the karakul sheep and large surpluses as far as its annual budgets are concerned. It is a reputation which may perhaps be flattering to South-West Africa and to me as a South-West African representative, but I think it is a reputation which does not reflect a true image of its position. If we look at South-West Africa&#x2019;s sources of revenue, the sources from which it must earn new money, we find that South-West Africa is to a very large extent in the position of the man who put all his eggs or most of them into one basket, and in my opinion this is a disquieting fact. When we look at the list of sources from which South-West Africa must earn new money, we find it to be a very short list. In the first place we think of mining, a good payer, but if we take stock of mining in South-West Africa, we immediately make the discovery that the profitable mines in South-West Africa, which are the great taxpayers, are mines which were discovered and opened as far back as the time of the German occupation of South-West Africa. These are the mines which are still carrying South-West Africa to-day. We also know that their end as profitable, productive mines is in sight. We know that if those mines have to close down one day, the position of South-West Africa will be a disquieting one unless new discoveries are made in the field of mining or other new developments take place in the meantime. If these new developments do not take place, and we make certain calculations on that basis, we find a somewhat disturbing picture as far as the future economy of South-West Africa is concerned. At a later stage I shall briefly refer to South-West Africa&#x2019;s relations with the Republic. We find that South-West Africa cannot afford to argue as a certain body at the United Nations did; this body would solve South-West Africa&#x2019;s financial problems simply by opening a new gold mine. We are optimistic in South-West Africa to-day that new discoveries may follow, but we cannot speculate on that, because it is mere optimism which exists there, optimism which is perhaps reasonably well founded.</p>

<p>If one looks away from mining, the next important source of revenue in South-West Africa is the fishing industry. Mr. Speaker, I do not think I need tell you how uncertain, vulnerable and uncontrollable that source is for all practical purposes. As far as industrial development is concerned, we have for all practical purposes come to the end, except as far as farming is concerned. A great deal of thought can in the future be given to an industry which is to-day in the process of developing in South-West Africa, i.e. tourism. A great deal of money is being spent to-day in developing that industry. If we try to look further, we find that South-West Africa&#x2019;s potential for creating new sources of revenue is very meagre. When we think of development of secondary industries, we have to try to look far into the future to be able to establish something substantial. We are faced with the inexorable fact that all the factors which must contribute to the successful development of South-West Africa as an industrial territory, in the way that South Africa, for example, has developed as an industrial country to-day, are absent in South-West Africa. All those factors are against South-West Africa. We find that its distances are great; we find that its population is sparse. For all practical purposes South-West Africa has a white and non-white population of half a million, spread over an area equal to approximately two-thirds of the area of the Republic. We find that the scarcity of water is South-West Africa&#x2019;s greatest single economic problem. Water is consequently very expensive. We find that power is very expensive. In other words, we come to the conclusion that for the near future South-West Africa does not have very much to fall back on as far as other directions of development are concerned. This, then, brings me to a further consideration, while I am busy mentioning the factors which are against South-West Africa in respect of the development of secondary industries, for example, and that is South-West Africa&#x2019;s uncertain position in the world. In this connection I feel that I must express my appreciation here for the very clear voices which have been raised in the past years in South Africa in respect of the position of South-West Africa. Those voices have to a very large extent restored confidence in South-West Africa. Even six, seven, eight years ago there were still many people in South-West Africa who had very serious doubts about the future of the territory. It was the steps subsequently taken by the Government of South Africa, steps of which you are aware, Mr. Speaker, which created new confidence in South-West Africa. In other words, the doubt which existed about the future of South-West Africa has always been a factor which has retarded its development, and I think that the bodies throughout the world which have been responsible for the creation of that doubt have in no way served the people of South-West Africa, whites and non-whites, because they have been retarding the development of South-West Africa over half a century, especially in the past two decades, when this doubt about South-West Africa&#x2019;s future became a strong actuality.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I referred to farming, and here I immediately want to make a statement which may perhaps sound fantastic. As far as farming is concerned, South-West Africa is today in the position in which South Africa was quite a number of years ago, when it could still rightly be said that farming was the backbone of the country&#x2019;s economy. In South-West Africa <span class="col_3555-3556" refersTo="page_0265"/>this is still the position. We find strange contradictions there, which I should like to put to the House. Farming in South-West Africa is not really a tax-paying industry, since the authorities there have always had to put a larger amount of money into it than was obtained from it in taxation, in order to keep it on a reasonably sound basis. While the mining and fishing industries in South-West Africa are large taxpayers their contribution to the actual national revenue of South-West Africa is not so fantastic, because the shareholders in those undertakings are mostly foreign shareholders. For example, one now finds the position that about R24 million a year&#x2014;a relatively large amount in respect of South-West Africa&#x2014;leaves this area and is paid to foreign shareholders. I make no reproaches in saying this, because I know the position that brought this about. South-West Africa greatly needed these capital investments at the time they were made. However, this results in the position that the stable element in the economy of South-West Africa and the actual money-earner there is the farming industry. When we draw a comparison with the Republic we also find in respect of the farming industry that particularly the farmer in South-West Africa has, to all intents and purposes, all his eggs in one basket. In the Republic there is a wide range of agricultural activities. If one sector of agriculture in South Africa were to be hit, the other sector could still hold its own. For all practical purposes there are only two kinds of farmers in South-West Africa, i.e. cattle farmers and karakul farmers. Both are greatly dependent upon a very short rainfall season which must cover the whole of South-West Africa at the same time. There is no winter season, summer season or widely spread rainfall season. In 1961-&#x2019;62 the South-West Africa Administration was in the fortunate position of having millions of rands in reserves at its disposal which it could plough in for the purpose of maintaining the economy of South-West Africa. According to all the concepts one could apply, South-West Africa ought to have collapsed then were it not for this fact.</p>

<p>I have now perhaps contributed somewhat to breaking down the reputation South-West Africa had in the Republic, but with the relations which have been established, I think it is necessary that there be mutual clarity. South-West Africa is not the rich prize which many people make it out to be. The facts simply reveal a different state of affairs. South-West Africa has a different fiscal structure to that of the Republic. This fact is reflected in the documents which have been tabled here. Apart from this, South-West Africa has a much younger economic structure than that of the Republic. This economic structure has only really begun to take shape during the past two decades. Really planned economic development in South-West Africa does not really date back more than 20 years. The preceding periods may be regarded as the pioneering years. This development was very seriously disrupted by two world wars. In this respect, too, the position is different to that in the Republic. This is repeatedly emphasized in documents which have been tabled in this hon. House. This fact also results, for example, in the people of South-West Africa being affected differently to those of the Republic by taxation proposals made here by the hon. the Minister of Finance. I therefore found it gratifying that the hon. the Minister remarked in his Budget speech that he realized that difficulties could arise, but that these could be ironed out with the mutual goodwill that exists. I sincerely trust that this will in fact be the case. I also want to give the House the assurance that the people of South-West Africa have no parasitic designs on its greater and much more prosperous brother, i.e. South Africa. On the contrary, I think the people of South-West Africa insist upon wanting to pay for what they receive. At the same time, however, the people of South-West Africa will insist upon being able to receive what they are capable of paying for.</p>

<p>South-West Africa realizes its dependence upon the Republic of South Africa. By way of example I refer to its dependence in the economic sphere. I do not think there can be any other body in the world except the Republic of South Africa which can have a clearer idea than the people of South-West Africa of how dependent South-West Africa is upon South Africa for the maintenance of its economic structure. Just think of what would happen if the wheels of the South African Railways did not run further than Nakob. Tremendous disruption would ensue. This disruption could not be avoided, no matter what body in the world might be prepared to finance the transport system. We realize our dependence. We in South-West Africa also have one consolation, i.e.&#x2014;and authoritative persons have said this&#x2014;that South Africa needs South-West Africa, and that South-West Africa needs South Africa even more. We in South-West Africa realize that the Republic of South Africa can do without South-West Africa and that this would not have disastrous economic consequences for South Africa. It can merely cause a little inconvenience. We also realize that South-West Africa cannot forfeit its economic ties with South Africa without entailing for itself tremendous disruption and chaotic conditions. Since the Budget in respect of South-West Africa bears the stamp of the new dispensation, i.e. the readjustment of administrative and legislative functions, I should like to conclude with the thought that South-West Africa realizes where its ties and its anchors lie. South-West Africa will cling to these anchors to the utmost.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and pleasure this evening to welcome to the House the hon. member for Windhoek and to congratulate him on his maiden speech. We all look forward to that occasion and <span class="col_3557-3558" refersTo="page_0266"/>look back to the occasion of one&#x2019;s maiden speech. The hon. member represents an important seat in a very important part of South Africa, and great responsibility devolves upon him. The best that I can wish him is this: That he will be a worthy successor to his able and distinguished predecessor who had a reputation here for all that we look for as being the best in this House. He will find that in Parliament we are a community of optimists&#x2014;we never look on the dark side. I can assure him that when he joins this happy band of pilgrims he will feel a very happy man here. I wish him good luck&#x2014;he will find that in this House he will need it!</p>

<p>I should now like to have a word, if I may, through you, Mr. Speaker, with the hon. the Minister of Finance. I am afraid I cannot extend the same congratulations and good wishes to him, but I will do my best.</p>

<p>The Minister has given us in this Budget a new approach to financing. I think that is the theme of the Budget debate. They have told us it is a give and take budget. He gives, but he also takes away. But the important thing I think is this, that when he gives and takes he should not give to one person and take away from another. That, I think, is the main criticism. The Minister has to tax, it is his job to tax, and as Edmund Burke said, &#x201C;To tax and to please, no more than to love and be wise, is not given to man&#x201D;. We cannot have it both ways. You cannot tax and still please people. What the Minister tries to do is to create as little displeasure as possible in imposing new taxation. Our criticism is that perhaps he could have adjusted his new system to the old system rather more intelligently.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida has said there has been a good deal of research into this new system of taxation and that the Minister has broken new ground. I do not think that is quite true because the system that has been introduced has been known in modern countries, in capitalist countries, for a very long time, for generations almost, as a purchase tax. I do not like the words &#x201C;sales tax&#x201D;, because it is not a sales tax; it is a purchase tax. It is a tax on the consumer, not on the man who sells. It is very important that when you have a purchase tax, as in countries overseas, you give the price of the article, and underneath the purchase tax. Then you add the two together. As a matter of fact, in America they give on their petrol pumps the contributing taxes to the price of your gallon of petrol. They give you the railage and the state tax and the federal tax. I wish they would do that here so that in Johannesburg the man who buys a gallon of petrol would know that he is paying 700 per cent to the hon. the Minister of Transport for transporting a gallon of petrol from Durban to Johannesburg. It costs the Minister less than a cent and we pay him more than seven cents. That is what I mean by a purchase tax.</p>

<p>The Minister feels he had to introduce this new system and the hon. member for Constantia has indicated that it could be done in a better manner. It occurred to me when the Minister was making his Budget Speech that had he decided &#x201C;I will extend this new system over a period of three years&#x201D; he could have commenced with the most expensive articles, the luxury articles, and perhaps he could have adjusted his income tax slightly at the same time. Then, in the light of experience, he could have gone a little further. That is the feeling I had about it. I felt it was too much too soon, and because of that I think there has been this well-founded criticism. Assuming that the Minister would have started with the 20 per cent tax first, the tax on the luxury items, then perhaps next year, or the year after, he could have extended the system in the light of experience.</p>

<p>I want to ask this question: if the taxes are to be imposed on imported goods at the city where they are cleared, would that mean, the price being higher in Johannesburg than in Cape Town or Durban, that we would have to pay more in Johannesburg&#x003F; Because, Sir, the price there will be higher, seeing railage is included in the price of the imported article. I should like to know whether we are going to pay more, although we are used to paying more in Johannesburg. I should like to know whether the Witwatersrand or the Transvaal generally will have to pay more.</p>

<p>Having said that, I think we should be grateful for where there has been tax relief. The higher income groups of course have tax relief. I need not say much about that. They are friends of the Minister; they have the ear of the Minister: he looks after them. I am thinking of some of the others. I am thinking of the war veterans. When the Minister decided to do something about the war veterans I think he was applying a system I should have liked him to have applied to the taxation system. He did so little, but nevertheless we are grateful for what he has done. I assume next year he will do a bit more until perhaps after another two or three years he will treat the veterans of the First World War in the same way as the veterans of the Anglo-Boer War. That is what we are looking forward to.</p>

<p>Now I come to this question of pensions. We are, of course, grateful for the adjustments the Minister has made to pensions. It is always necessary to pay bonuses to pensioners and change the payments because the whole pension system is not founded on a sound basis. That is the difficulty. We had a Pensions Bill this Session, the Territorial and Provincial Pensions Bill, and we discovered that most of these funds were insolvent. This old-fashioned system, the colonial system, that we have for our pensions in establishing funds, is out of date in all modern countries. I should like to ask the Minister whether he would consider having an investigation into the possibility of a non-contributory pension scheme for the Civil Service. I am speaking of the Civil Service only. He should start <span class="col_3559-3560" refersTo="page_0267"/>with the fighting forces. Why say to a man serving on the border, &#x201C;You are getting your pay, but an amount is being paid to a fund and we are going to add an amount to the fund from the Government&#x201D;&#x003F; Do not tell him that. Say to him, &#x201C;You will serve 20 years or 25 years and this is how your pension will be paid. It will be paid every year out of Revenue&#x201D;. That is the modern method.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is true.</p>

<p>Now there is another matter I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister, and that is the question of these non-resident bonds. I had a question on the Order Paper earlier this Session and I was told that the total amount for the whole of the last year was only R3 million. I see the Minister has budgeted this year for another R3 million&#x2019;s worth of non-resident bonds. Is it worth it&#x003F; Money is flowing into this country at such a rate that it is an embarrassment to the Minister, and still he says, &#x201C;If you want to take anything out of the country you have to go through this process of the non-resident bonds&#x201D;. I think it is quite unnecessary. I think the Minister could use a system of non-resident bonds in order to raise loans, short-term loans, fiveyear loans. I think he could do that. He could make it attractive and I think these people would be very glad to take up these bonds knowing the money will be paid out in their own country. I make that suggestion to him.</p>

<p>The next point I want to raise is this: I cannot go into the basic system. We have had three financial experts on that matter already. I hope the Minister has listened to what they have said. I want to talk about the loan levy. Why does the Minister say to a man of 70 or 80 years of age, &#x201C;You must lend money to the Government&#x201D;&#x003F; I have had a letter from a constituent of mine who is 82 years old, and he writes, &#x201C;They are asking me to lend money to the Government; they say I will get it back after seven years&#x2014;but I do not expect to be here in seven years&#x2019; time!&#x201D; He says the chances are he will no longer be here. He asks, &#x201C;Why should I have to save now&#x003F;&#x201D; The hon. member for Paarl has told us we must save. Why must this old man save for his estate&#x003F; I quite see the Minister&#x2019;s difficulties. He is thinking of the rich taxpayer. I would say that he should allow him R1,000 of his income tax free for loan calculation. Do not touch it. Let him have it. If he is paying income tax up to R1,000, do not say to him that he has to give the Government an extra 5 per cent loan. Leave him out of that if he is over 70 years of age. I am not asking that for them all.</p>

<p>Now I want to devote the time I have at my disposal to what I regard as an exceedingly important appeal to the Minister. I have touched on one or two things in the Budget, hut this I have had on my mind for years, as hon. members will know. I have raised it on several occasions in the House. The Minister has introduced a new system of taxation and accounting. I refer to one of the accounts. I want to refer to an anomaly in our whole system of budgeting and accounting in South Africa. Hon. members will guess what I mean. It is the Bantu Education Account. I have appealed on many occasions to the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and of Bantu Education with no response. I have come to the conclusion that they just do not know what I am talking about. I have now decided to come to the <i>fons et origo,</i> to the Minister himself.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>That makes it still more difficult. What is this Bantu Education Account&#x003F; It was established in 1956. It is laid down in the Act (Act No. 23 of 1956) that Bantu education will be financed by R13 million per annum. It was a fixed amount. It would not be changed. Subsequently, in 1963, because we established the university colleges, it was laid down that there would be another contribution from Revenue Account not exceeding R1,500,000, and nothing more than that excepting what the Native paid through his own head tax. That was the financing of this account. In the meantime the number of pupils in the schools has increased from 1 million to over 2 million. The costs have become greater, but the R13 million has remained pegged. It has never changed. What I propose to do this afternoon, is to try to show what that R13 million should be today and what it should have been in the years between 1957 and 1969, which is 12 years. That is the purpose of my speech here this afternoon. I have tried to ascertain a reliable figure for the annual depreciation of money. I have consulted financial experts and they gave me a figure of about 2.5 per cent, compounded annually. Does the hon. the Minister accept that figure&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I am taking it for the 12 years from 1957 to 1969 at 2&#x00BD; per cent per annum I was told that 2.25 per cent was too low, so I am taking it at 2.5 per cent. But if there is any difficulty about whether it is 2.5, 2.3 or 2.25 per cent, that we can adjust, but I am working on the basis of 2.5 per cent. Now, in that year the amount was R13 million. The following year 2&#x00BD; per cent should have been added to the R13 million. I think we all agree on that. It was added to all the other accounts, and even more was added in the years following 1957. I am just giving the figure for the first year. The amount to be added at 2&#x00BD; per cent would be R325,000, so that the contribution in 1958 would be R13 million plus R325,000. I think the hon. the <span class="col_3561-3562" refersTo="page_0268"/>Minister knows what I have in mind. I have compounded it every year up to 1969. I am not asking for more money; I am asking that the equivalent value of R13 million in 1957 should be the value paid to-day. Now what is the position&#x003F; What should the amount be today if we say that 2&#x00BD; per cent is a fair figure&#x003F; I have calculated that the amount should be R17&#x00BD; million. In the 1969-&#x2019;70 accounts I have here the figure we get again is R13 million. It should be R17&#x00BD; million this year. Hon. members may feel that 2&#x00BD; per cent is too high. There may be a quibble about that. I will now make it too low, namely 2 1/4 per cent; then it should be not R17&#x00BD; million this year, but R17 million. I think that is accepted by everybody. That is the amount. When we go back, say to 1963, we find that the amount should have been R2 million more than R13 million. It should then have been R15 million. I have gone to the trouble to find out how much money over the years the Bantu Education Account has been deprived of. I will not say defrauded; I may not say that. They have been deprived of increasing amounts of money every year. Over the years they have been deprived of these sums which amount to R27.8 million. That is the total, taking all the years. Now what do we do with this Bantu Education Account&#x003F; If the hon. the Minister feels that 2&#x00BD; per cent is too high and would rather have 2 1/4 per cent, the amount would be R25 million. Over the last 12 years they should have had that R25 million. Of course, they have not had it.</p>

<p>There has been a discussion in Johannesburg recently on the future of Bantu Education. All the discussions came back to this: &#x201C;There is not enough money being voted.&#x201D; I am not asking for more money; I am simply saying: Pay the money that is their due. Give them what is their due. We have tried year after year but we have never received it.</p>

<p>Now I come back to the Budget. The hon. the Minister told us of the R5 million he is going to give to the development of the friendly nations to the north. It is coming out of Revenue. He quoted from the Preacher, &#x201C;Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shall find it after many days&#x201D;. I hope he does. That is out of Revenue Account, but what does the hon. the Minister do in his Budget for the Bantu Education Account&#x003F; He said that he will lend the account R13.4 million. Well, he had to lend them something, because they cannot come out on their money. He will lend them R13.4 million. Now, how are they going to pay it back&#x003F;</p>

<p>With interest. How are they going to pay it back over the years&#x003F; Out of the little money available they have to give more and more to the Government. One only has to look at the Bantu Education Account to see the shocking state it is in today. We have it here. Expenditure is reckoned at R39 million for this year. And the revenue&#x003F; All revenue that can be collected, Native tax and everything else, comes to only R26 million. They cannot possibly balance these accounts. The hon. the Minister says that he will lend them R13.4 million. That is how we treat our own people. I do not want so much of the outward look. I am appealing now for a little of the inward look. Charity begins at home. It begins with our own Africans first, the Bantu in South Africa. Quite recently, the hon. the Deputy Minister who is smiling across the floor and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and of Bantu Education have been introducing Bills to create universities. How are they to pay for these universities&#x003F; Out of this same Bantu Education Account, which was created in 1956&#x003F; But they said in 1963 that Parliament will give money for that. We will give an extra R1&#x00BD; million. That is not sufficient if one looks at the Bantu Education Account. University colleges, now to be universities, receive R2 3/4 million this year. The limit of the other amount is R1&#x00BD; million. They may not get more. I think it is a very serious situation. My appeal to the hon. the Minister is to give his attention, or as the lawyers say, to apply his mind to this problem. Why should the Bantu Education Account not be quoted as part of Bantu administration and development as it is with Coloured Affairs, as it is for Indian Affairs, as it is for all our education&#x003F; Why should that not be done&#x003F; Why do we have to have a separate account&#x003F; Why should these poor children be in this position&#x003F; I know that hon. members do not wish to do this. They say there is not a sufficient number of pupils for the different colleges. Well, there will be sufficient numbers of students if the money is available.</p>

<p>What I should like to do is to ask the hon. the Minister to discuss this with the Department, because the formula in all our Bills is that the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance will do certain things. The next time when the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration consults with the hon. the Minister of Finance I should like the hon. the Minister of Finance to ask whether it is not time that the Bantu Education Account should become part of the accounts of Bantu Administration and Development. Look at it this year. What is being given to Bantu Administration and Development this year&#x003F; The amount is increased from R48 million to R56 million. It is R8 million up on R48 million, which is 17 per cent. The Bantu children receive nothing extra from Revenue for their education. They are given a loan on which they will have to pay. That is the position.</p>

The other day the hon. the Minister of Railways said that when a Railway man goes on pension he will raise the amount of pension by 2 per cent every year. If the hon. the Minister of Railways is prepared to say 2 per cent, you can be sure that it should be 2&#x00BD; to 3 per cent. If the hon. the Minister of Railways is prepared to go as far as that, I think the hon. the Minister of Finance can really do something big. He has come along with a new system of taxation; let us have a new system of accounting for this poor account that is left out in the cold. My final word to the hon. the Minister is: When are you going to let these children come in out of the cold&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before coming to the hon. member for Kensington I should like to thank the hon. the Minister of Finance for the Budget which he presented to South Africa on 26th March. The English-language Press are having a problem with that Minister, because they are running out of adjectives. His first Budget was announced in these terms: &#x201C;Diederichs, the determined.&#x201D; The second was announced as &#x201C;the prudent budget&#x201D;. Now they are talking about &#x201C;the bold budget&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It is always striking to watch the reaction of the English-language Press to each Budget, whether the Railways Budget or the Central Government&#x2019;s Budget. If one looks at the reports which appeared in the English-language Press during the past week, one can well understand the dilemma in which hon. members on that side of the House find themselves. The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 27th March headed its leading article with the following caption: &#x201C;Bold Budget&#x201D;. The <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 27th March reported as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In its broad outline as well as in its details it puts forward eminently sound and sensible proposals that heed the changing patterns of employment and social structure that South Africa&#x2019;s industrial revolution is bringing about at an increasing tempo. In an uncertain world racked by monetary crises, it takes care of the present and looks ahead prudently but not timidly or unimaginatively &#x2026;</block>

<p>The newspaper which came closest to criticism was the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 27th March. Among other things they talked about a &#x201C;reform Budget&#x201D;. That is what the hon. the Minister said. They tried to criticize here and there, but they could not let the opportunity pass of at least speaking well of someone or something. They said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Diederichs has done it boldly and must be congratulated on taking the step in that brisk, efficient manner of his which generates confidence.</block>

<p>They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Diederichs is a master in his job. His Department has produced a masterly budget, and he has presented it with the skill of a magician.</block>

<p>They do not want to praise the Budget; therefor they praise the Minister. That is why I say, Mr. Speaker, that the English-language Press will encounter problems in the future. They will exhaust the available adjectives. One can indeed echo the Preacher in saying of this Budget and of the hon. the Minister, Dr. Diederichs, &#x201C;Wisdom is better than weapons of war&#x201D;, but I am afraid that one can only say to that side of the House that &#x201C;One sinner destroyeth much good&#x201D;. I am afraid that we not only listened to one sinner to-day, but to many sinners, because if one sums up this Budget or the criticism on it then one comes to the conclusion that basically only two points of criticism were raised on that side of the House. The first was that it was a rich man&#x2019;s budget and the second was that it would stimulate inflation. Apart from that we have only had words, words, words, from that side of the House. Again one can join the Preacher in saying, &#x201C;For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool&#x2019;s voice is known by multitude of words&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to deal briefly with the main points of criticism raised by that side of the House, the first being that this is a rich man&#x2019;s budget. I believe that implies that it is a budget which benefits the rich man. The hon. member for Florida dealt with that briefly. I should like to deal with that accusation in more detail. The Opposition has already been trying for years to be accepted as the mouthpiece of the poor man, the less privileged, the have-nots. When they make the kind of demands that are embodied in the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia, one has to examine them a little. The impression is created that this Budget will bring no relief to the poor man. Now one has to be realistic and ask what would in fact be a definition of a poor man. We have talked about it a great deal, but I have not yet heard to-day what the definition of a poor man is. I assume that a person who lives in Transvaal, earns R2,000 per year, is married and has two children, could qualify for the concept of &#x201C;poor man&#x201D;. I found that that person benefits, by way of direct tax concessions, to the amount of R16 as against the payment last year of R30. This means a decrease of 53&#x2153; per cent in his tax. In fact, he only pays R14 or .7 per cent of his total income. Similarly one can assume that a person who earns R3,000 and lives in the Transvaal, is married and has two children could qualify for that concept. In this case, we find that that person gets R42 by way of direct tax concessions, or 31 per cent <span class="col_3565-3566" refersTo="page_0270"/> of what he paid last year. He now only pays 3.1 per cent of his total income in tax. But let us take a wider view of the matter, since hon. members on that side of the House say that this is a rich man&#x2019;s budget.</p>

<p>In other words, the poor man is being penalized. Let us see what the position is in the rest of the world. I have just told you that a married man with two children pays .7 per cent of his total income in the Transvaal. In Canada he would pay 4.9 per cent, in Australia 9.8 per cent, and in New Zealand 3.3 per cent. I do not want to compare it with the position in the United States of America. I only want to compare it with countries which are on a more or less comparable basis with South Africa. Let us go back to the man earning R3,000. He pays 3.1 per cent. His counterpart in Canada pays 14.5 per cent, in Australia 21.4 per cent, and in New Zealand 16.8 per cent. I can continue in this way, but I think I have proved that the poor man, the person who, according to the Opposition, has been prejudiced in this Budget, has in fact benefited by this Budget and is far better off than his counterpart in three comparable countries in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The taxation proposals envisage among other things to iron out the tax bulge. Now the Opposition have been telling us all day that they are in fact the people who have been asking for this all these years. But are they not also the people who left this side of the House, the National Party, and this Government, with that inheritance&#x003F; I have here in front of me statistics comparing the tax rates of 1947, normal plus super, with those of 1968. It appears from these that this Government has gradually ironed out this bulge over the years. In this way a man earning R5,000 in 1947 paid an effective tax of 12.2 per cent, as against 5.5 in 1968. A person earning R12,000 in 1947 paid an effective tax of 25.7 per cent at the time, as against 21.6 in 1968. A person earning R20,000 paid 34.9 per cent in effective tax in 1947, as against 31 per cent in 1968. The figures in respect of the comparisons for the years 1947 and 1968 exclude provincial tax. It is a fact that the tax bulge was an unwelcome phenomenon. That is why this Government has removed it. But it is not this Government which caused it. That side of the House is to blame for it. They are still left sitting with a few bulges. The hon. member for Durban (Point) is a living manifestation of that. They left that bulge to us. It is this Government which has now finally eliminated and ironed out that bulge.</p>

<p>It has not taken us 21 years. This bulge has been ironed out over the years. While I have now proved that the poor man, about whom the United Party were so concerned to-day, has been well and truly provided for in this Budget by way of direct tax concessions, allow me to point out how the rich man is going to be affected by the taxation proposals contained in the Budget before us.</p>

<p>When I talk about the rich man, then I am talking about the people who control probably one of the largest companies in South Africa, the Anglo-American Corporation, and I am talking about the people who are rich enough to own shares in Anglo-American, shares which were sold for R85 on the market recently. I am talking about rich people, now, Sir. This tax of 25 per cent on undistributed profits after less than 75 per cent has been paid out in dividends, is only leviable on income from investments and the earnings of foreign branches, with the exclusion of earnings at source. I have here in front of me a publication of the latest financial results of the Anglo-American Corporation. From this it appears that after having paid out R18.5 million in dividends taxable in the hands of the receivers, people who must, as I have said, be rich people in view of the cost price of those shares, this company would have had to pay a further R1.2 million after already having paid R2.5 million in income-tax, if this measure had already been in force this year. It is nearly a 50 per cent increase in the income-tax which would have been paid in the year in question under this specific policy in regard to dividends. But now the United Party say that in this Budget we have prejudiced the poor man and benefited the rich man. They say it is a rich man&#x2019;s budget.</p>

<p>The second point of criticism which we have often heard this afternoon, is that this Budget would not combat inflation but would encourage it. Several speakers have said so, but then we find this strange thing. The hon. member for Constantia asked for the financing of Government expenditure out of the Stabilization Fund. This Government has done its utmost in recent years to drain off this surplus liquidity and then to sterilize it in order to lessen the danger of surplus liquidity and thereby to reduce the possibility of inflation. Now the hon. member says: No, we should take more of that money, that money which is lying unproductive, and we must inject it into the spending stream again. Surely that would be inflationary. The hon. member for Kensington said, on the strength of his appraisal of the depreciation of money since 1957, that we should spend R17.5 million on Bantu education. In other words, he asked for additional expenditure of money. The hon. member for Parktown criticized the Government because Government expenditure was increasing, but the hon. member for Constantia said we should spend more. In the midst of this confusion of tongues the hon. member for Pinetown came along and said it was the Government&#x2019;s policy that was responsible for inflation; this Government was responsible for inflation. Let us look at the White Paper. There we see that over the ten years from 1958 to 1968 the rate of inflation, with 100 <span class="col_3567-3568" refersTo="page_0271"/>as the basis in 1958, came to 124.3 in 1968. That means an increase of 2.43 per cent per year. Let us compare that with the rest of the world, which is not saddled with this Government, unfortunately for them. In England the rate of inflation from 1957 to 1967 was 2.8 per cent; it was 3 per cent in New Zealand, 3.1 per cent in the Netherlands, 3.2 per cent in Norway, 3.7 per cent in Sweden, 4.1 per cent in Japan, 4.7 per cent in France, 24.8 per cent in the Argentine, and 31.6 per cent in Brazil. How the people of Brazil would have yearned for a Government like this one, which maintained a rate of inflation of 2.4 per cent in ten years!</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown criticized the building up of the Stabilization Fund as a policy of this Government. He said that to have R369 million in the Stabilization Fund was completely unnecessary; we could get by on much less and we could finance from those sources. But if we were to do that, and if we were to reinject that money into the spending stream, we would only increase the problem of liquidity. It is a problem which arises out of the confidence of the outside world, which, according to the March quarterly report of the Reserve Bank, invested R453 million in South Africa during the past year, of which the private sector invested R381 million. In fact, it has become characteristic of the South African economy for the last four years that each year substantial amounts were invested in this country by the outside world. For the past four years a total of R1,029 million was invested, an average of R257 million per year. Over against that there was a net outflow during the six years from 1959 to 1964 of R549 million, or an average of R91 million per year, and in 1958 there was a net capital inflow of R161 million. It speaks volumes for this Government and for the National Party that with this fluctuating pattern of capital flow, a heavy outflow over six years and a heavy inflow over four years, inflation has been held in check to the extent it has been.</p>

<p>I say the problem of liquidity in South Africa arises out of the confidence which the outside world has in South Africa, and it arises, <i>inter alia,</i> from the confidence which the world has in gold. If we only look at the fact that in the two years 1967 and 1968, a net capital inflow of R614 million was brought to South Africa by the private sector alone, of which more than 50 per cent was long-term capital in the last year, then it proves what confidence the private sector in the outside world has not only in South Africa&#x2019;s economy, not only in the stability of its Government and of its economy, but also in that precious metal, gold, which is experiencing certain marketing problems at this juncture. To a certain extent this Budget has to be judged against this background of almost excessive foreign confidence and the problems of marketing gold. Several hon. members opposite asked why foreign exchange control was not relaxed further. The reason is obvious. If we were to do that, we would be weakening our bargaining position in the world, and that is not advisable at this stage. In fact, we should gird up ourselves and make ourselves as strong economically as circumstances allow.</p>

<p>The taxation reforms contained in this Budget also had to arise out of various problems revealed, <i>inter alia,</i> by the Report of the Franzsen Commission. I briefly want to deal with a few. Tax evasion means of the form of the undertaking is one. Another is canalization of time and energy into unproductive industries or into directions not bearing income-tax. I refer to speculation on the Stock Exchange. To a certain extent it also had to come as a result of the existence of the bulge. In the light of these fundamental problems the Minister of Finance attempted in a bold way to solve the problems, and to let the Budget influence productivity to the extent that we can manage with our manpower shortage. I think it is the first time the history of this country that the total number of unemployed Whites, Coloureds and Indians fell below 10,000 as was the case on 31st December last year.</p>

<p>There are therefore no more people who can be drawn into the labour market, except perhaps married women, and that is why the concession of R500 on the income of married women is so important. But the concession to pensioners to earn up to R72 per month if married and still be able to draw the full pension is another attempt to combat the manpower shortage. The danger of inflation was not underestimated by the Minister, and on various occasions in his Budget speech he pointed out that we could not relax the anti-inflationary measures. That is why it is also important that consumer spending should also be discouraged to a certain extent, and the sales duty can do much to bring about precisely this, to reduce the demand and in doing so to bring the competing powers of a free economy into full play. The rising cash requirements of an ever-expanding economy had as its basis the necessity for an expansion of the basis of our taxation system. That is why the number of contributors to our economy had to be spread out substantially, and that is why we have the sales duty. But the hon. the Minister also considered the profitability of the various sectors of our economy. For example, he probably considered the fact that over the four years from 1963-&#x2019;64 to 1967-&#x2019;68, manufacturing industry, on a basis of 100 in 1963-&#x2019;64, showed an increase of 20 per cent in its profits, equal to 5 per cent per year. Trade showed an increase of 54 per cent, or 13.5 per cent per year. The higher companies tax of 3&#x2153; per cent more was therefore fully justified.</p>

<p>There may be further measures to which the Minister or his colleague the Minister of Economic Affairs will have to give attention. There is perhaps the compulsory disclosure of the sales duty. This will give the public the opportunity, probably for the first time in history, <span class="col_3569-3570" refersTo="page_0272"/>to calculate the profit of the distribution sector in trade. If one knows that one has to pay 10 per cent on a certain product and that one has to pay, say, R150 for that product and the sales duty is specified as R10, then you know that the production price or the import price is R100 and that the profit taken is 40 per cent. This would give the public the opportunity to calculate the production price or the import price. The hon. the Minister or his colleague will perhaps have to look at this and give us some guidance. A further problem we shall have to face is not to disrupt the capital market in South Africa completely via flight capital or via a swallowing up of foreign capital. The question arises whether specific conditions will not have to be coupled to capital influx via the private sector in course of time. The coupling of technical knowledge is one possibility; another is perhaps the opportunity for local prospective investors to obtain an interest in foreign companies which come to invest money here.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that this House should every year consider whether the Budget satisfies the basic requirements which can be laid down for a Budget. There are various requirements; my colleague the hon. member for Florida mentioned one. But there are others too. There is for example the test of full employment. I have proved that this Government is succeeding brilliantly in achieving the objective of full employment. Economic stability is another requirement. Since the consumer price rose by only 2.4 per cent per year in ten years according to the White Paper, we can state without any doubt that economic stability is in fact being maintained by this Government and by this Budget. The welfare of the individual is another test. If we look for a moment at the position of the pensioner, then we see that the maximum amount payable in 1947 was R10. Over against that the amount in 1969 is R33, i.e. an increase of 23 per cent over 22 years, in other words, 10&#x00BD; per cent per year. [Laughter.] Hon. members on the other side are laughing, but this increase of 10 per cent per year was substantially higher than the increase in the consumer price index. I know that hon. members will ask me whether it is enough. But was R10 in 1947 enough&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is another criterion and that is the balancing of the Income and Expenditure Account. This Budget satisfies this requirement too. We are therefore fully entitled to declare that this Budget, &#x201C;a bold Budget&#x201D;, as the English-language Press called it, satisfies the requirements which can be laid down for a budget in these times, although it is not a painless one; no budget can be painless. It is painful to pay tax, but under these circumstances, with the future which South Africa is heading for, it can be rightly declared that this Budget satisfies all the requirements which can be set for a budget in this country at this juncture.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that I should enter the debate in this calm and quiet atmosphere to follow the speaker who has just sat down, the hon. member for Wonderboom, at this non-contentious level. He is, of course, well-known as the financial adviser to the hon. member for Innesdal and he can therefore speak with authority on this Budget.</p>

<p>Sir, I noticed that the hon. member started off by quoting from various newspapers to show what the initial reaction was to the Budget, but I also noticed two significant things. He did not quote what Veg had to say about the Budget&#x2014;he has not got that yet&#x2014;otherwise there might have been some divergence of opinion. The other thing which he did not do&#x2014;and which not one member on that side has done&#x2014;is to defend this so-called sales tax. What he did reveals a significant symptom of the malady from which the Government is suffering. Sir, it is a sorry state of affairs when a Government, even where it tries to do something right, makes a mess of it. When the hon. member for Constantia and other speakers on this side said that this was a rich man&#x2019;s Budget, we had a howl of protest from Government members. We have had member after member trying to show that this is not a rich man&#x2019;s Budget. Now the hon. member for Wonderboom has indicated what he considers to be a poor man. He got up to prove that this was a poor man&#x2019;s Budget. I do him no injustice when I say that he quoted as an example of a poor man who would gain from this Budget, the man with two children in the Transvaal earning R2,000 a year. Am I correct&#x003F; The hon. member indicates that I am. In other words, to the Government, to the Nationalist Party, a poor man is a man earning R2,000 a year. A man earning R2,000 a year is an income taxpayer. He is part of the 8 per cent. Sir, when we talk of the poor man, we talk of the 92 per cent who pay no tax at all; we talk of the pensioner, who does not earn R2,000 but R396 a year. That is the amount that the pensioner will be receiving as a pension from this Government as from next October after the next increase in pensions. The Government is going to give the old-age pensioner the magnificent increase of three cents a day. Then that hon. member talks of the poor man as a man earning R2,000 and R3,000 a year. He quoted the example of a man earning R3,000. Does he know that the Minister of Transport has some twenty thousand odd people in the employ of the Railway Administration earning less than R100 a month, less than a basic pay of R1,200 a year&#x003F;</p>

<p>Does he know that some 90,000 workers on the Railway earn less than R200 a month&#x003F; These are white people working for his Government, and then he talks of a poor man earning R2,000! He was very <span class="col_3571-3572" refersTo="page_0273"/>careful not to indicate the effect of this Budget on the man who is really poor, the man who has to live on the pension that the Government gives him, a pension which as from October, will be R33 per month but which at this stage is R32 per month; the pensioner who is living on the interest that he receives on his investments and who sees the value of his investment decreasing year by year. When we talk of this Budget being a rich man&#x2019;s Budget and then listen to the speeches of hon. members opposite, I think it is a case of the lady protesting too much. When they talk of a rich man, they may talk of the Oppenheimers and the Haakenheimers. Sir, we are not interested in the Haakenheimers and the Oppenheimers; we are interested in the mass of South Africans, the 92 per cent of the people who are going to be hit by this Budget, not the 8 per cent who will benefit by it. If I had to describe this Budget I would say that it is the help-ten-hit-ninety Budget. It helps 10 per cent or less of the people and it hits 90 per cent of the people where it is going to hurt them most. Sir, what are the concessions in this Budget&#x003F; The concessions are to the income taxpayers, not to the man who does not pay tax. Look at the magnificent concessions! I refer to page 13 of the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech: Post-graduate study courses; annuities for dependants; uniforms; proto-teams. The loss of revenue as a result of all these minor concessions, as they are described, will be R100,000. What a magnificent, generous concession! What does the pensioner get&#x003F; He gets R5.4 million. Then there is a slight increase in the free earning rate of married and unmarried pensioners before they start paying tax. There is a slight improvement in the position of World War 1 veterans. These are all concessions involving small amounts and helping a small group of people. But not a single member on the other side has spoken of the estimated R100 million, which is more likely to be R200 million or R300 million which those self-same people are going to have to pay! When we look at the White Paper we find this statement on page 24&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Housing and related items increased by 2.5 per cent and food prices by 3.5 per cent.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Food prices by 3.5 per cent&#x201D;. The social pensioner with a fixed income of R32 per month from the State is going to get an increase of R1 per month as from the 1st October.</p>

<p>Three per cent, but food alone is going to cost 3.5 per cent more, and food and housing are the major items in the Budget of old-age pensioners. A white pensioner is going to get an increase of R1 or 3 per cent of his pension and even before he gets it in six months&#x2019; time, he will lose it as a result of the increase in the price of food alone. And what about last year&#x2019;s increase; what about the increase between now and October&#x003F; Above all, what about the increase which will flow from the sales tax&#x003F; I am going to come back to this sales tax in a moment, but I want to deal with one or two other so-called concessions, the concessions which the hon. member for Wonderboom held up as being concessions to the poor man to make this a poor man&#x2019;s Budget. Take beer, for instance, an item which is shamefully taxed. [Interjections.] Here we have a drink, with a lower alcoholic content than any other drink, carrying an unreasonably high excise duty, a duty which places it beyond the reach of the average young person. I am not talking of beer as such; I am talking of the sociological effect that this excise duty is having on out youth. The hon. the Minister, in his Budget, has now given a concession, which amounts to what&#x003F; It amounts to R300,000. This concession is given through the application of a different sliding formula. Sir, this is a tax which is repulsive to all the concepts of free enterprise; it is a tax which punishes efficiency and growth; it is a tax which punishes productivity; it is a tax designed as a punitive tax against one company. Instead of removing this iniquity, instead of encouraging the young people to drink a healthy drink, the hon. the Minister tempts them to switch to a drink with a higher alcoholic content. I warn the hon. the Minister that he and his Government will be held responsible for this tragic switch on the part of our youth from beer to drink with a higher alcoholic content.</p>

<p>The Minister gave a small increase in the free margin for elderly people. Sir. why does he not make a decent job of it&#x003F; We have asked time and again that pensions up to R1,500 should be tax-free. The Minister is now increasing the tax-free limit for people over 60 years of age to R1,350, counting the medical bonus. Why does he not make a job of it&#x003F; Why fiddle around: why not make a proper job of this while he is about it&#x003F; To the working pensioners the hon. the Minister has given an increased margin for earnings by a pensioner. But what chance has a pensioner to get a job to-day&#x003F; Day after day, week after week. I come into contact with people who are willing and eager to work. But where can they get the sort of work they are able to do&#x003F; Why, instead of giving merely this margin for employment, did the hon. the Minister not reconsider the iniquitous level of the means test on old-age pensioners&#x003F; R42 per month! It is a shame in a country like ours, a country that can salt away a R58 million surplus in this year, R58 million just put away for an election fund some time in the future. Yet our pensioners have to survive and exist under this miserable level of the means test. Why can the hon. the Minister not do something for those people&#x003F; Another disappointment to a large group is <span class="col_3573-3574" refersTo="page_0274"/>that the hon. the Minister has failed to give relief to divorcees who are taxed as single persons. The widow who is left to bring up her children and who has to work and raise her family after her husband dies, gets the benefit, correctly so, of being taxed on a married basis. But the woman whose husband deserts her or who is a drunkard or leaves her for some reason, and she is left with the same children having to bring them up in the same way at the same cost, is treated as a single person for tax purposes. I feel that this was another of the groups which could have been helped in this Budget. A person who has the same responsibilities, who has made the same contributions to South Africa, should, I believe, be treated the same as any other mother, whether she be a widow or a deserted divorcee.</p>

<p>Let me come back to the sales tax, the purchase tax as it should be correctly called, as my colleagues have pointed out, the tax which nobody on that side of the House has been prepared to defend. I challenge them now to get up, whoever is going to follow me and the speakers after him and to say in this House, to the people of South Africa: We support this purchase tax which you will have to pay. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister has calculated that this will bring in R100 million. If you accept this figure, and I do not, because everyone you talk to says that it is more likely to be R300 million, it comes to R6 per person per annum which, for a family, comes to R30. That means that it is R2.50 per month for a family of five people.</p>

<p>My hon. friend wants to know how. Is he misled by this nonsense that this is a tax on luxuries&#x003F; Let him tell me. [Interjections.] Let us look at some of these luxuries. Before I do that, I want to support the hon. member for Pinetown and take it a little further. He quoted the basis on which taxation is being applied. I wonder who has advised the hon. the Minister on this issue. I have here a bill of entry dated the 3rd April. It sounds like the 1st of April when one looks at it. It is a bill for 90 domestic radio receiving sets which cost at the f.o.b. price paid by the importer, R1,734. On that amount a customs duty is levied of R260. By the time the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s fantastic formula is applied, this consignment for which the man has paid R1,734, is taxed for sales duty on a value of R2,254. In other words, over R500 more. This is a photostatic copy from which I have only cut off the name of the firm. It is a photostatic copy of what is going to happen. Here we have a value gone up from R1,734 to R2,254. Where the duty is R260, the sales tax on this item is R450,80, a sales tax on a fictitious value which does not exist and which is nearly double the excise duty on this particular item.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>There were ten radios. That means that those radios originally cost R173 each. [Interjections.] I am not saying it is not a luxury item. I am dealing with the basis of the application of this tax, because this basis will apply to everything else. Let us take another item, for instance linen. Here we have a consignment of linen imported from Communist China. [Interjections.] Linen is a luxury item according to the hon. member for Florida. According to him we must not sleep between sheets. [Interjections.] These were not red sheets I know. They were white sheets. They will probably not be sold to black men either, because they come from Red China. These sheets cost R1,000. The customs authorities however, maintain that this is a dumped price. Although the customers have paid that price for it, they placed a 25 per cent dumping mark-up on to it. They say that for import duty purposes they will tax that consignment of R1,000 on a value of R1,250. In other words, they increased the value for import duty purposes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>That is a dumping duty.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The only dumping that hon. member knows about is dumping Black people into areas where they cannot exist. [Interjections.] The position is that the sales tax is not based on what is paid plus the duty, plus the 15 per cent, but on the fictitious value. I do not have the time to deal with this, but I have the calculations for anyone that may be interested. The position is that that consignment which, with duty paid, with landing costs, with clearance, and everything else, costs the importer R1,363, is taxed for sales tax purposes at R1,687. In other words, a fictitious additional R300 is added to the value of these goods before the sales tax is applied. Therefore, the sales tax then becomes R85, i.e. 5 per cent, which means an extra R85 on that consignment. What I want to say is that a Minister who can introduce a sales tax or purchase tax on a fictitious basis like this, has not done his homework. Even the forms have no provision for it. In this particular case, they had to write on top of the form with a ring around it, &#x201C;Sales tax value&#x201D;, because there is no provision for it on the form. All imports <span class="col_3575-3576" refersTo="page_0275"/>are based on f.o.b. or on current domestic value. Yet here we have fictitious values being created and an artificial price being established.</p>

<p>No, let them pay the dumping duty, but do not put a fictitious value on the item. This happens to be from Red China, but it can happen with any other item from any other country.</p>

First of all, you are going to have people who must not wash, shave or clean their teeth, because these are apparently luxury items. [Interjections.] I know that soap may be a foreign thing to some people, but to most South Africans cleanliness is something they value. But, Mr. Speaker, this is now a luxury!

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are certain artifices which help to beautify the scenery&#x2014;the surroundings&#x2014;when you are in female company. Therefore, it would be tragic if those artifices were to be denied them. But this is a luxury and ladies will have to go around without the benefit of the odd little bit of powder and paint.</p>

<p>We shall have houses without paint, without insecticides, without lights, without crockery, without cutlery, without kitchenware. But it will be possible to have a fridge of over 13 cubic feet, because such fridges are free of import duty. But the ordinary family, the family of the poor man who earns R3,000 a year who can only afford a 12 cubic foot fridge, will not be able to have a fridge. The Haakenheimers and the Oppenheimers, how ever, will have 15 cubic foot fridges. There will be offices without typewriters or paper. There will be babies without bottles, and without baby powder. There will be children without toys and without sweets. All this will be necessary if they do not want to pay the sales tax on so-called luxuries. There will be food without spices or condiments. Imagine, Mr. Speaker, a pale, a dirty, a smelly, a bearded, a lousy, a longhaired people &#x2026; [Laughter] &#x2026; living in unpainted, unfurnished, uncarpeted, unheated, sheetless homes with nothing to kill the cockroaches and the rats! Mr. Speaker, I should like to see some rat poison being made free use of without duty.</p>

<p>What will these people be wearing, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; They will have to wear hand sewn clothes, because domestic sewing machines are taxed. They will be eating unseasoned food and they will toe eating it with their fingers off the floor because the knives and forks and everything else are luxuries which have to be taxed. Is this the sort of people the Government wants to inhabit South Africa&#x003F; Is this the sort of people who must live without luxuries, who must live without all these everyday commodities&#x003F; Sweets are being taxed. The only thing which has been left out is niggerballs! Vanilla is taxed, but not raspberry! So one can go on. Disinfectants and insecticides only have a 10 per cent tax, but there is a 20 per cent tax upon glues and adhesives. So you can glue the cockroaches to the wall. Only it would be more expensive.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this tax is an iniquitous imposition on the poor people of South Africa! It is a tax on them but in the words of the hon. member for Florida, in the words of the hon. the Minister himself, mainly on luxuries. I quote the Minister&#x2019;s words, &#x201C;If the income tax on the lower income groups is reduced and if the sales duty is applied in a selective manner, namely not on basic necessities, the case for it is even stronger&#x201D;. These items I have named here, are therefore apparently not basic necessities! I believe that they are basic necessities to most decent South Africans; people who want to be clean, who want to look decent, who want to be able to have a neatly painted house, who want to have food which they can enjoy and eat, people who want to give their baby a new bottle and who want to be able to powder it. But no, Mr. Speaker, this Government believes that these things which I have named are luxuries or mainly luxuries. I promise that we shall remind the people of South Africa that when this tax was imposed it was this side of the House that told the hon. the Minister that it was unnecessary. He could remove the bulge, without this&#x2014;with that we agree, even if he cannot get rid of my bulge &#x2026; [Laughter.] But, Mr. Speaker, he does hot need to impose this sales duty. We shall tell the people that hon. members on that side refused to support us when we were pleading <span class="col_3577-3578" refersTo="page_0276"/>with the Minister not to go ahead with this duty on essentials of living.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when luxury articles such as those which the hon. member for Durban (Point) has just mentioned, appear to him to be necessities of life, it speaks volumes for the high standard of living in South Africa under the National Party Government. The hon. member for Durban (Point) had a great deal to say here about things which the hon. member for Wonderboom was supposed to have said but did not say. I want to tell him that the hon. member for Wonderboom gave an excellent economic exposition of this Budget and I may just add that the hon. member for Wonderboom has probably forgotten more about economics than the hon. member for Durban (Point) will ever learn. That hon. member complained because the hon. member for Wonderboom did not quote from <i>Veg.</i> Mr. Speaker, I have the latest issue of <i>Veg</i> here, but the Budget is not even mentioned. I do not know whether that newspaper&#x2019;s sources are sufficiently authoritative to write about such a complicated matter.</p>

<p>I may just tell the hon. member that it is not necessary to quote from <i>Veg,</i> because you know, Mr. Speaker, <i>Veg</i> is merely a monthly supplement to the <i>Sunday Times,</i> the <i>Argus,</i> the <i>Star</i> and all their cronies. All those newspapers simply get their news from <i>Veg.</i> What would they do without <i>Veg</i>&#x003F; The hon. member then simply quoted from these newspapers, because what is the difference&#x003F; They are all comrades in arms! They are all hand in glove with the Opposition. They are all ranged against the National Party Government. I want to say to the hon. member for Durban Point that, as usual, he was not listening. The hon. member for Wonderboom very clearly asked the Opposition to give him a definition of a poor man. In addition he said that since there was no definition he would draw the dividing line at the R2,000 a year income group for the Sake of argument. Then the hon. member asked the Opposition to tell him whether they accepted this. The hon. member for Durban (Point), fat as he is, then rolled helter-skelter into this. The hon. member for Durban (Point) accepted the hon. member for Wonderboom&#x2019;s statement that an income of R2,000 a year was that of a poor man.</p>

<p>In a Rawly-pawly way he tumbled into it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I said in a previous debate that the economic armour of the National Party Government was absolutely impregnable. I have listened to the speeches which hon. members of the Opposition have thus far made and I have come to the conclusion that it is still as impregnable. They reminded me of a lot of hens ferreting and scratching under a tree in search of a little food and eventually finding one small worm. A terrible cackling then rose into the skies about this one small worm. That small worm represents, in their case, R100 million out of a cash budget of more than R2,000 million. It represents about one-twentieth or 5 per cent of the Budget. They have now seized upon this and are running to the public with it in the hope of picking up a few votes.</p>

<p>Are you defending it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#erasmus">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am defending it to the hilt. As the Official Opposition they now want to catch a few votes with that, but they have fallen altogether flat with it. They do not look at the Budget in its broader aspects at all; they do not look at the 100 per cent; no, they have taken the 5 per cent and they have run away with that.</p>

<p>I want to take a look at this Budget in its broad aspects; I want to see how this Budget fits in with the entire economic constellation of this country. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister sincerely on an outstanding and an excellent Budget&#x2014;and let me tell the Opposition that I am proud to do so. It is clear that this Budget was not prepared overhastily, but was prepared with great circumspection and wisdom. I want to describe this Budget as an extension, a continuation of the previous two Budgets, with this difference: There is now a difference in the emphasis of the tax collection structure. This is all that has changed. As I have said, this Budget is a continuation of the previous budgets, but it is necessary that they be continued in this way as a result of the prevailing interna] as well as foreign economic conditions, as well as the high state of liquidity within the country. The previous budgets were purposely aimed at curbing inflation. Hon. members will remember that with the previous Budget a seven-point plan was drawn up against inflation, and that plan is still in operation. The plan is still being maintained, and this Budget is further maintaining it. That previous budgets have succeeded in combating inflation and keeping it under control&#x2014;and that this was done effectively&#x2014;has nowhere been gainsaid by economic authorities. It is common cause that South Africa compares very favourably with the rest of the world to-day. In particular I want to mention here the industrially developed countries of the world. South Africa compares very favourably with, and has combated inflation far more successfully than, those countries. South Africa has been kept basically sound, especially through the <span class="col_3579-3580" refersTo="page_0277"/>combating of inflation. I do not want to bore the House with figures. Other hon. members to-day repeatedly mentioned the figures here again. The figures speak for themselves and I do not think there is any dispute about them. Therefore I say that this Budget is just as anti-inflationary as the previous ones were, because it is cast in exactly the same mould. That is so. I now want to tell hon. members opposite, especially the hon. member for Parktown, that every time they express opinions about financial measures, subsequent events prove to be altogether different to what they envisaged. I want to refer the hon. members for Pinetown and Parktown to certain speeches they made here in 1967. If I were they I should certainly not be so quick to express opinions about the future again. For example, on the 3rd of April, 1967, according to column 3425 of Hansard, the hon. member for Pinetown said that at best the then Budget was a neutral one. I am not wrenching his words out of context; this is the entire gist of his argument. On the same day the hon. member for Parktown said&#x2014;column 3450&#x2014;that it would be wrong to think that the Budget of 1967 would reduce inflation. In the course of his speech he quoted someone else, I think it was a certain Mr. Cloete. The hon. member for Parktown added to that, &#x201C;I think that puts the question in a nutshell.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I do not want to repeat the relevant figures, but I say that if we look at what the previous inflation figures were, we see that those budgets definitely curbed and reduced inflation. The hon. the Opposition even went as far as corroborating this statement here. I do not think the hon. the Minister of Finance ought to be at all concerned about opinions aired by the Opposition to-day. This Budget is as deflationary as those budgets were, but now a cry goes up that this Budget is inflationary. The <i>Sunday Times</i> of the past week-end proclaimed this and so did the hon. member for Constantia. According to them this Budget is inflationary, so that the cost of living will increase. This is what the hon. member said to-day. They are also saying that this is a rich man&#x2019;s budget. But I say that in terms of previous budgets it is clear that this is a deflationary budget. Under inflationary conditions, who is hit hardest, the rich or the poor man&#x003F; When the Government takes deflationary steps it is protecting the poor man, and this is a deflationary budget. How can it then be a rich man&#x2019;s budget&#x003F; I reject the statement made here to-day that this Budget is inflationary. I say that this Budget is just as deflationary as the previous ones; it is a continuation of what those budgets envisaged. Surely it is dear that the hon. the Minister is not putting more money into circulation. He is giving relief in one respect, but he is withdrawing the same amount of money again. If we listen to the Opposition&#x2019;s attempts at guessing about how wrong the Minister is, and to their predictions about how much more money will be taken out of circulation, this Budget is surely even more deflationary. With this Budget the money is being taken from other sources, while the entrepreneur source is being afforded relief. Those people are doing a great deal for the growth of our country. I remember how the hon. member for Pinetown carried on here last year about those people. I agree with him that those people ensure that we have a growing economy in our country. They ensure that it is maintained. Those people have certain talents and they ensure that there is development in the country. It is quite right that relief should have been afforded them, but it seems to me as if there is a confusion of tongues among the Opposition about the term &#x201C;rising cost of living as a result of inflation&#x201D;. Surely there is a great difference between rising cost of living &#x201C;as a result of inflation&#x201D; and rising cost of living &#x201C;as a result of fiscal measures&#x201D;. There is a very great difference. But the Opposition is confusing the two terms and wants to broadcast the misconception to the world that this Budget will fan the flames of inflation and will thereby push up the cost of living. That is what the hon. member opposite said, not so&#x003F; Surely this is quite wrong economically; it is not right.</p>

<p>Will the cost of living now decrease or not&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#erasmus">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that in a moment. We agreed that there will be an increase in prices now, but not on basic, essential provisions and goods. It will take place on certain semi-luxury and luxury goods. It does not represent a general increase in the cost of living. It represents, shall I say, a discriminating increase in the cost of living as a result of the fiscal measures. But an increase in the cost of living as a result of inflationary conditions brings about an altogether different position. There are other economic factors influencing that. I am not going to elaborate on it, but, as everyone knows, this is the dangerous point. As the hon. member has said, when we exceed the inflation figure of 4 per cent, inflation becomes dangerous and we have general increases. That is where the danger lies. But surely the present situation is not the same. This is a basic misrepresentation, and it is now being broadcast to the world.</p>

<p>I want to concede that because of certain problems administrative difficulties will develop in connection with the initial collection of this tax, but I believe the problems will be ironed out in due course. They will be a merely temporary phenomenon. These administrative problems are half held up by the Press as a form of inflation, which they surely are not. The budgets of the past brought stability and caused no disruption. This Budget will do precisely the same. If the Government were to listen to the recommendations of the Opposition, we would find ourselves in a <span class="col_3581-3582" refersTo="page_0278"/>financial morass. They blow hot and cold at the same time. They make inflationary as well as anti-inflationary proposals which the hon. the Minister is supposed to follow. They maintain that the hon. the Minister does not know what this whole system of taxation comprises. They say that he does not know where it will end. Well, I say that that is the biggest lot of nonsense. I agree that our experience of this system of taxation is not such that we can at this stage budget to the nearest R1 million or R2 million. We cannot yet determine quite accurately how much we shall collect. However, we shall still gain that experience. I am very sure that it will not be as caitastropihic as the Opposition wants to make out. The Opposition nevertheless agrees about the principle. I do not know whether the hon. members opposite all attended the same caucus meeting to-day. If one compares the speech of the hon. member for Point with that of the hon. member for Pinetown it appears to me as if each of them made a speech according to his personal feelings about the matter. I do not know wether they represent a party. I do not know whether they even care about what they are saying.</p>
