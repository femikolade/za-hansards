<p>Yesterday the other side raised the objection that this debate had started immediately after my Budget speech. I do not want to attach a wrong interpretation to a person&#x2019;s words, but I should like to know whether I understood the hon. the Chief Whip of the Opposition correctly as having said that I as the Minister had insisted on this, because I just want to make it very clear that I as the Minister did not insist on that. It was an arrangement quite beyond my control. I was informed that this was an arrangement which the hon. the Leader of the House had made with the Whip, and that the arrangement had been accepted by the hon. Whips of the Opposition. Therefore I just want to make it clear that I am not to blame.</p>

<p>I want to apologize to the hon. member for Germiston (District) for having passed him over in my reply to the Second Reading debate. I should like to reply to him now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) proposed that the roneod forms being sent to those applying for telephones, should be done away with as they are so impersonal. I want to tell the hon. member that the use of roneod forms is necessary in order to eliminate the large amount of work which would otherwise have been necessary, i.e. that of composing individual letters to applicants and of having them typed and checked. However, we agree that the roneod letters do not always look very neat, and I gladly undertake to go into this matter with a view to improvement in the future. In the second place, the hon. member said that officials were not prepared to furnish their names when members of the public were discussing telephone problems with them. It is departmental practice for officials employed in certain telephone departments not to furnish their names. In cases where the name of a junior official employed in a department which controls the provision of telephones becomes known, it may lead to malpractices. This may also cause disruption in certain sections, if one person, whose name is known, is continually being called to the telephone, especially once that person has changed jobs. Nevertheless, we shall go into the matter to see whether an improvement can be effected. We shall see what can be done in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark referred to the F.M. reception in his area. If the names and addresses of listeners experiencing problems in regard to F.M. reception are forwarded to the S.A.B.C., the complaints in question will be investigated. Listeners are also requested to make use of aerials on their radios in order to derive the maximum benefit from F.M. transmissions. If the hon. member forwards complaints to the S.A.B.C., the matter will be investigated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown, who unfortunately cannot be here this afternoon and who has apologized, referred to the salary improvements and said that what the Post Office officials had been granted, was very little. Last night I explained the position very clearly. I do not know on what grounds this assertion is made, because the same conditions that apply in regard to the improvement of salaries in the Public Service, i.e. in respect of the 6 per cent pensionable allowance and the subsequent increase to 10 per cent, do of course apply in the case of the Post Office as well. There is, therefore, no question whatsoever of smaller salary improvements having been effected in the case of the Post Office officials. In the course of this Session the hon. member for Orange Grove asked me a question in this regard, and I replied that I had given the staff the undertaking that I would gradually bring about a salary and wage structure in the Post Office which would be adapted to the distinctive circumstances of the Post Office, and in these Estimates I have in fact made a start with it. Hon. members will see, when the scales are made known, that considerable improvements have been effected in the salary and wage structure of certain departments. Of course, I did say that these improvements would be effected gradually. Rome was not built in one day, and we shall have to effect improvements gradually as and when the available money, which of course is always a restrictive factor, permits our doing so.</p>

<p><span class="col_2925-2926" refersTo="page_1486"/>The hon. member for Simonstown also referred to the house ownership scheme. I can tell him that this will involve considerable benefits for the staff. Persons in the Post Office service who earn up to and including R3,000 and who have existing loans, will be subsidized so that they would only have to pay 4 per cent interest on those housing loans. Persons earning between R3,001 and R7,500 will be subsidized to this extent, i.e. that they would only pay 5 per cent on their housing loans. Of course, this does not only apply to existing loans, but also to loans contracted in the future.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vryheid asked that a certain place which was about to be considered for the provision of certain capital facilities, had to be visited by the planners this year, before such provision was commenced, and that at the same time the M.P. had to be contacted so as to ensure that the tempo and the extent of the development there would not be more rapid and more extensive than was originally thought to be the case in order that the necessary adjustments may be made. I want to tell the hon. member that the proposal is a logical one, but that it is unfortunately not a practicable one. Planning is a lengthy and continuous process and, although minor adjustments can sometimes be made at the eleventh hour, substantial changes are usually impossible at an advanced stage. The effectiveness of planning depends to a large extent on how correctly needs have been determined and the degree of accuracy with which anticipated growth, etc., can be projected. The Post Office&#x2019;s physical planning embraces projects which have to be planned well in advance and cannot be amended over night, such as buildings and the design and manufacture of sophisticated equipment. However, we can give the hon. member the assurance that with the new dispensation we are geared for adapting the pattern of planning to our specific needs and for displaying as much flexibility as possible in doing so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) said, in the first place, that the Post Office had to straighten out its priorities in regard to telecommunication planning. He referred here to places such as Mandini and three other places, and said that they had been provided, at considerable cost, with automatic telephone services, whereas there were long waiting lists at other large places and problems were being experienced in large centres such as Durban in having local calls put through. Now I want to tell the hon. member that he is apparently labouring under a misconception. His statement concerning the Post Office&#x2019;s priorities in regard to telephone planning is quite unjustified. The automatic dialling to the smaller towns to which he referred, was not introduced in order to improve the position at those exchanges, but for the very purpose of alleviating the pressure on the trunk exchanges in the major centres to which he referred. Direct dialling to those smaller towns has had the effect that members of the public can handle their own calls to those places and consequently this leaves the staff in the major trunk exchanges free to run those exchanges more smoothly. In the second place, the hon. member said that in cases where a trunk call can be dialled automatically and the person on the other side is making a local call, it is not possible for the exchange to break into the local conversation. In particular he also referred to calls which people from other places wanted to make to the hostel at Richmond, and said that when they dialled the exchange at Richmond they were informed that the hostel telephone was engaged. As regards the hostel at Richmond, the position is that calls which are intended for the hostel and are dialled directly by the public from other places to the Richmond exchange, cannot interrupt calls that are in progress on the hostel telephone, since the person who dialled the exchange can easily do so again later on, just as if it were a local call. In any case, it does not cost him anything if he only dials the exchange and cannot get through to the hostel telephone because it is engaged. To interrupt calls is a disruption for persons who are conducting a conversation. Where there are no direct public dialling facilities to an exchange and calls from other places still have to be handled by the operators on all the exchanges along the route, all those operators along the route are concerned with that call and they have to keep the route clear so as to be able to put that call through. Under such circumstances it is necessary to interrupt local conversations for the incoming trunk calls, but not when, as is the case at more and more places to-day, a trunk call can be dialled by the public in the same way as a local call can be made. If members of the public are experiencing too much inconvenience as a result of the hostel telephone being engaged all the time, the alternative is for the hostel to apply for an additional telephone.</p>

<p>There are in actual fact not many other matters to which I need reply. As usual the hon. member for Orange Grove repeated some of the things said in the course of the Second Reading debate. He said that the Opposition was highly delighted about the assurance I had given that I would not hesitate to take action if the S.A.B.C. were using programmes for party political purposes.</p>

<p>Let us see what course matters take in practice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I grant the hon. member all the pleasure and all the delight he derives from my assurance. The hon. member said that he would write down my words in block letters, and I now want to suggest that he should put that piece of paper under his pillow every night and sleep on it if it would help him to drive away at night the Broederbond bogey he sees in the S.A.B.C. If he does that, I grant him that pleasure. May he by doing so rid himself of his political nightmares.</p>

<p><span class="col_2927-2928" refersTo="page_1487"/>As regards the programme &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;, the Opposition should try to be a little consistent, no matter how difficult this may be for them. Just listen to what the hon. member for Orange Grove said at the Committee Stage last night. He said the following: &#x201C;Would the hon. the Minister admit that at present a certain interpretation is being given to the policy of the Nationalist Party, an interpretation which does not tally at all with the policy of the Nationalist Party of the past, that &#x2018;numbers do not count&#x2019; is the policy which is being advocated now, and that the S.A.B.C. is going out of its way to defend that policy?&#x201D; In other words, it is being suggested all the time that the S.A.B.C. is adopting the &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; attitude. But here the statement is being made by the hon. member for Orange Grove that the S.A.B.C. is defending the Government in its so-called &#x201C;verligtheid&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Is it an enlightened policy to say &#x201C;numbers do not count&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I suppose it is an enlightened policy if one departs from the Party&#x2019;s principles, not so? I want to read out what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had to say. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir De Villiers Graaff said that the time was ripe for an end to be made to the way in which the S.A.B.C., a State-protected monopoly, was being used for thrusting the propaganda of one section of a political party down the throats of the public of South Africa. What was more, the people for whom the S.A.B.C. was making propaganda, constituted a &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; section of one political party.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader was not listening when I read this quotation. The charge made by the hon. member for Orange Grove was in fact that because the National Party had departed from its previous course, the Current Affairs programme was in fact a great champion of the National Party in this &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; condition in which it finds itself. Both assertions cannot be true. According to the hon. member there is no difference whatsoever between the &#x201C;verkramptheid&#x201D; and the &#x201C;verligtheid&#x201D; of the National Party. The Opposition should at least try to argue about these matters in a somewhat logical manner. They cannot level this double accusation at the S.A.B.C. and then expect me to take logical action.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove referred to an excerpt Current Affairs had quoted from a speech by the Prime Minister in the Other Place. Then the hon. member said, &#x201C;Of course, this is not party politics; this is merely a leader of a political party who says that&#x201D;. But I want to remind the hon. member that the hon. the Prime Minister is not merely a leader of a political party. He is the Prime Minister of this country. This makes a rather big difference. I also want to remind the hon. member, as I said last night, that the policy of apartheid has now been the policy of this country for the past 21 years. With each election the Government is returned to power on the basis of this policy to govern this country for a further period of five years. The trouble with the United Party is that since 1948 they have never accepted that they no longer govern this country, but that it is the National Party that has governed this country for the past 21 years. If the United Party regards the national interests of South Africa, as they are interpreted in Current Affairs, as being propaganda for the National Party, this is the best proof that the National Party is still following the right course for serving the national interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Orange Grove said that we had different criteria of comparison. I can really say, &#x201C;Thank God that this is so&#x201D;. This is the case. The National Party and the United Party have different criteria of comparison. I on the one hand and the hon. member for Orange Grove on the other hand definitely have very different criteria of comparison. Now I just want to show hon. members, especially hon. members opposite, how easily that hon. member for Orange Grove can misinterpret one&#x2019;s words. In my reply to the Second Reading debate last night I said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subsequently it may possibly be necessary to increase tariffs in respect of postal services somewhat, because, as hon. members know, the expenditure exceeds income by R11 million. As a business undertaking the Post Office cannot afford to render uneconomic services. I take it that the hon. member for Orange Grove will also see this matter in this light, because it was he who advocated that the Post Office be placed on a strictly business basis. In this connection I must point out that it is accepted that the Post Office, as an essential public service-rendering body, will continue for example to render services in remote areas at a loss, but in general every service must be self-supporting.</block>

<p>In the first speech the hon. member for Orange Grove made during the Committee Stage, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What I found particularly alarming was the last part of his speech, in which he discussed the possibilities of tariff increases and said that he intended to make every service self-supporting.</block>

<p>After all, I did speak clearly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I was concerned about postal tariffs in general.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but you misquote. It seems to me as though this is in the hon. <span class="col_2929-2930" refersTo="page_1488"/>member&#x2019;s nature and that with the best will in the world he cannot act differently. By way of interjection I tried to set the hon. member right. At the time I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let me just clear up a misunderstanding. I did not say all tariffs must be increased in order to become self-supporting. I was talking about the remote areas and said that we would grant assistance there as a matter of course.</block>

<p>In this way I tried to clear up the misconception under which the hon. member was labouring&#x2014;I take it that it was a misconception and that he did not do so wilfully. However, immediately after that the hon. member said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In other words, according to the reply of the Minister there is in fact a possibility that he will over-burden the public and the ordinary telephone subscribers in order to make millions of rands out of them. I am grateful for that admission and I hope the country will take note of it.</block>

<p>What admission did I make?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>We shall see what happens.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should not try to get away from this now. This is the interpretation you gave to my words after I had tried to set you right. One can say something now and the very next moment the hon. member puts into one&#x2019;s mouth words one simply did not use. The hon. member also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Minister referred to an even worse phenomenon, i.e. a shortage of 100,000 telephones in 1951. Surely, that was very naive, for who was in power in 1951?</block>

<p>Here the hon. member once again gave an incorrect interpretation to my words. When the hon. member spoke for the first time yesterday, he said that this existing telephone shortage was an unprecedented record in the history of the South African Postal Service. I reminded the hon. member for Orange Grove of what Minister Mushet had said in 1946, according to what this hon. member had written in <i>Die Kruithoring.</i> At that time the hon. member was still immature and to me he does not seem to have matured since. The Minister was supposed to have said that 45,000 people were waiting for telephones and that the backlog would not be made up until 1951. The hon. member said that these facts were included in the first miserable speech made by the new Minister of Posts, Mr. Mushet, who had said that the telephone shortage which had developed under the regime of the United Party would grow until 1951, and that the figure would only show a downward trend then. [Interjections.] The hon. member must listen now. In 1951 there was a shortage of 102,000 telephones. The hon. member now wants to suggest that it was very naive of me to mention it because a National Party Government was in power at the time. But as far back as 1946 Minister Mushet predicted that the shortage of telephones would only begin to show a downward trend by 1951. Surely, the hon. member knows that the position during the last year of the United Party regime was simply terrible. Surely, he knows that at that time the shortage was 79,000 already. The total number of telephones at the time was only 318.000 and in comparison with that the shortage, expressed as a percentage, was 24.8 per cent. What is the position to-day? To-day there is in fact a shortage of 72,000 but &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Talk about the Post Office instead.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is in difficulties&#x2014;that is why he wants me to talk about the Post Office now. As I have said, the shortage of telephones is 72,000 to-day. The total number of telephones in use is 1,310,000. If we contrast this with the shortage of 72,000, we get a shortage, expressed as a percentage, of only 5.5 per cent. How does this compare with the shortage of 24.8 per cent in the last year of the United Party regime? In spite of this the hon. member comes along here and in a booming voice he proclaims that the current shortage of telephones is unprecedented in our history. He ought to be ashamed of himself for making such a wretched and untrue assertion. &#x201C;What about the shortage of 72,000 telephones?&#x201D; resounded like a refrain from the mouths of hon. members opposite. All they are doing, is to fix their minds on the shortage only. They do not look at the Estimates, because the answer is to be found there. There they will see what we are doing in regard to telecommunications in South Africa. If they had consulted the Estimates, they would have seen that we had spent R39.5 million this year on expanding our telecommunication system&#x2014;the largest amount ever. But, what is more, in the year that lies ahead we are planning to spend R52 million, almost R13 million more, on the expansion of our telecommunication system. Surely, here we have the answer they are looking for. And yet the hon. member for Orange Grove says that this is not a courageous Budget. I say that it is more than courageous&#x2014;it is a vigorous attempt at wiping out the backlog in telephones. Let me tell hon. members that if we wanted to wipe out the telephone shortage over the past five years, we could very easily have done so. But that would have been very short-sighted of us, and I shall tell you why. If we had applied all available money and means for this purpose only, there would of course not have been a telephone shortage to-day. But by doing so our entire telephone system would have collapsed as the outmoded manual operating system would not have been able to carry all the traffic. In addition to that the Post Office would have had to employ a large number <span class="col_2931-2932" refersTo="page_1489"/>of telephone operators throughout the country for putting through local and trunk calls.</p>

<p>Of course, apart from the fact that we would not have been able to find them, we would not have been able to provide all of them with housing, even if we could find them. At the moment 76 per cent of our telecommunication system has already been automized. We are trying to make this 100 per cent by 1980. This brings me to the staff. Hon. members of the Opposition have been wanting to know all day what we are going to do in regard to our staff shortage. Well, here is the answer now. At the moment the degree of automation we have already been able to introduce, has eliminated the services of 24,000 operators. By 1980, when we expect to have the entire system automized, the saving will amount to 36,000 in all.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think that there is anything else to which I can reply. In conclusion I could just express the hope that all these things will not be raised once again in this afternoon&#x2019;s debate. I take it that the hon. member for Orange Grove has in the meantime had the opportunity of glancing at the Estimates and making a study of them. If he has done so, we may at least expect him to put intelligent questions this afternoon on what is happening in the Post Office.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I leave the hon. the Minister to the hon. member for Orange Grove. He is quite capable of defending himself. I should like to return to the speech of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) who spoke when the House adjourned last night. All he did was to praise the S.A.B.C. As a matter of fact, he seems to find the S.A.B.C. so intriguing that it appears that he spends all his time listening to the radio.</p>

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>But he must remember that tastes differ and that what is sauce for the goose is not always sauce for the gander. As we have no TV, the radio is our only source of on-the-spot information and the only source of entertainment in our homes. Consequently, it must be of the best&#x2014;unbiased and of the highest quality. The Broadcasting Corporation can afford it.</p>

<p>At the outset, however, I want to be honest and congratulate the Minister on his first autonomous Budget. We are looking forward to the introduction next year of the popular Budget he has spoken about. It is also my great pleasure to congratulate and thank the Postmaster-General and all his staff for the wonderful service they are rendering to the public despite the strained staff condition under which they had to work during the year.</p>

<p>I wish to mention a few matters that I raised previously. The Minister has not yet replied to them. I am referring to the Pietermaritzburg telephone exchange extension. The original Estimate in 1965 was R200,000. The revised Estimate approved in 1968-&#x2019;69, was R268,000. The present Estimate has increased to R275,000. At the end of the present financial year R265,000 will have been spent, leaving a balance of R10,000 for the 1970-&#x2019;71 financial year. When it first appeared in 1965 it was an urgent necessity; three years later it had not yet been commenced. It was only during the 1967-&#x2019;68 financial year that it was commenced. On 23rd August, 1966, the then Minister informed me that it would be completed during the next few years. In answer to a further question he stated that a &#x201C;few&#x201D; years would be 1&#x00BD; to two years. Pietermaritzburg is a border area and one of particular importance according to the Minister of Community Development. The tempo of expansion with the present industrial development is ceaseless. Thousands of flats, dwellings and businesses are continuously rising and telephones are of the utmost importance. On 12th March, 1968, the Minister informed me that the new exchange would not be able to meet the backlog of telephones, but on 5th June, 1967, the then Minister informed the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) by letter No. M.1/2/67 that the extension to the exchange under construction had been planned to make provision for approximately 17 years. He stated in his letter that there would be an increase of 2,000 lines, bringing it up to 3,800 lines, but on 7th February, 1969, the Minister informed me that the new exchange would now provide for 5,286 additional lines instead of 3,328, and that the exchange was expected to meet requirements until the middle of 1973, based on present developments. Sir, this is now becoming a Chinese puzzle and the Minister must please elucidate it and give me the true position and the figures. May I ask at this stage where the equipment for this exchange is? Has it been ordered yet? What is the promised and expected delivery date? What is the cost thereof? Where is provision made for payment for this equipment?</p>

<p>The next matter that worries me and the pockets of Pietermaritzburg subscribers is this disparity in telephone charges between Durban and Pietermaritzburg, and Pietermaritzburg and Durban. If a Pietermaritzburg subscriber has four calls, one each of three, six, nine and 12 minutes to Durban, it costs him 42 cents more for 30 minutes duration than it costs the subscriber speaking from Durban to Pietermaritzburg. On 5th March, 1968, the Minister informed me that this is merely of a transitional nature and will be eliminated as fast as possible. Surely this is now becoming a serious matter and not a laughing matter. We cannot continue fleecing the public for another two years in this way, according to the Minister&#x2019;s reply on the 19th March, 1968. I suggest that arrangements be set in motion to equalize the charges between the two cities as soon as possible. Sir, whilst we are on the question of exchanges, the Minister informed me that the question of taking over the Durban Corporation&#x2019;s private telephone system was under consideration. As a result, an article appeared in <span class="col_2933-2934" refersTo="page_1490"/>the <i>Daily News</i> of the 14th February, 1969, setting out certain grievances of the staff of that exchange. The present Estimates reflect that the telephone system of the Durban Corporation is now being taken over as from the 1st April, 1969. What I want to ask the hon. the Minister is whether all the grievances of the officials who are being taken over have been settled to their satisfaction&#x2014;I repeat: to their satisfaction? According to recent Press statements this is not the case. It would be interesting to learn what the Minister is doing in this matter. Have all the technicians agreed to come over to the Post Office?</p>

<p>Then I would like to ask whether local calls all cost the same irrespective of their duration? I should also like to know what arrangements, if any, are being made to have congratulatory telegrams delivered to bridal couples on Saturday afternoons throughout the Republic&#x2014;a very necessary and important service to the public, especially the younger generation.

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) referred to the excellent speech which the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) made in this House last night, and he stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that tastes differ, from which I deduced that he is not satisfied with the programmes of the S.A.B.C. I want to elaborate on that theme, because I found on perusal of the S.A.B.C. Bulletin that the S.A.B.C. also, to an exceptional degree, meets the needs of the United Party in particular. I am referring here to a programme &#x201C;Calling all Farmers&#x201D;. I think the hon. member for Newton Park would benefit tremendously if he listened to that programme.</p>

<p>Then he would perhaps learn something about farming.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>He would undoubtedly be able to make a more constructive contribution to debates in this House on farming matters. When the United Party is in a nostalgic mood and longs for bygone days, then I cannot think of a better programme than &#x201C;Op Soek na Gister&#x201D;. Then there are undoubtedly those who suffer from calcification and sterile thought processes, and here I am referring to the programme &#x201C;Talking of Medicine&#x201D;. I also have an idea that some of them, after a heavy day in the political arena here in the House of Assembly, seek an escape and recreation, and for that purpose I cannot think of a better programme than &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;. In addition they will at the same time take cognisance of the existence of the programme &#x201C;Calling back the Past&#x201D;. There are undoubtedly quite a number of them who need handbooks on good manners. What about a programme like &#x201C;So maak mens&#x201D;? I am thinking here of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) in particular. The hon. member for Telephone Shortages will undoubtedly benefit from the programme &#x201C;Your Hate Parade&#x201D;. And what about a programme like &#x201C;Leave it to Van der Merwe&#x201D; for the hon. member for Durban (Point)? And then, last but not least, to achieve perfect balance&#x2014;and here I am thinking in particular of the hon. member for Port Natal&#x2014;what about &#x201C;Talking of English&#x201D; and &#x201C;Afrikaans vir die Immigrant&#x201D;? Sir, the S.A.B.C. Bulletin itself offers many informative articles. In particular I want to recommend to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) the article &#x201C;Die Man wat nie wou Praat nie&#x201D;. This taciturn, lovable, reserved and modest member will undoubtedly benefit from that article. Since the United Party is quite determined to sit on this side of the House one day, they must read &#x201C;On the Rocks&#x201D;. I am convinced that if we were to page through the S.A.B.C. Bulletin for a while, we would find that ample provision is made there for the taste, and particularly for the needs of the United Party.</p>

<p>The Post Office has emerged strongly as a development partner. In certain regions and cities the Post Office is spending considerable amounts, and I find it strange that hon. members opposite omitted to mention this. For example, the expenditure of an amount of R1,400,000 is being envisaged in Hillbrow, R200,000 in Pietermaritzburg, R28,000 in Pinetown, etc. These things are passing unnoticed by those members, and it is consequently the duty of hon. members on this side to bring these matters to the attention of the voters. The spending of money by the Post Office generates development in those areas as well. Not only is the Post Office rendering essential services, but it is also undoubtedly generating optimism and, last but not least, confidence in the Government. This brings me to Bloemfontein. We are grateful to take cognisance of the fact that in the near future buildings to the value of R1,254,950 are going to be erected in Bloemfontein. This would undoubtedly enable Bloemfontein to serve its hinterland to much better effect. For its development Bloemfontein is particularly dependent upon its tertiary sector, and education, trade and other services, and that is why this announcement is of great importance. Previously we heard about this in the Press, but now we have heard more details. It will undoubtedly lead to Bloemfontein coming into its own to better effect as a national service point.</p>

<p>While we are dealing with large amounts it is also with pleasure that we take cognisance of the considerable surplus of more than R5 million. This alone is proof of good management. This also causes me to feel free to point out to the hon. the Minister that, although we have already received considerable concessions from him in respect of radio licences, particularly for our aged and our blind, we would appreciate it if, whenever it is possible, and if further good results can be achieved as a result of the good business sense of our dynamic Minister, we can receive a general and uniform concession in respect of the people I have just mentioned. This will bring them a <span class="col_2935-2936" refersTo="page_1491"/>considerable degree of alleviation because for most of these people the radio is a source of entertainment and relaxation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just spoken has indicated that at last they have found something for the great army of unemployed Nationalist M.P.s to do, namely to sit and listen to the radio all day and night. The hon. members for Port Elizabeth (Central) and Bloemfontein (West) apparently have occupied themselves doing nothing else, judging by their knowledge of programmes. But I am afraid the hon. member for Bloemfontein (West) would not get a job as a comedian; I have heard people laughing much more heartily at Current Affairs than we did at his speech to-day.</p>

<p>Last night the hon. the Minister asked me whether I was going to thank him. I am not going to disappoint him&#x2014;I do not intend to thank him. I have no intention and no need to thank that Minister. The reason is easy to find; the reason is he has 120 mbongos who have been thanking him for the last five hours, so why should I waste my time thanking him?</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Chairman. I say he has enough praise singers. We in the Opposition are here to point out the weaknesses and the failures. It is our job to try to get better Government for South Africa. It is our job to try to shake this Government into doing some of the things that are necessary in the interest of our country. We have not come here to thank the Minister. We leave that to those members who have their eye, even if it is very far over the horizon, on possible Deputy Ministerships and boards. We are here to do our job.</p>

<p>I want to start immediately by dealing with this facile argument of the hon. the Minister in regard to telephones. The hon. the Minister said that one cannot expand at short notice. It is on record. What does the Minister mean by &#x201C;short notice&#x201D;? He said first that in 1946 the peak shortage was estimated to be in 1951. That is 18 years ago. Now, in 1969, he tells us that it is estimated that we will reach the peak in 1971. In other words, after 18 years he has suddenly discovered that there is going to be a shortage of telephones. I think he is like the hon. members who have been praising him here for so long. They are used to sending messages on drums and sending letters by forked sticks. They are not used to picking up telephones or being able to live in the twentieth century. If the Minister has discovered this state of affairs at short notice, then he must have been living in a dream world. For years, in fact, for the last 21 years, people have been screaming about the telephone shortage. Now it is going to be supplied &#x201C;at short notice&#x201D;, because the Government has just discovered the shortage. What did the Minister give as an excuse? In 1946 there was a shortage under the United Party Government. Yes, there was a shortage here in South Africa, and there was a shortage of staff, too. The hon. member for Germiston (District), who had a lot to say about having been in the Post Office, was one of those who was working there at that time. The reason was that one could not be choosy in those days, because the people who were worth something to South Africa were fighting for South Africa. They were laying telephone lines in the deserts and in the mountains of Italy. There were telephones there and that is why there was a shortage in South Africa. I am now going to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his Department. Since those days we have got a much better quality of worker in the Post Office than some we used to have during the war and in the immediate post-war years.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with what I believe is a very significant statement which was made by the hon. the Minister this afternoon. It is a statement to which I now want to draw specific attention and which I believe is one on which there will be much debate in the months and years that lie ahead. The Minister said clearly and unequivocally this afternoon that a &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; &#x201C;een is wat afdwaal van Nasionale Partybeleid&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I ask the hon. the Minister to check his Hansard. He said, in defending &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;, that we accuse this programme of being a verkrampte mouthpiece and then he said that we had complained that it is supporting the Government. That is &#x201C;verlig&#x201D; and to be a &#x201C;verligte&#x201D;, said the hon. the Minister, &#x201C;is om af te dwaal van Nasionale Partybeleid&#x201D;. I ask the Minister again to check his Hansard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<p>That is nonsense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Then the Minister does not believe that to be &#x201C;verlig&#x201D; &#x201C;is om af te dwaal van Nasionale Partybeleid&#x201D;. The Minister does not believe that a &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; is one who wanders away from Nationalist Party policy. This then means that the &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D; are the ones that are running away from Nationalist Party policy. We have now had a wonderful reversal here. The hon. the Minister <span class="col_2937-2938" refersTo="page_1492"/>who said that one must accept Nationalist Party policy or get out, is now defending the views of the verkramptes, defending &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; and those in his party who have attacked his own party newspapers and have said things about the Nationalist Party Sunday Press which are far worse than anything that has been said about the English-language Sunday Press. The hon. the Minister is now the new defender of those who attack the verligtes and the verligte newspapers who support the Nationalist Party. What is more significant is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s definition of politics. He said that statements by the Prime Minister and by implication statements by Ministers of the State, are not party politics. In other words, the radio is to be used to put across the views of the Nationalist Party Cabinet Ministers because they are in power. Because they are in power their views become the views of the State and therefore the S.A.B.C. is there to put across these views. The hon. the Minister said it.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am drawing that conclusion and I say it is a fact that the S.A.B.C. is putting over the view of the Government and the Nationalist Party. This is a symptom of a one-party state and a symbol of dictatorship which we will yet argue further with this hon. Minister.</p>

<p>I do not have the time to go into this in any great detail, but I want to deal with two matters in brief. On 25th February I asked the hon. the Minister a question, namely what post offices, towers or other structures under his control are named after persons. The Minister answered that with the exception of post offices bearing the names of the towns, airports, etc. where they are located &#x201C;there are no buildings or structures under my control which are named after persons&#x201D;. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the Albert Hertzog Tower has been given a new name since that member&#x2019;s dismissal from the Cabinet. There was a ceremony at which it was announced that that tower would be known as the Albert Hertzog Tower. There is also a post office called the Hendrik Verwoerd Post Office, which I will not argue about. But I want to know about this Albert Hertzog Tower which has suddenly disappeared from the nomenclature of the Nationalist Party and the Post Office Administration. Is it now going to be called the Basie or the Hasie van Rensburg Tower? I also want to suggest that when that tower is renamed the Television Tower, the first programme on it should be of the unity twins, namely the hon. member for Moorreesburg and the hon. member for Innesdal. The ex-Minister of Posts and Telegraphs will of course be the comp&#x00E8;re. I can visualize a beautiful introductory programme with the hon. the Minister in the background, the ex-Minister as comp&#x00E8;re and the unity twins telling us how they reconcile the &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; view, the hon. member for Sunnyside&#x2019;s view and the view that has recently become known as &#x201C;Die Nuwe Beeld&#x201D; of the Nationalist Party.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find it astonishing that a front-bencher, such as the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, should tire himself out in criticising the National Party. I think that if he had mastered the problems which his own Party has in Natal, his status in Natal would not have declined to such an extent. We hope that he will in due course keep his own house in order and retain the status he has at present, because we like him in the position in which he is now.</p>

<p>In the few minutes I have at my disposal, I should like to say a few words about the South African Broadcasting Corporation and, in particular, to associate myself with what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) said last night. I want to make it clear that I specifically want to discuss the Afrikaans service. However, I believe that what I say in Afrikaans about the Afrikaans service, can be said with as much sincerity in English about the English service. If one looks at the S.A.B.C. in an appreciative manner, one must say that one appreciates the fact that the programmes are so faithful to the Afrikaner way of life; that the programmes reflect this so well and remain so closely connected to the national traditions of that section of the Afrikaans nation that is served in Afrikaans. If one listens attentively to these programmes, one can really say that the Afrikaans character finds an echo in the programmes presented to them.</p>

<p>We know that the radio is a mighty means of communication and that it penetrates the most intimate domestic circle. One finds radios in the kitchen, in the lounge and even in the bedroom as well. The radio is at the disposal of the whole family and it is employed in such a way that through live broadcasts we are presented with a very clear picture of those events which are connected with our national life. That picture remains closely connected to our national traditions. We have great appreciation for that.</p>

<p>Let us look somewhat more closely at this statement. To the Afrikaner his religion is a very intimate, tender and sensitive matter. If one looks at the way the S.A.B.C. handles this matter, one cannot have anything but appreciation for it. The day is started with an early-morning meditation. Later in the day morning service is broadcast. In the evening there is the popular family programme &#x201C;Laat ons Boeke vat&#x201D;. And later in the evening the day is once again concluded with a late-evening <span class="col_2939-2940" refersTo="page_1493"/>meditation. Therefore, the day&#x2019;s activities begin and end with divine worship. I think that this is a good example of how the character of the Afrikaner is reflected in the programmes. There is hardly a person, no matter what his occupation may be, for whom it is not possible to tune in to these divine worship programmes at some time or other. On Sundays the various church services are broadcast. There are many people who live on remote farms and for whom it is a practical impossibility to go to church on Sundays. They really do derive a great deal of benefit from these programmes which are presented on Sundays. The S.A.B.C. also recognizes the various denominations and they are granted various turns to preach. This matter is taken even further in that the listener is being afforded the opportunity of participating. He may forward his questions to the programme &#x201C;Wat s&#x00EA; die Bybel&#x201D;. These questions are then replied to by experts in that field.</p>

<p>One of the other characteristics of the Afrikaner is that he is particularly interested in State affairs. To put it differently, one may say that he is particularly fond of politics. Of course, this is not an uncommon characteristic, because as far as it is humanly possible he determines his own future and that of his children through his politics. Nor is the Afrikaner only interested in South African politics. He takes just as great an interest in what is happening on the world scene. This sphere is covered by the programme &#x201C;World Affairs&#x201D; and by the excellent news services.</p>

<p>When we come to the programme &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;, which has become so contentious here in this House&#x2014;why this is the case, I do not know&#x2014;we see that it covers national issues for the most part. Those aspects with which every citizen of South Africa is in daily contact, are discussed in this programme. As far as I am concerned, this is a most stimulating programme. It affords us new horizons, and new viewpoints are opened up for us by this programme. One would certainly not agree with all these viewpoints, nor do I believe that it is by any means the compiler&#x2019;s aim to make everybody agree or to make everybody accept everything. However, if a person says that &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; propagates party politics, that person must be very afraid of his own politics. If that is the case he should take care that whatever political foothold he still has, is not slipping away from him.</p>

<p>The agricultural programme, of which mention has already been made, means a great deal to our farmers. There are many farmers at remote places for whom it is not possible to get their morning paper together with their coffee in bed. It might take weeks or longer before they receive their mail and are able to read these articles. In the meantime that radio programme makes a better-informed and more intelligent farmer out of him. However, I have my misgivings about the suitability of the time of the programme &#x201C;Calling all Farmers&#x201D;. This programme is only broadcast at 1.35 p.m., and by that time the farmer who is worth his salt is already doing his work, whereas the farmer who has already made his fortune is taking his afternoon nap. Therefore I feel that it is not possible for the vast majority of our farmers to avail themselves fully of this programme as it is not being broadcast at a suitable time. I wonder whether it is not possible for the S.A.B.C. to effect a change in this regard?</p>

<p>In this way it will be possible for one to analyse all the various programmes. The music programmes offer something for everybody; there are talks for housewives and there is the excellent news coverage in which the South African view on news is always given preference. In the past we in this country were accustomed to the South African standpoint taking a back-seat. We were accustomed to hearing first what had happened abroad. The South African news always followed last, like a small appendix at the end of the programme. Now we want to tell the S.A.B.C. that that priority which they, in their news coverage, are giving to what is our own, means a great deal to us. I think the hon. member for Durban (Point) could benefit himself if he would listen to the new economic survey which is being presented, and he might select a few good shares if he has the right approach to it. This means a great deal to our people. These programmes range from &#x201C;Siembamba&#x201D; to &#x201C;Oupa and Ouma&#x201D;, and nobody is forgotten, not even the aged.</p>

<p>Now I should like to conclude with this. If one were to make a summary of everything the S.A.B.C. offers, I should like to make this statement, i.e. that nowhere in this country can so much value be bought with so little money, for if one takes one&#x2019;s family to a concert or to a cinema in the evening, it could easily cost one R10. But for R5 per annum the S.A.B.C. affords the whole family information, instruction, education and much more. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>In addition to all the things the hon. member who has just sat down says the S.A.B.C. gives us, he has forgotten to mention &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;. Of course &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; has become rather a matter of confusion amongst the ranks of the Nationalist Party. Here we find the &#x201C;verligtes&#x201D; defending the &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D; and the &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D; defending the &#x201C;verligtes&#x201D; and the poor Minister is in the middle. He reminds me of the conductor of an orchestra. The brasses are playing one song and the tympanists are keeping beat to another, and he, the poor conductor, is trying to get something decent out of the two groups. It would be quite amusing if it were not so tragic to those people who have to pay licences and who have to swallow what that programme dishes up day after day. But of course the Minister does not consider that to be politics. Well, I think it is the worst type of politics, because it is politics not only run by this Government but <span class="col_2941-2942" refersTo="page_1494"/>it is the politics of a monopoly that is talcing money from the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>But let me get on to something a little more parochial that I want to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. Now, a lot of praise has gone to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but in my case I think there has been a serious dereliction of duty in some of the work performed by this Department. It is not usual for me to condemn people who are working under difficulties, but in this case the service is being paid for by the public and that service is not being conducted efficiently and in some cases it is being conducted most unfairly. In my own constituency we have a telephone exchange, which I see is going to be enlarged at some time or other, but at the moment serious difficulties are being experienced in this exchange which have resulted in a technical breakdown. This technical breakdown, I understand, took place in October last year. It was apparently discovered in December. From October to December the accounts department of this telephone exchange was simply chaotic. Circulars had to be sent out in February explaining to the subscribers that the exchange had broken down through this technical fault and a revision of the accounts had to be made. When the accounts came out, every single account showed that the subscriber had previously been undercharged.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That is funny. I am always being overcharged.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>The first thing that strikes me is that it is always the subscriber who has not paid enough. I have yet to find an account where the subscriber has paid too much and he gets a refund. These people found that they were debited with an average number of calls, or an estimated number of calls, but how the estimates were made I do not know. However, after three months they were asked to pay an additional amount to the usual account, which was the normal account plus an accumulation of calls that took place over a period of three months. I wrote to the Minister about this and I said to him in my letter dated 3rd February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Would it be possible to ask for an investigation into the break-down which has occurred in the Rosettenville telephone exchange? To allow a technical fault to last three months without rectification points to a serious fault in the administration of the exchange. If it is true that subscribers were undercharged for three months, it is, to say the least, grossly unfair to have an estimated additional number of calls added to the January account. If the Department has the right to make people pay on an estimate of calls, surely the repayment should be spread over the number of months during which the fault occurred.</block>

<p>I then ended up by saying I trusted that he would give this matter his immediate attention. A few days later I got a letter from the Private Secretary of the hon. the Minister, saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am directed by the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to acknowledge receipt of your letter &#x2026;</block>

<p>He then deals with the inquiries regarding the charges collected from subscribers and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister will write to you in regard thereto in due course.</block>

<p>I have now waited six weeks for a reply to that letter. I have received requests from my constituents asking what is going to be done in the matter, and I can only tell them that I have not yet received a word further from the Minister or his Department. Now we find some quite serious overcharges by the Department. I do not want to read from newspaper cuttings, but I will read from my own notes. There is a woman here who was given an average account of R12 to R14 and she says to me that this is ridiculously high. On a check of her calls, this R12 to R14 is approximately three times what she usually pays. Now she is told that even the R12 to R14 is incorrect and she has to pay an extra R8. What is quite surprising is that during this period of three months her telephone was out of order for nearly a month, but she still has to pay that. I just cannot understand what has been going on in this exchange. I will not deal with the other complaints I have here, but for the past three or four months this whole telephone exchange has been chaotic. Its number starts with 26, but as soon as you dial 2-6-1 you cut into somebody else&#x2019;s conversation. That may be interesting to some people who like to butt in, but to people who have to use the telephone it is quite a nuisance. If conversations take place of a confidential nature between people and it is open for everyone to listen in, it results in only one thing, namely that people have to use a telephone in another area. I do not want to continue along these lines, but I regard this as a very serious matter and I would like the Minister to look into it immediately and see what can be done to remedy the position. Because this exchange may be antiquated or badly serviced, or it may not have sufficient personnel, a review of it is necessary. I see on the Estimates under Sub-head 4 that the Johannesburg-Rosettenville telephone exchange is going to be enlarged. But before that enlargement takes place, it is essential for the present telephone exchange to be put into proper working order. Without that it is absolutely useless to go and spend money on the enlargement of this exchange. Tied up with the enlargement of the exchange because of the demand for telephones in the area, especially from the business people, I want to tell the Minister that the Post Office in Rosettenville is hopelessly inadequate. The Minister probably knows through his Department that <span class="col_2943-2944" refersTo="page_1495"/>this is one of the fastest developing business areas in Johannesburg. Houses are being demolished and blocks of flats erected in their stead and the business centre is expanding so much and so quickly that the streets can barely carry the traffic in the area. But this post office is virtually a tiny little room. There is a constant queue of people trying to get into the post office, let alone being served at the counter. It has insufficient room for the people who want to use the telephones and it is also a badly placed post office. I understand that the post office is in leased premises. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>For South-West Africa it is an historic occasion that the hon. the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could present this Budget in which the Postal Services of South-West Africa are also included for the first time in history. Therefore, as a representative of one of the South-West Africa constituencies, I cannot omit in the first place to pay tribute to the officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in South-West Africa, in all its wide ramifications, and to say a few words in this connection. Firstly, I want to pay tribute to-day to the Post Office officials in South-West Africa who have in the past done their duty over a widespread area and who have performed a great task in the interests of South-West Africa and its progress.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to take note of the development of Postal Services in South-West Africa, and in that connection I then want to mention a few interesting figures. The first postal service in South-West Africa was already begun more than a century ago, and it consisted of traders, travellers and other people who conveyed the mail on a voluntary basis. In 1848 the Rhenish Missionaries decided for the first time to institute a fixed postal service in South-West Africa. All mail was consequently sent to the mission station of Otjikango, and from there the resident missionary sent it to Windhoek by two Herero mail carriers, where two further Carriers took it to Rehoboth. From Rehoboth Willem Swartbooi sent it to Bethanie and from there Dawid Christiaan in turn sent it to Komaggas in the Cape Colony, whence it was sent further to Cape Town and other parts. It is interesting, if one pages through the old archival documents, to find that the missionary Kolbe, for example, made mention of the reliability with which the carriers of that mail executed their task in those olden times. It is interesting that in the remote areas of South-West Africa we still make use of Bushmen to-day, for example, to carry a letter to a neighbour. The letter is placed in a forked stick and handed over to the Bushman and he then covers the entire distance at a slow trot. He does not know what the letter contains but he believes that the voice of his master is enclosed in that envelope and he regards it as his great task to deliver it intact. In 1856 a postal service was instituted for the first time from Otjimbingue to Walvis Bay. It traversed the desert by ox wagon and the journey lasted about three weeks. On 28th April, 1888, South-West Africa became a member of the International Postal Union in terms of section 18 of the International Postal Union of 1878. The postal service was then placed under the control of the German Department of Posts, and the first post office in South-West Africa was opened at Otjimbingue on the 16th July, 1888, and it was not a postmaster who was in charge of it but a police officer, Hugo von Goldammer. The incoming mail was kept there until someone collected it and this sometimes took as much as five years. In 1891 the civil administration was transferred to Windhoek and the post office, of course, as well, and from there the mail once more traversed the desert to Walvis Bay by means of pack oxen. The mail bags were placed on pack oxen and the pack oxen were then driven through the desert by natives. In 1892 a scotch cart was introduced which was pulled by eight oxen, and passengers could also travel in it if the mail bags allowed sufficient space. On 9th March, 1895, the German Department sent a certain Sachs to investigate and to extend the postal services in South-West Africa. On his recommendation a by-law regulation was issued on the 6th August, 1896, in terms of which any private person was compelled by law to convey mail, if requested to do so by a postal official. It was a transgression of the law if he refused. It is also interesting that the arrival of mail in South-West Africa was always announced by means of flag-hoisting, i.e. a red flag for outgoing mail to Europe, a blue one for outgoing mail to the interior, a red one over a blue one for incoming mail from Europe and a blue flag over a red one to indicate incoming internal mail. Skipping quite a long period in time, it is also interesting that in 1920 a distance of altogether 110,000 miles was covered by the Postal Services in South-West Africa in order to convey mail, and it is interesting to note the way in which it was conveyed. Mail was conveyed over 21,820 miles by motor car; by horse and cart over a distance of 35,880 miles; by ox wagon over a distance of 11,380 miles; by camel over a distance of 16,050 miles and by pack oxen over a distance of 24,870. It is also interesting to note that in that year R17,516 was spent in the conveyance of postal items, by comparison with more than R&#x00BC; million today. The first telegrams in South-West Africa were sent in 1901 and were in fact sent by heliograph and later by Morse Code. In 1930 the Creed printing telegraph was introduced for the first time. In the fifties when I was a newspaperman, I was the person who made the first direct link-up between Windhoek and London and I operated the printing telegraph myself. In 1915 there were still only 175 telephones in South-West Africa. On 30th September, 1966, there were already 17,968. In the same year there were already 24,774 miles of farm lines in South-West Africa, supplied to 4,434 farmers. In 1966 there were <span class="col_2945-2946" refersTo="page_1496"/>only 122 applications throughout the whole of South-West Africa on the waiting list. South-West Africa&#x2019;s Estimates in 1920, for the entire Postal Service merely amounted to R65,983. In 1966 it was already over R2 million and to-day it is very much more. With this tremendous development one has no choice but to pay tribute to the inhabitants of South-West Africa, to those postal officials who were responsible for this phenomenal progress in the Postal Services in South-West Africa, and since South-West Africa&#x2019;s postal services will in the future fall under this Parliament, I want to express the hope that the same dedication will be displayed as far as the development of South-West Africa&#x2019;s Postal Services is concerned. Knowing the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs as I do, and knowing the head of the Postal Services, Mr. Strauss, and his officials, I am left in no doubt at all that they will display the same dedication to the extention of South-West Africa&#x2019;s Postal Services, so that they can reach even greater heights.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) congratulated me on the Budget. I want to thank him and all the other members who congratulated me on it. The hon. member referred to the new exchange. The hon. member should re-read the letter written by the previous Minister in this connection. The previous Minister wrote, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am glad to be able to confirm that the extension to the automatic telephone exchange building in Pietermaritzburg, which is at present under construction, has been planned. The exchange building has been planned to make provision for telephone expansion for a period of approximately 17 years.</block>

<p>The period of 17 years refers to the building and not to the equipment. The planning for the extension of the exchange equipment makes provision for 5,286 lines. This will meet the requirements up to the middle of 1973. Additional equipment will be installed at the appointed time in order to meet any further needs. The cost of the apparatus is R613,764. The apparatus will be delivered in the 1969-&#x2019;70 financial year and its installation will be completed during 1970.</p>

<p>The hon. member once more referred to the difference in rates in respect of telephone calls.</p>

<p>I gave the hon. member a full explanation on a previous occasion, and therefore I do not believe that it is necessary for me to do so once more.</p>

<p>This anomaly, of course, arose when national subscriber trunk dialling was introduced at the Durban exchange in November, 1967. But, as I have said, I do not believe it is necessary for me to explain once more. I may just inform him that the implications of this inconsistency are fully realized. It is actually a transitional problem and it must be accepted as such by national subscribers in the interests of an improved national telecommunications network. As a result of multiple technical and other considerations, national subscriber truck dialling is being extended step by step. As a result it was not possible to make the facilities available to Pietermaritzburg at the same time as they were introduced in Durban. However, we are doing everything possible to eliminate the inconvenience as quickly as possible and to extend the services. All anomalies will be eliminated as soon as the system is in operation throughout the country. According to present indications national subscriber trunk dialling cannot be made available to subscribers in Pietermaritzburg before 1971.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked whether the same period applied to all local telephone calls. My reply to that is in the affirmative. Then he also wanted to know whether congratulatory telegrams were delivered everywhere on Saturdays. The position here is that all telegrams which are handed in to the office of destination in time, i.e. before closing time, are still delivered that same day.</p>

<p>To the hon. member for Bloemfontein (West) I want to say that the Post Office surpluses cannot be used to subsidize concessionary S.A.B.C. licences. The S.A.B.C. is an autonomous body and is therefore responsible for its own funds.</p>

<p>There is another question which the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) put to me. It concerns the staff of the Durban Corporation. In this regard I want to assure him that the points of dispute were not between the Post Office and the staff, but between the Durban Corporation and the staff. However, those points of dispute have all been ironed out.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) apparently enjoyed attaching his own particular interpretation to my words. He is welcome to it. He is welcome to the pleasure which he derived from setting up his own skittles and then knocking them down again. I accept it in very good spirit, because he too was actually only joking and not being wilful. Therefore I shall not respond to it any further. As far as his question about the Hertzog Tower is concerned, I must tell him that the Hertzog Tower does not fall under my control, but under that of the S.A.B.C.</p>

<p>As regards the matter which was raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville, I regret that the hon. member has not yet received a reply. He complained about the building and about the exchange. In regard to his complaint about the exchange, I still cannot furnish him with a reply. As far as the building is concerned, I must tell him that as a result of the tremendous backlog in building work&#x2014;there are about 430 major works&#x2014;and the <span class="col_2947-2948" refersTo="page_1497"/>priority being accorded to automatic exchanges, a Government building for Rosettenville cannot be constructed in the foreseeable future. However, the question of whether relief is possible by means of taking up a lease will be investigated. As far as the other matter which he touched upon is concerned, I shall once more give instructions that a reply to him be expedited.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister referred to the question of concessionary radio licences and stated that it was a question for the S.A.B.C. This matter was taken up with the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C. as far back as 1962. During the course of 1963 I received notification from the head of the Secretarial Department stating that the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C. had approved the suggestion that concessionary radio licences be granted to all old-age pensioners, persons who receive an allowance from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and to the blind. I was informed that the existing regulations had been revised and submitted to higher authority for consideration. The Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, after a long negotiation, did agree to revised regulations concerning the granting of concessionary radio licences to certain groups of social pensioners. I submit that it is, therefore, within the power of the Minister to take steps to extend the limited concession which was granted some three years ago by his predecessor. As I have told the Minister, the extension of this facility has already been approved by the Board of Governors in principle. It is now, therefore, only a matter for the responsible Minister. I submit that the Minister can and should extend this facility to a number of other social pensioners, people who deserve that consideration. However, in view of the fact that the time allotted to the Committee Stage is just about exhausted, I shall raise this matter again at an appropriate stage later on.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>May I just tell the hon. member that these concessions were last considered in 1967. At that stage it was calculated that if concessions were granted to old age pensioners who were living alone and had no income other than their pensions, the revenue of the S.A.B.C. would be detrimentally affected to the tune of R45,000. In the case of the 130,000 white social pensioners the S.A.B.C. would lose revenue to the extent of R500,000 per annum. But this is a matter which can be reconsidered, and I promise the hon. member that I will go into it again. Later on in the present session legislation will be introduced in connection with the collection of licence fees. This may result in the S.A.B.C. being able to collect more money from this source, because then fewer people will be able to evade payment of their licence fees. If it appears that the S.A.B.C. has some money left over and does not know what to do with it, we can reconsider this request of the hon. member. The hon. member must not doubt my sympathy in this connection. I assure him that we will accommodate this group of people to the extent that our financial position allows us to do so.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not standing up to object to the Third Reading because naturally, we should like to see the money being voted so that the Post Office workers can be paid their belated wage increases and the Minister is given a chance to see what he can do in order to alleviate the telephone shortage. Before coming to the main points of the few short remarks I should like to make, I want to refer to a certain remark made by the hon. the Minister. I take if from his Hansard. It is in Afrikaans because his speech has not yet been translated. We were discussing the alleged difficulties experienced by firms manufacturing telephone equipment in South Africa in getting Bantu labour, and the Minister replied to me as follows when I pointed out these firms had these difficulties&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die agb. lid vir Orange Grove se stelling dat die Minister van Beplanning nie genoeg Bantoe-arboed aan die fabrieke wat telefoonuitrusting vervaardig, beskikbaar stel nie, is van alle waarheid ontbloot. Dit is nie waar nie. Nie&#x2019;n enkele woord daarvan is waar nie. Die inligting het hy blykbaar uit sy vingers gesuig.</block>

<p>He said three times my statement was not true. I want to refer the Minister to a reply which was given to me by the hon. the Minister of Planning in this House on the 25.2.1968 when I asked him whether there were such firms which had difficulty in obtaining Bantu labour. My question was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether applications for additional Bantu labour have been received from firms in the Transvaal which &#x2026; manufacture telephone equipment for the Post Office; if so, &#x2026; (b) for how many labourers in each case and (c) what was his reply in each case?</block>

<p>The Minister of Planning replied by giving names of firms and said that the first firm, A. E. I. Henley, had applied for 33 Bantu labourers and only 19 had been approved; Siemens at Isando had applied for 40 Bantu <span class="col_2949-2950" refersTo="page_1498"/>labourers and only 20 had been approved. The firm of Siemens at Koedoespoort had applied for 186. Its application was first of all refused but on reapplication a lesser number was granted. These are the facts as stated in Hansard, Weekly Edition No. 4, column 1344. Therefore I cannot see how the Minister can say it is untrue on my part, and can say it three times, when I said that certain firms had difficulty in getting Bantu labour and they simply did not get enough. As a matter of fact, there is an application from Siemens at Koedoespoort for 947 Bantu labourers until the year 1986. This application was received at the end of 1968 and is still under consideration.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>If I have misread the question then I am quite prepared to accept the Minister&#x2019;s reply, which is fair.</p>

<p>There is a second matter which I wish to raise, and that is the utter inadequacy of the Minister&#x2019;s reply when we questioned him about the strange action of the S.A.B.C. which, with or without the Minister&#x2019;s knowledge, went to Malawi and Swaziland and assisted there in the construction of broadcasting establishments. I want to make it quite clear that the fact that these are two black countries is entirely irrelevant to the question, for had they been white countries, I would have made the same remarks as I am making now. The first question was, on whose authority did the S.A.B.C. go to Malawi and offer to construct a broadcasting station of R50,000 and a studio of R20,000? I am going by Press reports, and the Minister can tell me whether the Press reports are correct. According to one Press report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The S.A.B.C. is to give Malawi a 20 kilowat shortwave transmitter worth R50,000, the administrative director of the S.A.B.C., Mr. J. M. Swanepoel, announced yesterday in Zomba.</block>

<p>He announced that in Malawi itself. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He was speaking at the opening of a R20,000 studio in Malawi&#x2019;s capital presented to the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation by the S.A.B.C. The studio was installed under the direction of an engineer on a year&#x2019;s secondment from the S.A.B.C.</block>

<p>I think a matter such as this does merit the attention of the hon. the Minister. We have often pleaded in this House that the Auditor-General should review the financial transactions of the S.A.B.C., and this seems to me to be eminently a matter which should be reviewed. It is one on which the Minister should give information to this House. If I were to have put such a question to him, say last year, or at the beginning of this year, it is quite probable that he would have replied it was none of his business, as the S.A.B.C. could do what it wanted to. That is the reply I would have got from his predecessor. I do appeal to the hon. the Minister now, where we have this opportunity of raising this matter, of telling us where did the S.A.B.C. get the right to install these stations, under what legal authority was it done, where did it get the money for this project? Was the money obtained by way of listeners&#x2019; licences or was the money granted to the S.A.B.C. by Parliament?</p>

<p>I should like to say something now about the debate which is now rapidly ending with this Third Reading of the Bill. It appears to me that certain salient features have emerged from this debate, and I am trying to find those features on which we can have agreement. I am trying to find agreement with the Minister as far as possible, as he will have noticed. The first point is we have a telephone shortage of 73,000 in South Africa. I will admit it is the second greatest shortage and the greatest shortage was under a Nationalist government, whosever fault it may have been.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>And under a United Party government?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not arguing, I am trying to find points of agreement so far. The second point is that the telephone shortage is going to get worse, probably until 1971, and the backlog will not be eliminated until 1974, that is, within five years. I trust that there is agreement. I want to see what we have arrived at in this debate. There has been confusion among the public, who have read about great amounts that are to be spent on telephones; they have read about new telephone installations, and they have been confused by the figures given by the Minister. Some of this confusion has arisen from the fact that in giving the amounts for new installations of telephone services he has included transfers, i.e. where a telephone service has been given up by a subscriber at one exchange and simply transferred in his name to another exchange, even if it is the same subscriber. In other words, if a subscriber changes his telephone from, say, the central Johannesburg exchange to another exchange nearby that would be included as a new installation in the Minister&#x2019;s figures. In that way confusion has arisen. The position is clear, and we are now <i>ad idem</i> on the salient point that the telephone shortage amounts to 73,000. It is going to get worse until 1971. The backlog cannot be eliminated until 1974, with a certain number of &#x201C;ifs&#x201D;. I will not go into these. I submit that the hon. the Minister was not even sure that it would be eliminated by 1974. I believe that that was an admission that this state of affairs is an extremely serious one. I shall not go into the seriousness of the <span class="col_2951-2952" refersTo="page_1499"/>matter. I have done so on two occasions in this House. The public will take notice of this, and the public, I hope, will also take note of the state of affairs in many other countries among the Western democracies where this state of affairs simply does not exist.</p>

<p>The second fact that has emerged from this debate, is that the Government unfortunately still seems to be adamant in its unreasoned opposition to television. I grant that the arguments used against television in this debate have, in many instances, been more sophisticated than those advanced in the past. I am leaving out, naturally, a few of the theories of our flat-earthist friends from Innesdal and Sunnyside; but on the whole, the arguments against it have been more sophisticated. However, there does not seem to have been any change in the attitude of the Minister towards introducing television on its merits.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, he is following the old policy of Minister Hertzog, the present member for Ermelo. The only time we have a hope to get television, will be if outside circumstances and new technological developments in satellite broadcasting and re-broadcasting, force the service on South Africa from outside and compel the Government to introduce a local service in response. It is a sad state of affairs, when there is this magnificent means of communication, entertainment and of instruction and the Government has to be forced, cajoled and kicked into introducing it by the rest of the world, instead of the Minister being only too happy to accept this wonderful medium. I am sure the country is going to be disappointed in having to realize this. The remarks from the other side seem to indicate that I am right to say that, in this respect at least, the hon. the Minister has capitulated to a strong &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; element in this Government as well as to the very sgrong, dominating &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; element in the S.A.B.C. itself.</p>

<p>The third salient point that appears from this debate is the statement made by the hon. the Minister that he would act if the South African Broadcasting Corporation ever interfered in party politics. It seems that a fine distinction is being drawn between politics and party politics. The hon. the Minister will interfere if the S.A.B.C. indulges in Nationalist Party politics, but he will not interfere if the S.A.B.C. indulges in politics alone. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Sir, I do not take much notice of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. The sincerity of the hon. the Minister in what he has said about the S.A.B.C. and its interference in party politics will be tested very thoroughly during the coming year.</p>

<p>The last point which appeared from this debate was the almost unexpectedly vehement defence of the S.A.B.C.&#x2019;s programme Current Affairs, particularly by &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; hon. members on the other side, and the violent language used against those newspapers who dared to criticize Current Affairs. I conclude by saying that what we have here is an unhappy picture of unsolved problems, a divided party, and not much hope for the Post Office <span class="col_2953-2954" refersTo="page_1500"/>and its administration for the coming year.

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member for Orange Grove thinks for one moment that there is division within the National Party, he is making a big mistake. If the hon. member thinks he can use words such as &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D; and &#x201C;verlig&#x201D; and say that this will divide the National Party, then he is making another mistake. The National Party is founded on principles and not on mere words. No one can say that the National Party is divided by using certain words and by putting a label on certain members. Those people are in the National Party because they believe in the principles of the Party. At present the National Party is stronger than any party in this country has ever been. While in a few minutes&#x2019; time we will accept the first Budget of an independent Post Office which stands on its own feet, which has its own staff department and which controls its own affairs we want to congratulate the Minister together with the Postmaster-General and his staff. But we do not only want to congratulate them. We in this House and the public outside realize that all the problems that exist cannot be solved by a wave of a magic wand. We must realize that the Post Office is to-day faced with its greatest challenge ever. It must be in a position to compete in rendering services in a country which is most definitely developing at a faster rate than any other in the world to-day. I am convinced that the new Minister, as well as the Postmaster-General and his officers, will accept this challenge of the times.</p>

<p>He did accept it. He tackled his task with dedication. He did his best, and if it had not been for the former Minister, we would not have been in the privileged position to-day that the Post Office can function as an independent Department.</p>

<p>I should like to exchange a few ideas with the hon. the Minister. While we are placing the Post Office on the road to independence to-day, I should like to ask him whether a department of planning cannot be set up in the Post Office. Then this department of planning must continually investigate the most modern methods in order to apply the highest degree of efficiency so that the best service can be rendered to the public. This department of planning must break away from the old concept of Government buildings. When we see a red brick building, we know immediately that it is either a post office, a police station or a magistrate&#x2019;s office.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, or a school. We are grateful to see that the Post Office is gradually breaking away from this idea. Our post offices should be planned to look attractive and modern, so that people would enjoy going there to do business. Neither should the rooms in the post office be little cubicles that one is loath to enter. The interiors of post offices should be planned in such a way that it would be a delight to enter them and to do business there, because surely the object of going to a post office is to do business there. What does one find in our major post offices to-day? There are a few cubicles in which one has to write while standing up. Has the time not come to modernize, and for tables and chairs to be provided at which people can sit down in order to do their business in a dignified way?</p>

<p>Another very important matter I want to deal with is the question of public telephones. To-day the public telephone is the only means of communication for the less privileged man. Not every one in this country can afford to have a telephone in his home.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>Will the hon. member please keep quiet. The only means of communication for these persons is the public telephone. When such a person wants to call a doctor, when he wants to call an ambulance or the police, or when he wants to talk to a friend, he must make use of a public telephone. And what do we find? One comes to the conclusion that the man in the street does not know for what purpose that telephone is there. These telephones are constantly being damaged. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister this afternoon that these persons who have no respect and appreciation for the property of others and who are bent on damaging these public telephones, should be prosecuted. This Parliament should provide that if such a person is under the age of 18 years, females excluded, corporal punishment must be imposed. Hon. members may raise their eyebrows and think of it what they will, but I want to suggest that persons who damage these telephones so that other persons cannot use them, should be sentenced to week-end imprisonment. If just a few persons were prosecuted this vandalism which is now running riot would be stopped. I also want to plead that public telephones should be provided at all police stations and fire stations and in the entrance halls of all large buildings, and that the presence of a public telephone should be indicated by a proper neon sign, because these public telephones render the greatest and most valuable service to the people of South Africa. I should like to see the people get this service, and I should like them to know that when they go to a police station or a fire station, a public telephone will be available there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) always wants to make a joke of everything that is said in this House. He is never serious and never contributes something constructive and all he ever wants to do is to break down and to play the fool. This Parliament is assembled here to make constructive suggestions to the hon. the Minister, and that is why we are having a Third Reading debate. The hon. member never makes a constructive suggestion, because he has nothing constructive to contribute.</p>

<p>I want to submit a plea to the hon. the Minister in regard to another aspect as well. The motor vehicles that are used in the Post Office play a very important role in the postal service. It hurts one to see at what speed and how carelessly these vehicles are sometimes handled. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the time is not ripe for him and the Postmaster-General to consider, when a person is responsible for the driving of a vehicle and he handles it properly, looks after the tyres of that vehicle and keeps the repair costs of the vehicle low, the possibility of a bonus being granted to that person at the end of the year. If we can bring it home to these persons that they must be careful because, <i>inter alia,</i> it is their own taxation money that is used for the purchase of these vehicles, we will all be very glad.</p>

<p>As far as television is concerned, I want to say that it is not the hon. the Minister who has to decide about that, but the National Party. It is no use the Opposition or anyone else trying to force the hon. the Minister in that direction. Like the hon. the Minister, I also say that in principle I have nothing against television. If we could get television in South Africa to-day which would offer programmes of the same high quality as those offered by the S.A.B.C., including Current Affairs. I would be the first person to vote for it. Television can come to South Africa provided it meets the high standards we set as regards the quality of the programmes. Each of us sitting here has to admit that the programmes offered by the S.A.B.C., whether they be broadcast over the Afrikaans, English or Bantu services, are of the highest quality, and therefore all of us should express our gratitude and appreciation to the South African Broadcasting Corporation for the wonderful service they are rendering. We extend our best wishes to the hon. the Minister and his staff in their difficult task of eliminating the telephone shortage and in rendering the best service to the public, and we hope and trust that next year we will all be amazed at what has been achieved, because we know that he and his staff will render nothing but selfless service to the Republic.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. member for Durban (Point) would like to know about this. The hon. member for Brakpan also asked that telephone booths should be installed at every fire station, every police station, and in the entrance hall of every large building. I think that in many cases these already exist, but in other cases where they do not exist, we can consider the possibility of installing such telephone booths there.</p>

<p>As regards the granting of special recognition by way of bonuses to motor vehicle drivers of the Post Office, I just want to say that no bonuses are being paid to them, but that they are specially mentioned in the Post Office Circular. But consideration can be given to this suggestion.</p>

<p>To the hon. member for Orange Grove I want to say that I am really not going to say anything more about the summary of the debate which he tried to make here, because it will only be tedious repetition. In connection with the so-called donation to Malawi, as he called it, this was a business transaction between the S.A.B.C. and the Malawi Radio Service. The equipment was not donated to them but was sold to them, and assistance was rendered with its installation.</p>

<p>Oh really, Sir, I said it was a business transaction. This is only a minor matter. I cannot say offhand whether the service was free of charge, but why does the hon. member want to tamper with the relations between South Africa and its neighbouring states? The hon. member now wants to make a mountain out of a molehill. The hon. member for Orange Grove said I must please come back to certain matters. I did not think he would be so unwise. I shall gladly come back to them. He said I should tell him what he did wrong, and that he was still adhering to that view in connection with the non-White labour of the firms manufacturing Post Office telecommunication equipment. But it is no use the hon. member&#x2019;s pretending to be so innocent. Surely he knows very well what he said. Surely he knows very well that he drew certain conclusions in the Press when he was again competing with the hon. member for Hillbrow in making a statement to the Press. Surely he is aware of the conclusion he drew when he told the country what he did tell it. It is not merely the question he put to <span class="col_2957-2958" refersTo="page_1502"/>me that has a bearing on this matter, or the question he asked the Minister of Mines and of Planning. Surely this is not one isolated matter. He then made a Press statement and said he knew who the guilty man was who was responsible for this telephone shortage of 72,000. He said he suspected that the difficulty was that we could not get the equipment in time.</p>

<heading>UNIVERSITY OF FORT HARE BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage resumed)</summary>

<p>Clause 17:</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraphs (b) and (e).</block>

<p>This particular clause deals with the discharge of a member of the staff, appointed permanently and, in the clause as it stands, there are six reasons for which a member of the staff of the University may be dismissed by the council: On account of attaining the pensionable age; in the case of a female, on account of her marriage; on account of continued ill health; owing to the abolition of his post or to any reduction in or reorganization <span class="col_2959-2960" refersTo="page_1503"/>or readjustment of the staff of the University; if his discharge will in the opinion of the council facilitate improvements in the organization of the university by means of which greater efficiency or economy will be effected; and finally, in terms of the conditions of service governing his appointment. Now, in terms of my amendment I propose that paragraphs (b) and (e) shall be omitted. Paragraph (b) reads: &#x201C;In the case of a female, on account of her marriage.&#x201D; First of all, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister one question. During the course of this debate, both in the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage, the Minister indicated on numerous occasions that various clauses are in operation in certain universities, not necessarily in South Africa, but in some parts of the world. I would be interested to hear whether this is a clause which is embodied in many university statutes in other parts of the world, because as far as I am aware it certainly does not apply under the Universities Act in South Africa, and I believe it is quite unique in so far as university legislation is concerned. Not only do I want to ask the Minister that, but I also want to ask him whether, if this clause should be enforced&#x2014;and I appreciate that it is a permissive clause because it says the council &#x201C;may&#x201D;&#x2014;it will not aggravate the existing teacher shortage. One only has to read the recent report of the Commission appointed to investigate the Teachers Training Bill to see in several instances that they say &#x201C;owing to the acute manpower shortage&#x201D;. It seems to me that the Minister is now condoning the introduction of a womanpower shortage, because this is a clause which, as far as I know, has not been embodied in other legislation. Is the Minister suggesting that this clause should be included because he feels that if a woman on the staff of the university, who has given good service, suddenly takes unto herself a soulmate, she may become subject to subversive influences because her husband may have a harmful effect on life on the campus? Because if that is the case, I believe it to be a very weak argument. I think it could apply just as well to a man who is on the lecturing staff and suddenly takes unto himself a wife. I think the Minister is underestimating the influence women may have in the lives of men, if he is prepared to differentiate on that basis.</p>

<p>Then I come to the second amendment, and that is to omit paragraph (e), which says he may be dismissed by the council if his discharge will in the opinion of the council facilitate improvements in the organization of the university, by means of which greater efficiency or economy will be effected. I do not believe that that provision is really necessary in this particular context. I believe that the reasons listed under the other headings are quite adequate and I do not believe that the council should be invested with that sort of power. It does not seem to me to be fair and I ask the Minister to omit these two paragraphs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>At the outset of his argument the hon. member asked the hon. the Minister whether this clause was contained in any University Act, if I understood him correctly, and in terms of his amendment the hon. member then objected to two paragraphs of the clause, i.e. paragraphs (b) and (e). This is somewhat illogical. If he objects on the grounds that this clause does not appear in other university legislation, he should object to the clause as a whole and not only to certain paragraphs. Sir, if I am not mistaken, this entire clause was taken word by word from the Public Service Act. This provision is applicable to and valid in respect of all State institutions. A matter such as the capacity in which a woman may be re-employed after her marriage or whether she may be re-employed in a similar post, or a post of the same nature, is a matter on which the council, in my opinion, should decide. It is not necessary to omit the paragraphs or to provide here that she should be re-employed. The council can decide on that matter.</p>

<p>I do not know what &#x201C;rubbish&#x201D; is seen in this by the hon. member who interrupted me. We know what her attitude is as regards matters in respect of the married woman.</p>

<p>Then I come to paragraph (e), which I should like to read out again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If his discharge will in the opinion of the council facilitate improvements in the organization of the University by means of which greater efficiency or economy will be effected &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, I think this is a very fair provision. The hon. member alleged that this was unnecessary. This is an exclusively domestic matter. Here the council is being empowered specifically to act in this way. I repeat that this is a domestic matter, and I should like to mention one example: If, for example, a member of the staff is inefficient or if a member of the staff neglects his duty, or if as a result of a state of disease he is unable to continue, surely it is necessary for the council to take a decision in connection with that member of the staff, because to replace him with another person will promote greater efficiency or economy. For that reason specific provision is being made for the council to take this task on itself. Throughout the representations made here by hon. members and throughout the arguments advanced here by them, they objected to the powers of the Minister and asked for more powers to be given to the council. In this provision certain powers are being given to the council, but the hon. member still objects to this provision. I simply cannot see how the hon. member can object to certain parts of this clause and not to others.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister took particular umbrage at the remarks I made about this clause when I spoke during the Second-Reading debate on this Bill. He was very incensed because I said that this clause, if nothing else, proved that this so-called university would be nothing but a glorified school. The reason I gave was that this particular clause appeared to be taken holus-bolus from the Coloured Persons Education Act which, as we all know, governs the school education of Coloured children. I do not know whether the Minister in his reply acknowledged the existence of this clause in the Coloured Persons Education Act, but he went on to tell me that this very clause appeared in the University College of Fort Hare Constitution. Also, he made the point, which has now been made by the hon. member for Koedoespoort, that this clause has been taken word for word from the Public Service Act. [Interjections.] Well, let us say that materially it was taken from that Act. I am not concerned about whether it appears in the Public Service Act or not. We are not dealing with the Public Service here; we are dealing with the creation of a university &#x2026;</p>

<p>We are dealing with professional people, expert people, people who are meant to be given responsibility for taking charge of the higher education of the students who go to the University of Fort Hare. We are not dealing with the Public Service. Perhaps that point has not struck the hon. member for Koedoespoort or the hon. the Minister. We are not dealing either with the University College of Fort Hare. We are not creating the University College of Fort Hare by this Bill; we are creating, we believe, or the Minister appears to believe, the University of Fort Hare. Therefore one would expect a completely different set of circumstances to apply to the staff of the university as against the University College of Fort Hare. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument therefore is absurd, and I maintain that my argument holds good that there is no place for a section, which is to be found either in the University College of Fort Hare Act, the Public Service Act or the Coloured Persons Education Act, in a Bill which is creating an autonomous university such as we have heard about from hon. members on the other side.</p>

<p>This does not belong in this particular constitution, and I am going to vote against it, of course. I take exception to the whole clause. I think the whole clause should be reworded to bring it more into line with the Constitution of other universities. I agree, of course, that the two particular paragraphs, which have been referred to, should be omitted. I think paras. (d) and (e) should be omitted as well as para. (b), but let me deal with (b) first, because that incenses me particularly. Just imagine that a female, when she marries, can be kicked out of her post at the university! I want the hon. the Minister to give me the name of any other university in South Africa or elsewhere, Greece notwithstanding, where a woman lecturer, a university lecturer or a university professor, loses her job because she marries. That used to apply years and years ago at the White universities in this country. I can remember when Mrs. Ballinger, I think, suffered the same unhappy fate. Her job at the Witwatersrand University was not only jeopardized when she married but I believe she was no longer able to stay on, or at any rate there was such a threat. Those days, however, have long since passed. This is a modern country and women are employed in every walk of life in South Africa to-day, and to suggest that a woman lecturer at a university or a professor should lose her job when she marries, is an absolute anachronism in this day and age.</p>

<p>I wonder if the hon. the Minister knows where he is going to get the staff from for his universities if universities dismiss women lecturers and professors as soon as they have married. Does he think that there are dozens of teachers lined up, ready to take these jobs? Does he not know about the shortage of staff at every single university, with chairs vacant and lectureships vacant, pinching staff from one another inside South Africa because they are not attracting people from outside. Yet the hon. the Minister has the impertinence&#x2014;that is the only way that I can describe it in this day and age&#x2014;to put this clause in a university constitution. It is a shocking clause, and I might say that paras. (d) and (e) are pretty bad too, because under (d) and (e) there is no security of tenure whatsoever for any member of the staff at the Fort Hare University or any of the other universities which have a similar clause in their constitution. There is no security of tenure because the hon. the Minister can abolish a post if he does not think it is in the interest of the university to retain the post, or he can discharge a person if in his opinion or in the opinion of the council it will facilitate improvement in the organization of the university.</p>

<p>The council, as has been pointed out over and over again, consists of the Minister&#x2019;s appointees, so the Minister has only to say that in his opinion the discharge of So-and-So will in fact improve the organization of the university, or he can say that in his opinion a post which has been created by him should be abolished, and that person then loses his job. There is no security of tenure therefore, under paras. (d) and (e). I believe that any self-respecting staff of any self-respecting university in South Africa would fight the inclusion of a clause like this tooth and nail, and I am going to vote against this clause entirely.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not like this clause. There are many things in it that I dislike. In the first place I do not like the word &#x201C;dismiss&#x201D;. &#x201C;Dismiss&#x201D; has a completely different connotation from what is intended here. You <span class="col_2963-2964" refersTo="page_1505"/>can retire a person; you can terminate his services, but when you &#x201C;dismiss&#x201D; a person it is similar to sacking him and that is not what you are doing here. When a woman marries you do not dismiss her because she has married; you terminate her services; she may not continue. That is the first point I wish to make. I do not like the word &#x201C;dismiss&#x201D;. Sir, let us take para. (e). For what reasons can a man be dismissed? He can be dismissed if his discharge will result in greater economy. In other words, if you want to save his salary, you can dismiss him. He has no security of tenure. The man is told: &#x201C;We want to save the money that we are spending on your salary, so you must get out.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Well, I do not think that is the purpose of a university bill. Surely we must give the man something better than this. It does not help to say that his provision appears in other legislation. Sir, there is another point I wish to make and it is something that I have had on my mind ever since Fort Hare was established, and this is the very clause to which I wish to refer. When Fort Hare was established the staff were classified in three classes; first of all, members of the staff who wished to remain at Fort Hare as a Government institution; secondly, those whom the Minister did not wish to have and whose services he wanted to terminate, and, thirdly, those men who said: &#x201C;I have been a lecturer or a professor in a university; I do not wish to remain in a Government institution.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sir, I am quite certain that these circumstances can crop up again. This is how they were dealt with&#x2014;and that is why I want to deal with the &#x201C;abolition of posts&#x201D; as a reason. The hon. the Minister said to those who wished to stay: &#x201C;You can carry on; you will get your pension rights and everything will continue as if there has been no change.&#x201D; He said to those he did not wish to have, including some people from overseas who had been at the old Fort Hare: &#x201C;I do not wish to retain your services, but I will give you full pension rights and something extra, and a gratuity,&#x201D; they left Fort Hare and some of them left South Africa with their pockets bulging with money. Now I come to the third class. They said to the men, who would not stay, that they would be treated, as far as pension rights are concerned, under the section of the Public Service Act dealing with the abolition of posts, and this is what happened: Those men got their gratuity money&#x2014;that could not be refused&#x2014;but they lost their pension rights.</p>

<p>Sir, that is what can happen here if these men are dismissed under the section governing the abolition of posts. Those men lost their pension rights. I have raised this matter in this House on more than one occasion. Sir, one man lost almost R14,000. He was a great South African, a distinguished man in later life and he was an acting principal. He was one of the seven persons who did not remain. There were six Africans and one white man. They forfeited all this, and for that reason I support the hon. member for Durban (Berea) when he says that the fact that this clause appears in the Public Service Act is not sufficient reason for its inclusion here.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to add a few words in support of what has been said by the hon. member for Durban (Berea) in moving this amendment. As the Committee will probably surmise, I want to deal with para, (b) which talks about the dismissal of a female on account of her marriage. Sir, I am surprised to hear the hon. member for Koedoespoort adduce the ridiculous reason that this is a clause which appears in the Public Service Act as though that is sufficient justification for continuing a system in this country which has become archaic. There is no justification for it, in whatever sort of Statute it appears in South Africa at the present time. It is absolutely archaic. I must say, speaking as a woman myself, that we really think it is time the authorities in South Africa grew up a little with regard to this type of legislation. Sir, as the hon. member for Houghton has suggested, can you imagine anything more ridiculous than dismissing a woman member of the academic staff simply because she gets married, a woman who, since she has achieved that sort of position, no doubt has precisely the same qualifications as her male counterpart or colleague? Can you imagine a situation where in this day and age in any university, if it is going to be a university, a woman is automatically faced with the prospect of dismissal because she gets married?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not automatic.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>It may not be automatic, but I do not even think that it should be included in the Statute. It is ridiculous. It is absolutely absurd. Perhaps the Minister will elucidate, but as I read this clause I imagine that it must apply to the administrative staff as well, because the word &#x201C;staff&#x201D; covers not only the academic staff, but also the administrative staff. Really, Sir, if it is the Minister&#x2019;s intention that clerical staff, or anyone else who happens to be attached to the university, shall be dismissed after marriage, it is quite fantastic. Certainly, in the teaching profession, we know only too well that very often the most highly qualified and experienced teachers are married women who have been teaching for many years. These are the people who are very often appointed on a temporary basis after their marriage. We disapprove of that as well. The hon. member for Koedoespoort produced what seemed to me to be a very strange argument. I do not know what sort of working married women they have in Koedoespoort, but obviously he is not &#x201C;with it&#x201D; at all as far as this type of thing is concerned. This is surely not an internal matter for the council of <span class="col_2965-2966" refersTo="page_1506"/>a university to decide upon. Surely they should not have these powers of dismissal in regard to the women members of staff? We take the strongest exception to this principle. It is time that the authorities in all spheres in South Africa realized that this should remain a personal decision to be taken by the couple concerned. The individuals concerned should be able to make their own decisions, because this is a personal matter. If a woman marries, no matter what her job, or in what capacity she serves, whether it be academic, or professional or in business, teaching, or anything else, the decision as to whether or not she will stay on in that field of activity after marriage, if she is competent in her job, should be an individual decision. It should not have anything to do with the Public Service or a university council or any other governing body. As the hon. member for Berea said, one does not find this provision in any other university statute that I know of. I think that the provinces themselves, in regard to the teaching profession, are to-day waking up to the fact that married women should be appointed increasingly on a permanent basis, if only because of the chronic shortage of staff in the academic field. If that can apply to a school, surely to goodness that principle should apply with even greater relevance to women who are employed by a university, whether they are members of the administrative or academic staff, and irrespective of their colour or anything else. I give all my support to those who have moved and spoken in favour of this amendment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in reply to the question of the hon. member for Kensington, I shall not be satisfied to retain only those few paragraphs. Hon. members from the opposite side who addressed the Committee dealt with virtually the same points. I should like to reply to their speeches point by point.</p>

<p>In the first place I should like to emphasize what was said by the hon. member for Algoa by way of interjection. The hon. member for Wynberg was correct in saying that this provision covered administrative staff as well. I do think, however, that too many members on the opposite side tried to suggest that any woman, i.e. a female lecturer or a female administrative officer, would automatically lose her position on her marriage. That is not what this legislation provides for. This very clearly is a permissive provision in this Act. The words used are &#x201C;kan&#x201D; and &#x201C;may&#x201D;. For hours I listened here to the sacrosanctity of the autonomy of the council. Here provision is being made to enable the council to do this work. Now I know that hon. members will say that the council simply is Michiel Coenraad Botha. I know hon. members will say this. But here it is being provided that the council may do this work. Hon. members will also notice in clause 14 that that very same ogre of whom such a great deal was said, i.e. the Minister, may veto the decision of the council if he wishes to do so. In other words, the council may decide that a woman should retire on her marriage. The Minister may veto that if a replacement for her cannot be found. In terms of the clause it is possible to do so. But hon. members opposite do not argue like this. They merely argue along one line. They only have one way of arguing and that is to hold up their own hypothesis to themselves. The hon. member for Berea asked me where else this practice was to be found. Now hon. members will probably not want to hear, or they will be very sorry to hear, that this very same position is the practice in terms of the statutes of other universities in South Africa. I am not going to mention any names.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to reply to the hon. member for Houghton if she does not want to listen. The position at that university, as I ascertained it to-day, is very clear. If a female member of the staff, for example a woman lecturer or a woman professor, marries, she has to apply anew to be retained in service after her marriage. She is then retained in service on a temporary basis. Now I wonder whether anybody would say that I am making misrepresentations or telling lies. If hon. members accept this their entire <span class="col_2967-2968" refersTo="page_1507"/>analogy that this does not happen anywhere else in South Africa falls away. This is the position as I ascertained it in respect of a university. I can see no reason why I should mention the names of our universities here unnecessarily. This is the factual position, and hon. members opposite may ascertain for themselves whether or not this is so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not ashamed of it, and least of all when it concerns that university.</p>

<p>As I have said, the position is very clear. If a female member of the staff of that university marries, she has to apply anew to be retained in service after her marriage. She is then employed on a temporary basis. I have already pointed out that this clause is permissive. Hon. members on this side of the House pointed out that these measures also applied in the Public Service. The hon. member for Wynberg may scoff at the Public Service as much as she likes. We are used to that. We are quite used to it that she and other hon. members scoff at the Public Service. But in spite of this attitude we have an excellent Public Service. This principle is a general and recognized phenomenon everywhere. Even in the private sector it happens that when a woman member of the staff marries, it does not follow <i>ipso facto</i> that she continues in service on her previous conditions of service. That is also the position in this regard, and I cannot sec anything sinister in that. I can see nothing wrong with that. In the past this position obtained at these colleges as well as at Fort Hare. Some of the colleges requested this provision. For particular reasons some of them requested this provision very specifically.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Berea, as well as the hon. member for Houghton, asked whether there was an acute shortage of teaching staff. We know there is an acute shortage of teaching staff. For this very reason this is a permissive and not a mandatory provision in this Bill. Had it been mandatory, it might have landed us in difficulties. But do you think, Sir, that any of these councils, and particularly the rector, would dismiss any woman who marries from service in a case where a lecturer is not available while the students are in the lecture room and when they know that they do not have a male lecturer or another female lecturer to replace her? Indeed, they would be fools if they were to do so. Why would they do so? If provision were to be made in the Bill that they had to do so, it would mean that we would deny them every opportunity of using their intelligence. But, because of the permissive character of this Bill, we are giving them the right to use their intelligence, according to practical circumstances. And to come and tell me now that they will not use their intelligence really is something in the nature of making too high a demand on one&#x2019;s general knowledge. The hon. member for Kensington raised one point to which I am sympathetically inclined. If the hon. member wants to give me some assistance in this regard, I am prepared to listen to him. This point relates to the words &#x201C;dismiss&#x201D; and &#x201C;ontslaan&#x201D;. If the hon. member wants to suggest anything else so as to phrase this more positively, so that this will not sound so nasty&#x2014;the hon. member said the words &#x201C;dismiss&#x201D; and &#x201C;ontslaan&#x201D; sounded nasty to him&#x2014;then he should do so with a view to the inclusion of his suggestion in the preamble of this clause. Of course, it is not at all the intention to attach a nasty stigma to this as the hon. member alleged. I think these are the only points which were raised.</p>

But, surely, the hon. the Minister must realize that when we plead for greater autonomy for the university and its council, it is within the limits prescribed by this Bill. It is within the limits which will be prescribed in the Act for the University. I do not agree with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument that we are now going against our previous arguments in regard to autonomy. We feel that anybody who is employed by this university will be employed under a contract of service entered into between &#x2026; Mr. Chairman, it is no good speaking as the hon. the Minister is not paying attention to what I am saying.</p>

<p>Surely, the hon. the Minister realizes that anybody employed by this university will be employed under a contract of service entered into between the university as the employer and the individual as the employee. We feel that such a contract of service should be unfettered and that it should be a matter of negotiation between employer and employee. But the conditions which the hon. the Minister is laying down now fetters both the employee and the council. What price his argument now about the autonomy of the council? He is now tying the council because when it employs anybody they are <span class="col_2969-2970" refersTo="page_1508"/>compelled to insert these conditions into any contract of employment. This is not giving any greater freedom to the council. In fact, it is tying greater knots around their autonomy and freedom. The hon. the Minister also mentioned about the women that are being employed and that they can be re-employed. The hon. member for Koedoespoort said the same thing. And I wanted to ask the hon. the Minister the question which he answered for me. They are now going to be re-employed on a temporary basis. This is one of the points raised by my hon. friend the member for Kensington. They are going to lose the pension rights they had prior to marriage.</p>

During the Second Reading debate on this Bill, I said to the hon. the Minister that what he was creating here was not a university as we have come to accept the term in South Africa, but a Government department.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not speaking generally. This is one of the clauses which led me to that conclusion. These terms and conditions which are laid down here make it sound like another branch of the Government service, and this was confirmed this afternoon by the hon. member for Koedoespoort. That hon. member said that this was taken directly from the Public Service Act. If the hon. member for Koedoespoort had taken a look at the Public Service Act, he would have found that they are not the same. The principles are perhaps the same. This brings us back to the very point whether we in this Committee are creating a university or are we creating merely another Government department? I say we are creating merely another Government department, which is not in the best interests of the people whom we are trying to serve, namely the Bantu people generally and in particular the Xhosa people. It is not in their best interests that we should merely create another Government department, another section of the Department of Bantu Education for them. Let us create a university and let us give them the rights of a University.</p>

Perhaps he is frightened that some women&#x2019;s organizations might start agitating about this, that the Vrouefederasie or something might start agitating against it.

<p>It may be the Black Sash. Who knows? I do not know what university it is. But it is certainly not a clause which is likely to be approved by any women with any pretentions at all to academic training. Every answer that the hon. the Minister gave us was not a positive stand in so far as this clause is concerned. It was a defence. He kept on telling us that it was permissive. We all know it is permissive. The word &#x201C;may&#x201D; means permissive. We know that. But the point is that it should not be there at all. There should be no possibility of any woman being dismissed because she has committed matrimony. That is the point. And whether it is the council of the hon. the Minister or whether the Minister has the right to veto any council decisions, is quite irrelevant. The point is that this does not belong in the statute of a modern university. I should be surprised to find that any of our other great modern universities have this in their statutes. I do not believe that changing the word &#x201C;dismiss&#x201D; to &#x201C;discharge&#x201D;, &#x201C;kick out&#x201D;, &#x201C;fire&#x201D;, or any other word you may care to insert, is going to make the slightest difference. It is a question of calling a rose by any other name and all that jazz. It means the same thing. It means the woman loses her job or may lose her job if the council so decides and the Minister does not veto that decision. I am afraid, therefore, that the omission of the word &#x201C;dismiss&#x201D; and the insertion in the place thereof of &#x201C;discharge&#x201D;, or any other word that the hon. the Minister is contemplating, does not make the slightest difference to my basic objection.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have some sympathy with the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Houghton in connection with the position of female members of the staff. One is coming to realize more and more to what extent women are beginning to enter in ever-growing numbers the academic sphere of our universities, that sanctum which used to be the virtually exclusive domain of the male, and that they are doing very good and useful work there. One should like to give them some degree of continuity in those positions, but now hon. members cannot say that this clause does not belong in the statute of a modern university at all. This has actually been a traditional practice throughout the years. I may be wrong, but I think that as far as the Afrikaans-language white universities in South Africa are concerned, this is a traditional practice. It goes without saying and it most definitely is so that when a woman in such a position who is a useful and satisfactory worker, enters into <span class="col_2971-2972" refersTo="page_1509"/>a marriage, her appointment will most definitely be reconfirmed. But this will be done on a temporary basis, because a married woman is, from the nature of the case, a temporary employee.</p>

<p>Why hon. members on the opposite side of this House are making such a fuss about this clause, I really do not know. I think this clause is very fair and reasonable. If I myself were in charge of this, I would perhaps have added a great deal more to this. It is not an easy task to dismiss a lecturer from his post, nor should one want to see that it should be easy to do so. After all, one must afford the necessary protection to these people who have high academic qualifications. But we are living in a time when these people can potentially do a great deal of harm at a university. The story is told of a professor who went fishing regularly and never attended his lectures. The council cannot dismiss him. No provision was made for his dismissal. The story may be a fabrication, but this can happen. To this one would be able to add that a person could be dismissed on account of neglect of duty or on account of intentional and malicious disregard of council decisions. I have in mind something of this nature which will afford the council increased powers. And at the back of all this there still is ministerial protection. If the council were to decide to get rid of a difficult person, he could always still appeal to the Minister. Therefore he does have this strong protection. I really think this clause does not go far enough.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, those of us who have been employed in the profession of education know that when we accept a post we enter into a contract. There is an employer and an employee. Now, if this is part of the contract it means that the discretion rests only with the employer at any time. He can decide to dispense with the services of the employee. I know it is sometimes argued that when a man accepts a post he does so under these conditions. But it is not a fair condition to impose when the man is employed. That is the point I wish to make. And, therefore, I think the hon. the Minister will be very well advised to accept the suggestion I made, namely that he should retain those three, namely (a), (c) and (f). I think that should be sufficient for him. It will cover all that he requires, and if the hon. the Minister is not prepared to do that, I think we must vote against the clause.</p>

<p>With respect, Sir, you have not heard me yet. What I want to say is that that is in fact not so. They are not exactly the same. And there is a very important difference. I think the hon. the Minister might well think whether he should not in fact import the provisions of the Public Service Act as being much better than these provisions in this Bill. I am not detracting at all from the argument that it does not matter what is in the Public Service Act, because that Act does not apply to a university. But what are the provisions in the Public Service Act? I am reading from Butterworths Consolidated, volume 17, page 239. The Act provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A female officer (other than a member of the services) who marries shall be deemed to have retired voluntarily from the public service in contemplation of marriage with effect from the date of her marriage, or if she has discharged her duties on that day, with effect from the day following the date of her marriage &#x2026;</block>

<p>It says so. The effect of this is if there is no recommendation from the Commission and the Minister or Administrator, whoever it may be, does not approve, then she is deemed to have been discharged on that day, she is deemed to have retired voluntarily, at any rate her services <span class="col_2973-2974" refersTo="page_1510"/>cease. But if the Commission makes such recommendation and the Minister of the department concerned, or the Administrator, approves, then she continues. At least she can find out whether that recommendation and approval are forthcoming before she gets married. This is the point. Surely, that is the least a woman is entitled to know. She is entitled to know whether she is to be retained. The Minister&#x2019;s suggestion puts her in this position that she has to get married, while she does not know whether she will be retained. It may be terribly important to the contraction of the marriage for her to know whether she has got this job or whether she has not, whether in the circumstances she can stay on or not. But she cannot ascertain what will happen. She has to take a chance and hope for the bounty of the Committee. But in the civil service she is able to apply beforehand for a recommendation from the Commission and get the approval of the Minister, and so, before she gets married, she knows that she will be retained in the service. Does he not consider that something like this should be in the Bill, in all fairness to women on the staff who want to get married? In these days it is very important for women when they first get married to have employment, and it is a very important part of the contemplation and the consummation of marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I replied so fully to all points of view that I really cannot add anything new in connection with the matter advocated by the hon. member for Berea. I said very explicitly that the services of a woman could be retained, although not on a permanent basis. To that I added that this would be nothing unique in our case, as we also had these circumstances at some of our white universities in South Africa. I said that would be on a temporary basis; I said the Minister could veto this if it was in the interests of the institution to do so; I said that I had every confidence that the councils would act in the best interests of the universities, etc. I have no new argument with which to serve the hon. member; I have said everything possible. I regret that I cannot reconsider the point. The colleges considered these aspects very carefully and they asked for them.</p>

<p>Clause 18:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, a little earlier in the debate the hon. the Minister took umbrage when I referred to the fact that after appointing the council, he then proceeded to go ahead and pass a vote of no confidence in that council. This is the clause which I should like to dub &#x201C;the no confidence in the council clause&#x201D;. As I said, and as we know from the debates on previous clauses, the hon. the Minister appoints all the members of the council, in effect. In terms of this clause he is taking away all the powers they have, and takes a power by which he can after he has taken the full responsibility for appointing those people, control them even further. <span class="col_2975-2976" refersTo="page_1511"/>In terms of subsection (2), if in the opinion of the Minister any staff member has committed an act of misconduct and the council fails to do so, the Minister may direct the council to institute an inquiry. If after directing them to institute an inquiry he is not happy that they will take the necessary action, he takes the power, according to subsection (3), either to approve of the action which they contemplate or to direct that they shall take such other action as he might consider necessary. He is taking the powers of the high priest of Fort Hare. This is the reason why I said that this Bill is not giving autonomy to the university. It is no extension of rights to this university college and creating of it a university. It is really taking more administrative control on the part of the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must record my objection to this clause. I really cannot imagine why the hon. the Minister has taken it upon himself to supersede the right of the council to exercise control over its staff, to investigate misconduct or inefficiency on the part of its staff. It seems to be a very highhanded clause indeed. Even if the council has investigated and has decided what action it should take against a member of the staff, if in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s opinion that action is not sufficiently drastic, or is too drastic, he can reverse the decisions of the council in regard to its own staff. I do not know whether this is a clause common to our other universities. I doubt very much that it is so. This means too that there is no right of appeal. At all other universities, if a member of the staff is dismissed by the council, that staff member has the right of appeal to the hon. the Minister of National Education. But in this case, by virtue of the fact that the hon. the Minister sits in judgment himself, there is, of course, automatically no right of appeal whatsoever. I believe, too, that this denigrates the status of the university, and I wish to record my objection to this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot accept the statement of the hon. member for Houghton and other members on the other side that this clause is not compatible with the work of a university as is the intention of the Bill. This clause is taken over exactly as it stands from the legislation concerning the university colleges. It has been inserted in this Bill at the explicit request of the councils of all the colleges. As I have said before, we have consulted and negotiated with them with regard to these Bills, and they have definitely asked for the retention of this clause as it appears in the existing legislation. I just cannot accept the complaints of hon. members on the other side, because this is being done on the request of the councils. They really should know better than we do.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has justified this clause on the grounds that this is the law as it stands at the moment with regard to the colleges. Surely, the whole object of this Bill is to elevate the colleges to university status. Here we have a long clause giving the Minister power to interfere with what would normally be the functions of the council. There are four subsections to the clause, laying down in detail how the Minister can go about it. Then the Minister still justifies it on the grounds that this was acceptable to the colleges which are not yet universities. The Minister should realize how very far the provisions of this clause differ from what one finds when it comes to the appointment and dismissal of staff members at a proper university, one of our white universities, for example. I want to quote from the Rhodes University Act in this connection. This is what it says about appointment and dismissal of staff. It says that professors, lecturers and other teachers at the university shall be appointed by the council after consultation with the senate or with such faculty or committee thereof as may be appointed for that purpose by the senate. Then it goes on to say that the conditions of service of members of the teaching staff shall be prescribed by the council, provided that the discharge from office of any such person who has been permanently appointed to a post by the Minister shall be subject to a right of appeal to the Minister. Here exactly the opposite is taking place. There is no right of appeal to the Minister given and the Minister is taking the right to interfere in the affairs of the university. I want to ask the Minister this. In line 20 there are the words &#x201C;who is alleged to be inefficient or whose conduct is alleged to be unsatisfactory&#x201D;. From whom are these allegations going to come?</p>

Who is going to make these allegations? Will it be the council or the senate of the university? This opens a tremendously wide field for people to go running to the Minister to make allegations about the conduct of the staff. Or is it the Security Police who will allege that his conduct is unsatisfactory? I think the Minister should think again about this matter.</p>

<p>I do not know what suspicions the hon. member for Albany has in regard to people who can allege all sorts of things in connection with the members of the staff at universities, but surely we must have the trust in the council to know that they will not just listen to any sort of gossip that reaches them. I think we can accept that these university councils are responsible bodies who will be able to protect their staff against gossip which should not be taken any further. If there is a proper allegation coming from proper persons, then they are the persons to go into it and this is the procedure laid down here. Besides, in subsection (4) there is still this overriding responsibility on the Minister to table all those reports here in both Houses so that he can be taken to task if he allows something improper to happen at the university.</p>

<p>At the Second Reading I referred to a case which occurred at Fort Hare. On several occasions in the House I raised the matter under these regulations and eventually the lecturer had charges laid against him and an investigation was held by the council. After I had even asked on the Minister&#x2019;s Vote for a copy of the proceedings and received them, I am still convinced that that man did not get what I would regard as a fair deal. I say he was not tried by his peers to begin with, although his peers were in the advisory council. They were in the advisory council, but they were never consulted. Why have an advisory council and all this paraphernalia we have here and then have this man tried on a charge which I think could not be substantiated? Of course I did not have all the evidence and I could not decide, but I am quite convinced, not that there was a miscarriage of justice&#x2014;I would not say that&#x2014;but that there was not a complete investigation as there should have been.</p>

<speech by="#engelbrecht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. members opposite are trying to arouse suspicion where none really exists. This clause deals with the incompetence of a staff member, or with his misconduct. Those are the two matters at issue here. After all, there must be some or other form of machinery by means of which the university authorities can rid themselves of a man who is incapable of doing his work. Or must he be kept on there and protected, and must the taxpayers&#x2019; money be wasted in this way? The question of misconduct can also crop up and there must be some way in which the university council can take steps against a person who commits a misdemeanour. If, for some reason or other, the university council perhaps does not deem it advisable to take steps itself, a stage must be reached where the Minister can act and get rid of the person, or order a university council to do so. After all, this is a very necessary clause. I cannot see how there can be any suspicion in regard to it, or that any unjustifiable or unfair steps can be taken against any person. The Minister is after all the responsible person, who, here as well, has to answer for any steps he may take in that regard, and he can be hauled over the coals here if he were to take any irresponsible steps. That is why this clause, in my opinion, is essential.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has been at great pains to say that the council should be trusted and that the council can run this matter properly, and one should not worry at all, because after all there is the council. But whether the council will perform its duties in the way one hopes it will, having regard to the way in which the Minister will appoint it, is another matter. But if one looks at the proposed section 18 (2)&#x2014;this is after the Minister&#x2019;s pious words about the council&#x2014;one sees that it says that if in the opinion of the Minister any staff member has committed any act or omitted to do any act and thereby renders himself liable to a charge of misconduct or inefficiency in terms of his conditions of service, if the council then fails to institute an inquiry within a month after the Minister has asked them to do so, then the Minister himself can institute an inquiry. I find it rather interesting to find a provision like this when the Minister says that we can leave it entirely to the council. If the council is there and they know what is going on and they are running the show, how is the Minister going to have an opinion? From whom is he going to get the information to form an opinion which is different, obviously, from the one the council has? The Minister has in mind that his opinion is going to be a different opinion from that of the council, these people whom he says are there on the spot and know what is going on and who must run the show. But he contemplates a situation where he, the Minister, will have an opinion as to whether there is misconduct whereas the council, not only having had the matter brought to their attention, and therefore having examined it, nevertheless refuse to hold an inquiry, despite the Minister&#x2019;s opinion. I find this rather interesting. How is the Minister then going to have an opinion which is worth anything if the council disagrees with it? It is bad enough having a council which is entirely appointed by the Minister, but when the Minister cannot even trust the council to deal with matters of this sort, matters of internal discipline, I think things have come to a very sorry pass. That is why the hon. member for Albany, quite properly, asked who will do the alleging in relation to the inquiry under subsection (1). <span class="col_2979-2980" refersTo="page_1513"/>Who alleges that the man is inefficient, and how is the allegation made, and is the person against whom the allegation is made given any notice of it? Does the allegation have to be in writing or can it just be verbal? It is no good the Minister just sitting there. I hope he will give an answer to this. We want to know what sort of action the Minister contemplates and what events will arise which will cause him to use these extraordinary powers under subsection (2).</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) is being either very na&#x00EF;ve, or ignorant or wilful. The hon. member has of course absolutely no experience, and will never have any either, of what happens in a Minister&#x2019;s office. If it were possible for him to work in a Minister&#x2019;s office for only a week, even if it were only as a messenger, as the hon. Minister of Transport is saying here, he would know that a regular stream of information reaches a Minister. Of course, a lot of this information is anonymous and this is thrown away, because the complaint of a coward who does not want to sign his name to that complaint must be ignored. But there are complaints from Members of Parliament, members of provincial councils and from leading members of the public and it is the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility to examine those things well, and the Minister is learning all the time. The Minister has a Department with experienced officials who can investigate these matters for him. The Minister has officials of his Department and leading members of the public on those councils. It could happen that a responsible person&#x2014;I am not talking about irresponsible persons now&#x2014;brought in a complaint on the grounds of facts which the council did not have at its disposal at all. Then the Minister is shown the way of following it up. But the hon. member ought to know that when such complaints come to a Minister&#x2019;s attention, he will at least have the sense of responsibility as a Minister, who can be called to account in terms of subsection 4 in this House, not to react unthinkingly to any nonsense or gossip and dismiss people from their posts. That is why the Minister can take steps if he is convinced that he has been furnished with the facts which were obviously not before the council or which were to the best of his knowledge not before the council, because the Minister has the Secretary of his own Department sitting on that council and he can form an objective opinion as to whether the facts were before that council, apart from the chairman of the council. If the Minister knows that such facts were not before the council, he can say to the council: Other facts have been submitted to me than were before you. The council can then be furnished with all the details and it can be said to the council that despite its former decision not to have an investigation made it must now have an investigation made. I can see nothing wrong with that. After all, a Minister will not level a new charge against a person every week.</p>

<p>But the Minister goes further, as the hon. member for Durban (North) pointed out: Under subsection (2) he takes the power that if he considers that the council has not taken the appropriate action, he can then direct the council or compel them to hold the inquiry. But unfortunately the hon. member for Durban (North) did not take this matter to its conclusion. Under subsection (3) the hon. the Minister need not even accept the recommendations of the council after their inquiry. He can direct them to do something else which he considers should be done, and he can do so, I would venture to suggest, without conducting an inquiry. Let me quote the whole subsection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On receipt of the record and report referred to in subsection (2) the Minister may approve the action contemplated by the council or direct the council to take such other action as the council may lawfully take against the staff member concerned in terms of the conditions of service governing his appointment, and the council shall thereupon take such action.</block>

<p>Even if the council does not want to take that action, even if the council does not deem <span class="col_2981-2982" refersTo="page_1514"/>it advisable or necessary to take that action, this Minister takes the power to compel the council to take that action, whether he has conducted his own inquiry or not. That is the point, Sir. The hon. the Minister says that the safeguard lies in subsection (4), which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A report of any action taken in terms of subsection (3) shall be laid by the Minister upon the Table of the Senate and of the House of Assembly within 30 days after the taking of the action, if Parliament is in ordinary session or, if Parliament is not in ordinary session, within 30 days after the commencement of its next ensuing ordinary session.</block>

<p>This is another one of those clauses which merely corroborates my contention that what we are creating here is merely another Government Department. We find that in terms of this clause, a member of the staff of the university may, with his own consent&#x2014;I am prepared to concede that point before hon. members on the other side start jumping up&#x2014;be seconded either for a particular service or for a period of time to the service of any office, department or administration of the Government of the Republic, including the Railways Administration, a provincial administration and the Administration of the territory of South-West Africa or of any office, department or administration of any other Government. In effect this means that the staff of this university&#x2014;and I guess that it refers to academic as well as administrative staff&#x2014;can be seconded to other departments.</p>

<p>I emphasized it. I accept that it can only be done with his own consent, but that does not alter the position at all. This merely strengthens my argument. During the Second Reading debate the hon. member for Cradock claimed that this clause gave the hon. the Minister the power, if he so wished, with the consent of the member of the staff concerned, to second him to another Government. The hon. member&#x2019;s argument was that he can be seconded perhaps to Lesotho or Malawi or some other Government for the purpose of establishing a university. Sir, I do not see that in this clause, but let us hear what the hon. member has to say about this.</p>

<p>Sir, this is one of the factors which I deplore in this Bill. I accept and I welcome the principle of creating a university for the Xhosa people, but this is not doing it; this is merely creating another Government department and narrowing even further, by control, the education of the Bantu people.</p>

<p>To give out that this clause is making public servants of the academic staff of Fort Hare is an absolutely foolish and ridiculous argument. In the first place this has to happen with the consent of the member of the staff himself. This clause has been inserted in the Bill for one reason only, and that is that if a lecturer at a university wants to do certain research at a Government Department, he is removed from the paysheet of Fort Hare and placed on the paysheet of that Department in which he is serving as he is rendering certain services to that Department. There is nothing sinister in this. The Minister does not have any power to take this man from his position and to place him in the Department of Bantu Administration and to tell him that henceforth he will be a public servant. The clause does not give him the power to do so This can only happen with the consent of the member of the staff concerned. What justification is there then to accuse us of making public servants of the academic staff of Fort Hare in terms of this clause? I think it is a foolish and ridiculous argument.</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall be registered as a matriculated student of the University unless &#x2026; (c) he has complied with such other conditions as the council may prescribe by regulation.</block>

<p>Sir, I do not see any reference to this particular clause in the Universities Act and I wonder whether there is any intention to lay down conditions which will allow the admission of students with an examination qualification lower than matriculation or matriculation exemption. I think we have a right to express concern in regard to this clause because already there is a high proportion of students at these Bantu university colleges who are not matriculated or matriculation exemption students, and I believe that if we wish to maintain the high standard of the university, this is one of the cardinal aspects that should be accepted. I would welcome the Minister&#x2019;s explanation as to the reason for the inclusion of this paragraph and I should like to hear whether my interpretation of it is correct.</p>

<p>No, not suspicious. This clause does not include what practically every other university in the country does have included in its statutes and that is a conscience clause. In other words, in this clause which gives very wide powers indeed for exclusion of students, there is no proviso that a student may not be excluded on the ground of religious beliefs.</p>

</speech>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is not out of date at all; it is very relevant. The hon. member should hear some of the remarks that I hear in this corner of the House and then he will know that it is very relevant indeed. The conscience clause in the statutes of the other universities reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No test of religious belief shall be imposed on any person as a condition of his becoming or continuing to be a graduate of the university or a professor, lecturer, teacher or student of the university, or of his holding any office or receiving any emolument or exercising any privilege therein, nor shall any preference be given to or advantage withheld from any person on the ground of his religious beliefs.</block>

<p>Sir, there has not been one word of explanation in this regard from the hon. the Minister in introducing this Bill. It was one of the points that I raised during the Second Reading debate, and I raise it now because it is relevant. This clause gives the council the right to limit the number of students, which is correct because quite obviously if the facilities are not available then the council must have the power, with the approval of the Minister, to limit the number of students. I understand that that may be necessary because there may not be the necessary facilities to accommodate the vast numbers of students who are going to apply for admission. I do not think that the University College of Fort Hare, which will now become a university, is in fact going to experience any such difficulty, because obviously there are not going to be sufficient matriculated students to stampede the university. But the conscience clause is omitted here. Although the Minister has the right to exclude students, in fact they can select from among those students who have applied for admission, those who shall follow a certain course. Apart from RAU and Potchefstroom, which have no conscience clause, all the other universities have it in some form or another. In the Statutes of the Orange Free State University it is there in its entirety. Even at Potchefstroom it applies to the students but not to the staff. I think Port Elizabeth retained the conscience clause.</p>

Has it been such a tremendously hindering factor in the development of the University of Port Elizabeth? I do not think so. Apart from RAU, this will be the only university, other than the University of Potchefstroom which did retain it in some form, which omits the conscience clause. I wonder if the hon. the Minister would tell us something about that aspect of this clause?</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I really want an interpretation from the Minister. I refer to subsection (1) (b), the conditions under which a student may be registered. Paragraph (a) says that the student must have the matriculation certificate. Paragraph (b) reads &#x201C;that unless he is a graduate of a university institution or has been admitted by a university institution to the status of a graduate&#x201D;, he shall not be registered as a matriculated student of the university. What is a &#x201C;university institution&#x201D;? According to the definitions, a university institution means any university established by Act of Parliament. The Minister of National Education has come along with a new definition. He says a university means a university established by Act of Parliament but does not include any such university which in terms of the relevant Act of Parliament has been established to serve a Bantu national unit. Apparently he does not recognize that this is a university. So, when a graduate from Zululand comes along, they can say: &#x201C;In terms of the definition of &#x2018;university&#x2019; which the Minister of National Education is going to give us, the institution you attended is not a university.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall deal with the last question first. I am aware of the new definition of the Minister of National Education which applies to the other universities. As a matter of fact, the need for that definition really arose, in a way, as a result of this Bill. According to my information, the expression contained in clause 20, which is defined in clause 1, applies to all institutions which are universities. As the hon. member should remember, it may even happen that a non-White is allowed to take a certain degree at a white university. If he then wants to return to Fort Hare, it should be possible for him.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Houghton, who spoke about the conscience clause, knows the answer to this question. She is quite knowledgeable enough to know the answer to this question. She knows that in this country we already have other universities for the white community which do not have the conscience clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the paragraph is not intended to provide for that. It may be that, in the case of certain courses, a certain grouping of matriculation subjects could be found to be very necessary. In paragraph (a), for instance, the council is empowered to require a certain percentage pass at matriculation level. I may add that we do, of course, allow holders of the senior certificate to attend the university colleges and also the universities. That is to say, persons who passed Std. X without obtaining a matriculation exemption, may also attend these universities. But that is nothing new in South Africa. At Stellenbosch there are at present almost 400 such students taking certain diploma courses. There are such students at the university colleges and I hope that we shall also have them at the universities.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am surprised at the hon. the Minister for advancing such a childish argument. Freedom of speech does not mean the freedom to shout &#x201C;fire&#x201D; in a crowded cinema. However much I might protest that I am in favour of freedom of speech, I am not in favour of people being allowed complete licence, and he knows that. Equally, Sir, autonomy of a university does not mean the freedom to exclude people on the grounds of religious belief, or the freedom to practice discrimination on the grounds of prejudice of any kind. The conscience clause applies to every other university, barring one, <span class="col_2987-2988" refersTo="page_1517"/>and in part to another, which is a university specifically devoted to religious teaching, namely Potchefstroom. But even at Potchefstroom this clause applies to students, although not to staff. The conscience clause applies to every other university, with the exception of R.A.U. The universities willingly accepted that restriction on their autonomy. The hon. the Minister should know that, and he does know it. I do not for one moment accept this sort of garbled argument which tries to turn the onus back on me to prove that I am being illiberal or that I am removing autonomy from the universities when I say that this clause is objectionable to me, not so much for what it contains, but for what it omits.

<p>There is another aspect which has not been touched upon during the discussion of this clause. In terms of subsection (4), the council may, after consultation with the senate and with the prior approval of the Minister limit the number of persons who may be permitted to register for any course. I do not really follow the reason for such a provision in a Bill of this nature. I know that if, for example, there is accommodation for only 100 students, the number of students who will be able to register will be limited to a hundred. That is obvious. But is there not more to this provision than just the question of accommodation? I wonder whether this will not allow channelling to take place. Is the Minister not giving the council the power to channel the development of these people along certain lines by giving the council the power to limit the number of persons who may be permitted to register for any one course? I shall be glad to hear from the hon. the Minister whether this is intended to channel the development of these people along particular lines.</p>

<p>There is another question I should like to ask. This subsection goes on to state that the senate may select from among those persons qualified to proceed to such course the persons who shall be permitted to register therefor. I wonder if the hon. the Minister could tell us on what terms and conditions such a selection will be made?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by sympathizing with that hon. member, because obviously he knows absolutely nothing about the way in which a university functions; neither from hearsay nor from direct experience. A provision of this kind is applied at every university in our country. There are facilities which must be used and one cannot allow twice as many students in a science laboratory as there are retorts available that is to say, if the hon. member knows what a retort is.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>One cannot admit more medical students than the clinical facilities can cope with. More examples of this kind are to be found. If the number of students has to be limited, it is left to the council of the university to select those that may be admitted. The council should be able to prescribe its requirements. In a case where the council receives more applications for admission than the facilities permit, they may decide to make the criterion for selection 70 per cent at matriculation exemption, or whatever other requirements they may lay down. This is only in order to select where facilities are limited. I think the hon. member did a great deal of harm to the development of the Bantu by insinuating that we are devising sinister schemes and that we are planning the &#x201C;channeling&#x201D; of Bantu students. We have no intention whatsoever of planning sinister channelings of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if one looks at clause 20 as a whole, one finds that it is merely a question of who shall or who shall not attend this university as a student. This clause is not wide enough. It allows too many loopholes. If we look at clause 20 (1) we will see that the hon. the Minister has there put in a clause ensuring that he does not have to discriminate against the Whites. They are already discriminated against. That he felt he should do, but we will discuss that later. The whole of clause 20 deals with the question of who shall attend the University of Fort Hare, which students may be admitted, but it does not say which students may not be admitted. Further, it gives him wide powers&#x2014;too wide. It gives the hon. the Minister power to select on all sorts of grounds. He can even select students by the colour of their hair and if they have lost their front teeth. Some are bound to try to knock out their front teeth; some sharpen them.

<p>This is not a principle; this is concerned with this clause. This is the clause stating who may attend the university and under certain conditions, who may be excluded. We do not want the hon. the Minister to have too wide a range, so we want a conscience clause to be inserted. That will then stop the hon. the Minister or whoever does the selecting, from using religion as an objection. These people are mostly irreligious and have no religion at all, but they do have their traditions and their customs.</p>

<p>I am worrying about these people being discriminated against if they are not Christians or something of that nature. Many of them are Moslems. I do not think the hon. the Minister or anybody else should have the right to exclude a student from obtaining education. After all, he has only one place to go to. Why then should he be excluded only because he has no religion?</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of paragraph (c) of subsection (1):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that no test of religious belief shall be imposed on any person as a condition of his becoming or continuing to be a graduate of the university or student of the university nor shall any preference be given to or advantage be withheld from any person on the ground of his religious belief.</block>

<p>Clause 21:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate I mentioned that I had strong objections to the fact that the University of Fort Hare would to all extents and purposes be a closed university. In other words, the inclusion of clause 21 means that the Minister does not even have the right to admit any white students at all who apply to become students at the University of Fort Hare. The following section, which limits the university to the Xhosa group, does allow the hon. the Minister to make exceptions. He may admit Africans from other ethnic groups and Coloured and Indian students to the University of Fort Hare. But here we have, for whites, a complete and absolute prohibition. In the same way as I was against the closing of the open universities (where non-white students may still be admitted to certain courses with the permission of the Minister), I am also against the provision making the University of Fort Hare into a closed university. I think it will do the students of different races a world of good to get to know and understand each other during their university years. It would do white students a great deal of good to know that there are non-white students Xhosa students &#x2026;</p>

<p>Will you send your daughter over there?</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Certainly, if she wants to go, I shall have no objections whatsoever. If she does not want to go there, she can always say no. This is the same answer I have given to the ridiculous question whether I want my daughter to marry an African. Nobody is going to force any white child to go to the University of Fort Hare or to the University of Zululand and nobody would force my daughter to go there. If she wants to go there, I shall give her the option of going. Does that answer the hon. member&#x2019;s question? I hope it does. I am not asking that this should be made compulsory. I am asking that this should be allowed. It should be the free choice of students who wish to attend a non-White university. There are many reasons why they may wish to do so. They may wish to acquire the languages, which they would certainly acquire in a far better way than learning the language as a foreign language at a white university. They might be anthropologists or sociologists who wish to make a special study of African students at those universities, and they may just decide that they want to go to those universities for the reasons I have mentioned, and that is that they would like to get to know their fellow South African non-white students rather better than they are able to do under present conditions. For those very simple reasons I am going to oppose this clause. I do not believe that a new university like this should have an adamant prohibition against the admission of white students.</p>

<p>Clause 22:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit the proviso to this Clause.</block>

<p>The clause as it now stands reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) of section 2 but subject to the provisions of section 21, the council may approve the admission as a student of the University of any person who does not belong to the Xhosa national unit referred to in that subsection, if the council is of the opinion that the admission of such person is justified: Provided that the first admission of any such person shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</block>

<p>There are three points I wish to raise concerning the clause. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) of section 2, about which we had quite a debate two days ago, the council may approve the admission of somebody who is not a Xhosa, or not a member of the Xhosa national unit as referred to in that subsection, but, of course, subject to the provisions of section 21 which has just been agreed to by this Committee. The second part of the clause says the council may admit such a student &#x201C;if the council is of the opinion that the admission of such person is justified.&#x201D; I wonder what the Minister means by this phrase, what does he mean by the words, &#x201C;If the council is of the opinion that the admission of such person is justified.&#x201D; The third section of this clause is the proviso, namely&#x2014;&#x201C;Provided that the first admission of any such person shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.&#x201D; My amendment seeks the deletion of the proviso. I want to ask the Minister this question outright: has he got nothing better to do than to sit down and decide whether or not to admit a Bantu student? First of all, the Minister must decide <span class="col_2995-2996" refersTo="page_1521"/>whether or not he is a member of the Xhosa national unit, referred to in subsection (3) of section 2, and then he has to decide whether or not he will allow that Bantu to take the course at the university. Why does the Minister want to stick his finger into this pie? Why must he be the one who shall determine whether or not some person who is not a member of the Xhosa national unit shall be admitted to Fort Hare?</p>

<p>I want to discuss further with the hon. the Minister the question of who will constitute persons who belong to the Xhosa national unit. I mentioned half-a-dozen and more surnames to the Minister yesterday, and the persons bearing those names can all be Xhosa-speaking but not all those surnames would belong to persons belonging to the Xhosa national unit. In terms of another Bill, this is going to be a complete and utter mockery. Persons will assume that a person belongs to the Xhosa national unit merely by his association with people who belong to that group. How is the Minister going to decide, how is it going to be applied in practice? As I said earlier on, these two sections are the most ridiculous sections in this whole Bill. The other aspect has to do with the words &#x201C;if the council is of the opinion that the admission of such person is justified&#x201D; in the clause. On what ground is the council going to decide whether it is justified or not? This is something else I should like a reply on from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The most important thing of all, however, is this. We on this side of the House have never regarded education as a privilege, we have rather considered it as a right of all people. This is not merely the adornment of democracy, this is democracy, this is freedom. Everybody should have the right to education to the maximum degree. These universities are the doorway through which these people can pass to become useful citizens in South Africa, where they can make a contribution to the running of our country rather than be a drag on the development of our country.</p>

<p>As I said before, I deplore the lack of choice which the Bantu pople have in their lower education, where it is purely secular, because they can only go to schools, with the exception of three that I have mentioned, which are controlled by the Minister and his department. Here in this Bill we are not only controlling their university education, limiting them to the universities which will be controlled by the Minister and his department, but we are limiting them to only one of five institutions, because certain Bills concerning other universities are before this House, and they have similar provisions. I believe that the Minister concerned in each case can allow the admission of Bantu people to those universities. In effect what we are doing here is this. We are giving a Minister the right, the power, to say to a Xhosa, to a Zulu, to a Pedi, and in other instances, to the Coloured and the Indian, that he shall only go to one university unless he first obtains the permission of the Minister to go to another one. I submit this is completely and utterly unnecessary. I do not know why the Minister wants to involve himself with this matter of deciding which university will be attended by whom.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry, but the amendment moved by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) is not acceptable to me. I am not prepared to delete the proviso. As hon. members know, clause 22 is there to provide for the admission to a university of someone who, strictly speaking, does not belong to that university by virtue of his ethnic group. The council is expected to arrange such matters, provided that the first admission is subject to the approval of the Minister. This is the proviso. There is a reason for this proviso. This matter is left to the council, which must see whether the physical facilities are available, and so forth. As regards the first admission of such a person, the purpose of the provision is to ensure a certain measure of supervision so that people will not be admitted unnecessarily, people who actually belong with another university by virtue of their ethnic group. There may be other reasons why a person cannot be admitted to a certain university, reasons on which the Minister and the Department may be better informed than the university itself, and for that reason it is right that the Minister should have this say in respect of the first application. The hon. member asked on what grounds decisions were going to be taken. This is for the council to decide. The council will approach the matter in a practical way. Let me give the hon. member one practical example. An agricultural faculty is now being initiated at Fort Hare; attempts are being made to establish such a faculty. None of the other Bantu universities has an agricultural faculty yet. Agricultural faculties may still be established at those universities as well. If a Tswana student is very keen to take a course in agriculture at a university, the council will most definitely decide that admission to that university is justified in his case, because he cannot go to Turfloop to take a course in agriculture. The council may therefore decide to admit him if accommodation is available for him. When application is made for the first time the Minister may permit the student to take the course and in subsequent years his admission will only be subject to the approval of the council. This is one example, and there may be others. There may be another university which is the only institution which has a faculty of law. The institution at Turfloop is the only one where Bantu can be trained as pharmacists. If a Xhosa man or a Xhosa woman wants to study pharmacy, the course has to be taken at Turfloop, and such a student will definitely be admitted to that <span class="col_2997-2998" refersTo="page_1522"/>university. This is the reason for this provision and these are the grounds on which the council will decide.</p>

<p>Yes, I read it correctly. I understand the Minister&#x2019;s case in this. My point is this. Why should the Minister trouble himself about it at all? He nominates the council. Surely he can leave it to them. He knows the people on the council, and if the council is going to make any change whatsoever in its policy, the obvious thing to do is to get in touch with the Minister or members of his department and say, &#x201C;We are considering these cases,&#x201D; Surely it is obvious. He nominates the whole council, why then should he have this proviso? That is what I cannot understand.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am afraid the hon. the Minister rather argued against himself when he replied to my representations on this matter. He quoted the case of Fort Hare where they are busy with a faculty of agriculture. I want to congratulate him on this step. I am extremely pleased to hear it. He mentioned a Tswana might want to attend that faculty. My point is, why must the Minister give permission for that Tswana to go there? I want to give him another example. In time, I hope, Turfloop and Ingoya will also have faculties of agriculture, and we will then have faculties of agriculture at all three universities. A Tswana might want to take a degree in agriculture, but why must he be limited to Turfloop? If he feels that the training at Fort Hare is better than that of Turfloop, surely he should be permitted to apply for admission to Fort Hare?</p>
