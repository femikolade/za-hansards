<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Last night when the debate was adjourned I had given the tax figures paid by Bantu to-day and those which will be paid by them from 1970. These figures show that in the category of Bantu with an income below R360 per annum there was a saving of R1 per annum in direct taxation, but that this would be more than eaten up by the indirect taxation they would pay as the result of this purchase tax which has been introduced by the Minister. I had shown further that in the category of income between R361 and R650 per annum the Bantu would pay more in direct taxation, in addition to the added burden of indirect taxation in the form of this purchase tax. I want to say now that the majority of the Bantu, particularly those employed in the urban areas, fall into this category of income between R361 and R650 per annum. But if we go on from there we find that a single Bantu earning R651 would pay to-day R11.50 and will pay in 1970 R6.52, which constitutes a saving; he will pay less. A single Bantu earning R1,001 would have paid this year R54.50, and from 1970 he will pay R12.22, a saving of R42.28. And in the category R2,001 his tax would be reduced from R197.50 to R36.82, a reduction of R160. I have used as my basis of assessment here the P.A.Y.E. tax tables for Natal for the 1969 tax year, and the taxation proposals for 1970, as detailed on page 299 of the Minutes. So here we find the pattern which has appeared for the white man repeated for the black man. We find that this Budget is not only for the rich white man, but it is also for the rich Bantu, and it works to the detriment of the lower-income Bantu. It is a discrimination against them, and particularly against all of those who have incomes below R650 per annum.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say that I associate myself with and support wholly the hon. member for Constantia in his amendment, and I wish to commend again for the attention of the hon. the Minister the suggestions made by my hon. friend as a solution to his problem for this year. In support of this I wish to quote to the Minister a statement which was made to me during the recess by a wealthy trader in Natal, who said that he welcomed this Budget. He said this was the finest Budget he had ever seen, and he was an old man. He said it would save him in direct taxation nearly R3,000 a year, and he rubbed his hands in glee and said that that R3,000 was going to be paid by his customers, the civil servants, the railway workers, the pensioners and the non-Whites.</p>

<p>When that hon. member spoke and criticized the Budget, I thought of a remark which my hon. colleague, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, made yesterday about a boy whose mother asked him why he was pulling the cat around by the tail. The little boy then said: &#x201C;No, Mother, I am just holding on to it; it&#x2019;s the cat that is pulling&#x201D;. This hon. member is merely dragging the Budget across the floor with his criticism, but he did not really have any profound criticism to make. The Opposition had the opportunity of criticizing the <span class="col_3687-3688" refersTo="page_0331"/>Budget, an outstanding Budget in the history of this Parliament, one which is beneficial to South Africa and its people. Here too the Opposition could have shown what their policy was and could have indicated what constructive recommendations they could make. But no, they did not do this. With a singularity of purpose they are still engaged in criticizing South Africa, and I shall give an example. Recently the hon. the Minister of Mining announced that we had struck oil in South Africa; and what was the criticism which these people had levelled in 1967&#x003F; At that time the hon. members for Constantia and Parktown criticized it strongly and said that the Government was wasting money in searching for oil in South Africa. One would have thought that they would have expressed gratitude for that money which was spent, but as yet I have not heard a single word from them in which they have thanked the Government for that search for oil. The hon. member for Parktown spoke in the debate, but he never once referred to that, and it was he who criticized this expenditure most strongly in 1967.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The Opposition criticize what they maintain to be wrong. Let us look at this amendment which they have drawn up. They say that this House should not accept the Budget proposals because, <i>inter alia,</i> they shift an unreasonable burden of taxation onto the working men and women of South Africa. In other words, for those who are not working it is fine; no fault can be found in their case. Then they go further and say that it typifies the Government&#x2019;s growing indifference to the great body of citizens who deserve more consideration. But they have never yet shown where the Government has been indifferent. I want to repudiate this with all the strength at my command. This Government has never acted indifferently towards any citizen of this country, not even towards the United Party and its supporters. Sir, the United Party states that it repudiates the Budget because the Government has neglected to solve the urgent problems of the country, including the manpower shortage. I want to know from the Opposition how they would want to supplement our manpower&#x003F; They are not speaking about manpower training; they are speaking about the manpower shortage. Sir, there are only two ways of solving the problem of the manpower shortage immediately and that is by bringing in thousands upon thousands of immigrants, good or bad, and secondly, by making use of non-Whites. We shall tell the constituents of the country that this is the policy of the United Party, i.e. to make use of non-Whites to crowd white people out of their jobs and to bring in immigrants in their excessive thousands, whether good or bad. But, the immigration policy of the National Party is to want to bring immigrants here on a selective basis&#x2014;the good immigrants and only the good ones.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to quote what the hon. the Minister of Finance said in his Budget speech about the question of sales duty. He said: We know that there are going to be problems; that there is going to be friction; we do not know precisely what problems it is going to present, and then he added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For this reason the possibility is being considered of giving the Minister of Finance the authority at any time, and in anticipation of subsequent Parliamentary approval, to reduce the sales duty on any article.</block>

<p>Why does the Opposition conceal this portion of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech when attacking the question of the sales duty&#x003F; The hon. the Minister stated very clearly that he wanted this right to reduce the sales duty on articles where there appears to be friction, where it appears that the sales duty is going to be injurious to the public, and I want to make the plea here to-day that the hon. the Minister should take this authority upon himself and much more into the bargain. I also ask that he take upon himself the authority to increase the sales duty on any article by not more than 5 per cent without any further approval of this Parliament. Sir, this has happened in other fields; for example, it was done in the case of telephones. This is what I should like to plead for.</p>

<p>Then there is another aspect which I should like to deal with and that is the position of married women. We are grateful to the hon. the Minister for once more having made concessions to married women. We have in South Africa to-day what may almost be described as mania in regard to working women. Everyone wants the women of South Africa to do a greater amount of work; everyone wants married women to work. Here in our country women are even used as traffic inspectors, etc. The hon. the Minister said in this connection: &#x201C;Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour&#x201D;. I want to elaborate on this and state that four are even better than two and that a woman&#x2019;s primary function in life is to look to the growth of the nation, and in this I want to support the hon. member for Algoa in his plea that more should be done to assist newly married couples to have larger families. Sir, we must bring in immigrants, but only to a limited extent; we must grow as a nation through our own flesh and blood. If we let our nation increase in this way we are supplementing our numbers with people who understand our problems, and therefore I want to support that request by the hon. member very strongly. This also brings me to the question of medical expenses. This Budget makes provision for a basic rebate of R150 in respect of medical expenses; this also covers pharmaceutical expenses, etc. This amount is being supplemented by R100 in any year in which a child is born. A healthy <span class="col_3689-3690" refersTo="page_0332"/>person never has medical expenses, although he may perhaps have pharmaceutical expenses. Those in bad health are the ones who have heavy medical expenses and who must also, <i>inter alia,</i> forfeit a portion of their incomes when they are ill. I want to plead that when a person&#x2019;s medical and hospital expenses are more than R150 a year, the full amount of his medical expenses should be deductible from his taxable income, provided, of course, he submits the necessary proof. I consider this to be a reasonable suggestion. It will not entail great expenditure. We who are healthy must look to those who are ailing and who are not as well off.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is another very important matter to which we must give our attention to-day and that is the question of water. I think that everyone will agree that nothing can exist or prosper without water. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs has a great problem. We know that at the moment the Vaal Dam holds only 48 per cent of its water capacity and we know what the state of affairs in the country is; after all the soft rains we have had the world around us is looking lovely. We may have the greatest crops under the sun and our dams remain empty if we do not have good rains. We know that 75 per cent of our industries are concentrated in Johannesburg, its suburbs, the cities of the Rand and Sasol. We also know that 75 per cent of our purchasing power is concentrated there. We consequently realize what an important part of South Africa that region is and we must now ensure that we are able to give the area more water. What is proposed for water affairs in this Budget&#x003F; An amount of R87 million has been voted in the Budget, which is 14.5 per cent more than the amount for the previous year. I want to plead for the hon. the Minister of Finance, in collaboration with other hon. Ministers, to do something to deal with the water crisis threatening us in South Africa. We can only do this by pumping the water across from the Tugela into the Vaal Basin. At the beginning of the year it was announced that the Government had given its permission for this to be done. We know that an amount of R11 million has been provided in the Estimates for the Spioenkop Dam in the Tugela and there is sufficient water in the Tugela to meet this need in our country. [Interjections.] The question is, is there sufficient water, yes or no&#x003F; The extent of the total catchment area of the Tugela is 11,260 square miles and the average annual downflow is 1,800,000 morgen-feet, which is about the same as that of the Vaal River. At 36 inches of irrigation water a year, the 69,000 morgen of available land can receive 207,000 morgen-feet of water annually, with 700,000 morgen-feet of water a year remaining for non-agricultural purposes. If a body such as the Rand Water Board were only to pump 133,350 morgen-feet of water out of the Vaal River, we can see that the Tugela Basin, with a surplus of 700,000 morgen-feet, would have sufficient water for South Africa. I want to plead for plans to be expedited in that respect. For example, the water of the Tugela is sufficient to supply 20 large cities and then there is still sufficient water left to provide for a large city such as greater London. During this year the hon. the Minister is engaged in promoting a water year, and therefore I consider it the appropriate time to tackle this scheme, thereby making our people more water-conscious. At the beginning of his speech yesterday, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) said that when the hon. the Minister announced that a capital gains tax would not be levied, we all heaved a sigh of relief. Well, I did not sigh, but if I had sighed it would have been because such a tax was not being levied. We know that the hon. the Minister has taken a fantastic step with this changed tax system. Everything can surely not be done simultaneously. We know that this is a tremendous thing that is being done. As the hon. the Minister put it, sufficient tax will be collected with the purchase tax to make the concessions which are being granted possible. This afternoon I want to try and make out a case for the introduction of the capital gains tax, which must in fact be introduced. As far as the Franzsen Commission report is concerned, I want to express my sincere thanks to the Commission and I want to say that I think that it has done a very good piece of work. The report is unanimous in respect of the capital gains tax, except for one member, Mr. Mabin, who spoke against it. I can simply not envisage on what grounds he is able to say that we should not introduce such a tax. The following other countries of the world, for example, the U.S.A. England, France, Germany and Sweden have introduced the capital gains tax. The hon. member said in his minority report that there were eight organizations opposed and two in favour of it. This tells me nothing, because those eight organizations may be focusing their attention on capital gains. It still means nothing. A certain accountant attested, <i>inter alia,</i> to the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Two or three years ago I would have been opposed to a capital gains tax but I feel that under the present circumstances the whole trend is to convert revenue into capital gain. This is, for example, evidenced by the request for shares yielding a ridiculously low return. Investment shares are no longer merely a question of the entrenchment of capital.</block>

<p>Such practical experience as I have leads me to believe that a tremendous amount of profit is being made, and it is simply not taxed because it is capital gain throughout. In his minority report Mr. Mabin states that there will be law-suits to determine whether the profit is normal profit which must carry a 40 per cent tax, or whether it is capital gain. Mr. Speaker, at the present moment there are so many court cases and law-suits in progress about capital gain that it just is not true. There is no reason why a man, when speculating <span class="col_3691-3692" refersTo="page_0333"/>in land, for example, should not be assessed by the Receiver of Revenue once he is classified as a speculator. But when a person makes a capital gain, be it by way of selling land or clothes, trousers or shirts, he is enriching himself at the expense of his fellow men. On that greater profit he must pay extra tax. I Simply do not find it morally right that one man should carry the burden. This Commissioner has said that capital gain contributes nothing to the gross national product. Why should the receiver thereof then still be exempted from paying income-tax&#x003F; To me that is all the more reason why he should in fact pay tax on it. Then I want to make a serious plea to the hon. the Minister to introduce a greater measure of capital gains tax next year. This Commission made a very clear recommendation. It is sound and very good.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say the following in the light of the half per cent levy on stock exchange transactions which the hon. the Minister has instituted this year. When an estate agent sells a farm, he imposes a 5 per cent commission. Similarly there are other commissions. It then becomes 5 per cent. Here only 1 per cent is being levied. I should like to plead that if we must reduce this sales duty, a 5 per cent commission on stock exchange transactions also be levied, as is customary. I do not want to depend upon the R341 million which those members want. They want it to be used this year. But where are they going to obtain money next year with which to replace this sales duty, if necessary.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, I want to say thank you for the Budget. We are grateful for the National Party. It is a party with faith and hope in the future. Every Nationalist and every South African also loves the National Party. The public outside no longer has faith in the United Party, nor hope, much less love.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has become very evident during this Budget debate that the bankruptcy of the hon. the Opposition is no longer limited only to representatives in the House of Assembly. They are also experiencing a bankruptcy in regard to subjects for discussion in this House. This becomes very clear if one looks at the amendment moved by them. I am referring to its second leg, in particular, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; fail to grapple with many of South Africa&#x2019;s urgent problems including the shortage of manpower and the plight of the agricultural industry.</block>

<p>Before coming to another very important matter, I want to refer in a few words to this last leg concerning agriculture. I represent an agricultural constituency. Some of my constituents happen to be in the gallery to-day. I am not afraid to say this. We as representatives of agricultural constituencies would most certainly be guilty of a very serious degree of ingratitude-if we did not object to this, part of the amendment, in which it is asserted that no attention is being paid to and no planning is being undertaken in regard to agriculture. We do not want to suggest for one moment that our agriculture is flourishing. But does the Opposition not know that those conditions are caused by circumstances completely beyond the control of any government in the world&#x003F; Is the Opposition not aware of the fact that a commission of inquiry has been appointed by the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to go into agricultural conditions and to see what can be done to improve these conditions&#x003F; This is a highly qualified commission from whom we have already received various reports and to whose reports urgent attention is being paid. Is the hon. the Opposition aware of this&#x003F; I think this is sufficient proof that the agricultural constituencies no longer trust the United Party to represent them in this House. That is why this Opposition has to make use of urban members to-day in discussing agricultural matters. Is the hon. the Opposition aware of the fact that one of our problems is devaluation in foreign countries&#x003F; Are they aware of the fact that this is having a seriously detrimental effect on our exports&#x003F; Do they know that the Government has intervened even there and has taken the necessary measures&#x003F; Of course our farmers appreciate this; of course our farmers cannot be fooled and gulled into believing that the Government is responsible for this state of affairs.</p>

<p>There is another aspect I should like to mention. We experienced the biggest drought ever in the history of South Africa. Naturally the Government is blamed for this now. Naturally it is the Government that is responsible for this drought which ended a short while ago. No, I want to say that the farmers realize that if this Government had not intervened and helped our farmers in such a completely generous and fair manner as it did by way of loans and fodder subsidies, they certainly would not have been able to survive the drought. I have the greatest respect for our farmers who went through this terrible drought and survived it. But both the farmers and I have the greatest respect for a Government and a Department of Agriculture which rendered assistance to the farmers when they were in difficulties. They did not tell the farming population to fend for themselves, but the Government said that agriculture was an important backbone of the country and extended a helping hand to them. We also had flood damages, because we really had strange weather conditions during the past years. There were terrible droughts and when the droughts ended, they ended in floods. We had that flood in the Orange River area. Our farmers were in difficulties then. I want to repeat to-day that our Government came to their assistance at the time. I would be shamefully neglecting my duty if I did not refer to that and did not thank the Government for the very timely and very reasonable assistance which it offered. We know that complaints are sometimes made in regard to the way in which assistance is implemented, but there will <span class="col_3693-3694" refersTo="page_0334"/>always be complaints. There will always be United Party supporters trying to represent matters in a bad light. I want to say, however, that in those areas our farmers are very grateful for the assistance they have received. They are grateful for that assistance which was offered them so soon. We know we have other problems. We have the problem of uneconomic units. The United Party, I hope, is also aware of this. If they are not aware of this, they must learn of it now. These are problems which arose in history and with which the Government is grappling at present. I am grateful to be able to say that the Government, the hon. the Minister and his Department are now paying urgent attention to these matters; that they are doing everything that is humanly possible in order to combat these problems. This Government&#x2019;s greatest achievement in the field of agriculture is perhaps the way in which it has co-ordinated its departments and created machinery in order to assist our farmers. We are grateful for these things.</p>

<p>In actual fact there is another aspect which is more important to me than the ridiculous statements made by a shrinking, or should I rather say vanishing, Opposition as to why they cannot approve this Budget. In the few minutes at my disposal I want to point out today that we in South Africa have to deal with certain wasting assets. I have in mind our gold mines in particular, which cannot remain very productive for many more years. The Department of Planning and other Departments have already furnished proof that they are aware of these aspects and would like to render assistance. In view of this, I should like to suggest that we should now develop that large area known as the North-West and that we should establish an infra-structure there so that that area may develop fully and realize its full potential. In this way it could be a substitute for our gold mines and other mines if those sources of income were to disappear.</p>

<p>I referred in a previous speech to the potential of that area and I said that I hoped to be able to elaborate on that aspect on a later occasion. I want to appeal to the Government to-day to proceed with the drilling programme which it wanted to begin in 1965. I want to state very clearly, however, that I am in full agreement with their reason for not proceeding with the drilling programme at the time. The drilling programme of the Department of Mines in the North-West was cancelled so that the capital which would have been used for that, could be used in the search for oil and natural gases. I think that was a very sensible policy and I now want to congratulate the Government on the first success it has achieved under that policy. Since we have now achieved success and it has been proved that natural gases and natural oils are indeed to be found in the southern hemisphere and in the vicinity of South Africa, I think the Government should now to a larger extent allow private undertakings to take the initiative and should withdraw a portion of those funds so that it may be reinvested in that scheme which was suspended in 1965. It was intended, according to this scheme of 1965, to send boring-machines to the North-West to prospect and to find out what lies hidden beneath the soil of the North-West. One often hears that the North-West is an area of samples since only samples are found there. Anyone who says this is making wilfull statements which he knows he cannot prove. I maintain that practically no boreholes have been sunk in the entire North-West in order to determine what lies beneath the soil. Such boreholes as have been sunk were sunk by the Okiep Copper Company and other companies and these experiments produced very good results. I think we are justified in saying that a drilling programme of this nature can only produce very good results for South Africa, and therefore I want to appeal to the Government to continue this drilling programme.</p>

<p>The second aspect which is of importance is to establish the necessary infra-structure for that area. I must mention in passing that we have had a very sympathetic approach in this regard from all the Departments concerned, but this is an area which can only be developed with great difficulty, as there is practically no infra-structure. By infra-structure I mean, <i>inter alia,</i> transport facilities; there is a constituency of 38,000 square miles with not one single mile of railway. We understand this; I have no quarrel with the hon. the Minister over this, because I know that these facilities can only be created if it is justified by the production. These facilities have to be created now, because we have the potential in that area. We can do it, but it will be very expensive to carry out; not a few million rands, but hundreds or perhaps thousands of millions of rands are required for the development of that area. The infra-structure must be established through planning. We think of transport and we think of power. We are aware of the fact that electricity will become much cheaper there when it is generated by the Orange River hydro-electric scheme. We are aware of the power circuit which is being planned for the future, but we adopt the attitude that all these schemes should be greatly expedited. We simply cannot wait another 15 or 20 years for this, for in the meantime the North-West is being deprived of its treasures to an ever-increasing extent. The rich and precious minerals are being removed, while the low-grade minerals are left behind. In this way an area which is of great importance to the economy of South Africa, is being robbed of its rich and precious minerals and will in due course reach a stage in which no development is possible.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of water. I want to express my gratitude over the fact that one of the first things the Minister of Water Affairs did when he became Deputy Minister, was to visit Namaqualand. He is therefore aware of our problems in this regard. However, <span class="col_3695-3696" refersTo="page_0335"/>I should like to remind the House that when dividing the water of the Orange River, we should not forget that it is here, in the North-West, that the focal point for the future development of South Africa&#x2019;s economy lies. We must take due account of this in dividing our water supplies. This area should not be neglected as far as water is concerned.</p>

<p>As it is, we have serious water problems there. Here I have in mind the mines of the Okiep Copper Company at Nababeep, Karolusberg and Okiep. The Buffalo River, which is our source of water, is not a constantly flowing river. It only flows once a year. This river skipped a year recently, which placed us in the invidious position that the basin in the Buffalo River only had water for another three months. This is subterranean water. Had the position not been relieved within those three months, we would have seen the greatest fiasco in South Africa, because the three mines would have been without a drop of water, and the town of Springbok too. So you can see, Sir, that a very serious situation could have been created. Therefore I am asking that we should make use of these times of prosperity in order to make provision for the future. I am not pleading on behalf of a constituency which is producing nothing. On the contrary. We all know that the Namaqualand constituency contributes a great deal to the Treasury. It is unfortunately the case that only selfish minerals have been mined thus far&#x2014;diamonds, for instance, which do not really stimulate the development of an area, but which do make a contribution to the Treasury. Therefore, in the present times of prosperity, we should seriously plan and seriously continue with the planning which the Government is at present undertaking. Furthermore, these matters should be expedited.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to the Government in this connection. We should think twice before deciding to remove the assets of the North-West from there to another place to be processed. In this connection I have in mind, for example, the iron ore of Sishen. We know, of course, that it is very easy to transport these assets to other parts. These are, however, assets of that area and as such they may be of help in establishing the required infra-structure in that area. If we were now to remove the raw materials of the North-West piecemeal, that area would never come into its own. It would never reach a normal standard of development. Therefore I am pleading that no further assets of the North-West be removed, or, at any rate, as few as possible. After all, I do not want to be too selfish. Therefore, as few assets as possible of the North-West should be removed from that area. Those assets should rather be processed in the North-West and by the North-West so that we may give that area the infra-structure it needs in order to develop further. Everything that has been undertaken there, has been successful. This has been proved repeatedly. For this reason I should, in conclusion, like to appeal to the Government to give the North-West even more attention than it has already done. I thank the Minister and his Department for what they have done for this area thusfar, and I ask them to continue those efforts.</p>

<p>Firstly I want to confirm my impression of what was said to this House by the hon. member for Sunnyside. I take it, if I understood him rightly, that he pleaded for a capital gains tax. Now, the Franszen Commission was divided on this matter.</p>

<p>The Minister of Finance rejected it, and we would like to know whether or not this is another little division in the ranks of the Government. [Interjections.] These little cracks that are appearing cannot always be papered over. I want to tell the hon. member for Sunnyside that he is in fact going along a very dangerous path in a young and developing country. He has come here with a half-baked scheme which he obviously has not studied properly and he presents it to this Minister, who has been careful in the matter, and he wants him to adopt it. I say to the hon. member for Sunnyside that if he wants to drive away overseas capital, if he wants to discourage it from coming to this country, then he must proceed on the lines he has followed this afternoon, against his own Minister&#x2019;s recommendation.</p>

<p>The members on the Government benches are actually scraping the bottom of the barrel in trying to find something to get the D.D.M., the &#x201C;Dank Die Minister Medal&#x201D;. Take, for example, the hon. member for Virginia. He praised the mining houses and he praised the mining industry. He brought out quite clearly how important it was for us in this country to encourage the mining industry to do its very best to keep going, but he had to thank the Minister, so what did he do&#x003F; He thanked the Minister for not taxing it. That was his negative &#x201C;thank you&#x201D;; because they did not tax the mines which he said needed every help, he thanked the Minister.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the hon. member for Stilfontein. He came along with a very good one as well. He thanked the Minister for something that the proto teams were going to receive, and he waxed lyrical. He brought thanks to the Minister on his own behalf and on behalf of his constituents of Stilfontein, but let us see what he thanks the Minister for. This is very interesting. I am going to read from a translation of the Minister&#x2019;s speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The members of so-called proto teams, i.e. teams of employees in the mining industry who may be called out in the event of fire or other emergency at a mine, sometimes earn additional remuneration relating to their fire-fighting or similar work. On this additional income they must naturally pay tax, but since such income is an exceptional <span class="col_3697-3698" refersTo="page_0336"/>accrual of income in any given year it is in my view fair that the rate of taxation should not be raised by it. Henceforth this remuneration will therefore be taxed at the rate applicable to the employees&#x2019; ordinary income before the inclusion of the additional remuneration. This concession does not, however, apply to the stand-by allowance that is paid irrespective of whether or not the employee is doing proto work.</block>

<p>Would it not have been better if the hon. member for Stilfontein had said to the Minister: Give those people a tax-free allowance for their work; it is dangerous work; they are saving lives and they spend hundreds of hours in training for this particular type of work&#x003F; But the hon. member is satisfied that this amount which comes to them for bravery&#x2014;and that is what it is&#x2014;should be taxed. I say to the Minister he must remove that tax entirely and rather give them a bonus for the work they do. The Government does not care about the miners; they will take money from anyone.</p>

<p>It has been said here once and it has been said twice and I am going to say it a third time that this purchase tax which has been introduced by the Minister has not been properly prepared. The hon. the Minister did not consider it properly, because if he had considered it properly, he would not have included some of the items which appear in his schedule. The Minister knows as well as I do what a shortage of manpower there is in the Department of Inland Revenue; he knows what difficulties he has there. He knows how the personnel of this Department is changing almost from day to day. For every 50 recruits he loses 60 employees. He knows the record of his permanent employees; he knows how few people he has who have been in his Department for more than four years, and now he introduces this purchase tax. He will have to have an army of tax inspectors to find out who is doing what and whether the taxes are being levied at the right places. The hon. the Minister can shake his head but he knows as well as I do that he will never be able to implement this tax properly. He will have to depend on the trader to give a correct report of every transaction that he does. Sir, it has been said that this tax is unfair to some of the people who are going to be taxed, and I agree with that. I agree that some of these items are not luxury items or near luxury items, and that they should not be subject to the purchase tax. The hon. the Minister is giving the pensioner R1 per month extra, in other words, an increase of three cents a day. If the pensioner happens to smoke a pipe, one cent out of those three is going to be spent on a box of matches to keep his pipe going. That is how much he is giving the pensioner. If the pensioner wants to have a wash he is probably going to have to pay half a cent extra per day for the soap that he uses. If a young married woman takes her bundle of washing to a laundry, she will have to pay more. Her washing will cost her more whether she does it at home or whether she has it done outside. The tendency in shops will be to increase the prices of all articles. One shopkeeper said to me: &#x201C;To be on the safe side, I think I had better add the tax on everything I sell; otherwise I may be caught out.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister is now imposing a purchase tax on certain articles, but he forgets to tell the House that there has been a steady increase in the prices of dozens of other essential commodities that are used everyday. What is the position with regard to rent&#x003F; The hon. the Minister knows that it is absolutely impossible to-day for a young married couple to-day to buy a house. The price of land has gone up and the price of building has gone up. Whereas a house could have been built a couple of years ago at R5 per square foot, the cost has now gone up to R8 or R9 per square foot. Even if the young married couple can afford to buy a house, they will come up against the very serious problem in furnishing the house now that the Minister has introduced the purchase tax on furniture. Let me take one item as an example. Take a fridge, for instance, which is no longer a luxury but an essential item. Let us say, for argument&#x2019;s sake, that a fridge costs R100 retail. The 10 per cent tax will bring the price to R110; that is the price which the young man now has to pay for the fridge. The young man cannot afford to pay R110 cash so he puts down a deposit and pays off the balance through a hire-purchase scheme. What does he pay on&#x003F; Does he pay on the R100 that the fridge cost or is the trader going to allow him the loan of the R10 tax&#x003F; What is going to happen there&#x003F; The young man will have to pay R110 for the fridge, he will have to pay finance charges, and he will have to pay interest on R110, not on R100. The fridge that originally cost R100 will end up costing this young fellow about R150 or R160 by the time he has paid it off. That applies to all the items in the young man&#x2019;s home. On every article of furniture he is going to buy he will have to pay tax on and the trader will not and cannot be expected to carry the purchaser and lay out the tax money for him. He will make the purchaser pay interest on the tax. If the hon. the Minister wants to do young married couples a favour, he will say that the tax charged on an item sold under hire-purchase agreement must not carry interest at the expense of the purchaser. I plead with the hon. the Minister not to allow traders to charge interest on the purchase tax percentage. But will they do it&#x003F;</p>

<p>Will traders do that&#x003F; It is a serious matter for a young man. Take for instance a house full of furniture, I have estimated at the minimum it must cost R1,200 to furnish a small flat, and if 10 per cent is added right through it means he will have to pay another R120 on that. Is the hon. the Minister going to allow the trader to charge interest on that&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_3699-3700" refersTo="page_0337"/>In these few words I have pointed out how much money is going to be taken out of the pocket of the wage-earner with every transaction that he does. Along with the increase in the general cost of living which will take place because of this tax, we find that other things have also gone up in price. Telephone charges, newspapers have gone up, water charges and rates and taxes are going up. [Interjections.] Of course they are. Then there is the matter of transport, and I want to stop here for a moment. Here the hon. the Minister has aggravated the position. Not only must the man who uses the bus pay more now for fares, but who buys a second-hand car which needs repairs continually&#x003F; It is not the rich man, it is the poor man that does that. It is the man who has to have transport because he might have to go to work before the buses start running. He has got to have that transport. What has the hon. the Minister done&#x003F; He is taxing his tyres and he is taxing all the accessories that may be necessary to keep that little motor-car going. This man is not using it for luxury. When he takes out his little car on a Saturday or a Sunday afternoon it might become a luxury for him, but when he uses it for his work this hon. the Minister is taxing him far above the increase in ordinary bus fares. I ask the hon. the Minister to look at the schedule of articles which he is taxing and I ask him to revise it. He has gone into this quite blindly. He has not got the foggiest idea how much is coming into his pockets from this taxation. He asks for R100 million and he expects to get that, but what is he going to do if he gets R300 million&#x003F; I want to know whether he will promise to give it back to us in some form or other in the following year&#x003F; Will he reduce taxation&#x003F; Or Will he have his election funds boosted up so that in the year before the election he can come like a Father Christmas and say to the voters: &#x201C;Look what a good fellow I am; look what a good Government you have got; I am going to reduce taxation all round; so vote for me!&#x201D;</p>

I want him to use his influence to see that the ordinary shopper is not cheated in his purchases. There are so many gimmicks, advertising pressure groups, and stunts to-day to make the purchaser buy, that I ask the Minister now to introduce some sort of legislation to protect the shopper. For instance if one goes to one of these supermarkets, one is sold a giant size box of porridge. One gets a big box but the contents do not fill the box. That is the point. There is a lot of packing inside, but one only gets a proportion of contents.</p>

<p>Quite a good idea.</p>

<p>I have been reading some criticisms of the gimmicks that have been going on. I should just like to bring this to the notice of the Minister, especially in regard to consumer goods. I quote from what somebody wrote in a paper:</p>

<block name="quote">A luxury flat is often one in which not quite ail the plaster has come off the walls. Certain showerproof wear is for use only in droughts. Some creaseless material remains so only until worn.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister knows that in England they had to introduce the Trade Descriptions Act to protect the purchaser from this unscrupulous type of advertising. I think we might have to do something here as well.</p>

<p>I want to leave that for a moment. I want to deal briefly with some of the anomalies with regard to the manpower question. My hon. Leader has made a clear case to this House how badly this Government has dealt with the manpower shortage. We heard again the same type of conflicting opinions expressed as I have mentioned earlier. The Deputy Minister of Planning wants to force 3&#x00BD; million Bantu, whom he describes as &#x201C;appendages&#x201D;, back to their homelands. He does not consider them to be human beings at all. His opinion has been expressed publicly, namely that whether the homelands are developed or not, they have to go there.</p>

<p>Then we have the enlightened opinion of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. He says that if one wants to get rid of them, unlike the hon. Deputy Minister of Planning, the homelands have to be developed. One cannot send them out until that has been done. I am being kind to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. <span class="col_3701-3702" refersTo="page_0338"/>He says we have got to develop the homelands before we can send these people back.

But what do we have&#x003F; We have two conflicting opinions within the Cabinet, on the fringe of the Cabinet rather. Here is another little crack that has to be papered over. I leave that to the hon. the Prime Minister to sort out. If he can allow these two conflicting opinions within his own circle, then he seems to be easily satisfied. However, it is necessary for him to make up his mind and say which one he supports. Is he going to develop or not develop&#x003F;</p>

<p>Let us assume that the Prime Minister takes the advice of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and starts to develop at a faster rate and at a cost of millions and millions of rand. Let us assume he gets a group of trained Bantu ready to work. It is quite obvious that he cannot possibly employ these in the homelands if he does not have the factories in which to employ them. So, he has perforce to bring them back into the metropolitan areas. Otherwise he would have a group of unemployed, trained unemployed people. Mr. Speaker, when is this bluff going to stop&#x003F; When is all this talk about the fear of integration and the stimulation of integration going to stop&#x003F; What does it all mean&#x003F; On the one hand they are training people for the metropolitan areas and, on the other hand, they tell us that if they work there they can only work there for 12 months. After that they must get out. What is going on in the minds of members of the Cabinet&#x003F; Cannot they be consistent&#x003F; Cannot they be honest with themselves&#x003F; Cannot they say they will train as many people as they can because the population discrepancy in South Africa is such that as the population grows, fewer and fewer white people will be available to carry the skills for the entire population&#x003F; Cannot they be honest and say that because of that they have to train more non-Whites and employ them, because otherwise we shall become a stagnant country&#x003F; We cannot allow people on the Government benches continuing to bluff the people by telling them that this is the only way by which white South Africa can be saved, i.e. through apartheid. We all know that apartheid does not exist. They cannot do that and point a finger at us on this side of the House and keep on saying that we are in favour of total integration. We want to see people work and have sufficient work. There is no fear in this country of any white man losing his job while he wants to work. There is work for everybody. Therefore, all this talk of protecting the interests of the white man is so much hooey that even the hon. Minister of Labour says that as long as there is not sufficient manpower to carry on a trade or profession, he will have to employ non-Whites, because what he says in respect of the building trade must necessarily apply to all trades.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I do hope the hon. member for Rosettenville will not take it amiss of me if I do not react to his argument. The Minister of Finance once said that the speeches of this hon. member are rather difficult to follow, analyze and comment upon. But in passing just this in regard to his comment on the statement by the hon. member for Sunnyside that the implementation of certain measures of this Budget would curb foreign investment. In this regard I just want to say that as long as this stable Government is in power South Africa will remain an attractive and profitable field of investment for foreign capital. With regard to his remarks about all the commodities which will be affected by the levying of a sales tax, he spoke about soap, refrigerators, etc. We on this side are also sorry, and the Minister has already said this, that not all the commodities that we would have liked to have excluded, could in fact be excluded. But what we were entitled to expect from the hon. member for Rosettenville was that he give us an acceptable indication of what commodities should not have been included. If he had done that, he would at least have done this House a service and would have indicated that he could also think positively. There are certain commodities which we are thinking of ourselves&#x2014;for example, the tax on rubber which can, at a later stage, be reconsidered.</p>

<p>In any case it is for me, as it is for others on this side, a pleasure to participate in this discussion. As long as the Opposition is so few in numbers and reveals such a lack of positive approach, it will be difficult for them to indicate weak spots in the Budget such as this one. Then I am not even talking about formulating alternative proposals. Their participation so far in the debate has, as far as we are concerned, been mentally and physically fatiguing&#x2014;so inept was it. If we were to take the conditions in our country into consideration and were to draw a comparison with those in other countries, even the Opposition would have to admit that we have ample cause for gratitude. On the world horizon economic and diplomatic storm clouds are continually gathering. They are ever-present. Sometimes they simply move from one crisis to the other &#x2014;just as the thunderstorms here in the interior of South Africa. However, they always remain <span class="col_3703-3704" refersTo="page_0339"/>typical thunder clouds, heavily laden with electrical tension. There is a rumbling and a roaring; bolts of lightning flash vertically and horizontally, which is an indication for the expert that somewhere they are striking home. Up to now South Africa has been fortunate in not being struck by one of those political, diplomatic or economic bolts of lightning. I am grateful for that, and to-day we take cognizance of that with gratitude. It is on the financial and economical fronts where uncertainty and tension prevail in the world at large. Strong, rich and powerful economic giants like the U.S.A., Great Britain and France are struggling to maintain and keep stable their gold reserves, balance of trade and monetary units. The shaky dollar, pound sterling and French franc are proof of the financial crises which are raging with devastating economic results in those countries. Things are no different on the diplomatic and political fronts. However, we do not have the time to dwell on these things. Greater and smaller powers are rubbing shoulders in such a way that often the sparks are flying and the blood spattering at the same time, to say nothing of the racial tensions and student debacles at the large universities in many states. There is labour unrest, strikes, genocide in North Africa which necessitate tremendous sacrifices in money and human life. How wonderful to be able to live in our own country, South Africa, where there is absolute peace and quiet, and where incomparable prosperity and development is taking place. The Creator has been good to South Africa, and we as a nation of believers want to admit this and pay the requisite tribute and honour to Him. We have just discovered oil here, the basic product necessary for any modern political economy. Everything must be lubricated. This can mean the breakthrough to further and greater economic wealth, stability and economic independence for our mother country. It is a privilege to stay in a country, to live and to work in a country which finds itself in such a fortunate situation. Despite all the Opposition&#x2019;s criticism and negative attacks, they do not want to live elsewhere. Even the hon. member for Houghton is very happy where she is living in safety there in Houghton, apart from the fact the hon. member made an unfair attack yesterday on the amounts of money which have been set aside for defence, the police, prisons and special security services. That was typical of the mentality of the hon. member and her kindred spirits.</p>

<p>There is racial peace and labour quiet. Those are the guarantees for economic growth in any country. Tax concessions have been made to almost all the sectors of our political economy. Mention to me another country where things are going better, and where, in these times in which we are living, more concessions have been made by a Minister of Finance&#x003F; [Interjections.] I challenge the next member of the Opposition to rise and mention to me that country where greater concessions have been made than those contained in this Budget speech. Next to the dispensation of the Creator, I attribute this fortunate state of affairs, in which our mother country finds itself, to the fact that it is being governed by the National Party; that there is a Government in power here, consisting of a Prime Minister with his Cabinet and a Minister of Finance who are entirely unique in the present world set-up as far as Governments are concerned. That may sound like a mouthful, but it is indisputably true. It is characteristic of the history of the Afrikaner in this country and also of the National Party that it has always gone from one great leader to the next. Sometimes we have even had too many great and powerful leaders available at the same time. The United Party cannot say the same. In other countries leaders of potential greatness are eliminated by coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tats, other cunning conspiracies, or even by assassinations. In South Africa the strong men take one another&#x2019;s hands and form a solid phalanx. As far as our Government is concerned they follow the strongest leader, namely the Prime Minister, along the road of growth, prosperity and development in South Africa. Outside this House great and intellectually developed patriots are serving this country from day to day: scientists, educationists, agriculturalists, economists, business men, geologists and others. They are all simultaneously engaged in developing and expanding the South African national structure in as many directions as possible to its maximum capacity. The leading personalities in South Africa have, thank God, the ability to be responsible, to act responsibly and to reflect soberly before commencing anything.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, I am just following my notes. I say that it is characteristic of the corps of leaders in this House and outside that they have that sense of responsibility to reflect soberly before they commence anything, and with such people a country goes far and must prosper. From the nature of the case budgets are always unpopular because there is usually some sector or other in the political economy which is affected in some way or other and which the shoe will pinch in some place or other. Every budget is met with a degree of fear and trepidation because nobody can predict in advance where the tax man is going to pounce. This Budget has, in the short space of a few hours of listening to the speech of the hon. Minister of Finance, converted the tension into calm acceptance. This places the seal on the capable and yet dynamic financial policy of the National Party Government. It can be regarded as a generous gift, an iced birthday cake, which the Minister presented to the Government on its 21st birthday office. For the layman and the ordinary citizen the acceptability of the Budget lies in the fact that the hon. the <span class="col_3705-3706" refersTo="page_0340"/>Minister has succeeded in getting more money available for all the essential services without thrusting his publican hand deeper into the pocket of John Citizen in person. It is important that the Minister has in fact with this changed structure, of a change-over from personal tax and direct tax to indirect tax and sales tax, succeed in creating a wider area of taxation, and more sources of taxation, and does not as a result have to thrust his hand deeper into your pocket as well in order to get the necessary money, but can collect it over a wider field. The introduction of this new tax structure, with sales tax as the principal basis of revenue, is a brave and realistic step by means of which the source of revenue is changed from the directly personal to the indirect. It is important, because it means that the individual can now to a great extent decide himself how much tax he is going to pay. He can do so by buying less. He can do so by buying only what is absolutely essential, and refraining completely from buying luxuries or buying less of these. But that is not all. This Budget unfolds and grows&#x2014;yes, I am going to put it like this&#x2014;just like an early spring flower which permeates the air with its pleasant scent, and it creates an inspiring economic atmosphere. It soothes the feelings of the less well-to-do layer of the population: the farmer in the platteland, the official in his office, the worker, the entrepreneur and many other people on a wide level in all sectors of our political economy, for by means of a changed structure of more indirect taxation and sales tax new sources of revenue are being created, as I have already said, and the range of taxation is being expanded. The result of this is there is no decrease, but an increase of revenue without increased pressure of taxation on the individual.</p>

<p>We welcome the concessions which have been made. I want to mention a few of them. Concessions to the value of R7 million have been made to social and public services pensioners. The benefits in this connection are distributed, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows. There are bonus increases of R1 per month for social pensioners, which brings their maximum pension up to R33 per month, as compared with the R10 per month of the United Party Government in 1947. There has also been a relaxation of the means test for the war veterans of 1914, as well as for the protesting burgers of 1914 and the war veterans of the Zulu uprising of 1906. It will mean a great deal to them and bring to them that pleasant scent, which I spoke about a moment ago, because they need it. A thought has been spared for the Public Service and Railway official pensioners. For married couples the pension has been increased from R94 to R100 per month and for unmarried persons from R47 to R50 per month. Altogether R128.9 million, or R4.45 million more than last year, has been put aside for social welfare and pensions, and yet the hon. member for Houghton complained about this yesterday and said we were spending more on defence than on social welfare and health. I am not saying that we cannot do more for this, but if the amount being appropriated in this connection is not an enormous amount, then I should like to know what greater amount should now be spent.</p>

<p>What characterizes this Budget is the exceptionally generous concessions to those sectors of the population that need it most. I do not have time to dwell on this any further. The public servants are receiving increases of R15 million whereas they are paying a little less in taxes. There is medical rebate Of R150 per year, whether you have made use of it or not. R50.918 million is being voted for higher education, that is R11.7 million more than the previous year. For defence it is R271.6 million, or R17 million more than last year. Of that R95 million is being earmarked for essential munitions purchases. I should very much like to spend more time on this. There is an additional R3.4 million for agriculture. But my time is up. I just want to congratulate the Minister of Finance once again on his Budget. I believe that in the application thereof, and with a correction here and there of the levy on a few commodities, even in regard to those about which the hon. member for Rosettenville complained, this Budget will still be known as an exceptional turning point in our budget policy. In this party good budgets by outstanding Ministers of Finance have already created a tradition.</p>

<p>One of my colleagues on this side of the House quite rightly referred to this Budget as a Renaissance budget. The Opposition&#x2019;s reaction to this Renaissance budget, however, makes me think of the image of the old donkey that used to draw the bucket pump in the early days. On the part of the donkey there was an incessant and colourless walking in circles. It was doing its work, but it was not really concerned whether fresh water was pouring from the buckets or not, not even whether the buckets were supplying any water at all. You see, Sir, a Renaissance budget, and then we have this sort of reaction on the part of the Opposition. Sir, I can describe this as the bucket pump reaction of a donkey, a reaction coming from an Opposition which at this stage in our political dispensation is nearly 21 years old. I know of no other Opposition that reached this same age in South African politics.</p>

<p>I leave it at that, because I want to pay attention more particularly to one certain aspect of this Budget. One of the members on this side rightly referred to this Budget as a Renaissance budget. It was notable, or perhaps it was a great coincidence, that this outstanding Budget was preceded by a very dramatic statement, a statement made by the Minister of Planning about the first results achieved in the search for oil in South Africa. These first results were achieved in the sea, 40 miles offshore, and this dramatic announcement reminded our people in South Africa in an almost equally dramatic way that there is <span class="col_3707-3708" refersTo="page_0341"/>more in the sea than we usually think. For a few moments the people in our country looked past the normal activities in the sea, i.e. our fishing industry in all its various facets, and looked once more at inner space, at the sea, which comprises approximately 71 per cent of the surface area of the earth and which contains approximately 80 per cent of all life on earth. This truth, this stimulation of our people, posed a new and very pointed question to all of us, and that is: Should we in South Africa, with our coastline of 2,000 miles long, not be stimulated by this dramatic event to a completely new, imaginative and scientific exploration of the sea&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, being a small country we cannot compete with the great powers in space to-day; we cannot play around in space, but I do not think it is beyond South Africa&#x2019;s financial capacity at least to participate in the new adventure in the field of oceanography. Sir, to state my plea in a much more practical way, I want to ask whether the time has not come that we should seriously think of a full-fledged State Department in respect of the sea industry in all its various facets&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member there is being quite frivolous. If there is justification to-day for a Department of Forestry, for a Department of Sport and Recreation, and for a Department of Tourism, then this question has become a really topical one in our national economy. I briefly want to motivate it in this way; I cannot do so in much detail: In the first place South Africa has a coastline of 2,000 miles, a coastline of 2,000 miles of warm and cold water, which is, from the oceanographic point of view, from the scientific point of view, a very important fact to our country. We are almost surrounded by the sea, which holds numerous secrets and riches which are still waiting for discovery, and which offers a particular challenge to technological and scientific initiative in this country. A further point: We are situated near the South Pole, a fact which from the point of view of a scientific approach is of the greatest importance to South Africa. Unfortunately I cannot go into more detail. I want to mention a third factor: We are to-day the greatest export country in the world but one of fishmeal and other sea products. The sea industry earns more foreign exchange for South Africa to-day than old traditional export products such as wine and the fruit industry, calculated in separate categories. I now come to a further point: With our greater mobility at sea&#x2014;I am referring here to our two factory ships&#x2014;we are dramatically opening up new vistas. The question also arises with us whether the time has not come for South Africa to move outside its territorial waters with greater stress and momentum. Another point: We are already looking for diamonds on the sea-bed. We are constantly developing new suction techniques that can be applied to the ocean-bed in this connection. South Africa&#x2019;s first nuclear project for the desalination of sea water has reached an advanced stage of planning. Our scientists already know of large quantities of table salt, sulphur, magnesium, bromine and other minerals on our sea-bed which are only waiting to be exploited. Another point: At this stage already South Africa can show good results with conservation farming in the sea. In the latest annual report of Viskor mention is made of the first products of South Africa&#x2019;s oyster nursery, a branch of sea farming we started in the lagoon at Knysna. The first results are encouraging. We have been working on this for a long time, but its products are only coming onto the market now. I want to mention here that particularly in countries such as Holland, France, Japan and America a very great deal is being achieved in respect of sea farming at this stage. The latest figures show, for example that in America at this stage oysters to the value of $15 million are being cultivated artificially. This new science which has now developed, the science of oceanography, actually presents, if I may put it in this way, three or four challenges&#x2014;four arms, if I may put it in this way&#x2014;in the first place, the physical and chemical aspects of sea water (this is virtually a science in itself); in the second place, geological and geophysical research in connection with the sea-bed and the earth below the sea. Mr. Speaker, one can become quite lyrical about what is already being achieved in this field in America; this is something to excite the imagination. In the third place, there are the biological and botanical studies of sea life, in which South Africa is already to a certain extent participating, and, finally, observations of the interaction between the atmosphere and the sea, which is also virtually a science in itself. These are in fact the four arms comprised by this new approach, this new science, as I should like to call it. In South Africa we have in fact started to explore all four of these arms, but the challenges that lie ahead are still strong and stimulating. Despite the fact that only approximately 6 per cent of the sea-bed has been explored as yet, it is a fact that there are indications that in the case of many countries of the world a new approach is being adopted, that the sea and its contents, and the significance of the sea for mankind will be viewed in a new light. Here, for example, I want to refer to the recent research conducted by the University of California in the Pacific, research which has shown fantastic results in respect of supplies of manganese, copper, cobalt and nickel. It is particularly these two stimuli, i.e. how science can make use of new foodstuffs derived from the sea in order to meet the needs of an exploding world population, and technological developments on the other hand, that force us to look anew at the mineral riches of the sea. In making this plea after this dramatic event of oil being found in the sea, I should like to make a humble suggestion. In the first place it <span class="col_3709-3710" refersTo="page_0342"/>is necessary for greater clarity to be obtained through a proper and thorough scientific investigation into three factors I want to mention. The first factor is how South Africa&#x2019;s present oceanographic work can be co-ordinated. Something has already been done in this connection at various places, but the time has come for co-ordination to be brought about in respect of this new work we have begun in South Africa. Here I have in mind, for example, something similar to NASA, the controlling body of the American Aeronautical and Space Administration over space research. It should be an umbrella body which can coordinate all this work so that we can bring a new vision to bear upon the future. The second factor is how effective contact in the field of oceanography can be brought about with other friendly countries which have recently achieved splendid results in this field. The last factor is the purposeful creation of a programme for the future for which an amount of money will be voted from time to time and by means of which South Africa can accept this challenge with renewed vigour. We have the research workers, even if they are few. Mention has been made of a shortage of manpower, but we nevertheless have the research workers and the necessary manpower. Moreover, South Africa is not a poor country. I want to express the hope that this dramatic event which preceded this Renaissance Budget, i.e. the discovery of oil, will stimulate us to such an extent that South Africa will in future regard the sea and what it contains with new imagination and vigour.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Moorreesburg touched upon a matter about which I think there cannot be much difference of opinion in this House. The hon. member is looking for new resources for South Africa and methods for the better utilization of what is to be found in our seas. The hon. member was justifiably proud of certain gratifying developments which have recently been taking place in our immediate vicinity, i.e. where oysters are being cultivated artificially in the sea. I can tell the hon. member that there is a place a few miles beyond Port Elizabeth where a farmer has for the past six or seven years been very successful in cultivating oysters artificially. When the hon. member pleads for our marine resources to be utilized more extensively, I want to tell him that he will encounter no opposition from this side of the House. Whether the hon. member is correct in saying that a special department should be created for something of that nature is, of course, a matter in respect of which I think the answer should be left to the Minister.</p>

<p>Over the past few days the hon. member for Moorreesburg as well as other hon. members have described the Budget in winged words, so much so that the hon. member associated himself with what another hon. member had said, i.e. that this Budget was really a renaissance budget. Of course, as compared to the budgets we had in the past this Budget does mark a change.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the very point which I also want to put to the hon. member for Florida. This Budget has introduced changes, but these changes are not necessarily improvements. This is the whole case the Opposition has been making out up to now. I also hope to prove this to the hon. member in this contribution which I am now going to make to this debate. To a large section of the South African population and to a large percentage of our taxpayers this budget failed to bring any benefits. Hon. members opposite have also quoted English newspapers to show what they think of the Budget. I have before me a few quotations of comments which were not made by United Party supporters. These quotations are not from socalled newspapers which support the United Party. These are quotations of comments made by prominent economists and financiers who are supposed to be favourably disposed towards this Government. I should like to quote what a few of them had to say. Mr. Van Zyl, Chairman of the Kaapstadse Afrikaanse Sakekamer, said the following: (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The wine farmers will also be disappointed at the fact that the requested increase in the excise duty on unrefined spirits was not introduced &#x2026; A surprise in the Budget is the announcement of a pay as you earn system for Bantu workers. Although this will facilitate the collection of taxes for the state, the system will, however, not be welcomed by the employers.</block>

<p>In the same way I can quote what Dr. C. H. Brink, Chairman of the Federale Group, had to say. The main heading of the report dealing with what he had to say, reads as follows: &#x201C;Companies Tax: Glad it is not worse.&#x201D; This is what he thought: &#x201C;The purchase tax was definitely necessary, but he had to add that it was going to be difficult to predict what the reaction of the general public would be to it. This was a form of taxation which could have been avoided.&#x201D; I do not wish to put words into the mouth of this hon. gentleman, because it is for him to say where it could have been changed or avoided. However, hon. members opposite should not think that there is satisfaction in respect of this Budget in all quarters. The only reasons why there could be satisfaction, is in fact about the proposals the United Party has been making in South Africa for the past ten years or more. It is being said that this Budget is a major incentive to the professional man, the business man and the industrialist above a certain income group. There are even hon. members who said that productivity in South Africa could now be <span class="col_3711-3712" refersTo="page_0343"/>stimulated to such an extent that one would find that many of these people would now put in fewer appearances on golf-courses on Saturdays and Wednesday afternoons. The best features of the content of this Budget were, as I have said, not even peculiar to the National Party. After all, the ironing out of the tax bulge, the concessions granted in the case where both husbands and wives are working, are matters which have over the years been advocated by hon. members on this side of the House through mouths of the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Wynberg and many others. These are the only good points in this whole Budget. In regard to these matters there has up to now been complete agreement between both political parties in South Africa. What happened, was that the Government was merely late in accepting these proposals.</p>

<p>This increased purchase tax which will hit all layers of the population, will have a very marked effect on the man in the street. Hon. members do not appreciate this. But apart from the effect this purchase tax will have on the industrialist and the business man, we must also look at the consequences it will have for the farmer of South Africa. Well, as far as the elimination of the tax bulge is concerned, this does of course make no difference to the farmer&#x2014;absolutely no difference. It does not affect them at all.</p>

<p>Let me, for the information of the hon. member, quote what Mr. Chris Cilliers of the S.A.A.A.U. had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Revenue statistics show that only two to seven per cent of farmers earned more than R10,000 whilst 75 per cent had a taxable income of less than R3,000 per year and 50 per cent less than R1,600 per year. About 12,000 out of 80,000 farmers in South Africa showed losses on their undertakings.</block>

<p>What benefit does the farmer therefore derive from the elimination of the tax bulge&#x003F; When we on this side pleaded for the elimination of the tax bulge over the years, the last group we had in mind, was the farmers&#x2014;for the simple reason that we knew that they did not fall into that income group. What we are actually pleading for, is that the farmer should once again be placed in a position where he can pay income tax. Hence our amendment.</p>

<p>What hon. members opposite usually do is to mention the general expenditure under one Vote, as they also did to the Prime Minister recently when they told him to tell the nation in the Other Place that they spend R215 million on the agricultural industry every year. To arrive at that total, they add up all the expenditure under the various heads. They will do the same thing in this debate. For instance, they will say that they are now going to vote an additional R3.1 million in order to help the farmers of South Africa. They will say that there is R5 million on Loan Account, an additional provision for Agricultural Credit. This kind of calculation is the easiest calculation in the world. It is true, it does look impressive sometimes, especially when one talks to people who are not conversant with the situation. But the only thing which these figures do in fact prove, is that the problems of the agricultural industry in South Africa are becoming greater and greater and ever more urgent. This being proved, <i>inter alia,</i> by the assistance they are granting to the citrus industry, to the wool industry and in respect of credit facilities. As long as hon. members opposite are voting money for the various sectors of the agricultural industry on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, the problems of the South African agricultural industry will remain as they have been under the National Party regime for the past 20 years. It is strange that when the United Party was in power, there were approximately 125,000 farmers in South Africa, but after 21 years of National Party rule there are merely 105,000 farmers. It is perhaps true that when the United Party was in power farmers in certain sectors did not receive such so-called good prices as they do to-day, but this is the difference: Under the United Party regime production costs were not as high as they are today. In other words, the farmers had a reasonable <span class="col_3713-3714" refersTo="page_0344"/>margin of profit. That is why our farmers complained about income tax 15 or 20 years ago, but to-day one finds at every congress of agricultural associations that farmers are complaining about income tax; it appears on every agenda. The assistance which is being granted to farmers, indicates that this Budget is by no means a revolutionary one. It is merely a continuation of the patchwork approach of the Government. The greatest problems of the agricultural industry are still being overlooked by the Government; hence our amendment.</p>

<p>What does the farmer of South Africa see in a budget&#x003F; In the first place, he does not merely see it as a financial report for the past year. The farmer is also proud of the general prosperity of the country. He does not begrudge other sectors that prosperity. Whilst other sectors enjoy benefits as a result of our unprecedented prosperity, which has been caused by many factors, the farmer merely feels that it is a pity that the same cannot be said of him and his sector. To the farmer the budget is not a summary of the expenditure of various Government Departments, or of the ways and means which have to be found in order to finance such expenditure. He sees much more than that in the budget. To him the following is the actual test: To him the budget has to indicate whether the Government has any real understanding of his problems. He wants to see whether the Government is prepared to go down to the root of the evil and to penetrate as far as that evil. He wants to see whether the Government offers the solutions.</p>

<p>Three, four years ago the nation was asked to spend more, and most farmers did that. Funds for extension works were made available to our farmers on a large scale. Financial institutions and money-lenders actually enticed them with reasonable rates of interest to invite them to borrow money. These institutions made the money available on easy terms. The money was lent at reasonable rates of interest. I want to mention the example of a certain farmer who four years ago borrowed R100,000 at 5 per cent interest.</p>

<p>The hon. culprit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. culprit who is sitting over there. Owing to inflationary measures this man is no longer paying 5 per cent interest to-day but 8 per cent. What I am mentioning here, is one of the easier examples. I know of people who have to pay 9 and 10 per cent interest to-day on money they borrowed at that time. To jump from 5 per cent to 8 per cent is perhaps not such a tremendous increase, but what difference does this not make to that person&#x2019;s burden of interest&#x003F; If one works this out, it appears that this does not only amount to a 3 per cent increase in this burden of interest, but it amounts to an increase of approximately 60 per cent in his burden of interest. This is the situation in which most farmers find themselves to-day, farmers who four, five years ago were encouraged to spend for prosperity.</p>

<p>To-day I want to repeat a matter here which I have raised before. Most farmers would not have minded paying these higher rates of interest if there had been a fair chance of their being able to pay these interest charges. If the farmer had received a corresponding increase in the price of his product, and not a tremendous increase in his production costs, no farmer would have minded paying those interest charges, for the very purpose of making the struggle against inflation a successful one. Any other person can afford to pay these charges. The industrial sector and the business sector are in a position to pay them, just as it will be easy for them to absorb this purchase tax, because in actual fact they themselves will not be paying it; somebody else will have to pay. But the farmer cannot do this; he has to pay for them himself. I want to make an earnest plea to the hon. the Minister of Finance to-day, as I have also done before, to reduce the interest burden of the farmers. I presume that his two colleagues are also doing that, and if they are not doing so there is <span class="col_3715-3716" refersTo="page_0345"/>something drastically wrong with them. They know that one deputation of farmers after the other asks for relief to be granted in respect of their burden of interest. Even at the conference the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture addressed in Graaff-Reinet (when his helicopter almost got stuck) more or less six weeks ago, one farmer after the other rose and said, &#x201C;Mr. Deputy Minister, our difficulty is the burden of interest in South Africa&#x201D;. I was not there in person, but I know it. This is the case, not so&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister knows that this is so. Now we want to ask him: What is the Government going to do about it&#x003F; If they do not do anything about it, then I repeat that in next year&#x2019;s Budget we shall have to appropriate more in an attempt to help the agricultural industry out of this difficulty. Last year already we made the proposal that there should be a subsidy in some form or other for reducing the farmers&#x2019; burden of interest. Hon. members opposite should not tell us now that something of that nature is impossible. In this Budget this is being done as regards the interest paid on houses by certain public servants. Under the house ownership scheme the State is going to help these people, for the State is going to subsidize their interest. Is it so impossible to do this for our farmers as well&#x003F; Is it impossible for the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x003F; Would it complicate the struggle against inflation to such an extent if he were to grant such assistance to that sector&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Finance must give us a reply in this Budget as far as this situation is concerned. If he does not want to give us a reply, we want to warn him that the problem of the agricultural industry in South Africa will become worse and worse and he will have more and more difficulties in solving this matter. What astonishes me, is that up to now there has been no response to these appeals. We are not the only people who are doing this; every single deputation to this Government is doing so. When those hon. members go out to hold meetings and meet a group of farmers, there are only three matters which are discussed by these people, i.e. the increasing burden of interest, production costs and the burden of debt of the farmers of South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, I do of course know what other matters they talk about. I shall tell the hon. the Deputy Minister what other matters they discuss. Particularly when they have the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development in mind, they say, &#x201C;Why can we not have him as Minister of Agriculture, for he does after all do something for his people&#x003F;&#x201D; That is what they are saying. This is not United Party propaganda. This is being said by his people. I know because I see and meet them daily. I want to make this plea to the hon. the Minister of Finance to-day. We must be given a decisive answer in regard to this matter. If we are not given a decisive answer in regard to this matter in this Budget, the responsibility must rest on his shoulders if more and more farmers of South Africa were to leave the rural areas. The responsibility will rest on his shoulders if more and more people were to find themselves in difficulties. At present credit is no longer given to farmers for production purposes only. Credit is in reality being given to them so as to enable them to make a living. Surely this is wrong. One does not want people to live on a credit basis. One does not mind credit when it comes to production. This is productive credit. This is essential. Everybody does it. But to-day the majority of the farmers in South Africa need credit so that they may make a living. That is why that hon. Deputy Minister of Bantu Development was obliged to announce at a certain meeting that the Government would once again assist in giving people credit, even for groceries, maintenance costs, to pay their labourers and to provide them with rations. The hon. member for East London is quite correct. It is not only a disgrace, it is also a tragedy that that kind of situation should exist in South Africa to-day, because the Government is not prepared to go down to the actual problem of the farmer. The actual problem of the farmer is the following: If it is necessary to adjust the produce price or salary of any other person in order to keep pace with new circumstances, precisely the same thing has to be done in the agricultural industry.</p>

We want to tell the hon. the Minister of Agriculture that up to this stage, for a period of 21 years already, he has failed to outline to us precisely what his views are on the development of the agricultural industry in South Africa. The situation which has developed under the r&#x00E9;gime of this Government is that there is a shortage of technical officers. We do not have a sufficient number of extension officers.</p>

<p>As a result of this Government&#x2019;s lack of policy over the past 21 years, the situation which has arisen is that soil erosion is becoming worse and worse and increasingly more difficult to combat. At this stage we want to know from this Government precisely what course they are going to adopt in this respect. They have always failed to take effective steps. They have been fencing with words. They have been finding fault and making excuses, but they have never told us in what direction they are moving and how the agricultural industry can in their view be placed on a stable and sound basis. Unless we receive those answers we cannot argue about the agricultural industry and cannot see any ray of light for the future under the present Government. This is why I strongly support the hon. member for Constantia in his amendment, and particular the part which relates to the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the previous debate dealing with agriculture took place, this country was experiencing one of the most crippling droughts in its history. But before I say anything further, I would like to place on record my gratitude towards the Almighty, particularly on this occasion, for the wonderful rains which have fallen throughout the country. After these persistent drought conditions which have prevailed for years, we can on this occasion express our gratitude for the wonderful rains we have had in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member has just referred to conditions in agriculture. There is one thing which strikes me about the Opposition, and that is that they cannot get over the fact that the farming population of South Africa has completely rejected the United Party. They have set up a record by sitting in the Opposition benches for 20 years, and over all these years, as far as I can remember, not one single motion has been introduced during which resultant debate the question of agriculture has not been appended. This is so because they themselves feel unhappy and would like to scramble back and recover the support of the farming population after the losses they have suffered. There is one thing the farming population of South Africa will never forget, and that is the history and the record of the United Party during the years they were in power. That record, Sir, stands out so starkly that we know in the first instance that all their pleas are merely irresponsible political propaganda by means of which they have tried to present a situation as being desperate and in this way catch a few votes. The farming population simply does not accept this. A few days ago we had the Provincial by-election at Graaff-Reinet. Sometime previously they kicked up a tremendous fuss about the wool farmers here. I do not think they even had a candidate for the election. The by-election at Graaff-Reinet was unopposed. If it were so that the farming population believed them this would surely have been the first indication that the United Party wanted to make a test of this occasion.</p>

<p>Let us return to the Budget. The hon. member has now elaborated on the situation in respect of the farmers and the taxes they have to pay. He spoke about income tax. I would like to refer the hon. member to the latest report of the South African Agricultural Union, from which he quoted, and ask him to read page 114. There he will be able to read more about the income tax to which the South African Agricultural Union referred. Normally they made a thorough study of the report of the South African Agricultural Union. In the latest report they found almost nothing. That is why they had not yet mentioned it in this discussion. That is why I find it interesting that the hon. member referred to the Agricultural Union, and spoke about income tax, and asked that we should point out to him where they had held discussions with their congresses. On the contrary, they are thanking the Government for the levelling of income tax which has been levied by this Government. They express their gratitude for this step, one which they have been advocating for many years, and which was introduced a year ago by the hon. the Minister of Finance. Let the hon. member tell us what taxes the farmers are paying in terms of this sales tax as far as the production of foodstuffs is concerned.</p>

Now they are distributing pamphlets everywhere which are absolutely distorted. This is the method the United Party utilizes. They tried to make the people in the platteland believe all kinds of things and distribute pamphlets there which are untrue, as in the case of the present pamphlets on the health measures which they are trying to distribute throughout the country. These pamphlets convey incorrect information. They are aware of everything which is being dealt with by the Agricultural Union and which it has done in this regard. However they are distributing pamphlets throughout the country in order to present the National Party in a poor light, without obtaining the necessary information.</p>

<p>This is the way in which the United Party goes to work to try to disseminate propaganda so that they can win back the farming population. However, with these methods they achieve the very opposite. I want to thank the hon. the Minister of Finance for this new system of sales tax and for having specially excluded the farming population for production purposes. I will concede that in something of such vast scope there will be excesses here and there. However, it is a start in a direction which we all welcome. What is more, the United Party has, according to hon. members on that side, also been advocating a sales tax and an amended system for years. It is typical of the United Party that when they advocate something they put forward their case with great bravado. If the matter turns out to be in their favour and they cannot make propaganda from it, they take the credit for it. That is precisely what the hon. member for Newton Park just did. However, if anything goes wrong and they think they can make propaganda out of it, they are the first to point out the faults. That is typical of the United Party&#x2019;s direction. That is what happens when a Party has no fixed policy and principles on which its policy is based. That is why the United Party has no future in South Africa, it has no fixed goal. That is the difference between the United Party and the National Party. Every blue Monday they have a new race policy, a new Bantu policy. We can produce one pamphlet after another of theirs to prove how their race policy has changed during the course of years. The United Party has no fixed policy; it trims its sails to the wind whenever it thinks it can make propaganda. Just take this rate of interest as an example. What hon. members said in regard to the debt position and the encouragement of farmers, is hopelessly incorrect. I want to use the wool brokers as an example. The hon. member, as a wool farmer, knows how much debt the farmers had with the brokers. The hon. member knows how many millions of rand in debts they had with the brokers. The hon. member said that farmers would not take loans from ordinary banking institutions. What was the debt which this Government took over the years from the brokers at a decreased rate of interest&#x003F;</p>

<p>You are aware that the previous year a million was appropriated for advertising and research in the wool industry in order to decrease the levy on the wool producers in this way. If you look at the Budget you will see that an amount is being appropriated there for certain agricultural institutions, at a decreased subsidized rate of interest. Why this great agitation in the House simply in order to say that this is only being done in certain sectors, whereas it is not being done in others&#x003F; But it is not so easy to establish a general bond interest subsidy; I wonder whether the hon. member is aware &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am aware that it has been done before, in 1933 but it is not such an easy task. I wonder whether you are aware that attention has in fact been given to this matter during the last two years, not on the insistence of the United Party, not because the United Party represents the farmers or the platteland, but because we as farmers took cognisance of the situation and also took cognizance of in what respect we can be of assistance to the agricultural population in the situation in which they find themselves. It is clear to us that the United Party sketches the same picture each time, the picture of rates of interest, production costs, produce prices and the depopulation of the platteland. This picture is repeated during every debate dealing with agriculture. Attention has been given to the rates of interest and to what possible steps can be taken in that respect. Hon. members are aware that steps have already been taken to help the farmer who went down by means of agricultural credit at 5 per cent. Hon. members are aware that the Land Bank received R30 million last year, and they are aware that this amount is being distributed at low rates of interest in order to assist the farmers who find themselves in this situation. The United Party, as I have already said, merely repeats the same picture.</p>

<p>A moment ago an hon. member mentioned that under the United Party Government there had been 125,000 farmers, whereas now there were only 105,000 farmers. Do they want more farmers to be forced into the platteland under present circumstances&#x003F; Does the United Party want this wealth, this available 15 million morgen of agricultural land to be further subdivided&#x003F; Do they want the available stock to be subdivided, even though the drought, as we will just have to accept, has over the years become a permanent one in South Africa. These riches available in the platteland, <span class="col_3721-3722" refersTo="page_0348"/>the natural resources, cannot be easily increased. We are aware of the existing droughts. Must we further subdivide these natural resources which are available to the farmers&#x003F; Must we increase the number of farmers from 105,000 to 125,000, which was the original number&#x003F; If the United Party wants to return to that 125,000, they must tell us, but that figure is not quite correct. They were not all farmers.</p>

<block name="quote">Before concluding we can congratulate our Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Uys, on having taken over the helm of the agricultural vessel. We are also pleased about his chief lieutenant, Mr. Hendrik Schoeman. They are both farmers who know agriculture and are good friends of organized agriculture. In his chief officials, namely the policy adviser, Dr. Du Plessis, and the three departmental heads, Dr. Vorster, Dr. Van der; Merwe and Mr. Viljoen, he has a team which is probably as capable as any Minister can ever hope to have, and behind them there are a good few others of similar calibre. I believe that these men will, within the next few years, be called upon to map out a course which will guide the vessel out of the present turbulence to more calm waters. Our congratulations to them and their endeavours. We offer them our sincere co-operation. If we should criticize one another from time to time, we hope that this will always be done in a good and constructive spirit, because our purpose and our endeavour will always remain the same, namely a sound agricultural industry in our beloved mother country.</block>

<p>I am in a very difficult position now. The usual etiquette is that one follows up the previous speaker as far as one can. But the previous speaker is my colleague and is my neighbour as far as our constituencies are concerned, and all I can say by way of following him up is that I fully agree with everything he said. To try to say anything further about my personal approach to this Budget, would be a waste of time. I do not believe there is anyone on either side of the House who would still be able to say anything we have not yet heard. There has been enough comment both for and against; many have criticized the Budget severely, and many have praised it. We are now probably nearing the end of the debate, and what we have achieved by it is a question each of us should ask himself. As for me, I, like previous speakers on this side, want to express my appreciation for this Budget. It is my honest opinion, without ulterior motives, that it is a very well balanced Budget for all our population groups and interests. I have felt for years, when we discussed our financial problems in this country, that it has become necessary for our taxation system to be investigated. We know that nothing remains the same. One has to adjust oneself to changing circumstances from time to time, and I was one of the people who welcomed the appointment of a commission of inquiry. I think that for our people in general, regardless to what political party we belong, much good has sprung from the report of this commission, which served as an inspiration to the architect, the Minister of Finance. I think this is as much as I should say about it. We have nothing more to tell each other.</p>

<p>Yes, Oom Gerhard Bekker always told him this, and I think Oom Gerhard was always right. I again listened to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech a while ago. He is always fiery enough and he never lacks for words, but, after all, politics is not of such a nature that one should be completely blind and deaf to the truth. One can always benefit from another man&#x2019;s views if one&#x2019;s thinking about those matters is sound. But in his case I realize only now what a prophet Oom Gerhard was when he always made him out to be a hater of the farmers. He told us how we should farm in this country. But I just want to tell the hon. member that many of us here who do not talk so much about farming, have already forgotten what he will not learn for years to come, and the same holds true for his politics. He is only a baby here, and if ever he comes back to this House, he will perhaps give us a different contribution to the contributions he made in these debates to which I have been listening for 17 years. I think the two of us came here together. I just want to say that I think we should devise some plan to give him some medical assistance, because he has developed a mania here which he can never forget. He will make the farmers solvent as if by magic; if just to pay them subsidies on their interest. The whole problem, as far as the farmers are concerned, is not drought; it is not foreign markets; it is not the circumstances over which we have no control, and over which the hon. member&#x2019;s Party will not have any control either if they should come into power. These are not the things he takes into account. He thinks along the lines of the old song&#x2014;</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member I think he does a great deal of wrong with the contributions he makes in this House. Here I have a number of telegrams in my pocket about the price of maize, and I am ashamed to show them to the Minister. There is dissatisfaction. Who is so petty and who is such a political fool as to deny this&#x003F; But this one will have under the best circumstances in the world. In the field of agriculture we and our children and their children will always have problems in South Africa. This is not the best agricultural country in the world. But we are ploughing and planting as far as into the Kalahari, and we are creating problems. As a result we come into conflict with nature, and then, as an individual or as a Government, one is absolutely powerless. It really cannot be said that this Government has failed to do its duty in the past years, when the farmers had such a hard time of it. This same Minister who is being so unnecessarily run down by hon. members on the opposite side, has done his best. He has done as much as any man could have done. I want to give the hon. member for Newton Park the assurance that he may well tell his farmers in Newton Park about all the things the Minister has done. The farmers are satisfied that if difficulties arise again, the Government will do its duty. The Budget has already provided for that. But what can the Government do for our wool farmers, the people who have suffered many losses and who have had a hard time as a result of the drought&#x003F; We cannot make rain. Neither can you make rain, my friends. As far as farming in South Africa is concerned, this is the crux of the matter. If it rains in abundance, there is no difficulty. The farmers help themselves and buy additional farms and they farm progressively, but if there is a drought, no one can control it and this sort of thing happens. But we who have supported this Government for a lifetime, know how well disposed it is towards the farmers and we are perfectly satisfied that there is no reason to be concerned should assistance be required.</p>

<p>I just want to bring something to the notice of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. I have received telegrams and letters from farmers&#x2019; associations and from many farmers. It concerns the so-called &#x201C;gou-gif&#x201D; or poison bush; it has quite a number of different names; it is called by different names by different people. We find this poison bush in the North-Western Transvaal and the Western Transvaal. It is found in my constituency, in Marico, in the former Ventersdorp constituency and in Coligny. This poison bush grows in about seven or eight constituencies in the dolomitic area. About 10 or 12 years ago I approached the then Minister of Agricultural Technical Services about the matter. The farmers passed resolutions about this matter; I brought a deputation to Cape Town, and then it was decided to establish a research station there. The research station is still there and tests are still being made, but so far without any results.</p>

<p>Recently, when a great many farmers approached me, I again asked the Secretary for Agricultural Technical Services, Dr. Vorster, to tell me what I should tell the farmers, what was being done and what the Department expected to do in the future. We have satisfied those people for the present, but personally I am convinced that much more can be done to combat the poison bush than has been done in the past. I do not want to cast any reflections on people. I had the kind support of the Secretary of Agricultural Technical Services in those years and I still have it this afternoon. He opened the research station there himself, and tests have been carried out there. Scientists are carrying out research there, but a very large part of our best cattle-grazing area in the North-Western Transvaal is being contaminated by this poison bush, and on behalf of the farmers in my constituency and in other constituencies that have an interest in the matter, I again want to ask the hon. the Minister to do everything within his power in this connection. If we can succeed in putting people on the moon to-day, we should have much less difficulty in eradicating the poison bush.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>When he began his speech, the hon. member for Lichtenburg said that he did not think that at this stage of the debate it was possible to say anything new about the Budget. I think the hon. member has to some extent borne out his own contention by the speech he has just made, because he certainly has not contributed anything new to this Budget debate, except a parochial request to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, a request which could probably be made more appropriately in the debate on the Minister&#x2019;s Vote. Sir, I am going to come back to the hon. member for Lichtenburg and also the hon. member for Christiana at a slightly later stage because there are one or two matters which I want to raise first and which are not agricultural matters before I deal with the speeches of those two hon. gentlemen. I want to say to the hon. member for Lichtenburg that these two matters which I am going to raise are very much new matters as far as this Budget debate is concerned.</p>

<p>The first matter to which I want to refer is the practice of the hon. the Minister of Finance through his receivers of revenue of taxing the ordinary army pay, air force pay or navy pay of people who are called up to do national service, of adding this amount to their other taxable income and then taxing them on it. Sir, this is surely a most strange principle at a time when we in this country are engaged in a cold war and when we have to have a large number of our young people under training, not under continuous training but under intermittent training for a large number of years. In the case of the Citizen Force it is for some 10 or 12 years, and in the case of the commandos for some 15 or 16 years. This falls particularly hard on those young men who are self-employed and <span class="col_3725-3726" refersTo="page_0350"/>who during the period of their training have to be away from their businesses and whose businesses suffer in the meanwhile. The receiver then comes along and then adds this very modest amount of army pay to their taxable income. I say that that is wrong in principle. But quite apart from that the receiver of revenue is going even further, and I want to give the hon. the Minister an example here. I want to quote from a letter that I have received from a constituent of mine&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If one is honest enough to mention the fact, as our son did, that he was paid 50 cents a day for nine months, i.e. R133, the revenue people concerned immediately step it up to R315; that is for the whole period of nine months. The extra R182 is for board and lodging.</block>

<p>Sir, when it comes to the question of board I have no doubt that the food that is being given to these trainees in the army services is really very good indeed, but I have also heard the expression &#x201C;army skilly&#x201D;, and I think it is really a little bit tough to add a certain sum for board.</p>

<p>The same applies when it comes to the question of lodging. An army trainee in many instances probably considers himself lucky if the lodging consists of an army bungalow. There are no doubt occasions when they go out on manoeuvres, when the lodging consists, again if the trainee is rather lucky, of canvas tents. There are probably other occasions when the lodging might even consist of a sleeping bag or perhaps even a ground sheet if the trainee is out on manoeuvres. I really do think that this is somewhat of an imposition which the hon. the Minister should think about before his receivers of revenue add an amount of R182 over a nine-month period to a trainee&#x2019;s taxable income and say to him: &#x201C;That is for board and lodging and you have to pay income-tax on that plus the tax on your extra little bit of pay.&#x201D; Naturally I am not referring to the Permanent Force, because this is their profession and their career, and they must naturally expect to be taxed on what they receive, but I think that a sum of R182 for board and lodging is something which borders on the ridiculous.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there has been a great deal of praise of the Budget from the other side of the House. The hon. member for Lichtenburg said that it was very well balanced; the hon. member for Marico became poetic; he said that it was like an early Spring flower. The hon. member for Moorreesburg likened it to a renaissance Budget. Sir, I am afraid that I cannot describe a Budget which contains this ill-considered, ill-conceived, ill-timed fiscal fiasco which the Minister has graced with the name of a sales tax, in such glowing terms. Quite honestly, Sir, I would think that the sales tax portion of the Budget at least could be more aptly described as a bit of a dog&#x2019;s breakfast and, may I add, a breakfast for a rich man&#x2019;s dog as well. Sir, this sales tax has led, in the short time since the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech, to something which has almost approached a shambles in the business world, because it has caused confusion and consternation in the business world and not only in the business world itself. Yesterday the hon. member for Algoa spoke here for the best part of half an hour on how much this Government was doing for education in this country, on how wonderful our educational system was, how the Government was doing everything to forward education in this country.</p>

<p>I am bringing this matter to the attention of the correct Minister for clarification, and the hon. the Minister will clarify it but I raise this as an example of the terrible confusion which has resulted from the premature introduction of this sales tax. Sir, I use the word &#x201C;premature&#x201D;, but before I proceed with that, let me say this. One wonders whether higher education of university standard and the things which are needed for that education come within the definition of luxury goods&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, perhaps university education is regarded as a luxury by the hon. the Deputy Minister. Sir, I have said that the introduction of this tax was premature, as was pointed out by the hon. member for Constantia. Furthermore, I say that it was unnecessary because the hon. the Minister is hugging to his chest his surplus of R58 million plus the R35 million which he had over from last year plus his credit in his Loan Fund of R28 million. In addition to all that he has some R341 million in his Stabilization Fund, making a total, I understand, of <span class="col_3727-3728" refersTo="page_0351"/>something like R457.9 million. Sir, these figures have been mentioned before during the course of this debate, but hon. gentlemen on the other side who lavish such praise on this 3udget seem to have forgotten them or they do not seem to have heard of them. The hon. member for Marico said that this Budget was like a spring flower. Sir, what sort of spring flower is it if we are taxed, not on luxuries, with this so-called sales tax which is in effect a purchase tax, and which in many cases is a tax on production, raising production costs. What sort of spring flower is that for the people of this country&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana wanted to know what taxes the farmer was going to have to pay under this sales tax which would adversely affect him&#x003F; I want to mention to the hon. member just a few of the taxes that either the farmer or his employee will have to pay. Either he or his employees will have to pay the tax on a formidable list of articles. Just let us go through them. I say that either he or his employees will have to pay and I will come back later to this question of his employees. Either he or his employees will have to pay these taxes which are either going to push up the cost of living of the employee or are going to push up the production costs of the farmer, the primary producer, which will lead to a squeeze on his profit margin. Let me set out these items&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Products of the chemical and allied industries: Varnishes and lacquers; distempers; paints and enamels; pigments in linseed oil, spirits of turpentine, etc.</block>

<p>There is a long list of items on which a 10 per cent tax will have to be paid. Are hon. members on the other side going to tell me that these are not production requisites as far as the maintenance of their farm buildings is concerned&#x003F; The next group of items I want to mention includes disinfectants, insecticides, and this includes articles like dips, fungicides and weed killers. These are articles which are in ever increasing use on our arable farming lands. The hon. member for Christiana I believe, represents a maize-growing area. Are weed killers not used in his constituency&#x003F; Is this not going to push up the production costs of the product&#x003F;</p>

In other words, the man who can only buy retail, the small operator, has to pay the tax, namely 10 per cent. But the man who can buy these items wholesale, namely the big user&#x2014;and this lends point to what the hon. member for Constantia said on the very first day of this Budget debate, namely that this is a rich man&#x2019;s budget&#x2014;escapes this tax. I would like to give the hon. member for Christiana a few more examples. One of them was also mentioned by the hon. member for Marico when he said that rubber was one of the items he would not really have liked to have had taxed. This group of items include new and retreaded or reconditioned rubber tyres, tyre cases, interchangeable tyre treads, inner tubes and tyre flaps for wheels of all kinds &#x2026;</p>

<p>Of course they do not buy a new one every year. The choice is given to the consumer by the hon. the Minister. I want to ask the hon. member what will happen if he should have a blow-out. Will he first think whether he really needs a new tyre or not&#x003F; This is also the answer to his question. These items are necessities and production requirements and the tax the hon. the Minister is going to impose, plus all the markups the trader is going to put on, is going to push up the production costs all along the line.</p>

<p>Let us not stop at this but let us go a little bit further. Items like matches, tarpaulins, sails, tyre pumps, furniture and bedding are also included in this list of items. It appears that some of the members on the other side have not read this. Many of the things I have just mentioned now are bought by many of our non-European labourers. The hon. member for Newton Park was absolutely correct and justified in asking what was in this Budget for the farmer. The hon. member for Christiana tried to pour cold water on the speech of the hon. member for Newton Park. He came with the story about the drought again and that the farmers were very thankful for the levelling of income-tax last year, but who in this House have pleaded year after year for the levelling of that income-tax, if it was not hon. members on this side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman says &#x201C;shame&#x201D;, but this is so. For years hon. members on this side of the House have asked for the levelling of income-tax.</p>

<p>I now want to come to one particular aspect of the Budget where I would like to ask the hon. the Minister for certain clarifications. The hon. the Minister has provided in the Budget for an amount of R240,000 for assistance to pineapple producers. In his Budget speech he said as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Various factors contributed to the straitened circumstances in which a large part of the pineapple producers presently find themselves. In addition to the low prices that producers received, the drought conditions resulted in the quality of the product generally being considerably poorer than usual. In order to enable pineapple producers to continue production I propose that a subsidy of R2 per ton be paid on pineapples that were supplied to the canning factory or that were exported fresh.</block>

<p>There are many questions that producers are asking and I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister could clear some of them up. I want to say that the producers are grateful for these concessions. When a person is in deep water and a line is thrown to him he is grateful. This was the position of the pineapple producers. I want to ask the hon. the Minister first of all, because I cannot find it in the Estimates, through which department this money is going to be paid.</p>

<p>Some of the price agreements expired after devaluation, but as soon as the new price agreements were made the price came down by R2 per ton because of devaluation. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture cannot argue around this one, because this is what happened. The loss to the producer was R2 per ton. The hon. gentleman says this is not a devaluation loss. If he is going to say that and that this is assistance to ensure the future of the pineapple producers based on past production, then I am going to repeat the charge I made during the Part Appropriation Debate, namely that the hon. the Minister of Finance has not kept faith with the pineapple producers.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. the Deputy Minister told them in this House before. At that time I accused the Government of not keeping faith with the pineapple producers and not keeping the promises which the hon. the Minister of Finance made at the time of devaluation 17 months ago. It now appears that this Government still has no intention of keeping that promise of recompensing producers for devaluation losses.</p>

<p>I want to say this to the hon. the Minister. This is an industry which is worth keeping going, and I want to quote from a Press statement which apparently comes from a memorandum which has been presented to the Government. It is an industry which brings in R7,400,000 per year in foreign exchange. I quote from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has invested R6 million in and around East London; it is a labour intensive industry, employing, directly, about 5,000 Africans and, indirectly, a further 10,000 on the pineapple farms.</block>

<p><span class="col_3731-3732" refersTo="page_0353"/>If we take the total as 15,000 and if we take the average figure of five to a family that means that about 75,000 people altogether, inclusive of dependants, are dependent on that industry. It is a higher figure than what I have given before in the House. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It enables pineapple farmers to pay out more than R1.5 million a year locally for wages, materials and services. It pays out R4 million a year to interests outside the Ciskei for such items as tins and sugar, etc.</block>

<p>I say to the hon. the Minister this is an industry which needs to be kept going in the interests of the country, and if it can be kept going a bit longer these people are trying to solve their own problems among themselves. The canners and the growers are getting together, and with a certain amount of extra-Government assistance&#x2014;and I am speaking about over and above this R2&#x2014;to give them more time for a year or so, they will be able to rationalize the industry. I hope that when these people come to the hon. the Minister in future with requests, that he will not only receive them sympathetically but that he will do something of value over and above this R2 in order to put the industry on a sound footing again.</p>

<p>In the couple of minutes left at my disposal I want to revert to what this Budget is going to do as regards farm labour. I have quoted enough out of this schedule which we were given to show that there is a large range of articles where the farm labourers are going to have to pay more for what are more or less every-day necessities of life. It means that we as farmers will have to increase the wages of those farm labourers in order to enable them to cope with the increasing cost of living. This will be necessary. This is all the more reason that we should have efficiency in our farm labour. I am glad the hon. the Deputy Minister is here, because I want to put the question to him that has been put to him so often from this side of the House, namely why will the Government not train Bantu farm labour for use on European farms&#x003F;</p>

<p>I do not have the Hansard reference with me, but last year that hon. gentleman said, &#x201C;That we will never do&#x201D;. He said he would never do that. I am very grateful to hear that he has changed his mind. As an hon. member says here, he has done a complete somersault. I specifically put the question to the hon. gentleman last year, &#x201C;Will you train them in their own areas for employment in the white areas&#x003F;&#x201D;, and he said &#x201C;No&#x201D;. I am very grateful to hear that to-day because the Government&#x2019;s policy as regards border industries is one of taking the factories to the people and not the people to the factories. As far as agricultural production is concerned, it is physically impossible to do this. The factory is our farm, and we cannot take our farms to the borders of the Bantustan.</p>

<p>Unless we are condemned to cope forever with a migrant labour force on our farms the Government must do two things. One is to train those people so that they can become efficient farm labourers and the other is to ensure that they can stay there without them having to remove themselves to the Bantustans every year.</p>

<p>I say this Budget has forced up production costs for the farmer, and it is going to continue to do that. I want to repeat the point made by the hon. member for Newton Park, namely that the farmer is a producer who cannot pass on production costs to the consumer. In the case of many other industries it is a question of mark-ups along the line, but the farmer can only do this, particularly in the case of controlled products, after there has been an annual price review, after a year has elapsed and he can persuade the hon. the Minister not merely that his costs have risen but that he is justified to have a price increase and that he can get beyond that hon. the Minister of Agriculture and actually get that price.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I like to listen to the hon. member for Albany, especially when he is speaking about agricultural matters. At the beginning of his speech this afternoon he touched lightly on the tax problems experienced by ballotees undergoing training; then he said something about the problems of education, and after that he switched to agricultural matters.</p>

<p>In respect of this Budget the hon. member used the words &#x201C;fiscal fiasco&#x201D;. He said that it was a fiscal fiasco. I regard the hon. member as an authority in the field of agriculture, but I regard this as an outrageous statement for him to have made. A few years ago the hon. the Minister made a tax concession, i.e. the levelling down of farming revenue for tax purposes. We all know that the farming industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations, that in certain years there are losses and in others tremendous profits. The hon. the Minister then introduced the levelling system, which means the equalization of income over a period to <span class="col_3733-3734" refersTo="page_0354"/>grant relief from heavy taxation having to be paid in one specific year when profits are large. Now the hon. member has said, pinning a medal on his own chest, that he had pleaded for the concession. I may tell the hon. member that the Government is well aware of the farmers&#x2019; tax problems. This Budget affects the progressive farmer very favourably as far as his tax is concerned. What he obtains by way of the decrease of direct taxation will entail a greater saving for him than what he has to pay in purchase tax on certain articles which he needs, articles as specified in this list. There are certain articles, which the hon. member mentioned there, such as insecticides, dipping fluids, etc., which may have a certain effect on the cost structure of farming. But in his Budget speech the Minister made it very clear that he contemplated assuming certain powers in the course of the financial year concerned in order to introduce certain changes in respect of the purchase tax of the different articles.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>But will he do so&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that the Minister will do so, because I shall not be told that there is a single United Party member on that side of the House who can determine exactly what the result of this purchase tax will be on the various economic sectors, for example agriculture. It is not something which one can pre-determine. The fact is that this is a new system of taxation. For me the great advantage in purchase tax lies in the fact that the Minister thereby obtains certain manoeuvrable powers to enable him to transfer the tax to the various sectors in accordance with their abilities to contribute taxes. This is something we never had in our previous system of taxation. Here a tax law is being formulated for the space of one year. In the field of taxation one is, to use an English expression, placed in a straitjacket. The present proposed type of taxation allows for manoeuvrability and fluidity.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park once more described the so-called poor condition of the agricultural industry in South Africa, as he saw it. This is also the second leg of the Opposition&#x2019;s amendment. Let us now look at agriculture in general. It is a large and complex industry for many obvious reasons. It is therefore probably very easy to take certain facets of agriculture, to quote certain people and thereby to make out a case claiming that agriculture in South Africa is in a very bad way. It can be done. But let us look at the whole picture of agriculture in South Africa. According to the report of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, there has, over the past seven years, been an increase of 5 per cent in the physical volume of agricultural products, notwithstanding the 1966 drought, which was one of the worst droughts in the history of South Africa. But now it is very interesting to see what the position was when the United Party was still in power. I have here a White Paper on agriculture in the year 1945-&#x2019;46 issued by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Department. Herein the shortcomings of farming and their causes are mentioned. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nevertheless, in the crop failure years the total yield is less than the effective demand, and is much too low when a minimum standard of human and animal nutrition must be met. In addition our farming, as it is today, does not even provide the majority of farmers and farm labourers with a reasonable livelihood.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have said that notwithstanding drought conditions, we have had an average increase over seven years of 5 per cent in physical volume. That is to say, in contrast to the period of the United Party Government we have, even in these circumstances, had no production problems. On the contrary, we are to-day experiencing problems with agricultural product surpluses. Then hon. members say that agriculture is in a precarious position.</p>

<p>The living standards of farmers have also increased. I do not know whether the hon. member still wants us to drive around in donkey carts and in horse-drawn carts and wear patched trousers.</p>

<p>But let us go further. Let us look at the position of the price structure of agriculture under this Government&#x2019;s rule. This is very important if one wants to appreciate the position of agriculture as a whole. Let us look at the White Paper which was tabled in connection with this Budget. On page 25 the graphs are very clearly depicted for the relationship between the agricultural producers&#x2019; prices, and the prices of farming requisites. The White Paper reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Producer prices of agricultural products which remained relatively constant to 1962- &#x2019;63 and increased sharply thereafter, increased by a further 4.7 per cent during 1967-&#x2019;68. Prices of farming requisites and implements rose by only 0.5 per cent during 1967-&#x2019;68 compared with the average annual increase of 1.6 per cent during the preceding ten years.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Let us give agriculture its due. There was a period when we experienced cost pincer position in agriculture. But specifically as a result of this Government&#x2019;s price policy, and its control boards, price stability was created in agriculture under the present hon. Minister of Agriculture, which brought about a gradual but progressive price <span class="col_3735-3736" refersTo="page_0355"/>increase in the entire price structure. We want to give the Minister every credit for that. Consequently there is a constant increase in prices, which is increasing progressively more rapidly than the cost of farming requisites.</p>

<p>But let us take another look at what the position was under the United Party regime. They always boast that they introduced the Marketing Act in South Africa. What did their policy state&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government once more wants to confirm these aims of the Marketing Act and bases its agricultural-economic policy on the continuance of the existing produce control boards and on the extension of the control system. Its development was interrupted by the War.</block>

<p>It went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the War the control boards unfortunately had to tolerate a great deal of criticism in that they rendered efficient service to the Government in connection with the rationing of State products which inevitably resulted in troublesome restrictions on consumption and on the trade.</block>

<p>In other words, the Opposition used the control boards for the control of shortages that existed in agriculture at that time, at the consumer, instead of using them more positively to establish a better price structure and balance.</p>

<p>If we look at the financing sources of our agriculture, ample provision is made for the farmer in South Africa who wants to make use of them. We are not speaking about catastrophic periods, such as droughts, etc. Let us look at the Land Bank. The Land Bank is one of the best financing sources for the farmer to-day. There is hardly a field in which the Land Bank cannot supply the farmer with production means and capital to-day. He can even be supplied with production credit by means of the agricultural corporations; because the majority of the co-operative associations are held in very high repute by the Land Bank. Corporations which function efficiently can make sufficient funds available, by means of the Land Bank, to its members in the form of production credit, such as fertilizers and other farming requisites.</p>

<p>If we look at these interest rates, we shall find them to be even lower than those of the open market outside, for example the rates of commercial banks. According to the Steenkamp report about co-operative matters it is about 1 to 1&#x00BD; per cent lower than that on the open market. There are thus sufficient financing sources from which efficient production can be effected. Where does our solution lie&#x003F; If we must look at agriculture in the future, we do not have a production problem in South Africa. This is very clear from the reports which have been submitted. However, I want to emphasize that this industry in which a large diversity of people have an interest, is a large one. Has a position not developed in South Africa&#x2014;I say this with all due respect and reverence&#x2014;where certain people practicing agriculture have not kept abreast of scientific developments&#x003F; Just as in other sectors, technological development has also taken place in the agricultural industry. This has created certain problems for people. They simply could not keep abreast. I want to state that I believe that our greatest problem in respect of certain persons practicing agriculture, if one can call it a problem, is an administrative one. At a later stage an administrative problem inevitably develops into an economic one. It is a very simple matter to single out certain farmers in certain branches of industry and to say that they are going to the dogs. One can do so and broadcast the fact, claiming the situation in agriculture to be critical.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>We can place agriculture on a sound footing. I also believe that a healthy climate exists for the progressive farmer to make a success of the agricultural industry. However, we shall have to face up to certain things. We will have to rationalize our extension services. We shall have to co-ordinate them. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services is doing sufficient basic research. There are a tremendous amount of facts and research results available. They merely need to be adapted and applied in practice. What is the position to-day in this rapidly growing country of ours&#x003F; Just as in all other sectors professional people are being enticed away day in and day out by the profit trade, fertilizer companies and certain other companies. It is important for us to give our attention to that matter, because technological development is also important to agriculture and we also need those professional people there. I believe that with the necessary farsightedness this problem will also be solved. The farmer who has been well-trained and who is aware of technological developments acquaints himself with these and also has sufficient opportunities to do so, because sufficient farmers&#x2019; days are held by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services; all its publications are available to the farmers and they may read and study them. They can make inquiries. They are available to them and it can be done. I do not want to agree with the hon. member for Newton Park that agriculture in South Africa is in a critical condition. On the contrary. I think that even under these drought conditions our agriculture is still moving on a sound basis.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am in the fortunate position of being able to say that I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I think that as far as the agricultural aspect is concerned, he <span class="col_3737-3738" refersTo="page_0356"/>has performed his task well, and that he gave a particularly good reply to the hon. member for Albany. I would therefore consider it unreasonable of me to descend upon him as well. [Interjections.] He probably expected it and has consequently left the House. We regret that very much. Since he has been replied to very well, I shall simply come back to a few general matters. While listening to this debate, my summing up was that the whole discussion boiled down to a common-or-garden noconfidence debate. As far as the Opposition is concerned, there is now another theme. Instead of Bantu homelands they have now taken up finance. It is quite pleasant to have that variation in the House.</p>

<p>While listening to the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s speech, I was struck by one aspect in particular. This was that the hon. the Minister said that, during the past fiscal year which he was reviewing, foreign capital of approximately R450 million had come into the country. Mr. Speaker, this is a colossal sum of money, and one asks oneself in the first place what that money is doing in South Africa. A portion of it probably came to seek good profits here, but by far the greater portion of that money has fled from those countries and come to seek refuge here against the dangers, the uncertainties, against devaluation and depreciation, which is taking place in those countries. That money has come in search of a country with a strong government at the helm. I am sure that if we were to go to the investors who despatched the money we would find in them an inward desire for a strong government as well. Otherwise they could never have sent their valuable possessions to South Africa. If one now looks at that one must surely think back a little because our political memories are surely not so short. When this Government came into power, did we not hear from the other side of the House that the banks in this country would one day close down&#x003F; The only danger I can at present foresee in this connection is that the banks will have to close their safes for want of space for all the money streaming into the country. It actually embarrasses us. The liquidity of the country is too high, sharing prices are rocketing. Hon. members opposite said that bankruptcy was to be our fate under the National Party Government, but the man who to-day says that South Africa is headed for bankruptcy is most certainly misinformed.</p>

<p>I also listened to the plea which they made here about manpower. It is surely very evident that a manpower shortage is one of the problems connected with prosperity, because we have so many opportunities for work that there is insufficient manpower to provide for everyone&#x2019;s needs. My thoughts turn back to the past again. When this Government took over the administration of the country, they told us that it would not be long before we heard the footfalls of the unemployed, However, at present just the opposite is true. What is one to do with a previous government, an Opposition, which makes such predictions and which is exposed to such public ridicule after a few years&#x003F; One can take it further. They said that the ships would not touch at our harbours and that our products would lie rotting there. You know, Mr. Speaker, every morning as I drive along De Waal Drive and see the boats queueing to enter the harbour to make use of our facilities and to load up our products, I feel an inward satisfaction; a satisfaction which I can barely express here.</p>

<p>I also regret that the hon. member for Durban (Point) is not in the House at the moment. I have no hesitation in saying that the hon. member for Durban (Point) has indisputable political talent, but he had to resort to buffoonery in coming to grips with this Budget. He had to tell us that our babies would be deprived of baby powder after their baths. He had to tell us that our workers, he might as well have said some of our Members of Parliament, would not have the money to pay for the razor blades which they have to use every day. He railed against the purchase tax, spread his arms and asked who on this side of the House was defending it. But I think we are all doing so. I myself in particular, specifically because, with the purchase tax, the hon. the Minister has taken up an instrument with which to wield a particularly strong influence on the future economic development and progress of this country. Let us take those sectors in our country in which there is over-spending. The first and obvious one is the motor car sector. If we go to the motor car dealers we see there scores of motor cars which could easily have given another two or three years of service. There they stand, actually bearing witness to the affluence of the owners who came to trade them in on new models. Another sector is the furniture sector. If we go to the secondhand furniture shops we are amazed at the beautiful furniture standing there which has already been traded in and is now no longer fit for everyday use. The hon. the Minister can now clamp down on that and create the position whereby less money is spent in those sectors where overspending is taking place. There are a few such sectors that we are not altogether happy about and in respect of which we can, with great confidence, recommend a lower tax levy to the Minister. One of these is in respect of motor car tyres. I should very much like to see motor car tyres included in a lower tax group. We all make use of them and they are an absolute necessity. The Minister can also stimulate sectors which are not very active by removing taxes on those sectors altogether, or by encouraging them indirectly. It is also a fact, perhaps not in the same scheme of things, that the Minister is now encouraging university students in engineering in another way. I mention this because when I was thinking of what sector of our economy or public life was now inactive, I could not come upon any example. And then I thought whether the hon. the Minister could not perhaps help the United <span class="col_3739-3740" refersTo="page_0357"/>Party and make it a little more active. This would probably be to the advantage of us all and make things very much more interesting. There we now really have an apathetic sector.</p>

<p>I am glad that Oom Jan can count to four, at any rate. We are living in a young country. We are living in a country where we want its peoples&#x2019; most important possession to be initiative. The old tax system which we had actually had the great disadvantage of depriving so many of our people of this initiative. There are also farmers in my constituency&#x2014;I am now referring to farmers because at this stage we are actually speaking a little about agriculture&#x2014;who have said to me: &#x201C;Man, I can produce a lot of wheat, but I do not do so. I just keep a few sheep because if I begin to produce wheat the Government takes all my profits anyway. That element will now be eliminated altogether. One will now joyfully be able to return to the active labour field. What he now makes he may do whatever he wants with. The Receiver of Revenue is not going to grab him by the lapels and tell him he has to pay up. He may now freely spend wherever he wants to. The advantage to us will now be that our people will work very much harder in the future. Another advantage will be that they will work harder to obtain quicker promotion. When one deprives a person, with a spirit of enterprise, of his initiative, it is not only that person whom one is restricting. He is perhaps an employer. If he extends his business he can employ many other people. It would result in one also curtailing him as far as employment is concerned as well as those particular persons who could have earned a much better wage in his service. I want to conclude by saying that while it was always said in the past that the Budget was unimaginative&#x2014;we heard this <i>ad nauseam</i>&#x2014;no one can say so this time. One of the members opposite even said that the Minister is almost a genius. I shall leave it at that. I just want to say that even though we may have had unimaginative budgets in the past, this Budget is certainly brimful of imagination, and every man who wants to be worth his salt in this country, now has no limits to what he can achieve.</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>I want at the outset to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Christiana. He referred to the copious rains which the country has experienced in recent weeks and particularly this week. For my part this is the first occasion on which I have been able to participate in an agricultural debate while knowing that the farmers are not suffering from drought, and we are indeed grateful for this position. But that is the only respect in which I find myself in agreement with the hon. member. One feels concerned in a debate of this nature dealing particularly with agriculture, when it is a known fact that our agricultural industry is in a serious plight, that so many members on the Government side adopt the attitude that all is well. I have struck very few farmers in Walmer that are happy about this Budget and the same applies to the many farmers with whom I am acquainted in the Graaff-Reinet, Middelburg and Cradock districts, the main farming areas. Not so long ago a conference of farmers was held there in order to discuss their problems with the Government. The Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration was in attendance there and also the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, and the hon. members for Graaff-Reinet and Cradock were also there. I regret that they have not seen fit to attend this debate so that they could tell this House and the Minister of Finance what in fact the plight of the farmers is; because I am quite sure that the story these farmers told those hon. members is a very different one from the story hon. members are trying to tell us here in this House this afternoon.</p>

<p>The point raised by the hon. member for Bethal is that we are opposed to this system of indirect taxation, but I think the hon. member for Constantia made it quite clear that we on this side support the idea of introducing indirect taxation, but in the initial stages it should only be on luxury items. Our main complaint is that the field over which this taxation operates is far too wide, and I think he made it quite clear that if it were imposed on luxury items only in the initial stage and we used this year as an experiment in this field, we would be doing this job in a well-planned manner. Our quarrel with the Government in regard to the Budget is entirely based on the fact that the spread of the taxation is far too wide. I wish to support the hon. member for Newton Park when he says that this purchase tax is very definitely going to affect the costs of production of the agricultural sector. The hon. member for Mossel Bay said that this new system of taxation provided the Minister of Finance with a tool whereby he could activate certain sectors of the economy which were depressed and curtail others which were possibly causing inflation. But what has this Budget done to help the agricultural sector, which after all is the most depressed sector in the whole of our economy to-day&#x003F; It has done absolutely nothing to help the farmers to get back on to a sound foundation. That is our quarrel with the Government today. We are grateful for the rain, which is giving the farmers a breathing space. But I believe it should also give the Government a breathing space and give them an opportunity to face up to the problems besetting the farmers, and give them time to look again at the whole situation and to introduce a long-term policy which has the objective of putting the agricultural sector back on its feet. But obviously any long-term policy which is well thought out will involve the Government in very considerable financial obligations, far in excess of what is provided in the present <span class="col_3741-3742" refersTo="page_0358"/>Budget. All this Budget does is merely to perpetuate the <i>ad hoc</i> and patchwork approach which has characterized the Government&#x2019;s agricultural policy in recent years. The Government has made certain concessions and the farmers are grateful for what the Government has done to assist the farmer in various ways, and through various forms of subsidy. But our complaint is that this <i>ad hoc</i> patchwork is quite inadequate to remedy the ills besetting the agricultural sector. I want to support very strongly the hon. member for Newton Park in his contention that the only way in which we can solve permanently the problems of the farmers is to tackle this question of the interest rate which the farmer is to-day called upon to pay on his long-term investment. In other words, the interest he has to pay on his bond has reached the stage which the farmer cannot bear. The sooner the Government appreciates this fact, the sooner they will set themselves on a course which will solve the problems of our farmers. It seems to me that the Government fails to realize that the farmer to-day is over-capitalized and over-borrowed. Previous speakers have tried to show with statistics what the position was under the United Party r&#x00E9;gime. The hon. member for Bethal tried to show that to-day agricultural production <i>per capita</i> far exceeds what it was in those days, but all those statistics are meaningless. The fact is that never has agriculture been in as great difficulty as at present. There is no object in trying to establish what the reasons are behind all this. The fact is that the Government has a problem on its hands and what they have to do now is to come forward with realistic solutions to put agriculture back on its feet. The one thing they have to do is to tackle the problem of the interest rate the farmer has to pay. Everything else is <i>ad hoc</i> and patchwork. It is the rate of interest that is causing all the trouble. Members on this side of the House have come forward with the suggestion that there should be one channel financing for the farmers, and I believe that I am voicing the opinion of members on this side when I say that the Land Bank is a fine institution which is well run and is doing a splendid job for the farmers. But our belief is that the activities of the Land Bank should be greatly extended so that every farmer who wants assistance through the Land Bank is able to get it.</p>

<p>To-day it is only those farmers who find themselves in difficulties who are able to get financial assistance from the Land Bank. The reason why the Land Bank is not able to help them to the extent it may like to is the fact that it has a shortage of funds. I believe that what the Government should do is to make funds available to the Land Bank on a large scale so that they can play a far greater role in financing the needs of agriculture, both long-term and short-term. If the Government adopts this approach and the farmer can get assistance at a reasonable rate of interest, I am quite sure the need for all the other subsidies the farmers are getting will fall away. If the farmer can get his capital at a rate of interest which the industry can bear, all the many other forms of assistance by the Government will fall away. The industry will go ahead, and farmers themselves will feel less dependent on State aid. I am sure that an approach of this kind will set the industry back on a stable footing.</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they can find money for the Bantu Development Corporation and I believe that the same procedure can be adopted in this case. I am not suggesting that this should all happen at once. I realize that the total indebtedness of the agricultural sector is a far greater figure than anyone can expect the Government to finance in a year or two, but it should be a long-term plan; it should be the direction in which they start moving and I feel sure that a move in this direction will solve the problem. You see, Sir, we are confronted with a very serious situation in South Africa. I have raised this point before.</p>

<p>While the farmers are in this difficult position in which they are&#x2014;and there is no denying that this is the position&#x2014;they are not able to devote their attention to the question of getting soil erosion, which is such a serious thing in this country, under control. They are simply not in a position to undertake these works which are absolutely necessary at this stage, and that is another reason why I believe that it is very urgently necessary for the Government to take steps to help the farmer to get into a position in which he is able to undertake those soil erosion works which are so important. Sir, you very often come across people with completely wrong conceptions about this question of soil erosion. Many city <span class="col_3743-3744" refersTo="page_0359"/>dwellers believe that the soil erosion that we have in South Africa to-day has been created by the present generation of farmers who are on the land. Sir, that is not so. Soil erosion started when farming first started in South Africa, and what the present generation of farmers is concerned with is the cumulated effect of soil erosion over three or four centuries. I believe that it is grossly unfair to expect the present generation of farmers to tackle these problems without adequate Government assistance. We therefore look forward to the amendment of the Soil Conservation Act to see in what way the Government is going to improve matters in so far as assistance to farmers is concerned. But I want to make one suggestion this afternoon whereby I believe this question of soil conservation can be greatly stimulated. I have said here before that the gap seems to be widening between the number of approved works and the number not completed, as indicated in the last agricultural report. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture that he should devise a system whereby the Government provides the plant and machinery to undertake soil conservation works; that he should provide such equipment for every two or three magisterial districts; that he should place in charge of that necessary equipment a qualified engineer and qualified soil conservation technicians; that that plant should then systematically tackle all the more serious soil erosion problems within those three districts, and that this job of soil conservation should be tackled on a national basis in three or five or ten districts at a time. Sir, the problem today is that the farmer does not have the finance to do it and the work is not getting done. I believe that through this method the job will be done; that it will be effectively done and that it will eliminate much of the present delay.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Well, soil conservation is (a) to protect the pastures and (b) to assist in their protection by creating earth banks and weirs, etc., that can assist the natural growth to rehabilitate itself; so it is a two-pronged attack on soil erosion, involving both biological methods of control and also mechanical methods of control. I believe that the farmers themselves will deal with the biological methods, but I am suggesting to the hon. the Minister that he should introduce these methods in order to get the mechanical control methods going; they are the methods that the farmer cannot afford at the present time.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to conclude by re-emphasizing that the basic problem of the agricultural sector is this question of the interest rate. I believe that the farmers in the country are bitterly disappointed in this Budget in that there is no indication at this stage that the Government is in fact grappling with this problem. The farmers know, and I am sure the Government knows, that this is the only proper course to adopt. You see, Sir, we have had the Marais Commission&#x2019;s interim report which dealt with soil conservation and veld rehabilitation, but we have not had the report which deals with financial measures. This commission has been investigating these problems for three years, and there is still no sign of the report. I think we are entitled to ask the Government when they expect this report to be Tabled and whether, when it is Tabled the Government is going to accept the recommendations which are made therein and whether we can expect a revolutionary approach to this question.</p>

Is the Government in fact waiting for this report to be Tabled, and will the Minister of Agriculture assure me that when it is Tabled we can then possibly expect a new approach by the Government&#x003F; I think the farmers are entitled to know this. The farmers are asking us why the Government is doing nothing about this. We might say that they are awaiting the report of the Marais Commission &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I follow up what the hon. member for Walmer said, allow me to say to the Minister that my voters are very grateful for the Budget. The message I have to give him is that it is nobler to give than to take.</p>

<p>Sir, at times it is rather worthwhile to listen to the hon. member for Walmer who has just sat down. I was particularly interested in what he recently said at Uitenhage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">U.P. Needs new Heart, says Kingwill: The United Party needed &#x201C;a heart transplant&#x201D;, said Mr. Walter Kingwill.</block>

<p><span class="col_3745-3746" refersTo="page_0360"/>And he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe the U.P. needs a heart transplant. The people who can give it that transplant are the congress leaders.</block>

<p>After all, Mr. Speaker, to perform a heart transplant is nothing. But that is not what the hon. members opposite need. What they need is a brain transplant, but how can that be done&#x003F; One can substitute something for something else; one can substitute a new heart for an old weak heart, but if there is no brain, that cannot be substituted. Sir, what I find so remarkable about this debate, is the following: There sits the hon. member for Walmer and there sits the hon. member for Newton Park. Like myself, these two hon. members represent urban constituencies. We are representatives of Port Elizabeth, and since I have been a member of this House those two members have not once taken up the cudgels for their voters. To-day I sat here and listened to the hon. member for Newton Park, and I thought that he, after his recent volcanic eruption in Port Elizabeth, would plead for his voters, but he was as mute as the grave. I listened to his speech with great care and if I had to give a summary of what he said about farming, I would do so by saying that his only contention was that the farmers were a povertystricken, sad, indigent lot of people who were dependent on the State. This is how he acted here. He simply overlooked the fact that there are also farmers who are credit-worthy, who are well provided with capital; that there are also farmers who do pay income tax. He overlooked the fact that there is a prosperous farming community as well; that there are farmers who are living in modern houses, who have luxury cars and who go overseas. But if one listens to the hon. member for Newton Park, one would swear that the farmers are a poverty-stricken, sad and indigent section of the population of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member issued a challenge to me because I had accompanied Mr. Niemand, the Secretary for Community Development, on an inspection tour he had arranged at the request of the Port Elizabeth City Council. I had requested sub-economic housing and economic housing for the lower income groups in my constituency. The Secretary notified me that he would visit my constituency, and at the same time the mayor invited me to dine with him and the Secretary, and Sir, do you know what happened&#x003F; The hon. member made the following attack&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Port Elizabeth&#x2019;s two Opposition members, Mr. Myburgh Streicher (Newton Park) and Mr. Walter Kingwill (Walmer) are furious about not being invited to municipal meetings and to tour housing schemes in the City with Mr. J. H. Niemand.</block>

<block name="quote">Housing is not the concern of a single party. It concerns us all and common courtesy should have informed Mr. Potgieter that the Opposition M.P.&#x2019;s should also have been invited.</block>

Here a green member of the United Party comes along and takes it amiss of me for not having invited him. Am I under any moral obligation to invite Opposition members when I undertake an inspection tour in the interests of my own constituency&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, have you ever come across such audacity&#x003F; Surely, my own voters would murder me if I were to arrive there in the company of a member of the United Party! However, this is not all. I know why the hon. member wanted to accompany me. He does not know what Port Elizabeth looks like. When the hon. member puts in one of his rare appearances in Port Elizabeth, he needs a guide to take him around. The hon. member thought that this inspection tour would have been a good opportunity to have had a guide who could have showed him the inside of Port Elizabeth. Because the hon. member could not have his way, as I did not invite him, he and the hon. member for Newton Park went further and issued a challenge to me.</p>

We then gave him the opportunity of doing so. However, during the debate he did not say one single word about housing, because he does not know anything about housing. The fact of the matter is that as yet the hon. members for Walmer and Newton Park have never taken up the cudgels for the lower income group of Port Elizabeth to plead for better housing for them.

<p>They have no knowledge of the sums of money involved. They do not know that it is not the primary duty of the Government or of the Department of Community Development to build houses. In terms of the Act of 1966 it is the duty of the muncipalities to provide the lower income groups with houses. The Government merely acts in a secondary and supplementary capacity. Why does the Opposition never talk about housing and why does it never plead for houses&#x003F; It is because the Port Elizabeth City Council is being governed by their political associates. If hon. members for those constituencies get up here to plead for housing, they clash with that liberalistic section that rules the Port Elizabeth City Council. I want to ask the hon. member to tell this House how much money was made available to Port Elizabeth by the Department of Community Development. It made R11 million, of which amount R4 million was used, available to the Municipality of Port Elizabeth. The total amount made available to Port Elizabeth was R17.6 million, of which amount R13.1 million was used. Therefore, if the hon. member wants to debate housing in the City Hall, here or anywhere else, he must come along with me and ask his liberalistic City Council, his political associates, why they do not use that money to build houses for the underprivileged people in Port Elizabeth. The Department of Community Development, however, acts in a supplementary capacity. In this case too it acted in a supplementary capacity and built houses for Whites and Indians in Port Elizabeth at a cost of R5&#x00BD; million and R300,000, respectively. Now I also want to say that, although all former governing parties in South Africa have always been sympathetic towards the question of housing, phenomenal progress has been made in this field, especially during the past 15 years of National Party rule. Out of a total amount of R490,288,000 voted by South African Governments from 1920 to 31st May, 1963, for a total of 397 housing schemes, the National Party made no less than R313,000,000 available during the past 15 years. Now I want to tell the hon. member that he may well plead for housing in this House, because he has the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>However, this is not all. I have not yet finished with the hon. members for Walmer and Newton Park&#x2014;on the contrary, I am now coming back to them. Hon. members will recall what happened last year on 1st September when that terrible catastrophe hit Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Within three hours 22 inches of rain fell. Because this Government knows that it is nobler to give than to take, it made R1 million available to those people. In that time of crisis we saw teamwork in Port Elizabeth; teamwork with the mayor at the head. The heads of the various Government Departments, the Police, the Fire Brigade, the Red Cross and the Department of Social Welfare all rendered assistance. Those people carried on teamwork operations and at their side were the National Party members of Parliament, the member for Algoa, the member for Port Elizabeth (Central) and the member for Port Elizabeth (North). [Interjections.] Where were the two hon. United Party members&#x003F; What did they do&#x003F; They launched an attack in the Press under the heading &#x201C;Nat politicians accused of negligence after floods&#x201D;. My dear friends, during the flood, while the fight was on we were, like a good <span class="col_3749-3750" refersTo="page_0362"/>general, with our men in that fight. Now they want to know where we were after the fight. [Laughter.] Is it not an outrageous scandal that one should want to make political capital out of the sufferings of our people there. Let me read the rest of that newspaper report:</p>

<block name="quote">They pointed out that Mr. W. G. Kingwill, the United Party M.P. for Walmer, left his farm near Graaff-Reinet to come to Port Elizabeth to offer his assistance. Mr. D. M. Streicher, the United Party M.P. for Newton Park, returned on the first plane from Cape Town, where he was holidaying with his family, on Wednesday.</block>

<p>The one hon. member was holidaying on his farm, the other hon. member was holidaying in Cape Town, while my colleagues and I had to do their work. This is how things go year in and year out in Port Elizabeth. The one member sits in Graaff-Reinet, the other in Richmond, and we three National Party colleagues have to do their work. They simply come to look for votes every five years. [Interjections.] Where is this leading to&#x003F; The power of Nationalism is beginning to show itself. We have three seats in Port Elizabeth and we are going to storm the other two as well. Now I just want to ask hon. members of the Opposition, who maintain from day to day that the National Party is on the decline, to listen to what the <i>Evening Post</i> of 29th March wrote under the heading &#x201C;U.P. Big Guns for P.E. Elections&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir De Villiers Graaff, the Leader of the Opposition, is coming to P.E. to participate in part of an all-out effort by the United Party to retain the Walmer constituency.</block>

<p>At the Provincial Council election their candidate was returned unopposed. Last year they took the seat with an enormous majority. Now, however, it is a different matter. We have not even started our attack and already the Leader of the Opposition proceeds there to see whether the seat cannot be retained for them. The newspaper report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir De Villiers Graaff will be the dinner guest of honour at a dinner dance on 9th May.</block>

<p>When the South African nation is occupied with serious matters supporters of the United Party are dancing. [Laughter.] The report goes on, and hon. members opposite will be well advised to pay attention, because this is very interesting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Jacobs, M.P. (Hillbrow) will address a big political rally in the Port Elizabeth City Hall.</block>

<p>However, the United Party does not have good attendances at their meetings. What is very unusual to me is that there is such a strange link between these things. When I think of The hon. member, Dr. Jacobs, and of the hon. Leader of the Opposition, Sir De Villiers Graaff, I involuntarily think back to something in the past. While the late Field-marshal Smuts was winning the war, the late Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr was undermining him here in South Africa. Wherever one went in Port Elizabeth he was enforcing equality. Whenever one met Coloured voters and asked them for what party they voted, they answered: The &#x201C;Russian Party.&#x201D; [Interjections.] The United Party was communistically orientated as long ago as 1948, communistically orientated to such an extent that they had champions of Communism in their ranks. Do hon. members want to deny this&#x003F; While Adv. Strauss was overseas, the same thing happened. He was undermined by the present Leader of the Opposition! And now the Leader of the Opposition is being undermined by the hon. member who is behind him on the Opposition benches, the hon. member for Hillbrow! Here in South Africa we are going to find that history will repeat itself.</p>

<p>Where I have been talking of the flood, I just want to say that at the next election the Opposition will be drowning men in the flood of Nationalism which will engulf them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is probably very interesting to listen to public opinion, but we never get to hear about much of it. One cannot but enjoy doing so.</p>

<p>I represent a constituency which is faced with many problems. My entire constituency has been declared a drought stricken area in the past three years, with the exception of a few quarters. I should like to express a few ideas here, specifically in regard to the practical implementation of assistance to our farmers, something which is not always brought to the attention of hon. members. However, before I come to that, I want to mention that in the past four sessions during which I have represented that constituency, I have heard how the arguments raised by hon. Opposition members have on every occasion been refuted by hon. members on this side of the House. They are refuted by proven facts and by comparison with the record of the hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have remarked that the speeches of hon. members on the opposite side of the House have progressively been more devoid of content. We know why this is so. Why did we have such a short introductory speech to-day about agriculture by the hon. member for Newton Park&#x003F; I thought that he would speak for another hour, but he did not utilize his full time. Why did he not do so&#x003F; Because the entire country has had rains by this time and because the farmers&#x2019; financial position is going to change.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I know what I am talking about because I do not represent an urban area, I represent farmers.</p>

<p>The droughts are being exploited in a way which makes one ashamed for the hon. Opposition. The other day I heard&#x2014;it was something that was said in a way I should not have adopted&#x2014;that the general opinion is that the Opposition is not praying for rain at present, but for a drought so that the farmers would be hard-pressed and the Opposition be afforded a means with which to attack the Government.</p>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>However, I do not want to say so, but I think that they often regret the prosperity of the farmers because they cannot succeed in using propaganda in connection with the circumstances in which the farmers find themselves. I disapprove of it and am saying it so that people may know that it is scandalous to exploit drought conditions for political gain.</p>

<p>We know that in the present circumstances the farmers are experiencing difficulties, but I also notice that they are gradually recovering financially. To-day we have heard the hon. members of the Opposition blowing hot and cold. Yesterday when an hon. member mentioned a man with an income of R2,000 a year, this man was, according to them, a rich man. However, to-day when mention was made here of the income of a farmer which was judged at between R5,000 and R10,000 he was described as a poor man. I want to claim that the farmers are experiencing difficulties, but things are not as bad as the hon. Opposition would have people believe from one platform to another.</p>

<p>The farmers&#x2019; problems have three basic causes. The first is the drought and the second is that at least 65 per cent of our farmers have paid too much for their land. The third is that uneconomic units have brought our farming to such a pass that we can no longer make the profits that we made on larger economic units. If the hon. members of the Opposition come along with the propaganda that there were 125,000 farmers under their Government as against 105,000 under the present Government, is it not logical that the policy we are striving towards each day and which the Opposition would also like to implement. is being carried out&#x003F; Must uneconomic units not be converted into economic ones&#x003F; If this policy is being carried out. then surely the numbers of farmers must decrease. In the irrigation areas of my constituency, an area 90 miles in extent, we have recently increased the economic units of 65 per cent of those farmers. This means, does it not, that the number of farmers must decrease and it is surely heartening to know that the remaining farmers are farmers who are economically stronger than before. The Opposition merely let matters run their course and did not try to prevent uneconomic units from developing. I regret that the hon. member for Gardens is not here, because I want him to know what I am talking about. He will probably not be able to contradict me, but I should like him to hear what I am talking about because he is an extensive farmer in my constituency. Let us now look at the assistance which the Government gives to the farmers. My constituency was the district most severely subjected to drought conditions in the Northern Cape and I want to use those farms in the particular district within my constituency as examples here. There are 422 farms within that district, of which only 29 are farms of under 1,000 morgen. They are Karoo farms, and does the hon. member want to tell me that under present circumstances a Karoo farm of 1,000 morgen can afford a livelihood to a farmer with a family&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<p>Under your policy a farmer will need more and more land!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, I can prove that the State has rendered assistance to those farmers. I shall demonstrate to that member and to the member for Gardens, who is well acquainted with my constituency, that financial assistance and mortgages were even obtained on land inhabited by what are regarded as small farmers. In the country districts to-day it is being propagated that the State is not prepared to help the small farmers; I may just say that it is not true and I want to prove this. Of these 422 farms in my constituency, 67 are less than 2,000 morgen in extent. In this district there are also farms which have recently been converted into more economic units by purchases. When farmers make purchases of land the number of farmers must necessarily decrease because those farmers are of necessity placed in a better financial position and on larger economic units. This is the Government&#x2019;s policy and it is a policy which is being implemented daily. Of the number of farms in that district, there are also 66 of less than 3,000 morgen in extent. This situation developed during the time of the United Party Government, and they did nothing about it. However, to-day they blame the National Party for it. The solution has only been a recent one in as much as the Government has been doing everything in its power to rehabilitate these people economically. It is once more possible for these farmers to obtain larger economic units and a great deal of help has been afforded them, as much as possible in fact. We know that droughts cause misery, and when they occur they destroy everything. It is no use being rich or well-endowed, it does not matter whether you are clever or not, or how much you possess, if a drought is a lengthy one it destroys every farmer. The Government did everything in its power to <span class="col_3753-3754" refersTo="page_0364"/>help as far as it could. Let us look at what is done in practice. I now want that hon. member opposite to listen to what I am saying, because I know that he holds meetings in my area and then different stories are told to the people. They then tell of the farmers making hundreds and thousands of applications, but receive no assistance. I now want to furnish certain particulars and hon. members opposite can look them up and see whether I am speaking the truth or not. I should like to maintain my honesty as we all would. In the particular district which I mentioned, where the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens is farming two out of every three applications for the purchase of land were approved. 100 per cent of the applications for soil conservation assistance received grants. All farmers who applied for assistance in the purchase of livestock received it. In the same district two out of every three requests for the consolidation of debts were approved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>How many applications were there&#x003F; There could only have been two or three.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>The question is not how many requests there were. Assistance is given according to the needs of the people in that particular area. 362 applications for fodder loans were made and 362 of them were approved. We are all old farmers and we have also been through years of hardship. When have farmers ever submitted so many successful applications for assistance as has been the case under this Government and this hon. Minister&#x003F; In this district alone over the past 2&#x00BD; years an amount of R737,000.96 was spent to support the people there financially and to rehabilitate the farmers. It is not a constituency, it is not a large district, merely a district subject to the conditions I have described here.</p>

<p>What is the position of our farmers to-day&#x003F; From one platform to another I hear that the farmers&#x2019; burden of debt is R1,200 million. I think that if hon. members opposite had taken a little trouble to go into the figures they would have seen that this was not so. The burden of debt is a mere R1,000 million; the balance is in respect of other debts. Twenty, and even 15 years ago, there were dilapidated farms in that vicinity, farms which were unplanned, unfenced and uncultivated. But to-day one can go down from the east right through Namaqualand, down into those parts, and every farm will be a model farm. Every irrigation scheme has its model smallholdings. A great deal of money was spent on achieving this. Farm work was done, houses were built, packing sheds erected, dams constructed, fences put up, camps established and drinking troughs erected. The farms were cultivated in such a way that they can be productive to-day. All this cost thousands upon thousands of rands. Of course, more than one farm was over-capitalized, but these costs were incurred over a number of years and will not have to be incurred each year. In the years to come those farmers will surely not have to incur those costs again. We now find ourselves in a period where we can rehabilitate, where we can pay our debts and decrease this burden. However, what troubles me is this. What have the people done who have to help us in this struggle&#x003F; They have said to Barclays Bank, Standard Bank, the Land Bank, Agricultural Credit, to all the financial bodies, and to the private sector, &#x201C;You must be careful what you lend and entrust to these farmers, since they are no longer creditworthy.&#x201D; I say that hon. members opposite, as they sit there today, have in many respects not benefited the position of our farmers but rather prejudiced it. We are now having welcome rains and the position of our farmers is in the process of improving We know what the incomes of our farmers are from the marketing of their wool, meat and karakul pelts. That constituency where it has recently been so dry, had an income of R816,000 every two months. We know that it will take time, and we merely need time. Therefore I ask that the help given should take place on a long-term basis so that our farmers may in the course of time be ensured of stability.</p>

<p>I now want to conclude. I believe that this Government has done a great deal for the creation and development of our foreign markets. We are to-day marketing our products in countries which we previously considered merely as countries on the world map. We did not realize the marketing potential in those countries. The Government took positive action and assisted our farmers in marketing their products in other countries at prices which are to-day world market prices. If we can have insight into our own faults, if we can rehabilitate ourselves, we can be assured of a good livelihood in the future. I know that the high interest rate is giving cause for complaint. Hon. members on this side, as well as the hon. member for Colesberg, have already mentioned it. We welcomed the reference to it. But we on this side are not as irresponsible as the hon. Opposition. We are responsible for the general framework of South Africa. We must save our country and keep it sound. We cannot simply put up a glass door at the front; we must also construct a door at the back so that we are not without a door there. The future of our country must be ensured by this Government. I do not want to detract from the difficult circumstances in which many of our farmers find themselves to-day. However, knowing our farmers as I do, with their sound judgment and capabilities, and with the moneyed position in which we still find ourselves, we can enter the future with faith and courage, if God will merely grant us sufficient rains, as we are having at present.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall begin by dealing with the hon. member <span class="col_3755-3756" refersTo="page_0365"/>for Prieska. I notice the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) is not here at the moment, and I shall therefore come to him later. I see the hon. member has just come in. I any case, the hon. member for Prieska spoke mainly about his own constituency and matters within his own constituency. He spoke about agriculture, about the conditions farmers are experiencing in that part of the world and about the subdivision of farms. I should like to say a few words about this matter. He made one statement which I really deplore, namely that this side of the House always exploits the drought. He said he heard people say that we on this side of the House will even pray for the drought to continue. This is a deplorable accusation. On several occasions this side of the House and even I have pleaded with the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Agriculture about the conditions of drought. How did we not plead! How many times did we not take deputations to see the hon. the Ministers, deputations of which we ourselves were members. We had interviews with the Ministers about matters concerning the drought, because we wanted to assist the farmers in seeing the drought through until the advent of rain, and it is raining at this very moment, something for which we are all very grateful. Why does that honourable member&#x2014;I mean hon. member, but of course he is also an honourable person&#x2014;say something so deplorable&#x003F; Save for a few exceptions all hon. members opposite do is repeatedly attack hon. members on this side instead of speaking about the drought.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) now, but I notice that the hon. member has disappeared again. I am sorry he is not here. I have very little to say to him. [Interjections.] I sent a messenger to the hon. member a moment ago informing him that I was going to reply to what he had said. He was in the Chamber a moment ago, but he has left again. All the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) did was to reveal himself as a clown on the opposite side and make the House laugh. He attacked his colleagues on this side of the House, his colleagues who represent that city as well, the city with, what he calls, the imperialistic city council &#x2026;</p>

<p>I mean liberalistic city council; all he did was to attack them all along. This is all his speech consisted of. To my mind this is equally deplorable.</p>

<p>I now want to deal further with a few statements made by the hon. member for Prieska. He spoke about the subdivision of land and he said that the size of farms in that part of the Karoo has dropped to below 1,000 morgen. We all want to agree that a farmer cannot make a decent living on 1,000 morgen of Karoo land unless he has a great deal of irrigation at his disposal. He went on to say that this state of affairs developed under the United Party regime. Surely this is not true. After all, it took years and generations for this state of affairs to develop. It was a question of land subdivided for heirs. Those people are slowly rehabilitating themselves now. The hon. member for Prieska would do well to tell us how many of those 420 farms in his constituency are more than 10,000 morgen in extent. He did not give us the figure, but there are many of them. There are many units which have become uneconomically large units. However, I do not want to argue on the basis of whether a unit is economic or uneconomic. I shall come back to this subject later, because I should first like to discuss with the hon. the Minister of Finance a few matters concerning the Budget itself.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia said that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, there is nothing wrong with having a purchase tax. A purchase tax is being applied in America, in England, as well as in many other countries. We would have given it our blessing if it had been imposed on luxury articles. We would have been satisfied had the hon. the Minister taxed furs, jewellery, tobacco, liquor and other non-essential goods. If he had a scale according to which the more expensive and luxurious articles were taxed more heavily, we would have appreciated it and we would have given him our support. But what did he do&#x003F; He introduced a sales tax, a tax which is, in the first place, imposed at the point of origin, that is, either with the manufacturer or at the customs. I want to put a certain question to the hon. the Minister now, and when he replies to the debate&#x2014;I believe he is going to do so on Tuesday&#x2014;he can tell us how this system is going to operate. Let us take a manufacturer or a collector of articles or a person who manufactures articles consisting of various components, articles which are purchased and are subject to the respective taxation tariffs in terms of this new schedule. The article reaches the stage where it is manufactured ultimately. What portion of that finished product is subject to 10 per cent taxation, what portion is subject to 5 per cent and what portion is subject to 20 per cent taxation&#x003F; And what will the proportion be&#x003F; How is a manufacturer who uses various motor vehicles as well as other components which are subject to taxation, going to decide what portion of the finished product is subject to what taxation, or how is somebody else going to decide&#x003F; Who is going to say what taxation he may impose for the wholesale trade&#x003F;</p>

<p>When this debate was adjourned yesterday afternoon, I was explaining to the hon. the Minister of Finance that we on this side of the House did not object to a purchase tax, as we had indicated before. But I also told him that the tax he was introducing, was not a purchase tax. Sir, this Budget, as it was presented by the hon. the Minister and as printed, has two fatal shortcomings; it contains two fatal mistakes. The first is that the tax is not only being imposed on luxuries, but on virtually all necessities, including commodities which the poorest among us must buy, and I am sure that it was the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention to tax these needy people. The second difficulty is that this tax, in its implementation, could lend itself to corruption and misunderstanding on an unprecedented scale. I stated yesterday that we on this side of the House would have had no objection if this tax had been levied on luxuries, as we presumed the Minister would do. This is what one would have expected in view of the fact that he is engaged in an experiment here. He could perhaps have collected enough in taxes by only levying a tax on those luxuries which were mentioned yesterday.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The articles I mentioned yesterday were furs, jewellery, expensive motor cars, liquor and cigarettes. The Minister knows as well as I do that if he had only levied the tax on the latter two items, he would collect a colossal amount in taxes. After all, it was not the Minister&#x2019;s intention to collect precisely R100 million; he wanted the principle of a new form of taxation to be accepted, a form which this side of the House is also prepared to accept. But then he went along and taxed furniture, refrigerators, stoves, polish, mattresses, soap, toiletries, bed linen, tyres, tubes, motor cars, station wagons, etc. Sir, these are everyday requirements for everybody. Some of these items are even being used by the indigent, and they will also have to pay tax on them. I am convinced that this was not the Minister&#x2019;s intention. I think that this new system of taxation is an ill-considered system. Sir, I want to come to the second point.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Are you proposing that a higher tax should be imposed on motor cars, liquor and cigarettes&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>They are luxuries, and the hon. the Minister announced that this sales duty would be a tax on luxuries and semi-luxuries. These are articles which the average person can do without. I referred to expensive motor cars, liquor, cigarettes, jewellery and furs. These are articles which need not be used by the average salaried person who earns R2,000 per year, by those who do not receive any salary or by pensioners.</p>

<p>Sir, yesterday I was speaking on the implementation of this sales duty. What happens when a manufacturer has to purchase parts, varnish, paint, turpentine or leather&#x003F; All these things are being taxed in terms of the schedule. In certain cases the sales duty is 10 per cent <span class="col_3773-3774" refersTo="page_0374"/>and in other cases it is 20 per cent. The manufacturer has to absorb this tax in his production costs, which would then increase to that extent. How on earth can one calculate the production costs of a manufacturer who uses goods on which tax has, in the first instance, been paid at the source&#x003F; He is the second man, for in his manufacturing process he uses goods on which he has already paid tax at the source, but he, in turn, is also the source of the article he manufactures. We now come to the article he has manufactured; he adds a certain amount to his production costs. It is impossible for anybody to ascertain whether the article he manufactures, includes 7 per cent of this article and 10 per cent of that article on which he has already paid tax at the source, and whether a certain percentage of the materials from which he manufactured that article is, therefore, not subject to tax. This article now goes from the manufacturer to the wholesaler, who in turn adds his margin of profit. From there it goes to the retailer, who in turn adds his margin of profit and then it eventually reaches the consumer. Suppose that an article costs R100 at the source. If the tax is 20 per cent, the price becomes R120 after the new tax has been added, i.e. when it leaves the manufacturer. From there the article goes to the wholesaler, who in turn adds 25 per cent; then it goes to the retailer, who in his turn adds 33 per cent. Has the hon. the Minister and his costing staff calculated what that article is eventually going to cost&#x003F; By the time it reaches the consumer the increase is going to amount to considerably more than 10 per cent or 20 per cent. Sir, there is another consideration: There is no control over the margin of profit of the manufacturer, the wholesaler or the retailer. Each of them can push up the price at will. With a few exceptions, no control is being exercised over the percentage they may add. It may perhaps be said that healthy competition will preclude abuses, but this is not the system according to which a sales duty is being levied in most countries of the world. Sir, the hon. the Minister has travelled extensively of late. He visits America much more often than I do; he visits England and other countries. In respect of each article he purchases, he receives an invoice on which, so he will find, the price of the article is reflected and the tax is indicated by way of a percentage. If one is a tourist and one has the goods one has purchased forwarded to the airport or to the point of departure, one does not pay purchase tax. But this is not what one does in regard to the everyday purchases one makes there. One purchases one&#x2019;s requirements at the shop, just as the average citizen does, and one pays the tax and receives an invoice for that purchase. If one does not receive an invoice, as is the case when a packet of cigarettes is bought, the shop assistant tells one that the price of the cigarettes is 25 cents and the tax is 1&#x00BD; cents. He never states the price of that article as being 26&#x00BD; cents. He always says that the price is so much and that the tax is so much: consequently it is always possible, under all circumstances, for the consumer to control the percentage of tax he pays. If the Minister were to levy in this case a tax based on a certain percentage of the purchase price of the various commodities at the point of consumption, it would have been something to which we could have lent our support, provided that he does not levy the tax on basic commodities which the poor and the indigent have to use daily. It will be extremely difficult to implement this tax. Even at this early stage people are having great difficulty in finding out how this tax is going to be implemented. The newspapers want to know how the tax is going to be implemented in respect of various commodities; there are manufacturers who are saying that they do not know how to implement this tax. They approach their M.P.s because they think that these people ought to know how the tax is going to be implemented. They ask one: &#x201C;What do I do in connection with parts which I have to buy at various rates of tax and incorporate in my commodity&#x003F;&#x201D; I should be glad if the hon. the Minister would deal with this matter in his reply. I think the Minister will still come to the conviction that it would be worthwhile and preferable to exempt some of these items from this tax. Let us then see how the tax operates in respect of the rest of the items which remain subject to tax. In this way we may then devise a sound system.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say a few words about the agricultural industry, and if anybody wants to upbraid me for being an urban representative speaking on agricultural matters, then he is welcome to do so. In this House there are many rural representatives who speak on urban matters and no offence is taken at their doing so. It is only when urban representatives speak on rural matters that they are reproached, despite the fact that they may be farmers. I am thinking of the hon. member for Walmer, for instance. When I think of the achievements the hon. member has attained and of the kind of person he is, it astonishes me that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) has attacked him here. Incidentally, Sir, I heard here yesterday that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) was having a huge house built for himself by Coloured labourers and contractors. I want to offer my apology in the event of my information being wrong, but that is what I heard.</p>

<p>This is the man who rises here and flings out reproaches in connection with housing and that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Sir, I shall now deal with the agricultural industry. All of us are jubilant over the very good rains we have had in most of the drought-stricken districts. We are jubilant over them because this country has not had such fine rains for a very long time. But it did not <span class="col_3775-3776" refersTo="page_0375"/>rain money. The mortgage and the interest burdens have not been lightened either, and the farmer is as subject to all these taxes which I mentioned here a moment ago, as is the city dweller. But as a rule the farmer is usually an employer as well; he has many employees, and the farmer&#x2019;s labourers must all pay this tax. The result of this tax will be that the farmer&#x2019;s wages account and his production costs will increase. Yesterday the hon. member for Albany mentioned here how many items such as paint, tyres, fencing, etc., had to be included in the farmer&#x2019;s production costs. In addition to that, if he is a married man, he is subject to this sales duty on all the requirements for himself and his family. But most important of all is the fact that his production costs are going to rise further because he will have to pay higher wages to his labourers, who also have to pay the sales duty. In trying to analyse what the agricultural industry is receiving by way of this Budget, I do not want to attempt to determine, as the hon. member for Prieska did yesterday, the reasons why the agricultural industry is struggling. We know why the agriculturist is struggling. The hon. member mentioned two or three reasons. Of course, drought is one of the reasons. The hon. member did not mention the farmer&#x2019;s interest burden and his high costs, but he said that these persons had paid too much for their land. Sir, perhaps they did. Now I want to put a direct question to the hon. member and I shall resume my seat if he wishes to reply to it. Is he of the opinion that R20 per morgen is too much for land in Prieska&#x003F;</p>

<p>I heard that the hon. member had paid it very recently for land in Prieska, and I wondered how he dared to rise in this debate and criticize other people for having paid too high a price for agricultural land. If in the past they had paid too high a price for agricultural land, then this is definitely no longer the case to-day. Throughout the Karoo and the Eastern Cape we find that the price of agricultural land has, in many regions, dropped sharply.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The price paid for agricultural land in the past, is water under the bridge; nothing can be done about that; all we can do is to try to save these people or to help them to remain on the land. Whether we want to build up larger units and eliminate smaller units or whether we want to consolidate larger units, the fact remains that the person who has paid high prices for his large units, experiences the same problems. The agricultural industry does receive aid, and this side of the House has on many occasions expressed its gratitude for such aid. The agricultural industry receives aid by way of subsidies, rebates, loans, etc. In addition there are the Land Bank and the Agricultural Credit Board which are of assistance to farmers. These wonderful rains have now made it possible for the agricultural industry to be rehabilitated. Hon. members on this side of the House have always said that the rehabilitation of pasturage and the agricultural industry is linked with the fact that there has to be two or three good summers first. Pasturage cannot be rehabilitated unless it rains. Now we are in a position to do so, because we have had very good rains. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture is aware of the large number of deputations which came to see him, before the rains came, in connection with the rehabilitation of pasture lands and agricultural land. I do not want to level reproaches, but I only hope that the hon. the Minister will do his best now that this miracle has happened and that we have had such very good rains. We are now in a position to save and rehabilitate pasturage. I hope that the hon. the Minister will nevertheless do something at this late stage, even if he could not do so in this Budget, towards making provision for pasture lands being rested.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I have already made an announcement in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I know that an announcement has been made, but the system and the particulars of that system have not come into operation as yet. There has merely been an announcement so far, whereas there are many people who wanted to start right now.</p>

<p>In this Budget an additional amount of more than R3 million has been made available for the agricultural industry. I want to return to the point that was made yesterday by the hon. member for Albany. The pineapple industry forms a small part of the agricultural industry. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that, although only 18,000 tons of fresh pineapples were exported, which only represents 1 1/4 or 1&#x00BD; million crates, those persons who have taken all the trouble to export the pineapples and to try to stabilize and feed the market and to make an industry out of it on the overseas market, receive a subsidy or devaluation compensation&#x2014;call it what you please; I do not know what the hon. the Minister wants us to call the latter&#x2014;of R2 per ton. At poor prices fresh fruit exported will net him R80 per ton, and I am asking whether this is fair towards them. When I say poor prices, I mean that farmers merely receive a profit of R1 on a crate of pineapples which they export. In other words, if he receives R3 per crate and the shipping charges and so forth have been deducted, he only receives R1 per crate. In that case he will get R80 per ton for his pineapples. Therefore, is it fair that, whereas the factories receive <span class="col_3777-3778" refersTo="page_0376"/>R6.70 or R6.80 per ton for their pineapples, the farmers only receive R2 per ton in the form of devaluation compensation or of a subsidy&#x003F; I want to make the statement that R2 per ton on a commodity with a price of R80 per ton is an absurd percentage when one has regard to the fact that the devaluation was 14 per cent.</p>

<p>Mention was also made yesterday of what had been done for the wool industry. We are appreciative of the fact that the levy has been reduced. The hon. member for Christiana also referred to wool yesterday. I want to give him the friendly advice he gave to me a few years ago, i.e. that if I do not know enough about maize, I should not talk about it. I want to tell the hon. member that if he does not know enough about wool, he should not talk about it either. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member referred to the wonderful aid granted to brokers. Does the hon. member know what that aid amounted to&#x003F; Of course, he knows that it is a loan granted by the Land Bank.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I know as much about wool as you do.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member ought to know that it is a loan by the Land Bank to the broker for which the farmer now pays 8 per cent interest where he used to pay 8&#x00BD; per cent. This half per cent is a tremendous reduction. Even if it is not so tremendous, we are still grateful for it. I cannot put enough emphasis on the fact that we are now in a position to rehabilitate the agricultural industry. In a friendly way I want to put it to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and the hon. the Minister of Finance that as a result of the abundant rains we have had throughout the country we are now in a position to rehabilitate the agricultural industry. The agricultural industry cannot rehabilitate itself with the aid it has been granted up to now. If we are prepared to spend colossal amounts and to increase them by millions of rands in one year in respect of defence, education, etc., then I maintain that the agricultural industry is, to the same extent, the backbone of the country and that it cannot under any circumstances be allowed to go under. The only time for rehabilitating the agricultural industry is after good rains. I want to make a special appeal to the hon. the Minister to rehabilitate the agricultural industry in these times while the opportunity offers itself. I am not only referring to pasturage and animal husbandry, but also to the agriculturists. We shall have to be prepared to spend money now in order to see whether something cannot be done to help farmers over a period of three or four years to get out of the plight in which they find themselves. For the reason I mentioned and as a result of the fatal mistake in the Budget, which I pointed out, it gives me pleasure to support the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>That is something which one uses in very small quantities.

Land prices are relative. One person may pay R20 per morgen, and whether or not he buys for cash, also plays a part.

<p>Arising from what the hon. member said in regard to pineapples, I should also like to refer to this matter. The hon. member for Albany also referred to it yesterday, and he insinuated that the hon. the Minister of Finance was not looking after the pineapple farmer. When Britain <span class="col_3779-3780" refersTo="page_0377"/>devalued, the Minister of Finance said that those farmers who could make out a case for aid having to be granted to them, would receive sympathetic consideration. Subsequently R6.84 was paid in respect of every ton of pineapples. However, the hon. members for Albany and East London (City) were under the impression that that devaluation aid would be paid to the farmer by the canner. The canner, in turn, regarded this as aid for his factory. This is the first misunderstanding which arose. The second is that the pineapple price paid to the producer had already been determined before Britain had devalued. I admit that at that stage the canners applied stricter grading. However, was that the Government&#x2019;s fault&#x003F; It was said that the producers were losing R2 per ton as a result. After everything had been finalized, the Canners&#x2019; Council asked us whether we could not come to their rescue by paying R4 per ton. Subsequent to that we approached the Minister of Finance once again, but he said that funds were running out and that he could not give R4 but only R2 per ton. Was that unreasonable&#x003F; Do hon. members not think that they ought to rise and say that they are grateful for it&#x003F; The Government is sympathetic towards pineapple farmers. Pineapple farmers also have a role to play and their industry is a labour-intensive one. However, this industry cannot be granted a disproportionately larger subsidy than those granted to the others, surely. The hon. member for East London (City) referred to 18,000 tons of pineapples which had been canned. 18,000 tons of pineapples were not canned.</p>

<p>That was 18,000 tons. Broadly speaking the pineapple production was sold at R20 per ton. The hon. member wanted to know what R2 was in comparison with R80 per ton.

His trouble is that from time to time he refers to what the South African Agricultural Union has to say, but then he only quotes those passages which he likes. Yesterday he made the mistake of saying that Mr. Chris Cilliers of the South African Agricultural Union had said that only 6 to 7 per cent of our farmers were earning more than R10,000. The hon. the Minister of Finance told all of us that only 8 per cent of our entire population paid income-tax. Is this not quite a different picture from the one the hon. member tried to sketch&#x003F;</p>

<p>Fine. The hon. member also made a fuss about the ironing out of the tax bulge. He referred to congresses, and said that at congress after congress it was being said that the initiative in the agricultural industry was also being smothered. I do not know whether the hon. member is aware of what goes on at congresses. He said that at congresses held over the last four years there were no requests for income-tax concessions. He also referred to the meeting I held at Graaff-Reinet, but does the hon. member know what the second item on the agenda of that meeting was&#x003F; It was income-tax. The hon. member should go through the items appearing on the agendas of congresses. Time after time the problem is income-tax. Last year the Minister of Finance granted income levelling to farmers as a result of representations made by agricultural unions. In spite of this the hon. member says that the farmer does not have income-tax problems because he does not make a profit. The hon. member also referred to the interest burden of farmers. I agree with the hon. member, because I speak my mind freely, that high rates of interest constitute one of the problems experienced by the agriculturist. Similarly income-tax is also the problem experienced by any other person who does not run his business on a cash basis. Why do many of our farmers have a problem in regard to interest burdens&#x003F; Because they purchased land. I do not have the figures, but I venture to say that half of them have difficulties in regard to interest burdens because they purchased additional land.</p>

<p>The Minister of Finance increased the rate of interest.</p>

<p>I know that, but why did that farmer purchase land&#x003F; Why did he pay a higher price, as you say&#x003F; Because the agricultural industry is allegedly so uneconomic&#x003F; I am sympathetic towards these people. I know that many of these people bought land when times were good and that climatic conditions subsequently deteriorated and rates of interest increased. Then they experienced difficulties. But now the hon. member <span class="col_3781-3782" refersTo="page_0378"/>says: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell us about all these Votes you are taking together and then tell us that assistance to the amount of R215 million is being granted to farmers.&#x201D; He does not want that mentioned. On a previous occasion I indicated in this House what is being done by the Government, by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, in order to keep a man going at 5 per cent interest, and the millions of rands spent towards this end. But the hon. member says that we should not add all these things together. When the hon. member refers to former times when they were in power, when there were 125,000 farmers on our farms, does he want to insinuate that we should still have 125,000 farmers in the rural areas to-day&#x003F; After all, that is all he wants.</p>

</speech>

<p>I have said before that, in view of the fact that we as a nation have our roots in the soil, I, too, should like to see our people remaining on the land, but should this be done in contravention of all the economic laws&#x003F; They still want there to be 125,000 farmers. The hon. member and also the hon. member for East London (City) no longer farm as they did 20 years ago. At that time they added acre after acre and bought out their neighbours. They cannot deny that; they did that; consequently they are implicated in this phenomenon, i.e. that our farmers have decreased in number to 100,000. If the hon. member&#x2019;s neighbour came to him to-day and said: &#x201C;My old friend, I can get five times as much for this land to-day as I paid for it before the depression; don&#x2019;t you want to buy it&#x003F; I am not going to farm any more; my children have qualified themselves in other fields and I want to spend my remaining years in the town. Do you want to buy&#x003F;&#x201D; In such a case the hon. member should, if he wants to implement his policy, tell his neighbour: &#x201C;No, my friend, my Party feels that there should be 125,000 farmers in our country; you must remain on your farm.&#x201D; Is that the point of view held by that side&#x003F; The hon. member cannot argue these things away.</p>

<p>The hon. member claimed that very little was being done by the Government. This was on the day after the maize price had been announced, and he said: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t talk about that R215 million.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister of Agriculture announced a maize price. Hon. members know that the price of yellow maize is R3.55, whereas the consumer pays R3.29 for it. That means that this price is going to cost the Government approximately R26 million in the form of a subsidy to the consumer. Who is the greatest consumer of yellow maize&#x003F; It is the farmer himself. Nobody else in this country uses as much maize as the agriculturist does. He uses it for his livestock and for his Bantu workers. But hon. members opposite say that we should not always refer to the large amount which is being spent on subsidies. The hon. member says we must tell them what we plan to do in regard to these problems, what we plan to do in regard to the agricultural industry. But so far he has not told us what his Party&#x2019;s point of view is in regard to these problems. I have asked this question before: What is the task of the Department of Agriculture, what is the task of this Government&#x003F; Is it to ensure that an ever faster-growing population gets food, or is it to ensure that 125,000 people who want to farm are kept on the land and struggle along&#x003F; Of course, the population has to be fed, and in this process sifting is taking place. Then I refer to what the hon. member for Bethal said. He spoke of managerial skill, managerial ability. No matter how sympathetic I may be towards farmers, I do not want to be a member of an industry which is being pampered and automatically kept on the land simply because we want to retain that number. We speak of managerial skill. The hon. member himself is a practical farmer, and I think he will agree that there are still many problems in our agricultural industry. A farmer came to me and said: &#x201C;This is the cost of each of my items. My light truck costs me R2.4 per morgen.&#x201D; Then I asked him: &#x201C;But how is that possible&#x003F;&#x201D; His reply was: &#x201C;It is almost time for me to buy a new light truck, but I have made calculations and as I see it my crop this year will not really justify my having a light truck and a car and a lorry.&#x201D; That man will remain in the agricultural industry up to the very end, because he makes calculations. I do not wish to say that he applies agricultural economics but he does apply farming business methods, as the shoemaker and the chemist and the butcher, as everybody has to do if he wants to succeed.</p>

<p>The hon. member quotes the S.A.A.U. from time to time, when it suits him. Hon. members know how many times the hon. member has referred here to Chris Cilliers and to De la Harpe de Villiers. Let me now quote what Mr. De la Harpe de Villiers said according to a report in a newspaper dated 7th March, 1969. The report reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Farmers who allow their land to be overgrazed and who aggravate soil erosion in this manner, should not expect State aid in times of drought, the Chairman of the S.A.A.U., Mr. De la Harpe de Villiers, said. &#x2026; An agricultural commission of inquiry found that farmers regarded those years with an above-average rainfall as normal and over-cultivated the soil in times of drought. This was conducive to erosion. &#x201C;To combat this tendency, a recommendation was made that in future State aid should only be granted to farmers who had set about matters in a judicious manner,&#x201D; he said.</block>

<p>This is what the S.A.A.U. says, but the hon. member does not want to quote this passage. He quotes those passages where it Said that <span class="col_3783-3784" refersTo="page_0379"/>farmers are struggling, and then he links them up with the Government. I maintain that once a drought sets in, nobody, not even King Solomon if he could be appointed Minister of Agriculture, would be able to offer an effective solution. The hon. member says that we have too few technicians, and this is true. He says that our country is washing away. But should all of this be linked up with the Government&#x003F; Whose duty is it to see to it that our soil does not wash away&#x003F; I have read out to you, Sir, what the S.A.A.U.&#x2019;s point of view is.</p>

<p>Let us look at this confession of faith to which the hon. member for Bethal referred yesterday. This is the only piece of paper on which I could lay my hands and which tells me how the agricultural sector was governed in the United Party&#x2019;s time. I agree wholeheartedly with many of the things mentioned in this White Paper on Agricultural Policy which was issued by the Department of the Prime Minister in 1946. But then I look at what we are being accused of by hon. members opposite, and what do I find&#x003F; Let me quote from this White Paper (translation)&#x2014;-</p>

<p>Average <i>per capita</i> income in farming increased simultaneously, possibly by over 25 per cent, since the relatively smaller proportion of the population that is on the land has been able to produce increasing quantities of food and raw materials for the expanding urban population.</p>

<p>Therefore the farmers were already decreasing in number in your time, my friend.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Speaker. Remember, it is a worldwide tendency that fewer people are producing food for more people. That is where the hon. member for East London (City) is quite correct, and I give him ten out of ten. Production costs are rising, and everybody is aware that the yield per morgen, the standard of farming, and full utilization of the potential of our soil, without applying over-cropping, constitute the reason why people in the agricultural industry are making even greater profits than R10,000 to-day, in spite of difficulties. This is also what the hon. member told us yesterday. Let me go further. This is what the United Party decided in 1946&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There will also have to be a re-alignment of land values, which are often excessive and in consequence both inflate costs and burden producers with heavy interest charges. It is the Government&#x2019;s object to see that these adjustments take place in an orderly manner. It will also seek to preserve a fair balance between the prices of farm and other products in the future. At the same time, the relationship of local to overseas prices cannot be ignored &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member will remember what he said in this House&#x2014;I do not want to go on rubbing salt into the wounds. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nor can there be any rigid adherence to a policy of maintaining parity prices or of basing prices solely on production costs in each branch.</block>

<p>The United Party admitted this as far back as 1946, and yet they now want to know what we have done in that regard. I shall read further from this pamphlet&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Failure to recognize this will result in extensive misdirection of resources from more into less productive directions. This would be as bad economics for the nation as a whole as it would be folly for any farmer to grow those crops for which his lands are the least suited.</block>

<p>Make the price of maize R4.50 or R5 per bag, then I shall plant maize in my own farming undertaking. Even if I only harvested eight bags per morgen, I would be perfectly satisfied, for then I would still be all right. I shall read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Such an essentially wasteful use of land and labour would, moreover, conflict with a sound international division of labour, on which world peace and prosperity so vitally depend. While the Government&#x2019;s policy is, therefore, to assure economic stability in farming and to maintain a fair balance between farm produce and other prices, this must be attained within the limits set by the natural controls of this country. A reasonable relation to world prices must be maintained. The attainment of these aims is, however, dependent on international action to bring about a greater measure of world price stability.</block>

<p>We referred to pineapples. If the pineapple farmers had given the pineapples to the canners free of charge this year, the canners would still have sold the pineapples at a loss, because the price of the tin, the sugar and the freight did not put us into a position to compete with a country such as Hawaii. Should we have implemented what that side asked for&#x003F; Should we have told those pineapple farmers what that side said in their confession of faith in 1946 when they said that we should take world prices into consideration&#x003F; If we had done that, the pineapple farmers would have suffered adversity.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany raised the matter of purchase tax once again, and he mentioned rat poison and other things of which one makes minimal use. I say, just give this new system a chance. After all, the hon. the Minister of Finance is an intelligent person; surely he will see to it that matters go right, and certain items can be removed from the list as soon as we have made up for the concessions which have been granted.</p>

<p><span class="col_3785-3786" refersTo="page_0380"/>The hon. members for Port Elizabeth (North), Bethal and Prieska gave me to understand yesterday that the farmers of our country were not as bad as many people make them out to be. They say the fanners of our country will be proud if they can also say: &#x201C;We have also had a share in the income-tax contribution of the whole population. We have received our subsidies but we are also privileged to be able to say, &#x2018;Render unto Ceasar the things that are Ceasar&#x2019;s&#x2019;.&#x201D; I say, Sir, that all the farmers of our country feel that way, if only we have good rains and prosperous times.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister referred to the request made by the hon. member for East London (City) as regards an increase in the duty on tobacco. I want to tell the hon. member that I do not mind his talking about tobacco, but he should not talk nonsense then.</p>

<p>I find it necessary to express a few thoughts on this matter. In the first place, I want to say that I am going to ask for an increase in taxation as well, but I am going to try and motivate my request. The hon. member asks for an increase in the duty on tobacco when he does not know how many farmers are directly and indirectly involved. Excise duty on tobacco increased tremendously during the past few years. Without excise duty having been increased the amount collected in excise duty on last year&#x2019;s tobacco production increased by R8.9 million. Several thousand farmers derive their main income from tobacco. I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance that I am greatly appreciative of the fact that he did not announce an increase in excise duty again, particularly because a large percentage of the people in the lower income groups in this country use tobacco products. It would have meant that an extra burden would have been placed on them.</p>

<p>I just want to quote various figures to illustrate what the position in the tobacco industry is. It is estimated that excise duty on tobacco will amount to R85 million this year while excise duty on pipe tobacco and cigars will come to approximately R8 million, giving a total revenue of R93.5 million from tobacco. A total amount of approximately R180 to R190 million is spent by the consumers of tobacco every year; of this amount R93 million goes to the State. The farmers therefore only receive a gross income of approximately R30 million from the tobacco industry. I just want to emphasize this particular proportion and ask the hon. member first to go into the matter and get clarity for himself before coming forward with irresponsible requests.</p>

<p>Another matter I want to raise and in connection with which I want to express my gratitude, concerns the assistance rendered to the citrus industry. The citrus industry was a large earner of foreign exchange in the past and for that reason it is extremely important that, under the present difficult circumstances, it should be given the assistance for which provision is being made now. There is one other minor matter in connection with which I want to submit a plea to the Minister. He should impose a higher duty on those cool drinks which are offered for sale under the pretext of being fruit juices. I want to emphasize that many malpractices are taking place in the cool drink industry. We have, for example, health regulations in terms of which it is laid down that manufacturers should indicate whether a cool drink is synthetic or not. I have here the cap of a cool drink bottle on which the word &#x201C;orange&#x201D; appears in large yellow print. This creates the impression that the bottle contains an orange drink. But when one examines the cap more closely, one sees that the word &#x201C;synthetic&#x201D; appears on the corrugated side. This is how the cool drink industry misleads the public and sells its products. For this reason I plead that the duty on these products be increased. As soon as the manufacturer can prove that 5 per cent of the contents of the bottle consists of pure fruit juice, he may apply for the rebate. But that is not all. Beneath the word &#x201C;orange&#x201D; which appears in such bold print on the cap, there is the mark of the Bureau of Standards. This is even more misleading. Probably this has something to do with the quality of the cap. I feel it is of the utmost importance to the citrus industry that this matter be investigated.</p>

<p>If a member of the public buys a fruit drink to-day and the stamp of the Co-operative Citrus Exchange does not appear on the bottle, he does not know what he is buying. Many of these cool drinks merely contain synthetic additives. I have here various illustrations of things that are being done. Everything is aimed at creating the impression among the public that the cool drinks contain fruit juices. Well, many of them do not contain any fruit juice at all. Last year the citrus industry produced 43 million 30 lb. units, 7.5 million of which were used in fresh form while 10.1 million went to the factories. However, those factories have to export 80 per cent of their production because they do not have a local market. The Citrus Exchange did, in fact, launch a publicity campaign and succeed in increasing the consumption of fresh orange juice from 16,000 gallons per month to approximately 100,000 gallons as from September, 1968. But now we have this unfair competition on the part of the cool drink industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a shortage of water in this country. How can we allow coloured or flavoured water to be sold to our school children at 8, 9 or 10 cents per bottle&#x003F; That something like this can, in fact, happen is beyond me. This matter should be given serious attention. For example, I want to ask that a general prohibition should be placed on synthetic orange juice for breakfast purposes, because it is not orange juice at all. The delivery of synthetic orange juice by dairies should be totally prohibited, because the public are <span class="col_3787-3788" refersTo="page_0381"/>under the impression that they drink orange juice, while this is not the case. Moreover, I ask that all advertisements of cool drinks should indicate what percentage of juice of the fruit depicted in the advertisement such drinks contain. This is not being done at present. What happens now&#x003F; Apple juice is cheaper than orange juice because, strangely enough, one gets more juice from an apple, per weight, than one gets from an orange. The manufacturers now take apple juice and use it as an additive in order to get a reduction in excise duty. The cool drink is then flavoured with orange flavour and advertised as orange juice. This evil practice should also be stopped. Each case should be treated on its merits and the public should know what it buys and drinks. The words &#x201C;nagemaak&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;synthetic&#x201D; should also appear in advertisements because this is where people are mislead. While large and attractive oranges, lemons and other kinds of fruit are advertised in the advertisements, the word &#x201C;synthetic&#x201D; merely appear on the corrugated side of the bottle cap. Excise duty on cool drinks and flavoured drinks should be increased from 8 cents to 16 cents per gallon. The rebate may be granted as soon as it is proved that 5 per cent of the contents of a bottle consists of pure fruit juice. In this way we can at least ensure that we protect our citrus industry.</p>

<p>At the same time we will be looking after the health of our people, particularly our children. An interdepartmental committee of inquiry is at present going into the question of the use of fruit juices in this country. I am glad about that. However, I hope the Minister will see to it that this committee will bring out a report as soon as possible so that there is no delay as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the position prevailing in agriculture generally. I find it necessary to do so because a great deal is being said about this matter. I want to confine my remarks to agricultural financing in particular. In this connection I want to express my appreciation of the fact that increased amounts are made available to agriculture every year, as has again been done this year. However, I have to point out that only a small percentage of agricultural financing&#x2014;I think it amounts to approximately 25 per cent&#x2014;is being undertaken by the Land Bank and the Department of Agricultural Credit. This is a pity, because the remaining 75 per cent really constitutes a burden. This is how it was described before and I endorse it. It is no use closing our eyes to reality. A large percentage of our farmers do pay a high rate of interest, mainly as a result of circumstances beyond their control. Many complaints are being voiced in Organized Agriculture. The various Departments of Agriculture, the Department of Agricultural Credit, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the Department of Agricultural Economics are fulfilling a major task. As regards the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, I just want to mention that this Department discovered this dreaded borer eel-worm disease in the Lowveld a few months ago. I have had representations concerning this disease from farmers in my constituency. These farmers are worried, because this disease may have serious consequences. I therefore want to thank the Department for having acted so speedily in this matter. They succeeded in determining the presence of this eel-worm in three areas. But even more drastic action is required, because the farmers there are very worried. The eel-worm which was discovered in bananas and which was apparently smuggled into the country by irresponsible people, attacks virtually any plant and even threatens the large blue gum plantations in the Eastern Lowveld. It is therefore a matter which should be viewed in a serious light. To come back to these articles in Organized Agriculture. One of the articles is dated March, 1969, and it deals with the effects of the drought on our agriculture, but I want to emphasize another matter in this connection and I just want to quote from the February article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since World War II a major change has been taking place in world agriculture and particularly in the agricultural industries of the more advanced and more affluent nations.</block>

<p>As regards the position in South Africa, I want to say that, as a result of our development, we are facing problems for the farmer in this regard as well. The article reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The cause of all this latest upset of our farming industry is progress&#x2014;economic progress. Over the past 20 years scientists and engineers have been hard at work finding ways and means of making two cobs of maize grow where one grew before.</block>

<p>I think we should try and maintain this debate on this level and endeavour to appreciate the real problems of the farmer soberly and objectively. I want to go further. The article goes on to read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maybe the year 1989 will see the number of South African farmers reduced to less than 50,000, with this number producing three times as much as is now produced. It means that some 40,000 farmers and their families will be obliged to trek for the towns within the next two decades. If we are inclined to doubt this, we would do well to remember that it has already happened in the U.S.A., where the farming community has virtually been halved in the last 25 years.</block>

<p>It is highly necessary that we should not tell everyone to go farming. It is better to have 50,000 or 60,000 farmers with a high standard of living and high productivity than to have 90,000 or 100,000 farmers. This process should be as painless as possible and I feel that the State is doing a great deal to make this process <span class="col_3789-3790" refersTo="page_0382"/>really painless; and, as has been said by the hon. member for Bethal as well, we are possibly doing too much to keep people on the land, people who are not equipped to be there. The article reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The consequences of too many farmers struggling to remain on the land after they have become redundant can be serious for South Africa. To stress the importance and urgency of stopping any further erosion and deterioration of our country&#x2019;s soil, is to emphasize what is now self-evident. What has to be understood is that a farmer lacking both sufficient land and adequate capital to farm economically under conditions now prevailing cannot conserve his soil as it should and must be conserved.</block>

<p>I feel that we should tackle these matters on this basis and approach them in a sober manner.</p>

<p>I do not want to reply to the speech made by the hon. member for Nelspruit except to say that I think he had a case when he discussed the question of cool drinks. This is a matter which should most probably receive attention.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to our Deputy Minister of Agriculture and the speech he made a few minutes ago. We all have great respect for the new Deputy Minister. He is a successful and progressive farmer and anyone who is a successful farmer under the policy of the Nationalist Party to-day, has to be a very good person. That is why we respect him. We think that when he takes over from the big boss things will be much better, but we want to warn him. He should not allow himself to be bound too much to the agricultural policy of this Government. He should rather allow himself some elbow room. If he does that he will most probably become quite a good Minister of Agriculture. It is a very difficult task to defend the agricultural policy of the Government, and the Deputy Minister did quite well when speaking in defence of that policy, but when he got up, he said he was going to tell the farmers that we on this side were in favour of a duty on wine and tobacco. But this is not what my hon. friend here behind me really said. He said he was in favour of a duty on liquor and luxury articles, and this the hon. the Minister may safely go and tell the farmers. I know the hon. the Minister is a just person, but he should also tell the farmers that during this Budget debate, this side of the House tried our utmost to have the duty reduced not only on petrol, oil and tyres but also on the daily necessities on which we will have to pay a higher duty in future. He should not forget to tell them that as well.</p>

<p>From the discussions held during the last few days it became quite evident that this Budget will have one important effect on South Africa, namely that the cost of living will rise tremendously. Sir, both of us are Free Staters. We grew up and we grew old and we suffered hardships among the Nationalists, as it were; when speaking of the old Nationalists I have in mind men such as General Hertzog, Dr. Nico van der Merwe, Mr. Swart, Mr. Serfontein and you yourself, Sir, men who created the image that the Nationalist Party was a party which had the interests of the poor and the less privileged at heart. This the Party in fact did.</p>

<p>The Party let the poor man down, but who could have thought that the descendants of that party would introduce a Budget which would be so hard on those who brought them to this House&#x003F; What surprised us even more, is that the hon. the Minister of Finance, who has done such a great deal to uplift the poorer sections of our population, should submit these tax proposals to this House. This goes beyond us.</p>

<p>This Budget is a very good one for the rich and the wealthy because they save such a great deal on income tax and they will not find it difficult to pay the higher prices of these other articles they must have, articles such as motor cars, fur coats and so forth. They will not find it difficult to pay those prices because they save quite enough, but how much does the poor man save&#x003F; He did not pay tax in the past. He does not save at all and he is the one who will have to make up the leeway now.</p>

<p>I have been waiting for the past few days for one of the hon. members opposite to get up and say: Let us not proceed so hastily; we should not have this tax. But hon. members are silent now; all of them accept it. The hon. member for Marico is not here now, but he became quite lyrical about what the people achieved in life, but he said nothing about taxation. Neither did he tell us that his constituency, Marico, would be paying a great deal more tax than ever before. He said nothing about that and all the hon. members likewise kept quiet about it. They do not tell us that people who have never paid any tax before will have to do so in future. They keep quiet. I also want to refer to the speech the hon. member for Moorreesburg made yesterday. He is one of the leading members of that party.</p>

<p>He advanced quite a good plea as regards development of his own constituency, but he did not tell the Minister not to proceed so hastily as far as taxation on the poor people was concerned.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) now. He was quite amusing yesterday. The hon. member spoke about brain operations and about voters who were being neglected in Newton Park and <span class="col_3791-3792" refersTo="page_0383"/>Walmer. He tried to show how hon. members representing those constituencies were neglecting their voters. I wonder whether he intends standing there at the next election&#x003F; It will be quite interesting, but I just want to warn my colleagues here that he has his own methods of getting a nomination and that they should be careful. He spoke about a personal quarrel he had with his colleagues in Port Elizabeth, but he did not say a word as to whether the Minister would mind reducing the tax on the daily necessities which his voters needed. By whom were those poor people he spoke about neglected&#x003F; He criticized these two hon. members for failing to render assistance as regards housing, but these two hon. members are fortunate. There is no housing shortage in their constituencies as there is in his. He should do his duty, but he should do duty here as well and he should plead that taxes for the needy people should be relaxed. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>This is a rich man&#x2019;s budget and it is because this Government has been sitting too long beside the flesh-pots. The Cabinet, the members of Parliament and their friends became rich during these 21 years and you know, Sir, what happens when one gets rich suddenly. One is far too inclined to forget ones needy friends, and this is precisely what has happened here. They have quite forgotten the people who helped them to come to this House and therefore we have these taxes the needy people have to pay. Apparently the rich people have a great deal of influence to-day and they persuaded the Minister to relieve them of the heavy tax burden, but somebody has to pay it and who pays it&#x003F; The poor man pays it. The fact, of course, is that we sympathize with the needy and the less privileged who will have to pay all these severe taxes. All of us have got up to plead with the Minister to revise his lists and to see whether relief cannot be granted in connection with articles which are essential and which cannot be described as luxury articles under any circumstances. But I hope that those who brought them here, will now realize that they have been bluffed long enough by a Government which professes to look after their interests. I think the verkramptes are right in that respect. They say the Nationalist Party not only abandoned their ideals of 1948, but they have also abandoned their people now. The lower income groups of the population in South Africa brought and kept this Government in power, but now the Government is turning its back on them, and we are waiting for them to protest, but they are sitting there without saying a word. [Interjections.] But as I said, if one suddenly gets rich, one is inclined to forget ones needy friends. I think this treatment is characteristic of them. The farmers who are now in the minority, are being neglected. We found first of all that the small farmers were being neglected, but now it applies to all the farmers. We had the hon. member for Namaqualand, who, unfortunately, is not here now. He told us of the fine planning which was taking place in the field of agriculture. Sir, when we listen to the complaints we hear at congresses, when we listen to the discussions taking place here and when we see how farmers&#x2019; debts increase year after year, I say that if there is any planning at all, there is something radically wrong with that planning.</p>

<p>I said the less privileged Whites of our country were the people who had to foot the bill. But they are not the only ones. There are also the Bantu and the Coloureds who will have to pay this tax. There are many of them who will not be able to afford this purchase tax. People living below the bread line will now have to pay more for most of the articles they buy. This reminds one of what the hon. member for Heilbron said the other day and the way in which he treats the Bantu. It seems to me the Government is not concerned about the interests of these people at all; they do not care what happens to them; they simply have to pay.</p>

<p>I just want to say a few words in connection with one matter about which we are all very glad. We noticed recently that the Minister of Foreign Affairs visited and had discussions with the Governments of other countries such as the Argentine and Brazil in the southern hemisphere and that we are on quite good terms with those countries. Of course, all of us agree with this wholeheartedly. We on this side just want to emphasize that we would like to see this idea of good neighbourliness, especially with other countries in the southern hemisphere, extended.</p>

<p>In case there is any trouble which, of course, we hope will not be the case, we have to realize that we in South Africa will have a major and important task which we shall find difficult to fulfil on our own. One always tries to find friends and people who are well disposed towards one, friends who will be prepared to come to your assistance should trouble arise. We are planning to enlarge our fleet considerably, and it can only be in our own interest and in that of the Western world if we could be on good terms with people in not only America and South Africa but also other countries in the southern hemisphere, countries such as Australia and New Zealand. <span class="col_3793-3794" refersTo="page_0384"/>We were happy to read about the successful visit of our fleet to Australia. It is a pity it did not visit New Zealand as well. We hope the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs will succeed in entering into friendly and helpful discussions with those people as well.</p>

<p>There is one other country which, to my mind, is particularly important and which the Government should really do its utmost to win over to our side, namely Malagasy. Malagasy occupies a very strategical position in the southern hemisphere. It is a big and prosperous country with an excellent naval base and it will definitely be in the interest of all of us if we could be on equally good terms with them as we are with, for example, Portugal and the South American countries.</p>

<p>It is actually very difficult to reply to the previous speaker, because he said nothing.

Neither did he come forward with any concrete suggestions. Time and again he referred to the difficulties of the poor man and to the fact that not one member on this side had stood up and proposed that the pressure of taxation be relieved. But, Sir, ever one on this side of the House stood up and thanked the Minister for this fine Budget which is being praised throughout the country. This Budget is not only a strong and effective one for the business man or the salaried man, but also a good Budget for the agriculturist, for the farmer. The farmers are highly delighted with this Budget.</p>

<p>I shall tell the hon. member now where I saw it. According to a report of 27th March, Mr. F. P. R. van Wyk, chairman of the taxation committee of the South African Agricultural Union, stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Budget is in accordance with the South African Agricultural Union&#x2019;s evidence before the commission of inquiry into monetary and fiscal policy.</block>

<p>This comes from the S.A. Agricultural Union itself. In addition, Mr. K. P. Landman, secretary of the Agricultural Union, stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many farmers will benefit from the fact that the bulge above the R5,000 notch has been ironed out.</block>

<p>That is my reply to the question of hon. members of the Opposition as to where we have seen that the farmer is also satisfied with this Budget. But, Sir, what is the picture in respect of the agricultural industry as regards this Budget; how does this Budget affect the agricultural industry&#x003F; Would we have had this tremendous progress in the field of industry in South Africa and this strong, sound financial position in which we find ourselves to-day, had our agriculture, as our basic industry, not assisted and provided for this progress in South Africa&#x003F; That is why the Government delves deeply into its pockets every year to bring assistance and relief to the farmer and to grant benefits judiciously where they are needed most. Let us briefly review the Budget as far as the farmer is concerned. On the Revenue Account R115,323,000 has been provided for the Departments of Agriculture, and on the Loan Account R40 million. For the Departments of Water Affairs and Forestry R15,636,000 has been provided on the Revenue Account, and R74,250.000 on the Loan Account. What is the position in respect of Water Affairs and Forestry&#x003F; Admittedly, Water Affairs is not only concerned with agriculture; these amounts are also for industry, for the urbanite and for the country as a whole, but a large portion of the amount is directly for the benefit of agriculture. But apart from this strong Budget and the amounts being provided for agriculture, special concessions have also been made, as has repeatedly been stated here. We think of the citrus industry, the pineapple industry and the wool industry, which have received special benefits. The hon. member for Newton Park said that it was not much use that these colossal amounts were spent on agriculture each year. He said that other benefits should be granted.</p>

<p>He is ungrateful.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#herman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>One of my hon. friends on this side rightly savs that the hon. member for Newton Park is ungrateful. Sir. this is the only conclusion we can come to. Surely these amounts must be provided on the Estimates, and if one considers how these amounts are increasing each year, one cannot but think that this Government is sympathetically disposed towards the farmer and that the farmer&#x2019;s interests are very dear to its heart. Sir, we also ask ourselves: What are the chief sources of financing for the agriculturist in this country&#x003F; In the first place we think of the Land Bank. The mortgage loans granted by the Land Bank in 1968 increased by 46 per cent from R31 million in 1967 to R45 million, according to the latest report of the Land Bank. These are colossal amounts. Of this amount alone 53 per cent was for the purchase of land. This means an increase of R6 million; 26.3 per cent was for the redemption of mortgages i.e. an amount of R12 million: 16 2 per cent for the consolidation of debts, representing an amount of R7&#x00BD; million. An amount of R2.608,000 was also granted by the Land Bank for the payment of commercial bank debts, as well as an amount of R1,310,000 for the purchase of livestock and equipment. Sir, while I frequently have dealings with the Land <span class="col_3795-3796" refersTo="page_0385"/>Bank in my constituency, I cannot do otherwise to-day but speak with the highest praise of the Land Bank and its officials. Whenever I went there they listened very sympathetically. I do not know whether I was one of the fortunate ones, but in the majority of cases I received assistance in the interest of the farmers on whose behalf the representations were made. The staff of the Land Bank really deserves a feather in its cap for the tremendous work it is doing.</p>

<p>Secondly, as far as agricultural financing is concerned, one thinks of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. An amount of R39,700,000 is being provided on the Estimates this year for the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. This is R5,150,000 more than last year, and of this, R3 million alone is for assistance to farmers and R2,277,000 for the purchase of land. This department also deserves a feather in its cap. It is probably the department which has to suffer the most criticism to-day from all sides to the effect that it does not make sufficient money available to farmers. But this Department must also be congratulated on this tremendous work which it is doing under difficult circumstances. From time to time amounts have also been made available by the Land Bank to the co-operative societies for means of production and short-term loans to the farmers. Water Affairs, as I have already mentioned, received a colossal amount this year. One thinks of the more than R5 million specially voted this year for drilling services. But numerous other forms of assistance have also been given to the farmers by the State this year. One thinks of the subsidy of R15 million for the fertilizer industry, the subsidy for the maize industry and all the other subsidies and rebates which have been granted. But now we must do a little practical and levelheaded thinking about the agricultural industry and about agricultural land. We have <i>bona fide</i> farmers, but we also have other people who call themselves farmers and purchase land for the sake of investment or speculation. In the granting of assistance to farmers it is this first group, the <i>bona fide</i> farmers, who should actually receive this assistance and not the other group, and it is for the assistance of this group that the State is chiefly and exclusively making provision. To illustrate further how the interests of the farmer have been promoted by this Government in the past few years. I just want to point out that we must bear in mind that our country is subject to variable climatic factors. From time to time we have severe droughts, and hon. members of the Opposition now want to know what assistance the Government is granting to farmers in these times of drought.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary for us to place on record what the Government has done in the past 21 years to acquaint itself with the facts and to grant assistance to the farmers where necessary. In 1948 the Minister of Agriculture had an exhaustive inquiry instituted into the possibility of establishing a state-aided fodder bank. The reports were published in 1949 and assistance ensued. In 1960 surveys were also conducted by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing into the drought conditions in the North Western Cape. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing also had investigations instituted into the establishment of fodder banks for the Namaqualand farmers. In 1963 Dr. Fabricius, of the Department of Agriculture Technical Services, made a study of the drought in the North Western Transvaal. The Verbeek Committee, a very important committee, instituted a very exhaustive investigation into droughts and everything connected with them. A comprehensive report was issued by the Committee and many of their recommendations were adopted by the Government. In December. 1965, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services had a rapid investigation made into the disastrous drought areas of the Northern and North Western Transvaal and a similarly rapid investigation and survey was made by the same department in February, 1966. when the Northern Cape portion of the Orange Free State was investigated. Apart from the investigations carried out by these committees various investigations were carried out by officials and extension officers and these investigations are still continuing unabated. All this led to the appointment of a commission of inquiry into agriculture on 7th May, 1966, under the chairmanship of Dr. M. D. Marais. They are still engaged in their investigation and their first report was issued as long ago as March, 1968. Not only are there agriculturists and economists serving on this commission of inquiry, but also practical full-time farmers who are assisting the Government by word and deed.</p>

<p>Since the House began with its proceedings this year, mention has been made on different occasions of the high interest rate which farmers have to pay. It is all very well to plead for a low interest rate, and actually it would have been better to plead for absolutely no interest rate whatsoever. However, the question remains whether this is practicable. We must ask ourselves whether this would not perhaps disturb the balance of our economy and monetary affairs in this country and disrupt the country&#x2019;s sound financial policy. There are many other subsidies and rebates already in operation. We have heard of the R15 million subsidy for the fertilizer industry and of other subsidies as well. Does the Opposition now want these subsidies and rebates to be withdrawn or reduced&#x003F; Since we now have these subsidies and, over and against that, also an interest rate which is, in fact, very low, we at present must bear in mind that this interest and these subsidies are allocated on a proportionate basis to everyone needing them. If the interest should perhaps be withdrawn altogether, other problems would be caused, for example, speculation, and people trying to <span class="col_3797-3798" refersTo="page_0386"/>speculate with the State&#x2019;s money. This is something which we should definitely and at all costs avoid. Although we feel that the agricultural industry should be the first in line when State aid is given, this should always take place in a reasonable and just manner, and all should be treated equally. The Government has already done a great deal to assist the agricultural industry and more and more will be done in future. While the Opposition&#x2019;s amendment reads that the Government has failed to grapple with South Africa&#x2019;s urgent problems such as the plight of the agricultural industry, I must say that in this entire debate no single point has been proved by any speaker on the Opposition side to the effect that the agricultural industry in any part of the country is in the plight in which they have maintained it to be, and to the effect that the Government has neglected to do its duty in that regard.</p>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while I agree 100 per cent with everything said by the hon. member for Potgietersrus, who has just resumed his seat, there are nevertheless one or two points from the speech of the hon. member for North Rand which cannot be left unanswered and which I should like to take further.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand returned to the question of this Budget being a rich man&#x2019;s budget and he tried to indicate how the poor and the less well-to-do section of the population would be affected by this Budget. This is beautifully in line with the metamorphosis on the part of the Opposition and its Press since the week-end. It is all done with the express purpose of confusing the consumer. In the term consumer I include the workers, farmers and officials in Government and semi-Government service, in short, all who have to buy in order to eat and be clothed. I also include the Bantu and other population groups. In this connection it is necessary to point out that some of the newspapers also made use of this opportunity to incite the non-Whites in a scandalous way. I want, then, to ask the United Party whether it approves of these actions of its propaganda mouthpieces. I should like to quote from the leading article of the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 6th April, 1969, in which it is stated that:</p>

<block name="quote">The tax will therefore press heavily on the lower income Whites &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are the people referred to by the hon. member for North Rand. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and certainly on the vast mass of non-Whites.</block>

<p>In an article in the same newspaper Mr. Stanley Uys writes as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Particular concern is being felt over the plight of th&#x00E9; country&#x2019;s 14 million non-Whites who will be hit by the sales tax in spite of its &#x201C;selective&#x201D; nature. Africans particularly will be vulnerable because they are not protected by statutory recognized trade unions or generally by minimum wage agreements.</block>

<p>It is also striking that the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 3rd April, 1969, sang the same tune. It stated the following:</p>

<block name="quote">The main result of the new tax system will be to shift part of the burden off this group onto the rest&#x2014;the other 94 per cent of taxpayers, plus the mass of the population which up till now has paid no income tax at all.</block>

<p>Elsewhere it was stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is very little that those with weak bargaining power&#x2014;especially the African workers whose trade unions are not recognized and who are forbidden to strike&#x2014;can do about this.</block>

<p>This is malicious criticism and purposely glosses over all the fine and attractive aspects in a Budget in which the hon. the Minister himself has made it clear that when it becomes apparent from time to time that there are shortcomings, he will put matters right. This assurance of the hon. the Minister, who has always declared himself a friend of the less well-to-do, in contrast to what the hon. member for North Rand said, is quite good enough for me. In the latest swing of United Party criticism it is once more clear to me that what is said by the United Party in this House is prescribed to them by their leftist mouthpieces, and hon. members opposite, such as the hon. member for North Rand as well, simply fall into step with this willingly and make a lot of noise in the hope that they will hit the mark. However, the question is whether the United Party is prepared to go back to the old system as it existed last year. I do not believe they are. Not a single speaker in this debate, and I was present during the whole of it, has yet said so. As usual the United Party&#x2019;s reply is once more the well-known yes-and-no reply. Only yesterday the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself said yes and no.</p>

<p>Since the emphasis in the collection of taxes for State revenue will in future fall on collection by means of this indirect taxation, one point is of overriding interest to-day. It concerns all buyers of consumer goods, as various hon. members on this side of the House have put it, whether the persons involved be farmers, factory workers, mine workers, Government officials, members of the House of Assembly or whatever, of any colour or race group. It is the protection of this consumer, especially the younger group who do not yet receive large salaries or incomes and whom we should like to see starting homes in the interests of this country, and the aged and the ordinary farmer and salaried worker, who <span class="col_3799-3800" refersTo="page_0387"/>must be seen to. The Budget speech had hardly been delivered when newspaper headlines again blazed forth: &#x201C;Public grossly deceived by purchase tax&#x201D; and &#x201C;Minister of Economic Affairs threatens strong action&#x201D;. This is a damning accusation against that section of commerce which receives direct and indirect State encouragement and protection in such ample measure and then abuses it. Recently two well-considered leading articles on these matters appeared in two or our publications. These indicated how the tide in our country was turning in favour of the consumer organization. Firstly I want to quote from the leading article in the March, 1969, issue of the <i>S.A. Worker</i>&#x2014;these are the people referred to by the hon. member for North Rand. This periodical has 30,000 readers and is the mouthpiece of the South African Iron, Steel and Allied Industries Union and the Provincial Co-Workers Association. The leading article draws a parallel on the one hand between organized agriculture, where the farmer offers his product and bargains on a collective basis through his cooperative sector, and organized labour on the other hand, where the worker offers his product and labour on a collective basis and negotiates the best price therefor. While in organized agriculture the bargaining power is also exercised through its co-operative sector in respect of its collective purchase of means of production&#x2014;these are now the &#x201C;things&#x201D; about which the hon. member for East London (City) spoke&#x2014;with a view to reducing production costs organized labour negotiates for the sale of its labour and not for the purchase of provisions. Under the title &#x201C;In Search of a Patron&#x201D; this periodical had the following to say about the labourers of our country (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While powerful foreign organizations serve as a stimulus to the consumer movement, it would appear as if its struggling South African counterpart needed a patron, similar to what the South African Agricultural Union is to the agricultural cooperatives. In view of the fact that consumer interests occupy such an important place in the activities of our trade unions&#x2014;the price and quality of consumer goods have a direct effect upon the cost of living &#x2014;and in view of the related aims of the co-operatives, consumer guidance and publicity can be presented to our trade union members as a profitable new field of endeavour.</block>

<p>In addition it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The consumer needs to be protected against shrewd sales gimmicks such as were recently exposed by Walter H. Nelson&#x2014;&#x201C;large price reductions&#x201D;, &#x201C;fantastic bargains&#x201D; and &#x201C;unprecedented reductions&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This includes the cool drinks which the hon. member for Nelspruit also spoke about. The article goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The consumer needs to be educated to protect him or her against malpractices and to help him or her to be selective and careful, whether in the choice of textiles, a motor car or a plot of land.</block>

<p>As is generally known, the motor trade is a very great culprit in this connection. I can mention numerous examples of the exploitation of the little man by the motor trade and I have not heard hon. members opposite objecting to this. At this stage it would therefore appear that if the trade unions were to begin thinking along these lines, if the Public Servants&#x2019; Association, which we know to be a particularly responsible organization, the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, which has already done so much for the mineworkers, the Post Office Staff Associations, the Railway Staff Associations, the teachers&#x2019; union, municipal staff associations and similar organizations, in cooperation with the Co-operative Chamber of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut and the Cooperative Council of the South African Agricultural Union, were to have a round-table conference and deliberate upon this matter, they would be able to draw up a blueprint for the creation of a National Consumer Council. This council would be able fully to protect the consumers&#x2019; interests against exploitation, because this is necessary. I am speaking of all consumers now, White as well as non-White, because I know that the latter group are also frequently exploited by certain trade bodies in a sinful manner. There are numerous scandalous examples which could be mentioned here, and these are damaging to race relations. With a National Consumer Council functioning effectively in respect of negotiations with manufacturers and distributors&#x2014;and this applies to the farming community as well&#x2014;the dissemination of sales information, the scientific study of the refined art of buying and selling, and the making available of such information, and also negotiating with the Government in respect of consumer matters, it may be expected that the consumer who sets about things judiciously and keeps to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s recipe of &#x201C;working and saving&#x201D; instead of recklessly spending and speculating like blazes, will cause the benefit of this new form of sales tax to flow through to every sector. The honest and industrious businessman will also benefit from this greater purchasing stability. However, the initiative must in the first place come from the consumer himself, through the above-mentioned organized channels. I believe that the Government departments concerned, such as Economic Affairs, Industries, Agricultural Economics and Marketing, etc., would gladly supply them with advice. I believe that this Budget paves the way for the consumer who sincerely wishes to put his affairs in order. The initiative displayed by the trade unions in this respect can therefore only be commended most highly. It is positively orientated.</p>

<p>Last Saturday an excellent leading article on this matter appeared in <i>Die Burger.</i> The <span class="col_3801-3802" refersTo="page_0388"/>article rightly drew attention to the new curse suddenly coming to the fore, the curse of the so-called credit cards which are now being issued and the use of which is being deliberately encouraged by certain banks. This credit card system is a country-wide continuation of Pretoria&#x2019;s generally known &#x201C;little book system&#x201D;. In spite of smaller benefits, this system, more than most other things, helps to plunge the public into debt and to keep them in debt permanently by stimulating people to live in advance of payment and to purchase items which they do not really need with money not yet in their pockets. This article rightly points out the techniques used in the onslaughts made upon the purchaser&#x2019;s resistance. It tells us to what heights the art of selling has been developed and how the art of buying has remained at a primitive stage of development. The conclusion of this article deserves to be quoted in full and I conclude my speech by doing so (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But activities such as those of the consumer associations &#x2026; this refers to foreign countries&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; are only a small beginning. The buyers have a long leeway to make up if they are really to compete with the sellers on the same level of sophistication. Perhaps it is time that children at school learnt not only how to figure in terms of money, but also how to handle money properly and how to make the best use of it. Perhaps a little more attention at school to the art of buying would be of greater value than many of the facts which go in at one ear and, after the examination, out at the other.</block>

<p>I say this is a good Budget in so far as the hon. the Minister of Finance has followed the advice of this side of the House, and the hon. member for Colesberg ought to have known that. This is a good Budget as regards the elimination of the tax bulge, and I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on having had the courage to eliminate it in this way. This is also a good Budget as regards the provision being made by the hon. the Minister for assistance to civil servants in the field of housing. This is also a good Budget in that the hon. the Minister is making income-tax concessions to working women. In addition this is a good Budget to the extent to which the hon. the Minister is introducing improvements in the field of social services. However, the hon. the Minister, I myself and all of us know that the main object of this sales duty is to curb inflation in South Africa. He himself said that. The second object is to obtain additional revenue. Surely ho knows that since this is a give and take Budget, he has already made up his mind to make more than he intends giving. This being so, why argue about it&#x003F; [Interjections.] Of course he is going to take more.</p>

<p>The hon. member holds a doctorate in economics and he does not even know this&#x003F; Where did he get his doctorate&#x003F; For what did he get his doctorate&#x003F; The hon. member knows as well as I do that the hon. the Minister is going to receive much more money than he is going to give away. If he does not know this, he should never again speak on economic affairs in a Budget debate. Does the hon. member want to deny that this is so&#x003F; He knows as well as I do, or ought to know, that the revenue which the hon. the Minister is going to derive from this sales duty will not be R100 million, but more like R200 million, if not more. We shall talk again next year, and then we shall have further discussions with this new type of doctor of economics. Now I am not referring to the hon. the Minister, because he holds a real doctorate in economics. Then we shall see the credentials of that hon. member. Even if that hon. member was just an ordinary sensible man and did not hold a doctorate in economics, he would have known that if the hon. the Minister was going to take R200 million from the ordinary people in the country. White, Black and Brown, commerce itself would see to it that a further one-third of that amount would end up in its own pocket. He knows that. [Interjections.] I am not accusing anybody. I am accusing the system. Our ordinary capitalistic system employs these means. If, by the time a product reaches one, it carries a duty, one simply has to pass that duty on to the next man. That is the truth. Whatever hon. members opposite may say, this is the effect which this duty is going to have. The buyers of South Africa will have to get an additional R300 million, or an amount very close to that, from somewhere in order to pay this duty. The hon. the Minister will in fact succeed by means of this sales duty to curb inflation temporarily&#x2014;and only temporarily&#x2014;but it will most definitely not be a permanent solution. I now want to make the prediction&#x2014;and it does not call for a clever man to make this prediction&#x2014;that because of this duty the hon. the Minister will be obliged to grant salary increases to civil servants next year because of the rise in the cost of living which this duty will bring along. Some people may say that the hon. the Minister will do so on the eve of an election, but I do not say this. I do say, <span class="col_3803-3804" refersTo="page_0389"/>however, that he will have to grant increases because of a wrong Budget which he presented here. We shall then hear the answer from the other hon. members who say they hold doctorates in economics. We shall hear their views if the hon. the Minister grants salary increases which will have a snowballing effect.</p>

Whatever may happen, this Government will be obliged to increase the salaries of officials within the next year. The Government can afford to do so, because it taxes other people to pay for the increases. Let me put the following question to the hon. the Minister. Is he of the opinion that the farmer, the ordinary employer, will be able to resist an increase in wages within the next year when the effect of this new duty will be felt by employees in the rural areas and throughout South Africa&#x003F; Not only will the salaries of civil servants have to be increased, but the private sector will also have to come with increases.</p>

<p>I am absolutely convinced that this duty will give rise to demands for higher wages. This is happening in a country which is a happy one, a country which has had many achievements.

<p>The Nationalist did not work for that. But what has this Government done&#x003F; Domestic consumption increased by only 80 per cent. In this respect the Government must render assistance. Domestic consumption increased by 80 per cent whereas production increased by 160 per cent. The farmers have done their share, but what has the Government done in order to increase consumption&#x003F; I say the farmers have done their duty. South Africa has other blessings as well. We in South Africa are the fourth largest exporters of minerals in the whole world. Providence endowed us well in this respect. But we nevertheless find that countries such as Germany and Japan, which have no raw materials, are overtaking us. Japan has no raw materials, it has to import everything. As a result of hard work, knowledge and dedication, Germany and Japan have overtaken virtually the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The old Romans said that while they were still working hard, they were the most prosperous nation in the world, and people said their decline started when they passed laws to lay down their working hours. They were the most prosperous nation in the world, but their decline started when they became ease-loving and worked only two days per week.</p>

<p>I now want to ask the Government this. Has the time not arrived to combat inflation by encouraging people to produce more in South Africa&#x003F; Should such an attempt not be made&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am not speaking of the Budget only. Our civil servants only work a five-day week. Figures have been quoted here to illustrate the increase in the number of civil servants. When countries such as Germany and Japan have to import everything and have reached their present heights by sheer hard work, there is a lesson to be learnt from that by us if we do not want to lose the race against the East. It is all very well for a country to be independent, but it should not only be politically independent. There should also be economic independence. Economic efficiency is perhaps more important than political independence. Have hon. members ever given any thought to the fact that these two countries, i.e. Germany and Japan, are not independent countries politically and that 20 years ago they were humbled to the ground&#x003F; Then there are countries such as Ghana, Zambia and Nigeria, all independent states, ones which boast of their independence, whereas they are in fact as dependent as any country can be. We know that we shall have to contend more and more with competition from the East. One wonders whether the time has not arrived for us to give consideration to the question whether we should export raw materials or whether we should process those materials locally. I had hoped that the Minister would have made more concessions, in view of the large sums of money he is now going to receive as well as the money which is already available, with regard to the technological training of our people, with regard to research and with regard to educating our nation to work harder. [Interjections.]</p>

<p><span class="col_3805-3806" refersTo="page_0390"/>Mr. Speaker, obviously hon. members want me to make petty politics of this matter. I can do so if that is what they want. Hon. members opposite are very quick to compare 1948 to to-day. But let us compare 1948 to today and let us begin at the top rung of the ladder&#x2014;with the present Prime Minister, who is a good Prime Minister and a man for whom I have a great deal of respect. But in 1948 we had an equally good, even better, Prime Minister, in the person of Jan Smuts. What was the position at that time&#x003F; He was Prime Minister and at the same time Minister of Defence, and no hon. member can make the statement to-day that the present Minister of Defence can be compared to Jan Smuts. He occupied those two posts and received the salary of one man. But more than that, he was also Minister of Foreign Affairs. I have a great deal of respect for our present Minister of Foreign Affairs, of course, but even he himself would not want to be so presumptious as to compare himself to the status of Jan Smuts as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Here we have it then. One man did the work of three people &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Now, let us take the Civil Service. According to a person who made a study of the matter, the Civil Service staff increased by 276 per cent from 1937 to 1966. During that period our white population increased by only 70 per cent. He estimates that if the same rate of increase is to continue, the staff of the Civil Service will increase by a good 72 per cent by the year 1980, which is not far off, whereas the white population will increase by 27 per cent only. Therefore, is the right thing to do not to give some attention to this matter&#x003F; Is the Minister satisfied, for example, that we cannot save in this regard&#x003F; Is he satisfied that we do not have a lot of unnecessary legislation on the Statute Book to-day, legislation for which there is no need&#x003F; At the moment the implementation of this legislation requires additional staff every day. Has the time not arrived for us to appoint a commission to see whether this entire business cannot be streamlined&#x003F; I think it has. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, unfortunately we have members here who used to be underpaid agents of the Nationalist Party up to a short time ago. By becoming members of this House they have taken up positions to which they are not at all suited. To them I simply want to say, &#x201C;second hand clothes do not fit&#x201D;.</p>

<p>There are a few other matters I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister, and not only to the attention of the Minister, but also to the attention of this House. There is, <i>inter alia</i>, the position of the farmer and of trade and industries in the Western Province. For what reason has the Western Province been selected as the place in which the new rules with regard to the employment of Bantu labour have to be applied&#x003F; What have we in the Western Province done to the Government to receive punishment all the time&#x003F; If they believe that that is the only way to keep the white civilization from going under, surely similar provisions should be applied to the rest of the country as well. But not one Nationalist Party member will make the suggestion that these restricting regulations should also be applied to his constituency.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sick of that foolish story. In the first place, we have never had a surplus of Coloureds here in the Western Province. For that reason this is foolish nonsense which is being advocated by a few people from the Transvaal, people who know nothing of what is happening here. Where are the superfluous Coloureds&#x003F; And if there are any such superfluous Coloureds, what is wrong with this Government for it to pay pensions and other benefits to idle Coloureds&#x003F; Why then does the Government not make these Coloureds work&#x003F; Are there Coloureds in the Western Province to-day who are idle&#x003F;</p>

<p>Listen to what the Transvalers say! What does the hon. member for Tygervallei say&#x003F; He is not saying a word. Why&#x003F; Because he knows there are no Coloured layabouts here. Of course, I am not talking about the odd bad ones. The Police should in any case remove those. In reality there is a shortage of Coloured labourers in the Western Province, and we shall have to content ourselves with that position for many years to come.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>That may be. But then surely it is the duty of this Government to solve that matter&#x003F; Why should housewives be taxed by means of a sales duty so as to allow skollies to lie about idle&#x003F; If the hon. member is correct, he should join me in an attempt to get this Minister as far as to stop taxing the South African nation so that skollies may lie about idle. The real position is, however, that the hotel trade, for example, is complaining that it cannot obtain sufficient Coloured labour. And what about the farmer and the industrialist&#x003F; We always used to get Bantu labourers from the Bantu areas for periods of two years. That was difficult enough. But now we are getting them for one year only. Well, for the first six months they are not worth anything. They are raw when they arrive; they cannot speak one&#x2019;s language, they know nothing about what is going on. But as soon <span class="col_3807-3808" refersTo="page_0391"/>as they begin to learn something, it is time for them to go back. The only thing that is expected of the farmer under these circumstances is to subsidize the S.A. Railways. These Bantu may return to their areas, remain there for one week whereupon they may return. Usually, however, they do not go back to their reserves. They leave the train <i>en route</i> and say that they are going to visit relatives. In this way they visit one for 72 hours and another for 72 hours, until such time as they may return. What kind of business is this&#x003F; There is not one single member representing a constituency in the Western Province who will disagree with me when I say that this measure is a handicap as regards the labour position in the Western Province. We do not want to run our farms on the labour of prison inmates, but we want people we can employ and can pay. Is there no other way of solving the labour shortage in the Western Province&#x003F; Forget for the moment the story that the white spots in South Africa will start to get whiter by 1978. Let us forget about that; it is all over with that story. But if we want to remain sovereignly independent, and economically effective, we shall need more and more labourers in the Western Province. I also hope that the white man with his superior knowledge and initiative and his superior skill will be able to retain the leadership instead of becoming impoverished yet another time. No one knows better than I and the hon. the Minister do what the position of the white man was in 1932-&#x2019;33. At that time we did not speak of a Colour problem. The hon. the Minister knows perfectly well how we spoke of the poor white problem at that time. Unless we can obtain sufficient unskilled labourers to supplement the ranks, we shall have to take care that we are not once again going to force white people to become poor Whites and to do that kind of work. I can see no reason, if there is any need for this, why this handicap should be placed on us in the Western Province. Let us be told what the reason is why we in the Western Province have to farm with migratory labourers and prison inmates. Why can these people not be allowed, as in the past, to come here under a two-year contract if they want to do so&#x003F; Why can we not even give consideration to the policies implemented by Germany&#x003F; The hon. the Minister is well acquainted with the circumstances in Germany in this regard. They brought entire villages from Italy to Germany under a five-year employment contract. Those people did not become Germans. They returned to their country in due course after having helped Germany over its difficulties. Germany was not afraid that those Italians would become Germans. May we not make use of the labourers we have at our disposal so that greater prosperity may come to the Western Province&#x003F; I have said that we shall have to work harder, and I hope that this will come to pass. I also hope that the Government will make it possible for us to get more effective workers here. Those of us who still have an interest in these matters, talk about these things.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. member asked that question. At least it shows that he is interested in this matter. As a matter of fact, I said to the hon. the Minister that he should give consideration to the possibility of solving this matter in the way Germany solved its labour difficulties. Germany allowed the entire family of the migratory labourer to come along with him.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Of course they did that. The hon. the Minister too knows that this is so. Too much time has elapsed since that hon. member visited Germany, whereas the hon. the Minister was there a short time ago. The German Government transferred entire families, a whole village, to Germany under a five-year contract. I should like the possibility of having a similar undertaking in South Africa investigated in order to ascertain what can be achieved by those means.</p>

<p>But my time is running out. There are a few other matters I should like to discuss with the hon. the Minister. The hon. member for Pretoria (District) referred to the position we were experiencing in connection with motor cars and the prices charged by garages. This is a matter which the hon. the Minister really ought to have investigated. I think complaints are fairly common in this country that the costs of repairs to keep motor cars and tractors in running order are too high at the present time. This any farmer or anybody who owns such a vehicle will tell us. In the beginning I praised this hon. Minister for his courage. I did not always praise him for his wisdom, but in these other cases it probably was political considerations which made him act as he did. I nevertheless admire his courage. I wonder whether the time has not arrived for having an investigation into the number of different makes of motor cars and tractors which are available in South Africa. Should standardization not be taken one step further&#x003F; I understand that we have more makes of motor cars in South Africa than they have in either America or England. It is clear what it is costing the country in spare parts alone in order to be able to have all these makes of motor cars in this country. Nowadays one really finds too often that good salesmen palm articles off on to people for which one cannot obtain spare parts two or three years later. That must mean tremendous expenditure to the country. I did not make a thorough study of this matter, but I think the hon. the Minister will be well advised to have some investigation into this matter.</p>

<p><span class="col_3809-3810" refersTo="page_0392"/>Another matter I should like to raise concerns the stock exchange. Unfortunately I do not have the time at my disposal to elaborate on this. However, we all know what is happening on the stock exchange at present. We know how some people, usually the same group of people, are becoming extremely rich. They do not work, but simply use their knowledge to enrich themselves. I do not have complaints as regards most of those transactions, but I do have complaints as regards mutual life societies. I think the hon. the Minister may in fact be giving attention to this matter, but I shall be pleased if he wants to take us into his confidence to some extent and inform us of his plans. These mutual life societies can, if we do not take care, become money forming societies which is really going to take over South Africa. When one has regard to the sums of money which they have at their disposal year after year, and to the power which they have along with other large money forming concerns, I think the hon. the Minister may safely inform us in this regard. The hon. the Minister will be well advised to give attention to this aspect of the matter and then to let us have his opinion in this regard.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have so little time that I hope you will take this interruption into consideration.</p>

<p>We listened to hon. members on that side of the House and after having listened to members on this side of the House as well, I just want to say to them that I think their attempt failed. Precisely because agriculture found itself in very difficult circumstances over the past few years, they tried to bring the farmers of South Africa under the impression that we have a Government here which is interested in industrial development, in economic development, in the establishment of a powerful Defence Force, but which is not interested in the problems of the farmer. What is even worse, they want to tell the farmers of South Africa that we have a Government here which does not really regard agriculture as a factor in our national economy. For that very reason and on the basis of this White Paper, I want to take this opportunity to bring it to the attention of the hon. members on that side of the House and to the attention of the farmers of South Africa that this Government, through its Minister and on the basis of the White Paper which accompanies the Budget, thoroughly acquainted itself with the part played by agriculture in the economy of South Africa. On page 5 of the White Paper it is made clear that the real gross domestic product increased at a slower rate in 1968 than in 1967, i.e. by about 3.6 per cent as compared with the previous year&#x2019;s rate of 8 per cent, and according to the White Paper this was due to a decrease in agricultural production in 1968 as against that of 1967 as a result of the drought. If there is a factor in our national economy which can cause the increase of the real gross domestic product to drop from 8 per cent to 3.6 per cent, then it is only a fool who will maintain that this Government, that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture, or hon. members on this side of the House, do not regard it as an important factor. But the White Paper makes it very clear that these conditions developed especially as a result of drought conditions. <span class="col_3811-3812" refersTo="page_0393"/>We only want to make this point, namely that over the past 21 years, and in particular over the past nine years, we have had balanced budgets, as this Budget also is, and that is why we want to tell South Africa that this Government has done everything over the past nine years for the establishment of a powerful military machine in South Africa, not in order to disturb other countries, but to defend what is our own. This Government has succeeded in doing that. We thought that we had the most powerful defence force in Africa, but after the Six Days&#x2019; War we are convinced that we have the most powerful military forces in Africa. With all these stories of boycotts and sanctions which were going round it was this Government that saw to it by means of its budgets that we created an industrial machine which must also impress the fact upon the enemies of our people today that we are the industrial giant in Africa. One of our enemies has even called us the workshop of the whole of Africa, and that is due to the policy of this Government. I wonder whether we should consider it necessary to say something in regard to our economic growth at this stage. We know that as a result of the policy of this Government, South Africa is a country with one of the strongest economies in the world, a country which can pay for what it buys with the gold which it has in its possession. All this is true and notwithstanding the impression which the Opposition wants to leave with our people outside, we want to make it clear that hon. members on this side of the House are proud of our military power and of our industrial growth and proud of our economic strength, and to the farmer of South Africa we say that this Government knows that none of these things can be maintained if this Government does not have a sound and vigorous agricultural policy to keep the farmers of South Africa in a strong position in order to feed and clothe the people. This the farmer of South Africa must know.</p>

<p>I listened to hon. members opposite and I thought that they would really do something to defend the farmers if their good name were sullied. I sat waiting to this late hour to see where on the other side of the House we would find someone who would really take up the cudgels on behalf of the farmer. I said a while ago that we had imprecedented climatic conditions which created circumstances unprecedented in the modern history of agriculture. As a result of these special circumstances special measures had to be taken. We are aware of the fact that in this Budget and in the Budgets of the past few years enormous sums necessarily had to be spent in order to keep the farmers of South Africa going; in order to enable the farmers of South Africa to carry on producing. Sir, without wanting to couple this newspaper to this statement, I want to point out that we had to see a certain columnist making the statement that the farmers of South Africa were helping themselves to gift money. Those are he very words which appeared in that particular article on 3rd March. Because special measures had to be taken, because lump sums had to be spent on agriculture, the impression is now being created, also as a result of the action of certain members on the other side of the House, that this is gift money which the farmers of South Africa have received. Sir, I want to declare in this House to-day so that hon. members opposite can take note and so that the farmers of South African can take note, that we dissociate ourselves from the statement that our farmers have received gift money. The fact of the matter is that the farmers of South Africa borrowed that money and that it will be repaid, capital plus interest, to the source from which it was borrowed. To the Department of Agricultural Credit alone R7 million will, according to this Budget, be repaid this year. We completely dissociate ourselves from the statement that the farmers of South Africa are receiving gift money. It is money which they are obtaining from this Government on easier terms, but which they as self-respecting businessmen, will repay, together with interest, now and in the future. Sir, we hear the criticism from the opposite side that this Government does nothing for the farmer. We want to tell the Minister today that we highly appreciate these enormous amounts which have been spent in order to help the farmers; and while the agricultural industry is still experiencing hard times, we want to say to the hon. the Minister that it is not his fault. If we had reasonable climatic conditions over the past years then this aid would have been sufficient.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the farmer of South Africa has great appreciation for what the research workers of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services have done in connection with agricultural research in South Africa. In this connection I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Bethal. In expressing this appreciation, we trust that in the years ahead this work will be continued. Sir, knowledge is strength, but it is of no use that we in South Africa have at our disposal that store of knowledge through our research workers if we do not create the opportunity of conveying that knowledge by way of guidance to the farmers of South Africa. who have to make use of that knowledge. For that reason I agree with what was said by one of the great economists of South Africa. I do not want to associate myself with everything which he said&#x2014;that is a matter which the Government will have to investigate&#x2014;but I agree with him that we will not have the success in agriculture which we ought to have before, as this economist says, we spend at least 70 per cent of our agricultural budget on guidance and the rest on research.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it is a privilege I have that the Whips on my side of the House have allowed me to come into this debate at this late stage, because it has given me an opportunity of listening particularly to the comments of hon. members on the opposite side of the House in support of the Budget introduced by the Minister of Finance. I think the most remarkable feature of the speeches that came from the other side has been the qualified and at best lukewarm support for the Minister&#x2019;s proposals, especially his taxation proposals. Indeed, the lukewarm and qualified support at times threatened to erupt into open criticism. I was particularly interested in the suggestion of the hon. member for Sunnyside that the Minister should consider reducing the sales tax which he is proposing and to put in its stead a capital gains tax. To us on this side of the House that is interesting, because it is part of the undeclared war that is being fought by the people known as the &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D; against the establishment in the Nationalist Party. It is obviously a direct appeal over the heads of the Government to the people who are being hit hard and unjustly treated as a result of the ill-considered proposals made by the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>I also hoped that there would be a member on the other side of the House who would follow the excellent example of the Nationalist Party supporters in the City Council of Johannesburg, who joined the United Party there in appealing to the Government to do something about the financial plight of local authorities in South Africa.</p>

<p>The &#x201C;Sappe&#x201D; are in charge in Johannesburg.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But the Nationalist Party joined the &#x201C;Sappe&#x201D; in Johannesburg. This is a problem that faces every local authority in South Africa, concerning the congestion that is arising from the growth of the cities as a result of the prosperity in South Africa, and as a result of the lack of suitable sources from which these bodies can obtain their taxation. Two commissions, the Schumann and the Borckenhagen Commissions, have investigated this problem for years. We know that their reports are available to the Government. They are not available to Parliament, nor to the local authorities concerned, nor to the public. In this important speech, which is to set the pattern of the Government&#x2019;s financial policy for another year, the hon. the Minister of Finance had nothing to say about any solution or any attempt at a solution of this vexed and important problem that affects every major municipality. We are being left in the dark. We do not know what these commissions have reported. We do not know whether the Government is concerned or what the answer will be. I do hope that in his reply the Minister of Finance will take the opportunity of taking the House into his confidence on this most vital matter.</p>

<p>I am surprised that the Minister did not deal with this for another reason: In his Budget speech and his taxation proposals, he did take serious cognizance of the criticisms and the suggestions of the United Party over the last few years. I am surprised that he did not deal with this particular matter, because he seems to have accepted most of the criticism that came from the United Party in every other respect. If I look at what is good in his Budget, every good measure or proposal we are considering emanated from speakers on this side of the House over the years. I think, for example, of the bulge in income tax which had to be removed. It was becoming preposterous. this remnant of the old days of super tax, when a man earning R4,000 was a wealthy man and had to be discriminated against as regards taxation. But that was when money still had value under the United Party. It was not possible to maintain that situation under a Nationalist Party Government. I can remember for the last four or five years how we pleaded for the removal of that bulge. I can remember the present Minister of the Interior, as Deputy Minister of Finance, trying to ridicule our pleas about the bulge last year. The hon. member for Paarl went so far as to deny that the bulge existed. It makes me wonder what he thinks the Minister has removed by his proposals this time.</p>

<p>I think, for example, of the well authenticated pleas of the hon. members for Wynberg and Parktown on the taxation of married women, to which I had the privilege to listen. Here is some indication of relief for married people. I can remember the pleas that my Leader has made throughout South Africa for more resources for the higher education of our people to ensure the leadership which we want to maintain. I find that one of the few good features in this Budget on the positive side is more money for higher education. I can remember the pleas he made for the Civil Service, especially for the higher echelons of the Civil Service, and not only for the lower and medium echelons. We are pleased to know that R15 million has been set aside to meet the just demands of the professional people in the Civil Service. But again the Minister in this particular instance has done only half of what the United Party is entitled in the name of South Africa to demand from him. Two years ago, especially when the Cabinet came forward with the ill-considered plan to limit the pay that local authorities were giving their senior officials, because they would not let them compete with the poor and ridiculous salaries paid to the heads of Civil Service departments, we pointed out to the Minister that it was not enough to recruit people to the Civil Service by raising commencing salaries considerably, but that the top ranks of the Civil Service, the Secretaries of the departments, the Commissioners and their deputies, should also receive considerable increases to bring them in line, at least, with the heads of the public utilities <span class="col_3815-3816" refersTo="page_0395"/>whom they control, who earn up to 60, 70 per cent more than they do. People do not only look at the starting salary, but they want to know how far they can get. If one wants a stable civil service, there must be an inducement for them to stay because there is a chance to satisfy their ambitions, comparable with the chances they enjoy in private enterprise. I hope that in his reply the Minister will indicate to us that the position of not only professional people, deserving as they are, will be reconsidered, but also of the senior members of the Civil Service staff. That will have to be done if we want a stable civil service in South Africa.</p>

<p>It is interesting that so forceful, so effective and I think so just and unanswerable was the criticism of the United Party on taxation over the past few years that the hon. the Minister had no option but to appoint a very fine commission under the chairmanship of Dr. Franzsen, to investigate these matters. That commission justified and supported most of our criticism and suggested chiefly that this bulge should be removed and also made suggestions as to what should be done to reimburse the State for the revenue it would lose as a result. It is interesting that the hon. the Minister had the wisdom to accept the proposals of this commission in principle. A few minor details have not been accepted, but are only delayed. But in implementing those suggestions the Minister had been guilty of the gravest unwisdom, I think, in the history of Parliamentary government in South Africa. It is quite clear, as somebody said to me a few minutes ago, that the hon. the Minister consulted experts and accepted their advice, which is good. But we should remember that under our parliamentary system of government, we have a very important aspect of government, which consists of experts, largely in the Civil Service. But their purely expert disembodied advice has to be tempered in its human consequences by the wisdom of the politicians who form the Government of the day. If one looks at this Budget, one finds that expert advice was taken and implemented, but the Minister and the Cabinet lacked the human insight to judge what the consequences of a literal application of those suggestions would be. I think that is the tragedy of this Budget. It is quite clear that, while we and the country, even the trade unions, are willing to accept in principle, the proposals of the Government for a new system of taxation in South Africa, the sales tax on the consumer, and especially the buyer, one cannot find any responsible person concerned with this aspect of our life who accepts the actual proposals of the Government. The trade unions, the chambers of commerce, leading businessmen, all have joined in supporting the attitude of the United Party in damning the implementation of the commission&#x2019;s report as done by the Government.</p>

<p>I want to give hon. members a few examples. I think we should first of all look at the people who are getting the most relief because of the change in income tax. I want to express my appreciation to the <i>Financial Mail,</i> which in its issue of 3rd April, printed a table indicating what relief various income-tax groups will receive as a result of the change. It is interesting that married people with two children with an income of up to R1,500 in the Transvaal are receiving no relief whatsoever. But they will all have to pay the new buyers&#x2019; tax without exception. Then I find that people with an income of R2,000 a year&#x2014;and there are thousands of them, as I will show in a minute&#x2014;get relief of R15.84 a year. How many purchases do they have to make before that is not only absorbed, but multiplied many times in indirect taxation through buyers&#x2019; taxation&#x003F; I find that even married people with two children in the Transvaal who earn R5,000 a year, will receive a relief of less than R80 a year. One motor car or one refrigerator, and it is gone for more than a year. Then all the other indirect taxes have to be added. Then I find this interesting fact. A married man with two children in the Transvaal, earning R5,000 a year, will get R79.62, less than R80 a year, relief. But the man earning R30,000 will receive R6,050 relief. This man will have six times the income of the man earning R5,000 a year, but he will get 75 times the relief.</p>

<p>The Trade Union Council of South Africa put economists to work on this matter. They have found, taking a very selective list of essentials in the Budget, articles we all have to use every day if we want to be decent, clean and South Africans in our true tradition, that the minimum a family must spend more under this tax, is something like R40 a year. But then, if one takes into account the creeping inflation which this Government accepts as part of its policy, the fact that they accept that money must depreciate in value every year in order to maintain the impetus of our economy, and if one accepts that that has happened at an average of 2.7 per cent over the last few years, one finds that no one earning R5,000 a year or less can hope to benefit under this Budget. Whatever benefit they get, for example the meagre R80 a year as a reduction in income tax, if they are married with two children, will be more than absorbed by the purchase tax and by the decline in the value of money. Does one want any greater justification for the immediate reaction that came from the hon. member for Constantia when this Budget was introduced, that it seems to be a rich man&#x2019;s budget&#x003F; The more the people have had a chance to study this Budget and the more they have had a chance to analyze it, the more they have become convinced that this is a budget to favour the few.</p>

<p>I took the trouble of looking at the report of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue for the year 1966-&#x2019;67. There I find that while about a million people had to render income-tax returns in that year, many of them did not pay because they either did not earn enough or they worked at a loss. Probably some 800,000 people were subject to tax, but <span class="col_3817-3818" refersTo="page_0396"/>of those only 75,600 earned R5,200 or more. Out of the 18 million people of South Africa, out of the more than 3&#x00BD; million white people of South Africa, 75,000 benefit under this Budget and the rest have to pay what they have never had to pay before, namely a tax on every purchase that they make. 92 per cent of the people get no benefits. They get additional burdens, they have to comply with additional demands as a result of this Budget. I say we are fully entitled to call it a &#x201C;rich man&#x2019;s budget&#x201D;. At last the disguise, the mask has fallen from the face of the Nationalist Party and they stand revealed for what they are, the friend not of the capitalist but of the militant capitalist, the old-fashioned nineteenth-century capitalist in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize this point. A man earning R2,000 per year with three children will get no tax reduction. His spending power will be reduced by R54 because of the increase in the cost of living.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think he paid much. As a matter of fact, he paid nothing. But that is not the point. Wait a minute. The man earning R2,000 per annum with three children will get no tax reduction in that he paid no tax before. Does that satisfy the hon. the Minister&#x003F; He will get no tax reduction in direct taxes inasmuch as he paid no direct tax. But his spending power will be decreased by R54 because of creeping inflation and, according to what I told the House a little while ago, he will have to pay at least R37 to R38 in purchase tax. That is the position. He paid nothing before but now he has to pay about R40 in purchase tax. Does the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs understand that&#x003F;</p>

<p>A married man with three children earning R5,000 a year can on the face of it look forward to a good reduction of R102 a year, but when he looks at the tax placed on him as a consumer and the fact that the value of his money will fall by 2.7 per cent at least, he loses R70 on the deal, he is R70 a year worse off. So we find only those 75,000 European families who earn more than R5,000 a year will get any benefit from this Budget whatsoever, and very few non-Europeans should be included there. I have not had time to work out their figures.</p>

<p>I think in view of what has been proved from this side of the House, in view of the criticism that has been levelled from this side of the House and which has been voiced by the public outside &#x2026;</p>

<p>Shall I read what Mr. Meyer of the Associated Chambers of Commerce had to say about this Budget&#x003F; Shall I remind hon. members opposite of what Mr. Hurland, one of the greatest departmental store managers of Johannesburg said&#x003F; He called this a &#x201C;savage budget on the poor man&#x201D;. [Interjections.] Shall I remind them of what the trade unions and the Handelsinstituut had to say&#x003F; Every one of them has been critical of the way the sales tax is being imposed, and therefore I say the Government and Parliament and the country should be grateful to the hon. member for Constantia who gave us figures so that all of us could understand the position. He came with a counter-proposal in regard to which I want to say now I sincerely hope the Minister does not find it too late to consider. He pointed out that the hon. the Minister needed R98 million to compensate for what he will lose as a result of the change in the taxation system. He pointed out that the hon. the Minister had R53 million, being the balance of his surplus after he had taken R5 million to help people outside South Africa. He pointed out that there was a Stabilization Fund of R341 million from which R35 million could be taken on a temporary basis, because that is what the Stabilization Fund is for. It is there to stabilize the situation when the Government comes with revolutionary changes in the financial organization of the country, as this Government has done this Session. If I remember correctly, the hon. member suggested that R10 million transferred from the Revenue Account to the Loan Account be transferred back to the Revenue Account. The Minister now has a surplus of R28 million and it should be brought back. That will give him the R98 million. I think that is correct; that is how the hon. member for Constantia saw it. This will balance the Budget. Then the Government will have a year in which to experiment with a purchase or sales tax. It can impose a considerable sales tax, say 15 or 20 per cent, on luxuries, and a tax of not more than 2&#x00BD; per cent on other commodities on a more selective basis than the nine-page one we got in the Minutes of Proceedings the day after the Budget speech.</p>

<p>I want to plead with the Minister to take the suggestion of the hon. member for Constantia for what it is worth. He can only have one objection to it, and that is it may be inflationary. I concede that and I think we all concede it may be inflationary, but will it be more inflationary in one year than a purchase tax, the outcome of which we cannot foresee because we do not know at what level it will hit the consumer at the retail outlet&#x003F; Will it be more inflationary than the cost push effect such an ill-considered and unplanned sales tax as suggested by the Minister can have&#x003F;</p>

<p>I read on the financial page of the <i>Cape Times</i> yesterday a small two-inch report of what happened in Holland recently. There on 1st of January the Government imposed an added values tax, which is very similar to this new tax of ours. The results were unpredictable, but the average cost of food has risen by almost 6 per cent and the Lower House <span class="col_3819-3820" refersTo="page_0397"/>had to be summoned from its Easter recess to look at the consequences of this tax. The Government has now frozen all prices.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>In principle it is the same. Let us look at the example of our neighbouring country, namely Rhodesia. There they set about imposing a purchase tax circumspectly. One could almost have thought that the United Party was in power in Rhodesia, the way they did this. A few years ago they imposed such a tax at the retail point of outlet, at the final point of consumption, as you have it in America, in England, and in all the countries in which I have seen it work. The rate of the tax was 3d in the &#x00A3;, 1.66 repeating per cent, and it worked. Recently they doubled it and it is now 8d in the &#x00A3; at the retail outlet, at the point of final consumption; it is now 3.333&#x2153; per cent, but it works. Surely the Minister should consider the difference between these two cases and should be grateful to the hon. member for Constantia and to the Opposition for being willing to give the Government the benefit of its sound thinking through the years. [Interjections.] The history of South Africa of the last few years abounds with examples where the Government was forced by the logic of circumstances to accept the views of the United Party. It is true of immigration, it is true of the Orange River scheme, it is true of taxation, it is true of a hundred different things. I plead with the hon. the Minister of Finance to prove that he has the one quality which the country is entitled to demand of its Minister of Finance, and that is wisdom. He will prove he has it if he will consider and accept the wise and sensible, the helpful, proposals which came to him from the Opposition through the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it gives me pleasure to be able to say that we hope that the pattern which the hon. the Minister of Finance laid down with this Budget will in future be able to serve as a model for his colleagues and for every hon. member in this House. From his speech it is evident that he sought wisdom, and there are indications that he called in the assistance of Him who is known to be the wisest Being of all. I think this can serve as a lesson to all of us. Far from making remarks which do not correspond to his pattern, I hope we shall elaborate his pattern in future so that we may say: &#x201C;Furthermore, the preacher said the following things,&#x201D; things which will be further proof of and which will lend further support to his statements.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>The true picture as regards the provincial councils is nothing like the picture the hon. member tried to hold up to us. I think just the reverse applies. There were times when the programmes of the provincial councils anticipated even those of the Government. I want to leave that part of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech at that.</p>

<p>As I have said, the hon. member referred to the <i>Financial Mail</i> and he tried to lend further support to his case by referring to the <i>Financial Mail&#x2019;s</i> criticism on this Budget. It is a pity he did not read the following quotation in the March edition of the <i>Financial Mail,</i> because his speech might have been more useful and we could have listened to it with greater advantage. The hon. member said this Budget was the rich man&#x2019;s budget, that the poor man did not benefit at all and that the poor man did not get any concessions worth mentioning. But the <i>Financial Mail</i> says, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A relatively rich man whose income tax has been reduced might well find himself worse off than before the Budget because the prices of many of the commodities he regularly buys have risen in some cases by as much as 20 per cent.</block>

<p>What articles does the rich man buy so often&#x003F; The rich man, of course, buys the luxury cars, extra watches, luxury articles, additional radios and the like. In other words, if the hon. member wants to get his information from the <i>Financial Mail,</i> he should also look at this quotation, and then he will see that the arguments he advanced here do not hold water. I cannot spend any more of my time on the hon. member, because I want to say a few words about the Budget as well.</p>

<p>As has been said by both sides of the House, this Budget was based on a completely new style. I want to express my appreciation of the fact that the hon. the Minister found other sources that can be taxed. Before elaborating on this point, I just want to say the following. I think we can argue as much as we want to, but under all circumstances and at all times one major fact remains as plain as a pikestaff. Income tax is still the most just and fair form of taxation there is in the world. In the case of income tax the person, the concern and the taxpayer can be taxed according to the amount they can afford. The indirect form of taxation is a method by which more funds can be obtained and to make people pay in such a way that they do not feel it so much, and to curb extravagance to <span class="col_3821-3822" refersTo="page_0398"/>some extent indirectly and in a different way. I still maintain, however, that if one applies all the tests, income tax is still the most fair and just form of taxation. I think both sides of the House will agree that the country and the Government still needs a great deal of money. In future considerable levies will have to be imposed.</p>

<p>In passing, I want to suggest something here which agrees to a large extent with a plea which was made in this debate by the hon. member for Sunnyside before. I want to suggest that there should be a form of capital taxation. I think this will be welcomed by the rich as well as the not so rich. I want to suggest &#x00BD; per cent capital gains tax which is earmarked, not earmarked to go into the. Consolidated Revenue Fund of the State, but earmarked as was done in the case of the duty on petrol in 1935. At that time money was earmarked for a specific purpose. I want to see that we have a capital gains tax in this country but not simply for the sake of imposing taxation, but that it should be earmarked for only one purpose, namely for the question of water conservation in South Africa. I hope the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs will give this matter his attention.</p>

<p>If there is one department which is at present drawing the attention of the whole of South Africa, it is the Department of Water Affairs. The problem that Department has to cope with can and will be solved only when that major problem is confronted in an organized way. Instead of asking the Consolidated Revenue Fund hesitantly for one amount or other for water conservation every year, we should rather use this opportunity. I think everyone in the country, rich as well as poor, will welcome a capital gains tax of &#x00BD; per cent which is earmarked and which is applicable to all of us. It should be allocated for the one and only purpose of enabling the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs to build those hundreds and thousands of private dams, because the country is not prepared to and cannot rely on major projects alone in future. After all, most of our water runs to waste. The smaller water schemes can also be stimulated if we have a fund from which proper subsidies and other forms of assistance can be made available to those who are prepared to conserve water in South Africa on a smaller scale. I want to recommend to the Government in all seriousness and with the greatest emphasis that we must use that money only for this purpose in future. I cannot see why this cannot be done. Nobody can tell me that our people will not welcome this form of taxation.</p>

<p>The real reason why I got up to speak, is to deal with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia. I want to speak specifically about that part of his amendment in which reference is made to the shortage of manpower. I want to say here to-day with all the responsibility that rests on my shoulders that the question of the shortage of manpower is being exaggerated far too much. That is the first thing I want to say. This shortage does not exist, and before going into the matter further, I want to say that a sound way in which to combat this state of affairs and to give attention to it, is to revert to the statement made by the late Mr. Strydom here years ago; one cannot get away from the fact that this is the right and only way which will prevent this country from being plunged into chaos later. As I said last year during the discussion of the Physical Planning Act, there is a rush and the rush will become worse. Mr. Strydom said that industries in South Africa should only develop as fast as the population of South Africa could afford such development, and industrialists from all over the world could not come and make claims here. They must not expect the people of South Africa, only because the climate for industrial development here is the best in the world, to do whatever they are told to do, to give them water, to give them Black labour, to give them white labour as well as housing. Let us keep to that statement, because if we keep to that statement, the Minister of Planning and the Minister of Bantu Administration will be able to handle the position properly. If we should give in to everything the Opposition expects us to do, if we give in to all their fancies and to the demands in connection with the so-called shortage of manpower&#x2014;I want to say again that that is not true&#x2014;we must bear in mind that it is the thin end of the wedge they are trying to drive in. This is the attempt they make and this is the flank on which they want to attack us in order to get us to accept their demands for Black instead of white labour.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, do you know why there is not enough white labour to-day to meet the so-called demand&#x003F; Because the big industrialists who are ruled by the whip of the Hoggenheimers do not want white labourers to come in from outside the country. They do not want this; they want technicians and professional people, but they do not want the artisans here because &#x201C;Hoggie&#x201D; says, &#x201C;There is all the Black labour you require in this country&#x201D;. Day after day he says we should allow the white man to be replaced by the Black man. &#x201C;Hoggie&#x201D; asks why we want white labourers in this country. What is the result&#x003F; He has a stranglehold on the majority of our industries in the Republic; he is the man who is projecting and who says that we should not let skilled Whites from Europe come into the country. In passing, I want to say that I will bring in any number of skilled artisans that may be wanted from Europe and Britain. Just give me a certificate, just give me a contract, give me a guarantee that a certain number of artisans are needed and I will go and get whatever number is needed. That industrialist who is ruled by the whip of <span class="col_3823-3824" refersTo="page_0399"/>Hoggenheimer does not want this, he will not allow this. I have made this offer to them time and again, but they do not want the skilled artisans here. No, they want the professional man who is here to-day, in Cairo to-morrow, in Europe the next day, and in Australia the day after that; they want the man who is going from one place to another, but the artisan who came to South Africa in the past was the man who made South Africa his home. It was the man who identified himself with White South Africa, the man who became a good citizen, and that is the man who to-day is as good a South African as one could possibly want him to be. They do not want those people. This is recorded in their letter written by the Chamber of Mines years ago. The contents of the letter boil down to the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not prefer, we do not like, to employ Europeans and white labourers, not even from Britain, because their political power would be such that they will hold the Government in the hollow of their hands.</block>

<p>That is the reason. The Black man does not have a vote and if the white man comes here from overseas, he votes for the National Party. It is an economic stranglehold which is being applied by Hoggenheimer for the purpose of exercising political influence in the industrial field from time to time to fight this Government. If the United Party is really concerned about skilled labour, they must make their influence felt with the industrialists and tell them: Give us a guarantee that we will be able to bring in skilled labourers from our countries of origin. But they do not want to do that. The hon. member for Constantia referred to the shortage of labour once more. He says there are thousands of blacks we should allow to be trained as skilled workers, so that they can take the place of Whites. Then they advance the argument of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;, and when you ask them what you must do with the white worker, they say he should be promoted. No country in the world and no nation under the sun can be in a sound position if it leaves its labour force in the hands of a foreign nation. Let the Opposition appreciate this once and for all. Whether they like it or not, the policy of separate national development will be implemented more efficiently year after year and as a result of that they will have to put it out of their mind that the Black man will always take the place of the white man. The reason why there is such an outcry from their part about the labour shortage to-day is to see whether they cannot obtain some concession or other so that we can allow more Bantu to come in to take the place of the white man.</p>

<p>As we allow that pattern to develop further, it will become increasingly clear, also to the people overseas. The Englishmen, the Scots, the Irish, the Dutch and the Germans come into close contact with South Africa, and they are being frightened away by Hoggenheimer&#x2019;s story that we are replacing Whites with Blacks. This frightens away the skilled workers overseas. He says he does not intend going to South Africa to work there on the basis of the rate for the job in competition with the black man, because he knows he will not be able to hold his own under those circumstances, because his standard of living is higher than that of the black man. How can one expect a skilled labourer from overseas to come to this country when there is all this talk of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; as regards your artisans&#x003F; Surely, he cannot do this. Surely he knows he will simply have to leave South Africa again. I say that as a result of this talk about the rate for the job, the United Party is frightening away thousands and thousands of potentially good immigrants from South Africa. But let them stop that nonsense and let them accept once and for all, because the public of South Africa has accepted it, that in future the industrial pattern here will only be based on the Industrial Conciliation Act, namely that under Section 77 the white man will be protected in his areas, and in order to protect the non-white labourer, he is afforded training facilities that he may equip himself to work in his own areas. This is the pattern that should be accepted by the Opposition once and for all, but as long as they talk about the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; story it serves as further encouragement to the industrialists in South Africa, who would perhaps have preferred white workers from Europe and for him to say, if I have to tell that man in Holland or Belgium or Germany or England to come and work here on the basis of the rate for the job in competition with the black man, they know it is useless to try and let that white man come to South Africa. I shall leave all this talk about the rate for the job at that. The United Party cannot tell me in which instances, from the time they started to talk about the rate for the job, they could protect one single white man against infiltration by the non-white worker. If we had not had Act No. 55 of 1962, under which the white miner was protected, there would not have been one single white man left on the mines. But as a result of the protection they have under that Act, the mining industry to-day is one of the industries in South Africa which does not take second place to any other industry as far as efficiency is concerned. And it is in the mining industry where the lines of job reservation are most clearly drawn. Certificates of efficiency are granted to Whites only, with the result that one has the highest degree of efficiency there. But what do we always hear from the United Party&#x003F; They say that as a result of job reservation and other forms of protection we give white workers, we are obstructing the industry. But I say that we are obstructing the industries to such an extent that there is not <span class="col_3825-3826" refersTo="page_0400"/>one single industrialist in the whole world today who is not keen to invest money here.</p>

<p>All this is attributable to the protection we give the White workers, because this is the key to industrial peace, which is something unheard of in the rest of the world. That is why our country has been progressing steadily and more rapidly than most of the other countries in the world, because we have the highest degree of industrial peace. Not in any of the old countries with a homogeneous population does one find the amount of industrial peace we are enjoying here. This is also attributable to the fact that among the workers there are leaders of consequence, men of calibre who have the necessary qualities of leaders to guide the workers and who know their responsibility towards South Africa, and because we do not have the situation one finds in America where trade union leaders are bribed by company owners to strike in order to embarrass the Government. Therefore I say we should pay the greatest possible tribute to the trade unions in South Africa, the leaders of which are men who place South Africa first and who have no motive other than looking after the welfare and prosperity of those of whom they are the leaders and whom they represent in the first place and, in the second place, of South Africa as a whole. We are very fortunate in that we have workers&#x2019; leaders of that calibre, and I hope and trust that the confidence the Government placed in them and which they placed in the Government will be maintained for many future generations, because when that happens the industrial peace in South Africa is guaranteed, and we can hope that our growing economy will flourish for many future generations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Allow me to say, first of all, that since this Budget debate has been in progress, I have listened to various speakers on this side of the House, and I may say that they, virtually without exception, have performed the duty which rests on their shoulders, i.e. to confine themselves to the various facets of the Budget. Fundamentally this Budget has so much impact that in my opinion it caught the United Party completely on the wrong foot, so much so that they, in the words of a certain writer they know well, Mr. Stanley Uys, as he predicted last year, simply fired a shot of buckshot to see whether one of the grains would not hit somewhere. I listened to the men who spoke on agriculture, and what they said amounted to a repetition in this Budget debate of the same bits of gossip they spread at the time of the last election in Newcastle. As far as I am concerned, however, I want this hon. House and the hon. the Minister and the officials who drafted the Budget to know that the majority of people in the area I come from are satisfied with the new taxation and that it is an inspiration to the people who used to feel depressed about the old form of taxation in the days when taxation still assumed a stereotyped form. This has now acted as an inspiration to them, because they see that now there is going to be a new dispensation. But what is alarming to me, was already an alarming factor to certain other people last year. I have here a photostatic copy of the problems with which the United Party was saddled last year after the Budget, and it reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Firstly, a number of its M.P.s and Senators are simply not suited to be Opposition parliamentarians in this trying period when the United Party cannot afford to carry any passengers. Secondly, too many United Party parliamentarians make speeches which can only be described as half-baked. Except on a few specific issues like agriculture, or a few other lesser important topics, they undertake very little original research, relying on a few inadequate newspaper cuttings and some half-formed thoughts to see them through a debate.</block>

<p>Let us now test the speeches of a senior frontbencher like the hon. member for Yeoville against this. He said a whole lot of things and said exactly the same things as the hon. woman member over there. [Interjections.] The article proceeds&#x2014;and I should like to quote this, because I should like not only hon. members in this House, but also the public outside, to have the opportunity of testing these speeches, which have now become public knowledge, against this statement of the gentleman who wrote the article. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">M.P.s have access, even if it is limited, to Government departments and to other sources of information. Often they should know much more and not less than they read in the Press. When they stand up to speak in Parliament they should be telling the Press Gallery something new, either by way of news or views, and not something they already know.</block>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand made terrible statements here and said the National Party used to be a poor man&#x2019;s party once upon a time; it looked after the poor man. In other words, by saying that he was actually admitting that they were a rich man&#x2019;s party. And that was their downfall. To-day they still are a rich man&#x2019;s party, and I do not want to assume the role of a prophet now, but I say that this same rich man&#x2019;s party is going to bury them, because in the past 20 years their numbers have been decreasing very rapidly. I would be concerned about something like that.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>There are a few factors about which we are very happy and I should like to mention them here. Because of this Budget we are now at least aware of the fact that we have a fine Civil Service. I am saying this because of an attack made here by the hon. member for Sea Point, who is not present at the moment, on the Civil Service. The hon. member wanted a commission of inquiry to be appointed in order to ascertain in what way the Civil Service could be made more streamlined. His deputy leader, the hon. member for Yeoville, was not present at the time and subsequently he came here and praised a few civil servants. Sir, personally I am perfectly satisfied with the Civil Service we have and so are my people. We should bear the fact in mind that this Budget makes provision for expenditure amounting to R4,000 million and that the administration of the country has to be undertaken by a greatly reduced staff, as the United Party put it, because according to them we are losing all our staff. Under these circumstances we can only say &#x201C;Bravo!&#x201D; to the small but valiant band of men and women we have in our Civil Service. Those of us who often have to deal with the Civil Service and who used to be civil servants ourselves, know with what interest they are performing their work. As regards this Budget with its sales duty, they have come forward with a completely new idea. Now we at least know that supervision is going to be exercised over the businessmen who are making exhorbitant profits, supervision for which we have been pleading for so long and in which connection we have never received any support from the United Party. I have never heard one single United Party member deliver a plea in this House for the activities of businessmen who make exhorbitant profits to be curbed. Here I have in mind the businessmen who adopt the attitude, &#x201C;This is my price for the article; take it or leave it&#x201D;. Now these businessmen will know that if they are exploiting the public in some way or other, the article concerned can quite easily be included in the Minister&#x2019;s list of articles which are subject to a 20 per cent sales duty, and this 20 per cent will most definitely not be recovered from the pocket of the consumer only. Hon. members of the Opposition should not think that this band of men who are assisting the hon. the Minister are so stupid as to introduce a duty simply because they want to introduce a new system or want to try out something new, as a town-dweller does who wants to ride a young horse and then puts his foot in the wrong stirrup as a start. We do not do things like that. Expert advice was taken.</p>

<p>Much of this duty can be absorbed from the profits which are being made at present and which are being invested in the so-called grey capital which the Government has been unable to get at up to now and which it will eventually get at whether people want to know this or not. Let this Budget then be a revelation to those who believe that the Government has struck a wrong note that the Government will eventually get at the people who use grey capital for financing their affairs and for keeping rates of interest low. But Rome was not built in a day, nor are fax systems. But, Sir, you can examine every one of our Budgets over the past 20 years, from the <span class="col_3829-3830" refersTo="page_0402"/>smallest to the largest, and you will find that they are indicative of progressive thinking, that fundamental changes were introduced from time to time, changes which were accepted in due course, and then the hon member for Yeoville maintains that the changes were introduced at the instance of the Opposition, for example, the elimination of the bulge in the income tax scale and the introduction of income levelling in respect of the agricultural industry. What does he think we on this side of the House do&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>If we did do nothing, surely the electorate would reject us and return a United Party Government to power. Sir, we want to congratulate the hon the Minister on this new tax direction. Before concluding my speech, I just want to mention three further points, points to which I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give his attention. In the first place I want to refer to those farmers who were placed on a stock basis for income tax purposes. That worked out at plus-minus &#x00A3;20, i.e. R40, per large stock unit, per head of cattle. At the present time this is still the value. In the event of such a farmer&#x2019;s death, his estate is assessed for taxation purposes at the difference between R40 and the estimated value of a head of cattle which, under present circumstances prevailing in our flourishing and growing economy has increased to R140, R160 or R180. I want to ask for these values to be re-adjusted so as to bring them more or less into line with the present market value of stock.</p>

<p>Then I come to the second point I want to raise, and here I do not want to plead for any change to be made to the tax system. The present position is that a tax is levied on motor cars, bicycles and other vehicles, and this money is distributed to the various authorities or, as the hon. member for Yeoville prefers to call them, local authorities. We simply call them provincial councils and other authorities which include the local authorities he has in mind. I hope the hon. member also had the Durban local authority in mind which still is under their control. I also hope he had the deeds of those people in mind when he referred to Johannesburg. Instead of letting the owners of motor vehicles etc., pay a wheel tax, as we call it, we want to plead for a tax to be levied on fuel, so that the man who makes most use of his vehicle may pay the most and the man who makes less use of his vehicle and the roads, may pay less. My basic reason for this proposal is that these assessments are left to the whims of provincial authorities and other local authorities. Therefore we find that this tax differs from province to province. We also find that difficulty is always being experienced with regard to the transfer of vehicles from one province to another and that people prefer to register their motor cars in that province which has the lowest tax. If a uniform tax were to be levied on fuel, it would be possible to do away with provincial taxes, and I think that sufficient funds would be found in this way for the maintenance of our roads.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to come to the allowances paid to provincial authorities. We know that Bantu Education has its own account now; the Post Office has its own account; the Railways Administration has its own Budget; the Provincial Administrations also have their own Budgets, but they may do as they please without this Parliament&#x2019;s having much say about money. In the same way as South-West Africa and the Railways, the Post Office and Bantu Education are expected to Table their Estimates in this House, I want to ask that the provinces should also Table their Estimates in this House so that we may discuss them. As hon. members know, we are not perfectly happy about the expenditure of one province, and it would be a good thing if we knew in advance in what way they were going to spend their money. I have here in front of me a Budget which made provision for R29 million for health services. Of this R29 million, R2 million was recovered from the State; another R2 million from Whites and the rest was a dead loss. We have to view this picture against the background of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; to which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred in his speech, because there is a correlation between the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; and the ousting of Whites from fairly important posts to make place for non-Whites. We also find that these provinces do not always spend money in a way with which all of us would agree at all times.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has been a privilege to me to have been able to take part in a budget debate such as this in which new vistas have been opened and in connection with which we know that the Minister and the people who assist him will also be open to new approaches in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened to a lot of speeches during this budget debate. Some have been very interesting while others have not interested me very much. Although I cannot compliment the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, there were a few points in his speech that were really very startling to me, and the Opposition. I am wondering whether hon. members on that side heard the statement coming from the hon. member for Vryheid just now when he suggested that as with the Railway and Post Office Budgets, the Provincial Council&#x2019;s budgets should be discussed and passed in this Parliament as well.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says why not. I wonder on whose authority the hon. member is speaking here this afternoon. We will be fighting the Provincial <span class="col_3831-3832" refersTo="page_0403"/>Council elections next year and we will look forward to dealing with this point, particularly in the Newcastle and Vryheid areas. The hon. member said that his constituents were very very happy indeed with the Budget. This is another bold statement for the hon. member to have made. I do not know and I cannot fathom why his constituents should be so happy and contented about this Budget, when generally speaking, wherever one goes, the topic of the day is about the purchase tax in this Budget. Everybody is complaining and dissatisfied and confused about the purchase tax. But in Vryheid they are very happy. This I cannot understand. It is an exception to the rule. When one refers to the purchase tax&#x2014;the &#x201C;sales&#x201D; tax as hon. members on the other side prefer to call it&#x2014;I immediately think of estate duties or death duties. Here one finds that the estate of a businessman which he has built up and in respect of which he has been paying direct taxation on his earnings over the years, is again taxed after his death. It is taxed for the second time. I want to see how many people in Vryheid accept even the estate duty tax. When we take a simple example such as the retreading of motor car tyres or any rubber tyres, the reconditioning of all tyres, the position is that we pay tax on these tyres in the purchase of that particular article. But when it is worn out, because the man is battling and he wants to try and make ends meet and at the same time curb inflation, he decides to have the tyre reconditioned; He then pays a tax for the second time on the same article, this is just like estate duty taxation. Here is an example of another small item. If you buy the shank of a gold ring at a jewellers shop&#x2014;the bare ring&#x2014;and at another jeweller you buy a diamond &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member must give me an opportunity to speak. I did not interfere with him whilst he was speaking. As I have said, if in these circumstances a diamond was bought at a jeweller you would have to pay 20 per cent on the gold shank and another 20 per cent on the diamond. When the jeweller fits the diamond to the gold shank to make a complete job of the ring, a further 20 per cent tax has to be paid.</p>

<p>This is a point the hon. member will have to explain to this House. I am very pleased that the hon. member mentioned this point, because it brings me to the theme of my speech on the purchase tax, namely the unpreparedness of the people. Before I proceed to this point I would like to say that I have heard the Budget called all sorts of things during this debate. Some have called it the rich man&#x2019;s budget. I should like to call it the rich man&#x2019;s &#x201C;joy&#x201D; and the poor man&#x2019;s &#x201C;nightmare&#x201D;. This is purely what it is, and what it means. I have often said to people, and it applies particularly to this budget debate &#x201C;dit is nie &#x2019;n skande om arm te wees nie, maar dit is baie ongerieflik&#x201D;. And this is true. We are to-day imposing taxation upon the poor people of South Africa to foot the bill for the benefit of the rich. This purchase tax is instant legislation on the public without debate. To-day we have in certain businesses nothing short of chaos. I represent a large area in the Eastern Cape and I can assure you that since the Budget was announced there has been chaos in the manufacturing industries, wholesale dealers and the retail dealers. In some instances there has been complete chaos, so much so that even the radio has had to come to the assistance of the department in trying to explain how this particular tax works. I wonder why the hon. the Minister did not first consider issuing a moratorium to all the manufacturing industries and all the other businesses, explaining to them precisely how this purchase tax had to work and how they had to go about it to make it work satisfactorily. But nothing at all was done. Only a few years ago we were faced with another problem, not nearly as complicated as this purchase tax, namely the decimal currency changeover. That was not nearly as complicated but at least the public and all the businesses had an opportunity of studying for five years the currency changeover, before it was brought into operation. The hon. member for Vryheid said in his speech that &#x201C;die Opposisie is onkant gevang&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In a sense the Opposition has been caught unawares or offside. The Government has been caught offside too. The Government brought in this purchase tax quite prematurely without warning anybody. I do accept that I was caught unawares as regards this purchase tax. I am not ashamed to say so because nothing was explained to us beforehand. It was simply dropped on us like a bomb and we have had to accept it overnight. The Budget in itself fails to combat inflation, inflation is something which has been a major topic in this House for some years. This Budget does in fact do the opposite, it is creating inflation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must get up and make a speech on the Budget. I should like to hear his views on it because he represents a large hard-working section of our population, namely the railway people. I should like to hear what he has to say about the people in the De Aar area where we have a large railway junction. We are looking forward to his speech. I will be visiting De Aar myself during the recess and <span class="col_3833-3834" refersTo="page_0404"/>I should like to check up on the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks here this afternoon, that is if he has any remarks.</p>

<p>Last year we showed a surplus of R58 million and in 1967 some R30 million odd. Today we have in our Stabilization Fund, as has already been mentioned here, R343 million. This is really a nice large tidy sum of money. We heard the hon. the Minister mention that he was prepared to lose in revenue through relaxing direct taxation by R115 million. He suggested that he was going to make up the leeway by this purchase tax which is expected to bring in approximately R100 million. In other words, according to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s figures, he would fall short by about R15 million, which on a large Budget of R2,673 million, is a mere drop in the ocean. I do not know how the hon. the Minister calculates the purchase tax, this is something which has been discussed here and everybody seems to be guessing. But knowing the hon. the Minister as I do and how well he has done by overtaxing our people for the last two years, my guess is that he will emerge not with a loss of R15 million but that he will show a profit of near R200 million this time next year. R200 million is my estimate. We will come back to this House and see how far out I was and how far out the hon. the Minister was. It has already been mentioned that there may be a motive in ending this next year with a large surplus. It may be a political stunt. I know this Government and its supporters well enough, that when it is election time, they are going to find themselves on the right side of the financial fence. Possibly a reduction will come next year in this particular purchase tax, which for the next 12 months is going to hit everybody very hard indeed, and just before the Provincial Council elections, this purchase tax will be reduced.</p>

<p>When one considers the working couple one finds that although the Minister has rejected the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s advice that working couples be taxed separately, he is replacing current concessions for working couples with a flat deduction of R500 from the taxable income of a couple. According to the Minister, he will gradually reduce the combined taxation on the couple when they reach an income of R8,000. We on this side of the House have been suggesting for years now that taxation on the combined income of a working couple should be done away with. We do already find that when a working woman receives her salary, she falls under P.A.Y.E.; and she pays her tax. So does her husband. They have always paid, but now the hon. the Minister is only allowing her a ceiling of R500 income, before this R500 salary is added together with her husband&#x2019;s. It is the same as the estate duty, the tyres and the rings tax. I should like to see that this is done away with completely. I am not satisfied. I am not satisfied at all. I was expecting something far better than the concessions the hon. the Minister has given to working couples. I think it is very unfair, and I can assure the hon. the Minister and this House that my constituency is very disappointed about the concession as regards this joint taxation on working married couples. No one will convince me that it is in any way fair. He is not giving the working wife much scope. She only has to earn R84 a month, which is not much to-day, when she exceeds the R500 mark per annum, her salary is added to that of her husband.</p>

<p>I now come to another item, which is the allowance on medical expenses of a minimum of R150, irrespective of the family. I feel there should be a sliding scale so that the family man can benefit. It seems wrong for a bachelor to have an allowance of R75 and a family man, who has six or eight children, or even more, to have a medical allowance of only R150. We know bachelors have expenses that married men do not have. I have been a bachelor myself. But I do not see why these two categories should receive virtually the same allowance.</p>

<p>Now I come to another item which I am concerned about. I know other members on that side are worried as well, although they are afraid to mention it. The growth funds to-day in terms of this Budget will be consuming all the cash in South Africa, which is of course to the detriment of the building societies. We must have houses and more houses, but the quotas from the building societies are decreasing monthly, owing to people investing hard cash in growth funds, simply because the growth funds are inviting the public to subscribe. I feel and suggest that the funds should be compelled to invest at least 20 per cent in the building societies to plough it back into houses for our people. Housing loans will naturally benefit. If this does not happen, the housing loans in South Africa will suffer very seriously.</p>

<p>Now I come to the last item, which is a matter that has been mentioned here quite often, namely the tax on soap and powder. This again affects the family, and is going to hit the family man, particularly the man with a large family. The Minister for Bantu Administration and Development mentioned only last year that we in South Africa must have larger families. Now the Minister of Finance is imposing a tax on all the items which help to keep the large family healthy and clean. Not only are we faced with this problem of keeping our families healthy and clean in view of the rise in taxes on these commodities which are very essential, but we find that even commodities such as disinfectants outside the house where we have to use them to control and kill germs and to keep away all diseases, have been increasingly taxed. Altogether I am very disappointed in the Budget and very dissatisfied about it. I look forward to reviewing it next year; I am sure we will see that the Opposition has been very accurate in its forecast.</p>

<from><span class="col_3835-3836" refersTo="page_0405"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I got a fright the other day when I heard one of the Opposition members say that these principles laid down in the Budget were acceptable to them, for experience has already taught me that that side of the House can do nothing good. If they say they accept a principle I must from the outset feel apprehensive about something being wrong with that principle. But I am glad, and I am certain that they accept the principle on which this Budget is based. That is one matter of which I am at least certain. This rummaging about in regard to soap, powder, shaving blades and what have you, is merely superficial. It is a smoke-screen intended to conceal something, as I want to show to hon. members in a moment. There is a second matter of which I am also very certain, i.e. that in no period of United Party government could our growth rate have exceeded the postulated and pre-planned growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent. The problems with which we and the Minister were faced were that our postulated growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent had burst its seams. It was more than had been planned in advance. This was one of the problems the Minister had to deal with. At no time during the United Party r&#x00E9;gime was anything like this possible.</p>

<p>I want to mention a third matter of which I am certain. In no United Party period were so many economically active people drawn into this developing economic structure of ours than is at present the case. Just imagine, we are planning an increase in economically active people in accordance with our natural growth rate of 20,000. Do you know by what number that figure is being exceeded&#x003F; By 17,000, and in spite of that 17,000 in 1967 there is still a manpower shortage. This is an amazing testimonial to the policy and economic arrangements in this country. Everything is developing so rapidly that it is virtually engulfing the established infrastructure on which these economic functions must develop. By no stretch of the imagination could something like this have been possible in any United Party period. This hedging on the part of the United Party by saying that this is a rich man's budget, where they are now giving themselves out to be the protectors of the less well-to-do sectors of the population, surely this is all a smokescreen, surely this is a false screen. It is not the truth. Not a single hon. member opposite has risen to his feet and put in a plea for that sector of the population whose existence is threatened by the people with a capitalistic mentality here in South Africa, or put in a plea for their ultimate security. Those people cannot dissociate themselves from one of their characteristic features, namely their capitalistic mentality. They know that the white miners of this country are once again being threatened by the deeds, the intrigues and the attempts of these capitalistic powers in South Africa to undermine the security of the workers. They are doing so with one end in view, namely to cut down on expenses. If there is one outstanding feature of the National Party it is the following: The National Party believes that peace and quiet must prevail in all sectors of the country. The Party has, succeeded brilliantly in achieving this. If there is a feature which differs fundamentally from this feature of the National party, then it is the presence of capitalistic groups in this country which ignore this basic component of our policy, i.e. the maintenance of stability based on peace and order and a stable economic growth. It is also a fact that as yet the world has produced no alternative to the basic principle on which the National Party regulates its labour relations in the Republic. It takes into account all socio-political, all socio-economic, and practical political factors. It is those which have a decisive effect on what is one of the indispensable supports on which a country&#x2019;s sound economic growth must be established. Throughout our history this capitalistic mentality has been tampering with the sound labour relations of the Republic of South Africa, and they are doing so again; they are tampering with them again. Once again there is unrest among our mineworkers. The unrest among our workers is building up. This unrest is not based on suspicions I have; it is not based on fictitious allegations; this unrest is not limited to one category of workers in the mines; it has wider repercussions. I want to read extracts from letters to the House to indicate why I am making these accusations. I have here correspondence from the offices of the Anglo-American group. I have, <i>inter alia,</i> a letter from a ventilation officer addressed to the General Manager of a West Rand mine. The letter deals with the Introduction of Bantu Observers, Proposed System of Observations. It deals with the incorporation of Bantu labour into the ventilation section of the mine. A whole series of proposals is made in the letter in connection with such an incorporation of Bantu. This is replied to by the Consulting Engineer of the Anglo-American group. The letter originated in the head office of Anglo-American. The letter begins as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir.&#x2014;Introduction of Bantu Ventilation Observers&#x2014;Proposed System of Operation &#x2026; The principle of introducing Bantu observers is agreed &#x2026;</block>

<p>The writer then comments on various proposals made by this ventilation officer. Then a reply from the ventilation officer, to the previous letter received from this consulting engineer. Here is the letter; it deals with the scheme of employing Bantu as ventilation officers. Then there is a letter, from the offices of Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa Limited. I want to read this memorandum as well now. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Use of Bantu Recorders in Mine Ventilation Departments: Bantu recorders (or observers) <span class="col_3837-3838" refersTo="page_0406"/>have been employed in some other Groups for up to two years and their use is being extended. This is a significant departure in policy and some details of practice and experience in Other Groups will be useful.</block>

<block name="quote">Selection and Operation of Bantu Recorders: Selection of trainees for this job is based on proficiency in reading, writing and arithmetic, and ability to converse in English and Fanakalo. Colour blindness tests are, given. Standard VIII education is required. On this basis it has been found that there is a fairly large &#x201C;waiting list&#x201D; for this position, and the mines can afford to be very selective. Bantu recorders normally operate in pairs. They report to the ganger or to the boss-boy in charge of the working place and record the temperature, air velocity and wet kata at points along the face, as well as measuring the distance of strike walls and ventilation controls from the face, and air direction at points in the stope. In some Groups they take dust samples but in others this is left to the European observer who must visit each working place at least once in three months.</block>

<p>This is something appalling which is being revealed here! I am quoting further from this letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Reaction of Personnel on Mines: In the two Groups (Rand Mines and Union Corporation) that have adopted this scheme fully, the introduction of the system needed a lot of care. Adverse reaction was, however, not severe and the use of Bantu recorders appears to be acceptable once all personnel are used to the idea.</block>

<p>Listen carefully now, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Salary changes and additional responsibility were given to European observers in the ventilation departments.</block>

<p>Those white observers who were replaced by Bantu are receiving higher salaries. Let me tell you how our people regard this matter. All of us who represent mine-workers&#x2019; constituencies know that this is how our people feel. I am not the only one who is pleading for this, nor am I the first to speak about this matter. I am speaking about it in the House to-day. Some of my colleagues here have had this matter in hand for quite some time. They discussed this matter a long time ago. I am consequently not claiming for myself the credit for having been the first to mention this to-day. We are all of us concerned about this matter. My people maintain that what is being done here amounts to silent bribery. Let me quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, the first time this system was introduced (at Crown Mines, some years ago) it was stopped hurriedly because of arguments that had developed in other fields. This is obviously a delicate matter and requires careful handling.</block>

<block name="quote">Groups Using Bantu Recorders: Rand Mines have been using Bantu recorders for over two years. All mines are now on this system.</block>

<p>That hon. member must not be so quick to speak.</p>

<p>These are all photostatic copies of the letters which found their way into my hands. I have read out the contents fully and carefully to this House. The process which is taking place here, is an alarming one. I want to emphasize that there is a continual tampering here. Where there is peace and quiet and order, they are tampering with it. The peace and quiet and order is the result of the National Party&#x2019;s labour relations policy. But these people are forever tampering with it; their object is to make as much capital out of it as possible and they are ignoring the true basis of stability in our country, i.e. peace and quiet and order. We are beginning to get sick and tired of it. The hon. the Minister appointed the mediation committee, and thanks to this step a wage agreement has now been approved. This agreement is now in operation. The mineworkers are completely satisfied with it. It does not operate 100 per cent in all respects, but the Government went out of its way to assist in that agreement being reached. Hardly has peace and quiet been restored among the ranks of the mineworkers when this eternal tampering begins again. All this process does is to upset the miners again. This process is not simply taking place among the ventilation people; it is also taking place among the samplers and the recorders in the mines. This process has been going on for a long time. It subjects the miners remuneration, particularly among the recorders and the samplers, to the samplers allocation. The sampler must now determine the stoping depths which have a bearing on the mineworkers&#x2019; contractual remuneration. The figure furnished directly determines the mineworkers remuneration. So important is this work that they require nothing less than a Junior Certificate as minimum qualification for it. Take the case of the ventilation officers. They measure the temperature; <span class="col_3839-3840" refersTo="page_0407"/>they must measure the air velocity, as well as the humidity. They are in control and must see to it that there is proper fresh air ventilation. He must also take dust samples. This directly affects the health of the mineworker. And now we know, surely. Surely we are no longer children or idealists. We stand with our feet planted firmly in the practical life. Now surely we know that what is going on here must ultimately lead to friction among the mineworkers. Surely we know that it will disturb the peace and quiet. Surely we know that it will slice through the entire spectrum of industrial peace and stability. This is the case and members of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, who have nothing to do with the ventilation officer and with samplers and mine recorders, are dissatisfied. There is bitter dissatisfaction among them because this procedure and this departure from policy results in a new sort of friction being created among the people who have to work together under it &#x2026;</p>

<p>I would say deliberately. Of course it is deliberate. After all, we know their policy. I say that I pride myself in being correct when I say that the mineworkers&#x2019; corps who belong to the mineworkers&#x2019; trade unions which can lay just claim to being correct in their demands and their statements when they say that the peace and quiet among the mineworkers will be disturbed. Consequently I am convinced that section 77 of the Industrial Reconciliation Act should be made applicable here. This is the only request I have at the moment and I am addressing this request on behalf of all my colleagues who represent constituencies where mineworkers form a major portion of the electorate, and I am addressing it to the Minister so that he may be so kind as to furnish us with a reply. Now I have done with this matter.</p>

<p>I want to raise another minor matter which results from the Budget. I see in the Budget that considerably more money is being made available to the Minister of Water Affairs. I am delighted by this and it brings me to the statement I want to make, namely, the principle in terms of the Act of 1967 that the distribution of water is vested in the State. Water will always be our problem here in South Africa. That is general knowledge. Experience has shown over the years that every commission we have appointed to inquire into drought conditions was in this position that when the report appeared the drought had ceased, and then nothing further was said about the report before another serious drought set in. This is an historic fact. Droughts have already hit the Republic of South Africa hard, and will in future do so in a more tangible shape. What I am going to say now is the result of my calculations after a very intensive and protracted study. Between 1929 and 1966 the losses of the Republic of South Africa in monetary terms in the shape of cattle, market delays owing to animals being in a poor condition, the cessation of farming activities, subsidies, low stock birth-rate percentages as a result of poor condition, can be put in the region of R2,000 million. Cattle grazing regions comprise most of the surface area of South Africa. There are, according to the Du Toit Commission of 1956 on drought conditions, thousands of farms in the cattle grazing regions which are uneconomic as a result of inadequate surface area and a too low carrying capacity. These uneconomic farms can all be converted into economic units if water can be brought to them&#x2014;not only drinking water, but water in another form as well. The time is passed for good when we were able to escape droughts by driving cattle to other regions. We must take into consideration the fact that the population pressure on meat as a form of food and source of animal protein will gradually increase more rapidly. This is already a factor which we have to take into account; i.e. that the stock factor will have to be included in our economy as one of the currency earners in the place of an eventual&#x2014;I do not know when this will happen&#x2014;decreasing supply of raw products. Now I want to say this. The old policy that stored, channellized water and the lands associated with this should be allocated to people for the purpose of using it as a means of settling socio-economically disrupted individuals must definitely be rejected now as far as the utilization of our water is concerned. Our water and land is too expensive for such restricted socioeconomic objectives. I want to state that the laying out of more compact settlements, with the accompanying high infrastructure costs, the ever-decreasing land productivity, increasing production costs as a result of the land becoming waterlogged and water becoming brack, and the increasing need for fertilization of the soil, and also as a result of far reaching socio-economic and educational factors, is not the reply to the question of how we should utilize our water. More compact settlements as points of production have not yet supplied the answer to economic fodder production for which a demand arises as a result of droughts. Our customary methods of limiting stock losses as a result of droughts, which consist of moving cattle, of deepening boreholes, of transporting fodder, of imposing water restrictions on towns, are ineffectual and must be regarded as such. Up to 45 per cent of the dry lucern which is being transported from the growth point where the lucern is produced, a few hundred miles to where it is offloaded is lost. Now I want to say this. We have the Orange River project, a wonderful project, by means of which more or less 500,000 morgen will eventually be brought under irrigation. This is a colossal and permanent project which will have such a decisive effect on our entire economic and socio-economic structure in all its facets that we dare not make a mistake here. Now I just want to mention two examples to you. Instead of laying out more compact <span class="col_3841-3842" refersTo="page_0408"/>settlements and developing expensive infrastructures at those settlements, and then being saddled with the tremendous problems which may arise, as we see to-day at existing compact settlements&#x2014;and I know them all because I have visited them&#x2014;we must adopt a different approach. Suppose there is 500,000 morgen which can be irrigated, and we take 50 main towns in South Africa, in the cattle regions. We can draw the rainfall line. It is not my task to do so now. But take 50 towns in our cattle grazing regions. We can then supply each town with 10,000 morgen surrounding it which can be irrigated. We can create a growth point there. The transportation of the water to those points is no longer a problem. America has pipelines extending 250,000 miles, and Australia also has long pipelines. Water is the only raw product which can be transported inexpensively from its source in order to create growth points over a distance. If we can bring 10,000 morgen around 50 towns under irrigation we can, if one calculates that one morgen of irrigation land can only bring R100 per year into circulation, bring a turnover of R1 million per year into circulation in that town and its environs.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>No. You do not understand what I am saying now. There will be a subsequent opportunity. With such a distribution of water we would be doing justice to the principle of a profit-making society and environment, and we would be getting away from the old tendency of a growth point developing where a raw material is developed or mined, which subsequently becomes a metropolitan area where evils arise and where, as the evils develop, the burden on the State of combating these evils increases. This has devastating socio-economic and socio-educational consequences for our population. I want to conclude. I maintain that this will enable us to derive the maximum benefit from our natural animal feeding areas by bringing water as close as possible to the areas where fodder can be as closely available as possible. This will cause dying towns in the Karoo and in our cattle grazing regions to revive. There are existing infrastructures which we can develop. This will recreate cultural centres. The socioeconomic effects would be phenomenal, almost immeasureable. This would create growth points. This will enable us to break loose from the centralization tendency which is so inclined to develop into an economic structure which tends to become more complicated.</p>

<p>As an alternative I want to suggest, in my last minute, 500.000 morgen of land, 25.000 farms each of which can be provided with 20 morgen of irrigation land. That means 25.000 fodder banks with a decreasing fertilization costs programme because the animal is there to supply the fertilization. There are an endless number of rotation farming possibilities, all of which will be under strict control and instruction methods. This will bring about greater stability.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that these few thoughts which I have expressed to-day in regard to the utilization and distribution of our water are in general terms only, but there is one thing I have established: Firstly: It is definitely implementable and, secondly, money cannot be an object here. I ask myself the question, what do we in South Africa lay down as being our maximum&#x003F; Is our maximum to become as rich as possible or is our maximum to subject as many people as possible to as few evil-forming circumstances, i.e. a chance of survival&#x003F; My choice is not to become rich, but to bring about a distribution.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>The matter which the hon. member for Carletonville raised in regard to Bantu ventilation officers and samplers on the mines is of such a nature that it deserves our serious attention, and that is why I deem it necessary to reply immediately. The labour agreement which that hon member mentioned with reference to those circulars, is one of those labour agreements which at the outset appear to be very innocent and which can often be motivated and justified by the mining concerns in question as essential regulations, but it is that type of labour agreement which, although it initially appears to be innocent, ultimately has repercussions and causes dissatisfaction among coworkers in such an industry. This unrest to which the hon. member referred is not an exaggeration. Nor is it a feeling which arose recently. This is a matter which was brought to my attention last year already. Last year the hon. member for Bethal brought this matter to my attention because there are mines in his constituency which have gone over to Bantu ventilation officers and samplers. The hon. member for Bethal then presented a petition from nine of those ventilation officers and samplers to me in which they expressed their objections to this change-over. I asked my Department to send inspectors to those mines in the Eastern Transvaal and to investigate the complaints which had been submitted on the basis of this petition. The inspectors of my Department paid visits to the mines and returned with the report that this experiment, as it is being termed, was apparently not introduced there without consultation with the employees concerned and with their trade unions. But at the same time it appeared from that investigation that there were nevertheless workers in that specific group, the ventilation officers and samplers, who felt unhappy about this arrangement; that they in fact felt uneasy about how it was going to affect them as a group in future. I came across this unrest a month or two afterwards when I addressed a public meeting at the request of the hon. member for Bethal in his constituency at Evander. On that occasion, towards the end of last year, I was asked by persons present at <span class="col_3843-3844" refersTo="page_0409"/>the meeting what the Government could do in this connection to curb the growing unrest there. I quite rightly pointed out to them that the finding of our investigation had been that the employees concerned had in fact been consulted and had apparently agreed to it, and that their trade union, the Underground Officials&#x2019; Association, had apparently also been consulted in this connection and had apparently also agreed. But on that occasion, that evening at Evander, I nevertheless gave them the assurance that if it appeared likely to me that this arrangement was in fact going to prejudice the position of the white workers and that it was in fact going to disrupt the industrial peace, I would not hesitate to take steps in terms of the legislative powers which I have. This same dissatisfaction made its appearance at the beginning of this Session when a deputation from the labour group on my side, under the leadership of the hon. member for Brakpan, came to consult me in regard to this same difficulty, a difficulty which then was in fact difficult to determine, because on the one hand one has a group of employees, the ventilation officers and samplers who have apparently agreed to this and even their trade union has not objected to it. I then pointed out to them that it was difficult for me to go over the head of such a trade union, but I nevertheless stated that I would in fact keep a careful eye on the matter in future. Two weeks ago a deputation from the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union saw me when I was in Pretoria, a deputation from the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, together with other workers in the industry who are affected by this, and on that occasion they brought a different aspect very clearly to the fore. Whereas the workers who had formerly approached me by way of the petition and also at the meeting at Evander had in fact pointed out how it could prejudice them as a group and that that work could ultimately be taken over completely by black labour&#x2014;for as the Blacks enter the Whites leave, and in the end it will become an entirely black industry&#x2014;the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union then raised another matter which carried great weight with me. They pointed out how the conduct of these Bantu ventilation officers and samplers was irritating the white mineworkers, the ordinary mineworkers; the rock breakers and the contract workers. As the hon. member for Carletonville quite rightly said, the rock which they have blasted must be measured by the black workers the next day, and there have been cases, about which the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union have informed me, where arguments have taken place between the white mineworker and the Bantu sampler in regard to the way in which he takes the sample. I have even been told that some of the Bantu samplers do not even know how to take a sample properly and then the white mineworker must show him how to measure the amount he (the white mineworker) has dynamited. They maintain that this is a matter which is now causing friction among the white mineworkers and these Bantu samplers. As a result of the representations of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, which were in support of previous allegations, I then felt that this was a matter which deserved serious attention, because this is a labour agreement which could affect the industrial peace in the mining industry. If the white mineworkers are going to become irritated about this matter, if it is going to cause friction and is going to lead to strikes, then it would, after all, be very irresponsible of us if we were knowingly to allow the present state of affairs to continue. I now want to inform the House about what I then did. I said to the deputation that I would not only go into this matter, I would take steps. Subsequently I wrote to the President of the Chamber of Mines and brought this matter to his attention and asked him, as he had done in the past, to co-operate in restoring the arrangement which had previously applied; to restore the previous dispensation so that we could eliminate the difficulty of industrial unrest, and I hope and trust that I will obtain this co-operation from the President and the Chamber of Mines. I do not hesitate to say here that since I have been occupying this post, first as Deputy Minister of Labour and Mines, and now for the past three years in my present capacity, I can testify to the best cooperation between the mine authorities and myself, and I hope and trust that the mine authorities will be of assistance in this connection as well. The hon. member for Carletonville was quite right in saying that we have authorization in terms of section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act (the work reservation provision) to order an investigation by the Industrial Tribunal into this matter, and if the recommendation of the Industrial Tribunal is such, to come forward with a work determination. But I hope it will not be necessary to act in that way. I discussed this matter with the Minister of Mines, who agreed with me that we must afford the mining chiefs the opportunity of regulating their affairs in this regard. We should like to afford them every opportunity of doing so. I hope that when my Vote comes up for discussion in a few weeks&#x2019; time, I will then perhaps be in a position to give hon. members the assurance that a satisfactory arrangement has in fact been made in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want on this occasion to react to the speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. However, I just want to make a single reference to it because it was simply a repetition of previous speeches made by him; it was a repetition of a speech which we heard earlier on in this Session, but I just want to refer to one of the statements made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, because it has a bearing on what I have just said in regard to this mining matter. During the course of his criticism of us and of the application of our work reservation policy, our labour policy, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3845-3846" refersTo="page_0410"/>We find that Whites are being replaced by non-Whites in various industries under a Government which has no policy to deal with the situation.</block>

<p>I hope the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will realize that this Government does in fact know how to deal with situations of this nature, as it has also done in the past. I do not want to elaborate on this any further except to make this one statement, on the basis of which I think any country and any Government&#x2019;s labour policy can be tested&#x2014;this is the decisive factor&#x2014;and that is whether or not strikes occur in a country. That is the predominant factor on the basis of which this Government can be tested. To my mind the true test is whether strikes are occurring among the white workers, or even among the nonwhite workers. If one&#x2019;s Whites were to feel threatened, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his side are so eager to make one believe, if they were to feel threatened in their field of activity, then one would after all not be able to have this industrial peace which is prevailing in the country. If the white workers in this country, with this phenomenal development which we are experiencing, felt that they had an unsympathetic government, then we would after all not be able to have had this industrial peace which we do have in South Africa. It is a fact that we are providing more work for non-Whites and causing them to be employed than was previously the case. It is true that there are to-day more brown and black people who are doing work which was previously done by Whites; this is a fact which I do not want to try to argue away. On the contrary, it is this Government which is seeing to it that opportunities for employment are being created for them, whether in their own areas or elsewhere. This is not a fact which we want to argue away. Sir, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said here: &#x201C;So far skilled jobs have been limited to the Whites in South Africa&#x201D;. But that is totally incorrect. What are the facts&#x003F; The facts are that in 1967 &#x2014;that is the latest year for which we have figures&#x2014;we had 158,000 white artisans in this country, but opposed to that we had 22,000 non-white artisans in the Republic which after all is a clear indication that there are also opportunities for non-Whites to do skilled labour. And what about the opportunities which non-Whites are being afforded to do skilled and semi-skilled labour under this Government in its own State machine&#x003F; What about the non-Whites I have employed in my Department of Coloured Affairs as teachers, as school principals, as inspectors and as educational planners&#x003F; Is that not skilled work&#x003F; That is why it is so nonsensical of the Opposition to make this allegation, but it is not only nonsensical, it is also a disservice to South Africa&#x2019;s image abroad to try to give out here that we begrudge the non-Whites a place in the sun. No, we are so reactionary, so inhuman, that we do not want to afford them an opportunity of making a decent living. By making such allegations they are doing South Africa a disservice.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to conclude by saying that this Government&#x2019;s achievements in the sphere of labour can be tested against the predominant fact that this large measure of industrial peace we are experiencing, an industrial peace which has been effected by on the one hand affording the non-Whites more and better opportunities of employment than they have ever had before, and at the same time on the other giving the Whites the assurance that their continued existence and their future safety is assured. Therein lies the key to the success of the labour policy of this side. That is why I want to say this to the United Party, since they are coming forward with a motion of no-confidence in this Government, that the industrial peace which is prevailing in South Africa is the most important item of proof that there is confidence in this Government, and as long as this Government remains in power, that token of confidence will remain.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I had intended suggesting to the hon. member for Carletonville that the first part of his speech could better have been addressed to the hon. the Minister of Labour than to this side of the House. I felt that as a miners&#x2019; representative, he was used to handling dynamite and that perhaps he had become too familiar with it. He set off his own Minister to answer him There was one part of his speech, the latter half, which impressed me and on which I want to congratulate him. That is the eulogy which he gave to the late member for Albany, Mr. Tom Bowker, who year in and year out, as all on both sides of the House will testify, advocated the Orange River Scheme. He continually advocated this. He almost, can I say, ate, drank and slept with this scheme. If anybody should be given credit for having thought out this scheme, it should be given to that fine old gentleman, Mr. Tom Bowker.</p>

<p>I want to refer to another aspect, the financial aspect. I do not want to create the impression that I am attacking the Stock Exchange, nor do I advocate the direct State control of that Exchange. However, I do feel that the hon. the Minister of Finance, in his Budget, has not in any way tried to help the ordinary man in the street. He has made great play over the last few years of the control of inflation. In fact, the battle cry of the Finance Department in this country is &#x201C;inflation&#x201D;. But, is the hon. the Minister protecting the ordinary, humble man in the street&#x003F; Is he helping him to save&#x003F; For years we on this side of the House have pointed out that the hon. the Minister was not helping a man to save. In fact, it did not pay anybody to save except in enormous sums of money, because of the heavy tax upon savings. The unfortunate man in the street is exposed to great temptations. Because the hon. the Minister has failed to appreciate his plight and has failed to come <span class="col_3847-3848" refersTo="page_0411"/>to his rescue, this unfortunate man is unable to find a haven for his savings which will safeguard him against depreciation of money and the inflation widespread throughout the country. The hon. the Minister has not given thought, or if he has, he has not produced his thoughts to us, as to how this unfortunate man must ensure his savings apart from coming forward with a 6 per cent tax-free investment, and similar suggestions. He knows that the 6 per cent is going to be eroded by the 2 per cent, or more, monetary depreciation which is taking place. I am sure that nobody could possibly walk the streets of Johannesburg or Durban, and less so in Cape Town (perhaps because there is such a large number of new buildings), without noticing the enormous increase in financial institutions in this country. I use the word &#x201C;enormous&#x201D; in the full knowledge of what a serious word it is to use in this respect. On every street corner is a new bank or a new finance house. Banks of different kinds have sprung up. When I go for lunch in Durban, I find that, along my usual walk, four banks have sprung up in the last year.</p>

<p>I am complaining about it, because these banks are staffed by large numbers of individuals who live, and many live exceptionally well, on the profits of these banks, but these banks produce nothing. These men are living by manipulating money; they do not produce anything. Productivity, as we are constantly told, produces something. &#x201C;Get your workmen to produce more! &#x201D; we are told. But these people are unproductive workers and there are so many of them. I can well understand that money must be made to work because, after all, it must be used to make more money. The hon. the Minister cannot tell me that money is being used to a productive purpose by having large numbers of finance houses. It means more hands to which a little gold can stick as it moves along; it means more mouths to feed. I feel that there should be some control over the number of finance houses which are now appearing.</p>

<p>Both. The hon. the Minister is not doing his duty in this respect. Where do we see the misfortunes of the inflationary process&#x003F; Mostly in the stockmarket. If you look at the figures of the enormous increase in the value of shares as a whole, it is a false appreciation. It is, in other words, an acute inflation; an acute inflation in making the values of articles more expensive and increasing the cost of living. It also brings about a depreciation in the possibility of saving. I think that we must go back a little in the history of the Stock Exchange. In brief, the Stock Exchange started as a street market at the corner of Simmonds Street and Commissioner Street in Johannesburg. There were other similar markets in Cape Town, Durban and Pietermaritzburg. This market gradually became more wealthy and it accumulated power. It came to be regarded as the chief financial market of South Africa. Who gave it the power which it has&#x003F; The public gave it that power because they accepted its decisions, its judgments and its honesty. The public, by that I mean the Government, this Parliament, having given the power should be enabled and should, if it is considered necessary, exercise its right to withdraw that power. The Stock Exchange exists by the permission of the people of the country. I think we are right when we ask whether that power is being used for the benefit of the people of the country as a whole. Does everybody reasonably benefit by taking a share in this market&#x003F; I make bold to say that although this Stock Exchange has rules, these rules do not meet the present situation.</p>

<p>I refer particularly to listings. Listed stock on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is the backbone of South Africa&#x2019;s economy. Everything centres towards that Exchange and that Exchange should so act that the citizens receive from it fair and just treatment. I would not for one moment suggest that the Stock Exchange does not act within the laws of the country; far be it for me to make any suggestion of that type. But I say that they have not fulfilled the public duty of ensuring that every citizen has the same right when it comes to dealings on that Exchange. It is very far from that. The right to a listing on the Stock Exchange is an immensely valuable right. But it is a right which springs from the people. The people have a right to look to the Stock Exchange to protect their rights, and above all to the Minister of Finance to see that those rights are carefully protected. When it comes to listings, I maintain that the Stock Exchange is failing in its duty. It is not giving to the citizens of the country a fair deal.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member remains awake. He has had a good sleep this afternoon. I noticed that. I suggest that, firstly, we should consider how a listing comes about. How does the Stock Exchange give a listing&#x003F; There are three ways. The first is by private placing; the second is by way of an open bid; and the third is by an offer of sale. Those are the three ways, namely: (1) Private placings; (2) tender; and (3) public offer. There are combinations of these. They are not all necessarily the same. As far as I have been able to make out (it is not always easy to get reliable information) the Stock Exchange grants a listing on condition that a certain number of the shares will be distributed to a certain set number of stockbrokers or more. A certain number of the shares must be available <span class="col_3849-3850" refersTo="page_0412"/>to the clients of those brokers. In other words, the public gains access and the Exchange will not grant a listing if less than 30 per cent of those shares is not made available to the brokers. In other words, 70 per cent of the shares which are going to get a listing are not necessarily placed direct to the public, because one can regard going through a broker as an opportunity to sell to the public. Private placing, on the other hand, means that the shares at a certain fixed price, which is made known, will be sold to a certain limited number of people. Now, as we know, kissing goes by favour. That is quite common with listings. The private placings which can comprise 70 per cent of the shares which finally get to the public, are sold at a fixed rate and donated sometimes to customers, sometimes to customers of the issuing bank and sometimes to employees. There are various kinds of favours. The private placing is used more and more to create, as it were, a little circle all of whom share the profits. When I apply for a listing I can give it to my hon. friend in front of me, and when he in turn has a listing which he wants to bring forth, he hands it over to, say, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture. All come into the privileged group. But the fact remains that 70 per cent of those shares do not reach the public at the quoted price. That is the point. That is the way it is done. The percentage quoted by me, namely 30 per cent, may be wrong; at any rate the majority of the shares do not reach the public at the quoted price.</p>

<p>Do you think that is wrong&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I most certainly think that it is wrong. The public have given the Stock Exchange the right to make a listing. They should see that the public get a fair deal when that listing is made. That is the point. I am pleading for the ordinary man in the street who wants to invest his money. By the time he can start buying shares which come on the market at, say, 100 cents, it is often the case that within a few hours of their having been quoted they are up to 180 cents, and that sort of thing. That is not giving the man in the street a fair deal. The Stock Exchange should see that the total number of shares are put before the public as early as possible and not first donated to a limited group of people who will sit holding the shares until they have gone up. This is familiarly known as &#x201C;stagging&#x201D;. I have met several people who told me that they were holding such shares for &#x201C;stagging&#x201D;. Anybody who looks through the <i>Financial Mail</i> or through the listed stocks and shares will see that shares which come on the market theoretically at 100 cents never reach the public until they have risen to 130 cents, 150 cents and perhaps even to 200 cents or 300 cents. Somebody has made a killing. Somebody has made a fortune. There are immense fortunes being made today. These fortunes are being made overnight and the Stock Exchange is a party to it. I do not believe that the Stock Exchange Committee do not know this. I feel that it is a gross injustice to the man in the street and it is something which the hon. the Minister should take note of and redress. That is the point. With these private placings immense fortunes are being made by sitting down and waiting for the Stock Market to rise in a few days, or even a month or a year. If those shares were to go up of their own accord, having been on the market for years, or if the other shares which had not been made available to the public were not allowed to be sold, there might be something to be said for it. But these shares come to the public market after having first passed through hands which sit and wait for the price to go up. There are these privileged persons; as I said, kissing goes by favour. Large sums accrue by passing favours from one to the other. This Minister should stop this defrauding of the ordinary man in the street. The Stock Exchange started as a market. It got its powers from the people, from the man in the street. He accepts the Stock Exchange as a market, but he does not get a fair deal. The share is inflated before the man in the street has any hope at all. I think the hon. the Minister must take some steps. I would advocate that there shall be no retention of shares, that there shall be no private placing. The Stock Exchange is a public market. Its strength comes from the public and it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s duty to see that the public is protected.</p>

<p>I wish to turn to another matter, namely the spread of mergers and takeovers. In this particular time in this country and in this world not one single man possessing a share can feel that it is his own and that he is safe. Not one man can be certain that to-morrow he will not wake up to find that the shares to which he had been looking to supply him with a living for his old years, have become valueless for the purpose. The giant companies of this country are going to be in danger very soon. It does not always require a giant to take over another giant. Small companies are taking over giant companies. It has been prophesied that in 50 years there will only be about 750 companies in the whole word, so quickly is this merger tendency spreading. The national and international competition, which is so valuable to any capitalistic country, will disappear. I know the hon. the Minister thinks, &#x201C;Well, we have the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act&#x201D;. But it is not going to control this spreading of mergers. It can do so up to a certain point. There are giants like the General Electric Company of Great Britain and the English Electric. When they joined, the total capital ran into millions. The excuse given for the Government agreeing to their merging, was that it was the only way they could face foreign competition. The movement of mergers goes towards nationalization, At the present moment the mergers are tending to form a national agglomeration of companies. It will lead to national control of certain <span class="col_3851-3852" refersTo="page_0413"/>business; however, not by the people, but by the directors of these companies. It will go further, and it is going further. Companies in other countries will merge with companies in this country. The control of companies will pass out of the hands of this country. What can the Government do then&#x003F; I am not advocating that mergers should be stopped. I do not know enough about it, but I do know that it can leave the ordinary man in the street with no assets whatever. If he wakes up in the morning, they might be gone. No company is safe. The small firms are using the money of the firms they take over to buy those firms. Has the Minister taken any steps&#x003F; Not as far as we know. We have heard that a Companies Bill is going to be introduced. It may contain something. Other countries are taking steps. The Securities and Exchange Committee of the New York Stock Exchange is at the present moment prosecuting the biggest broking firm in the world, because it sold with one hand to one lot of clients and bought with the other hand for another group of dents. It withheld from those to whom it sold, information which the Securities and Exchange Committee believed that it should have made known to the people it was advising to buy.</p>

<p>In the London Stock Exchange the Bank of England has stepped in forcibly and placed one of its deputy governors at the disposal of the Stock Exchange in order to produce a code for control of mergers. They hope that they will be able to control by persuasion and voluntary action. The Securities and Exchange Committee of the New York Stock Exchange makes no bones about it; it takes legal action, because it does not believe in voluntary action. Great banks like Morgan have become involved in this business. They stayed out for a time until they found that the upstarts, the people who could manipulate money, handle other people&#x2019;s money, use it to buy what belongs to those people and to forcibly take over shares from the ordinary man in the street. All this is taking place, and I am asking the hon. the Minister what he is doing about it and what he is intending to do.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this afternoon we had the interesting phenomenon here of a senior member of the United Party attacking our financial institutions. He started with the banks and complained about the establishment of new banks. He did not want new banks to be established. To me the establishment of a new bank is a sign of the development of our country.</p>

<p>He also complained about financial institutions getting too many powers. From that he proceeded to attack the stock exchange. He said their rules and regulations were not strict enough and that they allowed things which they ought not to allow. I do not want to argue about these matters. These things may possibly be true. I do want to say, however, that we have always had great confidence in our financial institutions. Similarly we have always had great confidence in our stock exchange. It is interesting that over the past number of years Afrikaans-speaking people have started to show a great deal of interest in the stock exchange and have started to share in the trade in stocks and shares, which is so flourishing at the present time.</p>

<p>In connection with share issues the hon. member for Durban (Central) made, for him, a very important point, i.e. that the market was being manipulated and that certain shares were being held back. I just want to tell him that in most cases when that is done, it is fair to hold such shares back. Old shareholders are given the opportunity to take up certain shares. Those people helped to make the company strong, and I think it is only right that such people who helped to build up the company should have the right and should be given the opportunity when there are new issues of shares, to take up of those shares. Moreover, it is not always so that the price of shares will go up on the stock exchange. It is also possible that the price of shares may decrease the day they are quoted on the stock exchange. This being so those people are in fact running a risk when they buy shares at the price of issue. For that reason I do not want to agree with the hon. member for Durban (Central). I think he made a very risky statement.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the statement made by the hon. member for Walmer, i.e. that we could solve virtually all our farming problems if the Government would only grant a subsidy on interest.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<p>He never said that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, he intimated that that was the major problem of our farmers, i.e. that rates of interest were too high. [Interjections.] In any case, he said this was a very big problem of our farmers. Sir, interest is a big problem, of course, but over the past few years our Government has done a great deal in an attempt to alleviate the interest burden. My contention is that what the Government has done has helped. Perhaps it has not been possible for it to do enough. I am convinced, however, that even if the interest burden were to be alleviated altogether, many of our farmers would still find the going hard. To-day we heard various reasons here, such as the business acumen of farmers and the economic units, which have a bearing on the situation. For that reason I say that it is very superficial really to want to suggest that our farmers would flourish if the interest burden were to be alleviated. In spite of this heavy interest burden a large percentage of our farmers are still very keen to farm. They even see their way clear to buy additional farms. I want to suggest that farming still is a very attractive profession to-day and that there still are many people who would like to be farmers. They are even prepared to invest a great deal of capital in farming.</p>

<p><span class="col_3853-3854" refersTo="page_0414"/>I should also like to express a few ideas in connection with the financing of our farmers. The Government has two ways in which it makes money available to our farmers, i.e. through the Land Bank and through the Department of Agricultural Credit. I regard the Land Bank as a wonderful institution which is rendering a major service to our farmers. I should like to see the functions of the Land Bank being extended. I should like to see all long-term financing of farmers being undertaken by the Lank Bank some time in the future.</p>

<p>That is what the hon. member for Walmer said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then he, too, was right. The Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure also has a very important function, and the function I envisage it performing in future is that of distress relief and distress aid to farmers, and in addition to its other functions, such as the buying up of land, exercising control over State-owned land, etc., I see its function chiefly in the granting of distress aid. In addition I should prefer long-term assistance to go through one channel, i.e. the Land Bank. Furthermore I am of the opinion that we are still doing too little as regards after-care to our farmers after we have assisted them I should say that if the Government has helped a farmer with cheap money, it may rightly and in all fairness impose certain obligations on that farmer. It may tell him to plan his farm and to adhere to that farming plan. The Government may cause regular visits to be paid to that farm in order to ascertain whether the plan is being executed. In that way the farmer can become an economic one. For this purpose we shall naturally need many more agri-economists. I think it has become very necessary for us to do more in this direction. We must provide farmers with after-care after we have assisted them.</p>

<p>To-day I want to deliver a plea on behalf of a certain group of farmers who have really been left in the lurch under our new dispensation. You will be surprised, Sir, if you knew how many small farmers there still are in our country. I am speaking of men who farm on small pieces of land and who are making a good living. In my constituency there are many of them. They are people who work hard and who make do without additional labourers. In the past these people practically were completely independent economically and they hardly ever approached the Government for assistance. Often in times of hardship they could make do without outside assistance. Seeing that we so often speak of economic units, I want to make a plea that we should not overlook our small farmers. I know they are a disappearing group in our agricultural industry, but in spite of that they are a very important group. They are still there and I want to ask that special attention should be given to these small farmers. When they ask for assistance, I trust they will be treated sympathetically. Many of them are farming on small farms, but they are hard-working and they are prepared to put everything into their farming undertakings.</p>

<p>Another point I should like to raise in connection with assistance to our farmers relates to the granting of short-term assistance. I was very pleased to learn while assistance was being given recently that a considerable share of such assistance was being canalized through our co-operative societies. I have said that financial assistance should in the main be given through the agency of the Land Bank, assistance which I would call normal assistance, and I should like to see short-term assistance being given as far as possible through the Land Bank and then through the co-operative societies. The co-operative societies are extremely suitable bodies to undertake this kind of financing. The directors know their people; they know where they can assist, and they are able to recover this money on behalf of the State in a very easy way as they may attach the crops of their members. Our cooperative societies are of inestimable value to our farmers, and I feel that as far as financing is concerned, the Government can make far more use of their services.</p>

<p>We have had a very interesting Budget. I want to say that the Budget owes a great deal to the report of the commission of inquiry. I just want to address a word of congratulation to the Franzsen Commission. Within a short time&#x2014;I think one year&#x2014;they produced an interim report which is going to be of tremendous value to our country. It was possible to take over and implement a whole number of the recommendations straightaway. I am particularly interested in their recommendations concerning the financial relations with the provinces. I know the hon. the Minister of Finance did not see his way clear to accept those recommendations at this stage. They recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that the rights of provincial authorities to levy personal taxation and income taxation on individuals should be withdrawn and that provincial authorities should share in the revenue from taxation collected by the Central Government on the income of individuals, as was already the case with company taxation. This is a very important recommendation. I want to address an appeal to the hon. the Minister of Finance. When we receive the report of the Schumann Commission he must give serious consideration to introducing this change. I realize that that would mean a diminishing of the powers of the provincial councils, but it will bring us important advantages, and for that reason I am drawing attention to this matter to-day. Such a change would have various benefits.</p>

<p>It would bring us uniformity as regards taxation in the provinces. Every person would pay the same tax, irrespective of his place of residence. It would bring uniformity as regards fiscal policy and it would mean that <span class="col_3855-3856" refersTo="page_0415"/>more use could be made of fiscal policy in order to control inflation. It would also be easier to take fiscal measures. It would bring about a saving in administrative costs and labour. Where we have five income tables today, we would then have one only which would be applicable to the whole country. The announcing of our taxes would be expedited as there would be no need for us to wait on Budgets passed by the different provinces.</p>

<p>I want to suggest that this way of collecting taxes centrally and subsequently distributing them to the provinces would be very helpful in promoting economic stability in our country.</p>

<p>To-day I do not want to refer to the unfair incidence of other taxes. We have had this problem of the unfair incidence of taxes for a very long time. I have in mind divisional council tax, for instance, and I am looking forward to the day when everybody in the Republic will be taxed on a uniform basis.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the statement made by the hon. member for North Rand, i.e. that the National Party and the Government were forgetting about the poor man and did not use this Budget to do something for the poor man. Here I want to address a special word of gratitude to the hon. the Minister of Finance for what he did do in this connection. I want to start with the R1 given to pensioners. This R1 is of great importance to those people. It represents 3 per cent on the pension paid to them and it is more or less equal to the depreciation in the value of our money. Therefore this keeps the pensioner on even terms. If we compare this to what pensioners received 21 years ago, it is a considerable amount, R33 as against R10.</p>

<p>Something else I am very pleased about is the concession in connection with the means test, i.e. raising it from R20 to R40. This is very important to the pensioners. This enables them to carry on doing productive work. It has always bothered me that a pensioner had to sit at home without his doing any work or otherwise forfeit his pension. This R40 which he will now be able to earn, will mean that he will be able to make a better living and it will also be useful to the productivity of our country. Civil Service pensioners are also going to be in a better position after this Budget. This pension is increased to R100 for a married person and R50 for a single person. In my opinion we have not yet expressed sufficient gratitude for these concessions made to our indigent people who need this money so badly.</p>

<p>I think I would be ungrateful if I did not refer to the concessions made to citrus farmers, especially as I myself am a citrus farmer. Last year the Minister of Agriculture referred to the special problems with which certain industries had to battle and he proposed special measures. The citrus industry was selected for assistance by means of those special measures. I am particularly appreciative of the manner in which assistance is being rendered to the citrus industry. This assistance does not merely consist of subsidies, but is being given in order to help the industry solve its problems. I have in mind, in the first place, the processing industry which produces the fruit juices and segments. Our production of citrus is increasing and our <i>per capita</i> consumption in the Republic is of the highest in the world, but the fact remains that we cannot consume all our fruit locally nor can we export it profitably. For that reason an ever increasing percentage goes to the factories. From 1959 to 1968 exports increased by 56 per cent, fresh fruit consumption by 213 per cent and factory production by 318 per cent. This merely goes to show how important factories are to the citrus industry. That amount of R200,000 or 4&#x00BD; cents given to the factories, is very essential for enabling them to compete on overseas markets. For that reason I am saying that these contributions which the Government is making is being made where contributions are really needed.</p>

<p>Let us examine the overseas prices and the devaluation losses suffered by the farmers. Farmers did not suffer those losses through any fault of their own but as a result of the devaluation of the British pound, and the Minister quite rightly decided to compensate those losses. The Cirtus Board stated the amount of their losses because of devaluation, and in my opinion they calculated those figures in a very fair way. If they wanted to be unfair they would perhaps have claimed the full amount of R1 1/4 million made available by the Minister, but they did not do so. They claimed only R336,000, i.e. 75 per cent of the real losses, and this the Government compensated.</p>

<p>Another problem with which citrus farmers are faced is the very high shipping charges. This is costing the citrus industry a great deal of money. The State enters into the agreement with the shipping lines. The citrus industry is consulted, but the final agreement is entered into in the interest not only of the citrus industry but also of all exporters and importers in the Republic. For that reason it is in the interest of the entire country. But now it happens that much cheaper ships are available during the citrus season and the Citrus Board calculated that if they were not concerned in the conference shipping lines, they would be able to effect large savings. They would be able to effect a saving of R1,356,000 if they could charter the cheapest ships available. That would mean plus-minus 7 cents per carton to each exporter. This is an important factor and I think that this may probably be the motivation behind the decision of the Cabinet and the Minister of Finance to give further assistance to the citrus industry. This amount of R1.6 million, for which we are very grateful, will, in my opinion, go a long way in giving assistance also as far as this matter is concerned. Before resuming my seat, I <span class="col_3857-3858" refersTo="page_0416"/>should like to point out that this matter of charges will continue to give us difficulty in future, and it will probably be necessary for the Cabinet to consider this matter another time. The best thing would be if the tariffs could be decreased, of course, because in that case it would not cost the State anything and the shipping lines would have to see how they could make do. Otherwise I think it will happen again in future that the State will have to render assistance as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>I also represent a constituency with a very strong farming community, and therefore I should like to welcome, in this late stage of the debate, the comments of the hon. member for Humansdorp. I feel, however, that farming matters have been discussed thoroughly in this House and I do not want to waste the time of the House by discussing them further.</p>

<p>The Budget has received a great deal of praise here on various levels, but criticism has also been expressed, criticism of a trivial nature, to my mind. A few days ago I came across these winged words of the revered American President, Abraham Lincoln, and I should like to read them, because I think his words will form a very good basis on which we can test this Budget. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer. You cannot further brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn. You cannot build character and courage by taking away a man&#x2019;s initiative and independence. You cannot help a man permanently by doing for him what he should do for himself.</block>

<p>I think these are very important principles in terms of which we can test this Budget. Allow me to say a few words about this aspect. In the first place, the principle of thrift has been encouraged by the Government as well as by the Minister of Finance for many years. We think of the compulsory savings which have been brought about through the years. We think of the savings which the pension benefits resulting from this Budget are going to bring about. We think of the fact that more money will come into circulation as a result of the greater availability of money since people will be paying less tax, and that is now at the stage before they have to make their purchases. We are giving a man the opportunity now to pay his debts and we are giving him the opportunity to save. This purchase tax, the way I see it, is going to teach people to save. They will think twice before buying an article which they can possibly do without. This will lead to greater saying, because they will have more money available. Those who are financially stronger are also getting their share in this Budget. The Opposition says this is a rich man&#x2019;s budget. There are certain benefits for the rich. We admit that, of course, but has this Budget not rectified a position in that respect which has been causing vexation for many years&#x003F; After exerting himself to the utmost, a man reaches that notch of taxation where he is discouraged completely. This Budget has rectified that position. But, as the hon. member for Humansdorp quite rightly said, this Budget holds particular benefits for the lower income groups. I am not going to repeat all those benefits. We think of the benefits which have been mentioned repeatedly in this debate. Then there is the position of the wage-payer, and if we test it against the principles formulated by Abraham Lincoln, this Budget has also provided encouragement to the wage-payer, and the wage-earner should also benefit from that. For if the wage-payer himself is in a better position, he is able to pay better wages.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this Budget has brought about another very important state of affairs. This is something that has been worrying me for many years. This Budget has stopped us from pursuing this road to socialism, on which we had set out, any further. I am not saying that we should not render essential services to our people. We must provide for their needs. We must look after the less well-to-do. We must provide sanitary services, pensions, social services and education. But we have to draw a line somewhere, otherwise we are pursuing the road to socialism, and we know what a form of socialism has done to Great Britain. The time has come again that every man who wants to make progress, has the fullest opportunity to do so, because he is rewarded for his efforts. Here in South Africa we never want to reach the stage they have reached in Great Britain under a national health and a secondary modern schools system, which are nothing but an excuse for the services they are supposed to render. We do not want a state of affairs in this country eventually in which the man in the street adopts the attitude: &#x201C;How much can I get from my employer or from the State with the least effort on my part&#x003F;&#x201D; One finds that there are people who continually go about thinking, &#x201C;What can I claim from whom&#x003F;&#x201D;. I have come across that attitude. This Budget has restored this balance and has at least retarded the growth of socialism, and the man who is prepared to work, will now get his reward.</p>

<p>We in Northern Natal are particularly grateful to the Government for what it has done for us through the years and in this Budget in particular, and I just want to mention a few of these things: There is the large number of Government loans granted to us; there is the <span class="col_3859-3860" refersTo="page_0417"/>assistance rendered to our farmers; we have in mind, in particular, the assistance given to municipalities by the Government. The question of assistance to municipalities was also raised in this debate. I want to say to you, Sir, that this Government helps those municipalities who want to help themselves, and I could mention practical examples of this. We want to thank the Government for the water supply in Northern Natal. We want to thank the Government sincerely for the progress it has made in regard to the removal of the black spots and the development of the Bantu areas. The Government created a model township near Newcastle, a model township where anybody may witness the results of separate development. We want to thank the Government for the teaching facilities it has provided in Northern Natal and for the recent expansion in the field of education in Northern Natal, which is aimed at bringing about industrial development. We think of the industrial school for Indians, the W. A. Marais Technical High School, and others which are being built at present. The municipalities of Northern Natal also did their share. They themselves made certain preparations for industrial development. We have already made provision for all the secondary services and industries that are required for great industrial development. We have already made provision for our own capital formation. No other municipality in this country has R1&#x00BD; million in reserve for possible development. I wonder whether there are any such municipalities in this country. Sir, we have made provision in regard to town planning and the layout of industrial areas. We have already made provision for secondary industries, as I have said, but the full potential of that wonderful area of the Tugela basin has not yet been exploited fully. We are looking forward with great expectation to the day when this far-sighted Government will enable us in that area to make use of the full potential of the area. I want to point out to you briefly the enormous potential which we have there. We probably have more level ground in Northern Natal than there is in the rest of Natal. We also think of the particular situation of that area. We are half-way between the two major markets, Durban and Johannesburg. We are strategically situated between two large harbours, Durban and Richard&#x2019;s Bay, which is being planned, so that transport may be canalized to both sides. We think of our enormous potential of raw materials in the vicinity and the labour potential, to which I have already referred, in these Bantu areas. We have there the tremendously large Chelmsford Dam and we have a reserve of 185 million gallons per day in the Buffalo River, as much as Johannesburg uses per day. We have the large Ingagane power station there, which could be the largest source of electricity in Natal. What more does one want for possible heavy industrial development&#x003F; We think for example of our transport position there, where we are on the main railway line and on the national road. All the factors which contribute to the economical establishment of heavy industries are present there. Economic factors are the main consideration in the establishment of any industry, as well as in this case in particular the matter I should like to mention now: this matter fits in very well with this Government&#x2019;s policy of decentralization, and there are many good ideological reasons why we could make this development area one of those with the largest potential in this country. In this area, where the Government has created the right climate, there is logical, economic, ideological and scientific justification for the establishment of heavy industries or for the establishment of a third Iscor.</p>

<p>We earnestly appeal to the Ministers concerned and the Minister of Finance to take into account the factors I have mentioned when a decision is taken on this matter shortly. I think we are justified in saying that the industrialists and the economists agree with us that there is no more suitable place in the Republic of South Africa. I do not want to stir up enmity between my colleagues and myself in regard to this matter. But I think that if we approach this matter on a purely economic basis, we cannot come to any other conclusion. We know that this Government, in all the projects, it undertakes, in spite of what the hon. member said here, gives careful consideration to all the factors. Therefore we are happy that this matter is in the hands of this Government and in the hands of the hon. the Minister of Finance. Just as he submitted this Budget to us with the greatest care, study and planning, we are satisfied that he will give the same careful consideration to this matter.</p>

<p>The debate on this Budget from the side of the United Party has already fallen flat. Their big guns have already spoken. Nothing remains to be said from their side. Mr. Speaker, South Africa is heading for a grand future with the hon. the Minister of Finance in charge of our financial affairs, who can manage our affairs so efficiently and who has been able to present us with such a realistic Budget as this one.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Newcastle has made a plea for a third Iscor in his constituency. He has also made all sorts of allegations about the favourable reception given to this Budget, but I would like to quote him an extract from a letter which appeared in <i>The Natal Mercury</i> on Wednesday, the 2nd April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish, as a Nationalist, through the medium of your paper, to dissociate myself from the rich man&#x2019;s Budget just announced <span class="col_3861-3862" refersTo="page_0418"/>I am utterly disgusted with the miserable R1 increase in old folks&#x2019; pensions. I think it is a disgrace even to offer it to them.</block>

<p>The letter then goes on to condemn this Budget. We have just had the hon. members for Newcastle and Humansdorp praising this Budget, and saying that we are incorrect in suggesting that this is a rich man&#x2019;s Budget. Indeed this is a rich man&#x2019;s Budget. I think as the effects of the sales duty begin to sink in, the people are beginning to realize that the cost of many essentials will be increased. I am thinking particularly of the effect of the sales duty on the poorer section of the community, on the ordinary working man, on the young married couple or a young couple intending to marry and who have to set up a home and on the pensioner who has to live on a small inadequate pension. The hon. members for Humansdorp and Newcastle regard this increase of R1 in social pensions as a wonderful increase. But what does it really mean&#x003F; It means an increase of three cents a day, whereas the cost of many items that they will have to buy will increase by 10 per cent or 20 per cent. This sales duty comes into effect immediately whereas the increase of R1 will only come into effect as from the 1st October. In other words, by the time pensioners receive this increase of R1 per month, the cost of living will have risen steadily over six months, so I cannot imagine that there is any joy in the hearts of pensioners when one considers what additional costs the imposition of this sales duty will entail.</p>

<p>Sir, let us look at some other factors. How is this sales duty going to affect homes for the aged and homes for committed children&#x003F; I had a discussion only yesterday with a person who is a leading figure in the welfare world and who expressed grave concern over the increased cost of administering these homes. These homes which are administered by welfare organizations are now facing increased replacement costs and increased running costs. They use a large quantity of soap; they do a lot of their own laundry, they have to renew equipment, furniture and furnishings, curtains, carpeting and linen from time to time, and all these items are subject to the sales duty imposed by the hon. the Minister. One of these welfare organizations estimates that the sales duty will increase their costs by approximately 27 per cent per annum. We know that the Government endeavours to subsidize these homes and organizations, but this is done on a very limited basis. The subsidy represents approximately half of what it costs to keep these children in children&#x2019;s homes or to accommodate aged persons in homes for the aged. The subsidy falls far short of the amount required to keep these people.</p>

<p>As we know, Sir, committed children are committed by a children&#x2019;s court; they are then handed over to welfare organizations which are carrying out an essential welfare service, a service which the State itself would have to provide if the welfare organizations, did not exist. These welfare organizations, however, only receive a subsidy of about 50 per cent of what it costs to keep these children. The running costs of the welfare organizations are going to be greatly increased by this sales duty which they will have to pay on many items that they require for the day-to-day running of these organizations. But what about new organizations which are just being established&#x003F; There are many welfare organizations which are endeavouring to meet the tremendous demand for accommodation in children&#x2019;s homes and homes for the aged and other institutions. They are endeavouring to raise funds and some of these organizations are in the process of erecting homes for the aged. Here I would like to refer to one in the Durban area which will accommodate 464 aged persons. This building is due to be opened at the end of this year. It is estimated that the cost of equipping this home will be R100,000. This organization will be subsidized to the tune of R46,000. The subsidy from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions is based on 75 per cent of the costs, subject to a maximum of R90 per inmate who qualifies for the subsidy. This means that they will have to find R54,000 but by the time they have to equip this home by the end of the year when it is completed they will have to find about another R10,000 to meet the sales duty imposed by the Minister of Finance. This means that this will delay and seriously hinder the establishment of many of these homes that are in the course of being built and are being established. The figure of R90 per inmate is the subsidy received from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, but the cost of equipping this particular home is R215 per inmate. So. of R215 <i>per capita</i> they will only receive R90 <i>per capita.</i> Over and above this they will be called upon to pay at least the extra 10 per cent of the cost of equipping this proposed home. If we look at the proposed list of sales dutiable goods, I believe that 10 per cent is a fair and average estimate. The list includes, as I have mentioned, furniture, curtains, carpeting and all other essentials that are required in equipping such a home. Refrigerators are also subject to tax. Electrical equipment, coffee urns, tea urns, are all included under the Minister&#x2019;s proposals. Only one of them is below 10 per cent and that is bed linen, on which the tax is 5 per cent. The others are all 10 per cent or more. This will greatly increase the cost of these homes which are being built and that have not budgeted obviously to pay this sudden increase of the sales duty. They will have to pay the entire amount, because as I have mentioned the <i>per capita</i> cost already far exceeds the subsidizable amount of R90 <i>per capita</i> which is allowed in respect of White inmates of these homes. They will have to pay this money themselves.</p>

<p><span class="col_3863-3864" refersTo="page_0419"/>As far as the Coloured community is concerned, there is also a Coloured organization which is building a home for Coloured aged in the Peninsula. They estimate their cost of furnishing at R18,000. Their subsidy from the Government is a maximum of R70 <i>per capita.</i> It is costing them approximately R118 <i>per capita</i> to furnish and equip this home. They, too, now will be called upon to find another R2,000 to pay in sales duty. That is all it means; an additional amount to pay purely as sales duty. This leads me to make a plea to the hon. the Minister of Finance, in considering the proposals for increasing the sales duty, that he should, in this particular case, at least make an exemption in the case of registered welfare organizations which are required to buy certain items that are subject to the sales duty. He should make this extra expense an amount which can be reimbursed at a later stage. It will be quite simple, in my estimation, to administer a provision that where a registered welfare organization is required to purchase these items which are subject to the sales duty, on submission of invoices and receipts they will receive a remission from the Department of Inland Revenue for the sales duty which they have had to pay in terms of these items. I believe that such an exemption could be granted and should be granted for the benefit of the welfare services in South Africa. The new Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions is unfortunately not here this afternoon. However, I was going to call upon him, as the responsible Minister who is most anxious, as he has stated when he assumed office as the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, to alleviate the position as far as the poorer section of the community is concerned. I wanted to call upon him to assist wherever possible to establish reasonable accommodation for these people. He also laid the emphasis strongly on the need for welfare organizations and private initiative to fulfil these requirements in respect of the welfare services in this country. I submit that these organizations are endeavouring, under tremendous difficulties from time to time, to do just that and to improve the position of our welfare services. They face many stumbling blocks, particularly in regard to the raising of funds. We know that even in the case of the Municipality of Durban they are required to provide a 10 per cent collateral security, which makes it all the more difficult for them to raise the funds from the public, from the community, to provide these essential services.</p>

<p>I should also like to deal with the question of the social pensioners. The two hon. members who spoke before me, the hon. member for Humansdorp and the hon. member for Newcastle, seemed to think that this Budget presented a wonderful opportunity to say thank you to the hon. the Minister in regard to the concessions that he has made to this one particular group. I presume that people must be grateful for small mercies. However, I would like to join the many members on the other side of the House who, on other subjects, requested more to be done in certain respects. Certainly, as far as this side of the House is concerned, all our speakers have pointed to ways and means where more can be done to assist people who are in need. I believe that the older section of our community is a section that is in great need. I believe that this increase of only R1 per month is a pittance in comparison with the increased costs that they will incur, bearing in mind the fact that these are the people who will be called upon to pay this indirect taxation on many of the items on which the Minister proposes to impose the sales duty. Yet they will be compensated by a R1 per month increase. What about the non-White section&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Finance, in delivering his Budget speech, said that in terms of a ratio certain increases would be granted to the non-White pensioners. One can only presume that the same ratio will be maintained as was applied in the past. That would mean that the Coloureds and Indians would receive 50 cents per month, while the Bantu would receive 25 cents a month increase in their social pensions. I believe that the amount of increase that is being granted, particularly in regard to the ratio that has to be applied and has been applied for a number of years, means that these people receive an absolute pittance. One must remember, too, that many of these people will also have to pay the indirect taxation which is now imposed in terms of the sales duty on many of these items. But they will have far less to meet these increased costs. Indeed, as far as the Bantu social pensioner is concerned, he will merely have an extra 25 cents per month to meet the increased costs which he will be called upon to pay in terms of the sales duty.</p>

<p>I also want to deal with the question of the relaxation of the means test. Here we welcome the provision that an amount of R20 per month for a single person and R40 per month for a married person will be deducted from earnings before applying the means test. We indeed have pleaded from this side of the House on numerous occasions that something must be done with regard to the income limits in terms of the means test. This will, of course, assist those who would like to take some form of employment and who would perhaps like to take part-time employment. However, I believe that it would be more beneficial to apply it in a slightly different manner. We have endeavoured from this side of the House to put forward constructive suggestions. We believe that a more practical application, which would be of greater assistance to the people concerned, might be the better way of applying these matters. Dealing with the question of the means test being relaxed for income purposes, we must remember that the ceiling has remained constant for a long time at R42 per month per person whereby a person is disqualified if he has more than that amount in income from certain sources as far as the <span class="col_3865-3866" refersTo="page_0420"/>receiving of a social pension is concerned. In terms of the present concession that has been made, it does mean that these people will be able to take some form of employment, but they will still be disqualified, of course, where they exceed certain limits. Here I believe that the ceiling which has been established is one that will still be very low indeed. For instance, the present proposed relaxation would mean that if a married person who has assets below R3,600, earns more than R124 per month, he and his wife would be disqualified from receiving a pension, because an income of R124 per month minus the R40 makes it R84 which brings him above the actual new ceiling which is to be created, whereas if half of the earnings was disregarded for the purpose of the means test, rather than the present proposed concession, it would mean that that ceiling would be R168 per month before they exceeded the ceiling. There are many pensioners who have managed to obtain some form of employment at about R160 or R150 per month. I believe that these people could have been accommodated if this concession had been granted on a slightly different basis which would have raised that ceiling from R124 per month to R168 per month. Another group which will be affected by the terms of the proposals made by the hon. Minister of Finance will be the war veterans of the First World War. As the Minister is well aware, we have pleaded from this side of the House on numerous occasions for the complete abolition of the means test for First World War veterans. We still believe that it is justified to abolish the means test for those veterans of the First World War and if the Government wishes to include the 1914 protesting burghers and the 1906 Zulu Rebellion veterans, there is so much the more a case for them to be included in the abolition of the means test. It is all part of South African history and these people who have served in the First World War should receive that consideration. However, we are dealing here with a proposal which the hon. the Minister has made during his Budget speech. We welcome the concession which has been made, but I believe that this is even further complicating the means test, because we are now creating a fourth group which has to be dealt with on a separate basis. Surely, it would have been easier to relax the means test for the war veterans of over 70 years of age. Should there be war veterans of the First World War who have not yet attained the age of 70 years, it can be arranged quite easily by means of regulations that they shall be deemed to have reached the age of 70 and be dealt with on the basis of that means test. Now we are creating an entirely new group as far as the means test is concerned. We have a group for the old age pensioners under 70 years of age, a group for the old age pensioners of over 70 years of age, a group for the war veterans of over 70 years of age and now another means test for war veterans of the First World War, the 1914 protesting burghers and the 1906 Zulu Rebellion veterans. Surely, it would have been easier if a relaxation of the means test for the war veteran of over 70 years of age was granted instead of creating a separate one entirely.</p>

<p>As far as the civil pensions are concerned, the two Government speakers who have spoken before me both praised the concessions which have been made for the civil pensioners. We too believe that the civil pensioners deserved some recognition because we know there are large numbers of resignations of key personnel and we know that the Civil Service is having a great deal of difficulty in attracting people to the service. Consequently fringe benefits have to be improved to try and compete to a certain extent with the private sector and at least retain many of the personnel in the Civil Service. However, the position is that the concessions which have been granted here are more or less in line with those granted to the Railway pensioners, with one very big and significant difference. The difference is that an annual increase of two per cent per annum compounded has been granted to Railway pensioners whereas it has not been recommended in regard to the civil pensioners. I would like to know why it is deemed that the civil pensioner should be dealt with on a different basis. We know that the matter was fully investigated. The question which I had on the Order Paper in 1968 disclosed that an interdepartmental committee of enquiry had been appointed to investigate the present Government pensions. It was appointed in October, 1967, and it included representatives of the Treasury, the Public Service Commission, the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, the South African Railways and the Government Actuary. One of the terms of reference was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether in view of the continual erosion of the value of money, special steps should be introduced to effect the automatic adjustment to the annuities in addition to, or in lieu of the existing relief accorded by way of a bonus, temporary allowance or minimum pension and to submit recommendations to cover any proposed variations or new schemes together with an indication of the financial implications involved in the implementation of such recommendations.</block>

<p>The Railways Administration and the hon. the Minister of Transport obviously accepted this fact that to compete particularly, or even to compare with various pension schemes which are available in the private sector, something on the basis of a regular increase should be granted to these pensioners. We know that in terms of these pension schemes of the private sector, with the new developments which have taken place in regard to equity linked pension schemes, the annuitants receive regular increases in their annuities so as to offset the ravages of inflation and the erosion of the purchasing power of their money. However, as <span class="col_3867-3868" refersTo="page_0421"/>far as the civil pensioner is concerned, it appears that under the old system of granting increases in a bonus every now and again, relief will be granted every few years or as the Government feels inclined, rather than having an organized set increase whereby the civil pensioners can look forward to receiving these increases. To many old people to-day, particularly in the private sector where there are still old pension schemes in existence to a certain extent, it means that the longer they live the poorer they become and the more difficult life becomes for them. It is the duty of the Government to look after its employees to the greatest extent. I believe this would be the opportune moment for the hon. the Minister of Finance to follow a similar course as the hon. the Minister of Transport, by granting regular increases to the civil pensioners.</p>

<p>Now, there are other points which I would like to raise concerning disappointments in regard to this Budget. One is, I believe, that far greater relaxation of the means test could have been brought about. There are still many anomalies in existence. Just to quote one, a person who has R8,000 invested at nine per cent receiving R60 per month can apply for a pension if he or she is over 70 years of age and receive the full maximum pension plus another R10 per month, amounting all in all to R42 per month. But a widow, for instance, receiving an annuity from her late husband&#x2019;s employer of more than R42 per month, receives nothing whatsoever. She might have no assets whatsoever, but if she is receiving more than R42 per month, she receives nothing whatsoever. Surely, the time has arrived for a review of this anomaly which exists in the means test to-day.</p>

<p>Another disappointment is in regard to the question of family allowances. We have heard pleas from the Government over and over again that it is in the interests of South Africa to have an increase in the White population particularly. According to the figures for the average size of White families, it has decreased over the years. The 1960 census showed that the average size of a White family at that stage was 3.7 persons; of Coloureds 4.9; of Asiatics 5.3 while some 25.1 per cent of the White married couples had no children. The figures in regard to the birth rate of the White section of the country are alarming. Surely the time has arrived when the Minister of Finance should make available sums of money to try to assist families where there are financial difficulties if they are to have more children and if the families are to be bigger. The question of our family allowances was investigated by a commission of enquiry, the Piek Commission of Enquiry, some years ago which made a large number of recommendations. Some of those recommendations have been implemented on a small scale, but a large number of those recommendations have not been implemented. I submit that the hon. the Minister of Finance should make available sums of money to the Department of Social Welfare in particular to see where and how the present system of family allowances can be expanded and improved. The new Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions made a statement on the 21st February this year concerning family life and he made certain observations which, I believe, indicate the urgency of this problem. The hon. the Minister in his statement said that in regard to such an important matter as family life and in particular aspects such as a higher birth rate and the combating of divorce, there should be no overlapping of action of future developments. He then made a statement that a conference would be held on welfare matters. But in terms of this statement, he indicated that a family life commission, which is one of the commissions we created when this House passed the National Welfare Act a few years ago, should be engaged in this task of finding ways and means whereby the birth rate amongst the White community in South Africa could be increased and encouraged. It would appear that the Minister of Finance to a great extent by financial means can assist in this regard. To-day we have a system of family allowances, which is subject to a very stringent means test. It is a very small sum indeed. Under a million rand a year is spent on family allowances. This is not merely a service which should be granted to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions to administer, but it should have a wider range of investigation to see if it is not possible that the Minister of Finance could also assist in this regard.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of other welfare services that exist, it appears that there are still very large gaps in the welfare services provided in South Africa. We welcome the fact that a conference is to be held in Pretoria in the latter part of June of this year. It is, therefore, hoped that next year the hon. the Minister of Finance will be in a position to make available greater funds to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, particularly to encourage our welfare organizations by financial aid to expand their field of operation to enable them to render what is an essential service to all sections of our community as far as our welfare services are concerned. The present system in South Africa is one which has been established over a large number of years and it is one which mainly subsidizes welfare organizations, which are providing the bulk of the field work that has to be done in the welfare field. However, these organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to continue with the essential services, due to increased costs. Here we have a budget and proposals before us which will adversely affect these organizations. If the hon. the Minister is not able to grant an exemption of the sales duty to these welfare organizations, I suggest that the only avenue open to him is to grant greater financial aid to these organizations by means of subsidies. There is no doubt about it; these organizations will have to come back to the Central Government for financial assistance.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier in my speech the fact <span class="col_3869-3870" refersTo="page_0422"/>that only a maximum of R90 <i>per capita</i> was granted for the provision of homes for the aged White persons, whereas, in fact, it costs over R200 <i>per capita</i> to make that accommodation available to these people. The National Council for the Care of the Aged, as I know, made numerous representations to the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions to increase this unrealistic subsidy of R90 <i>per capita.</i> [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Umbilo has once again done what we have been accustomed to for a long time. Without having any grounds for doing so, the United Party says something this year so that next year, or one day when something may perhaps be done in that direction, they may say, &#x201C;But, surely, we suggested that last year.&#x201D; Let me just illustrate this to hon. members.</p>

<p>No, wait a minute, the hon. member is talking about wool; we are talking about people. The hon. member for Umbilo referred to the Commission for Family Life, which is carrying out certain terms of reference. He gave a brief summary of what their actual task was. Then, anticipating the issues he said that the Minister should kindly make additional funds available next year in order that the Department might give effect to the Commission&#x2019;s findings. Surely, it is absurd to want to anticipate a matter in that manner. But next year, or whenever the Commission tables its report and the Department accepts it on well-founded facts&#x2014;not on general, broad premises&#x2014;the hon. member for Umbilo may rise and say, &#x201C;But we asked for that a long time ago.&#x201D; I refer hon. members to the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 21st March, 1969, so as to indicate how these people feel about their own affairs. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a sad thought that there is a whole generation of South Africans who cannot recall this country under any government but a Nationalist one. On 26th May, the Nationalist Party will have governed South Africa for 21 years. That means that young South Africans, 26 years or younger, can remember only a Nationalist Government.</block>

<p>Sir, that is what the hon. member for Yeoville wrote in the <i>Cape Argus</i> on 21st March, 1969. Now I want to tell them that we have the same difficulty. Our children no longer know either what a wretched government we had before 1948. We also have the problem of making them realize that they have only had experience of a decent government. This kind of argument in which the hon. member for Umbilo was engaged all afternoon, is the kind of argument by means of which they now want to suggest to the young people of 26 years and younger, to whom he referred, that the Government acted differently at the time or would have wanted to do so. But surely, this is not the case at all. This Budget proves very clearly that we are not only dealing here with amounts which have been increased or decreased, concessions which have been made or taxes which have been increased. The significance of this Budget is, after all, that it reflects the country&#x2019;s strong economy.</p>

<p>To come to the welfare matters to which the hon. member paid particular attention: I want to tell him that just as the country handles its economy in a consistent manner, and just as it has ensured a stable economy, it ensures that it is capable of providing what is necessary and making the concessions which are necessary at this stage, not only in the sphere of welfare hut also in all other spheres. In the same way I want to show him, as far as this particular aspect of the Budget is concerned, in what a consistent manner the Government has developed this programme as well.</p>

<p>Just take the question of old age pensions. In 1947 the pension was R10. At the moment it is R33. This represents an increase of 230 per cent. Surely, we cannot omit to take this into account. Hon. members will agree that the value of money has decreased, but let us look at the means test. Here we find a very interesting phenomenon. In view of the limited time at my disposal, I shall only refer to two groups, the old age pensioners and the war veterans. I furnish round figures. Of the 27,000 persons Who receive old age pensions and own fixed property, as many as 23,700 receive the maximum pension. This is the extent to which the means test has been relaxed. I am now referring to those who have fixed property. In the case of the war veterans the figure in respect of those who have fixed property is 4,900. Of that number as many as 4,100 receive maximum pension benefits, notwithstanding the fact that there has been such a tremendous improvement in these benefits between 1948 and 1969. Of the 100,700 persons who receive old age pensions, there are as many as 90,600, i.e. more than 90 per cent, who receive the maximum old age pension. Surely, this proves that there has been a tremendous concession in respect of the means test. As far as the war veterans are concerned, as many as 16,900 of the 18,800 receive maximum pension benefits at the moment. After this Budget this figure may even be more favourable.</p>

<p>But it is not only this increase in pensions as such or the relaxation of the means test which we can point out. I shall also point out several other concessions which the Government has from time to time made in the interests of the aged. I shall also mention to hon. members an amount of R2.7 million which the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions spent in respect of White pensioners <span class="col_3871-3872" refersTo="page_0423"/>for a wide range of other services. Capital provisions for accommodation for the aged, which is being provided, <i>inter alia,</i> by the Department of Community Development, has not even been included here. The opportunities which the strong economy of this country under this Government affords the aged&#x2014;i.e. that of enabling them to work until they attain the maximum age, until they qualify for a pension, and even after that&#x2014;constitute part of the reason why this Government is still going to persevere with the means test, because it creates opportunities for the aged to be employed for their maximum lifespan, so that they may amass considerably more savings than was the case in former times. There were times, when those people on the other side were in power, when there were few opportunities for employment for the aged, when the wages of the White aged were such that they could not save anything. That is why there is a large group of aged persons to-day who have no reserves and who are completely dependent on their pensions.</p>

<p>I want to go further. I want to mention the services to which the hon. member for Umbilo referred time and again, i.e. the services rendered by voluntary welfare organizations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mclachlan">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. MCLACHLAN</person>:</from>

<p>But, surely, I said at the beginning that the hon. member was pleading without any grounds in order that he might be able to say next year, &#x201C;But I advocated that last year.&#x201D; But the hon. member has no facts on the strength of which he may claim that at the moment voluntary organizations have to incur all sorts of liabilities. At the moment we have as many as 143 old age homes. After all, not all of those 143 homes are going to purchase, in this particular year only, new curtains, new furniture, etc., which would increase their expenditure. These homes are, after all, equipped properly. The Department has, after all, made provision.</p>

<p>But I want to associate myself with the warning the hon. member for Newcastle sounded against the welfare idea. The Opposition has said time after time that they do not want it either. But if they are going to insist that the State should contribute more and more to these services, this must, after all, inevitably result in these voluntary organizations being subsidized in full. But now the Government has a different policy. Instead of merely handing out and granting cash allowances, it is developing, in conjunction with the voluntary organizations, a comprehensive professional service, for instance, by subsidizing social workers, people who are also rendering a very great service in the interests of these aged persons.</p>

<p>In addition to these matters which I have mentioned, there are the attendant&#x2019;s allowances which are being made available to our aged. Those people who are so weak that they cannot look after themselves, obtain the services of persons who take care of them. Several thousands of rands are being set aside in the Budget in order to make provision for that. By 1947 there were only 57 old age homes for Whites in this country, with a mere 4,800 inhabitants. At the moment there are 143 homes, which have room for 10,570 aged persons. Another 63 homes are under construction, and if they were to be filled within the next few years, they would provide accommodation for more than 15,000 aged persons. It is this more effective and more practical method of caring for the aged which is made possible by a strong economy. Give those persons nothing but a pension, and it will be found that a large number of them are not capable of controlling or handling it. That does not make it a constructive service. We place the emphasis on the constructive service which is being rendered.</p>

<p>Last year we passed legislation relating to the care of aged persons. This legislation provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for better control over aged persons who have been exploited in the past through high accommodation fees, inadequate care, and so forth. These are the things we emphasize. A strong economy and a stable Government can always uphold a means test, knowing that its aged are in any case still well cared for.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo objected to the various forms of means tests which exist, but what does he do by way of illustration&#x003F; He comes here with individual cases. He tells us about a widow whose husband earned a certain amount and who invested the money at such and such a rate of interest. If he wants to reason in that way, he will be able, no matter how these tests are altered, to quote a whole batch of individual cases here every year, cases of which he and I may have many examples. These cases differ so radically from one another that within the framework of even the most idealistic means test provisions one would find that the one still differs from the other, because one person may have invested at 6 per cent, the next at 8 per cent and another may not have invested at all because he keeps his money in his own money box at home. No, it is because the United Party governed the way they did that they have to come forward with the complaint here that their people no longer know what an old United Party Government looks like.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the hon. the Minister had presented the Budget I leant back and thought: &#x201C;Look, now we are going to hear something from this Opposition, our alternative government; they will really swing the hatchet and show us how such a Budget is to be criticized and what they can substitute for it.&#x201D; Alas, the <span class="col_3873-3874" refersTo="page_0424"/>debate has nearly run its course, but we have heard nothing in this connection yet. The best I have heard was the speech made by the hon. member for Constantia, but he congratulated the hon. the Minister on the new direction he had taken with this Budget. In the other speeches made by hon. members opposite they scurried and floundered about without making any impression. They fought with closed eyes; they hit left and right, but did not strike anything. That is why we can also say: &#x201C;Vanity of vanities,&#x201D; saith the Preacher, &#x201C;vanity of vanities; all is vanity.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Apart from congratulating the hon. the Minister I want to extend another congratulation in the House. This is a congratulation on a birthday and it is extended to one of our industrial giants. It is extended to Iscor. When last year the National Party had been in power for a period of 20 years, this undertaking had been doing as good work as the National Party Government had been doing for the past 20 years, but for exactly twice as long. This undertaking set South Africa on the road to sound and vigorous industrial development. Around Iscor a host of factories and business undertakings developed which not only created good employment opportunities for our Whites, but also enabled South Africa to defy everything which our enemies in the outside world could throw at us in the form of boycotts and what have you.</p>

<p>What was the attitude of the Opposition in regard to that undertaking&#x003F; What was their attitude when the National Party Government wanted to establish our own iron and steel undertaking in 1928&#x003F; This legislation was before this House in 1927. It was passed here, and when it came to the Other Place, where the Opposition was in the majority at the time, it was rejected. South Africa had always had to import from foreign countries. Only in 1928, at a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, was this legislation passed.</p>

<p>To-day our iron and steel industry is a source of strength and a gem in the economy of our country and a monument to the farsighted policy of the National Party. I therefore deem it a privilege to have the mother company of Iscor in my constituency. On behalf of the thousands of Iscor workers I say: &#x201C;Congratulations, keep up the good work and carry on along the road of steel that has been chosen.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I also want to refer to another matter, and that is how this Budget will, in my opinion, affect the worker. It is a well-known truth that the National Party recognizes the worker as the backbone of the economy of our country and of our people. It is as great a truth that the National Party is the friend of the worker. If we look at the various budgets introduced this year, the Railway Budget, the Post Office Budget and the Budget of the hon. the Minister of Finance, we see what tremendous concessions have been made.</p>

<p>Large concessions have been granted to pensioners. Railway, civil, war veteran&#x2019;s pensions have all been improved and the means test has been relaxed. Concessions have been granted to working wives in respect of the first R500. There is a maternity rebate. Medical expenses have been brought to a fixed amount. Subsidies are paid to officials in respect of their interest on housing loans. Other concessions have also been announced. If that is not sufficient proof then nothing will be able to convince anyone that the National Party is the true friend of the worker in South Africa.</p>

<p>I am particularly glad about the concessions in respect of housing loans to public servants, policemen, soldiers and provincial officials. However, I think attention may be paid to three matters arising out of this. The first relates to the private sector. These people are paying 8&#x00BD; per cent interest on loans, and at some building societies even 9 per cent. They must have 25 per cent of the purchase price as well as transfer costs available. That means that a person wanting to buy a house for R10,000 will have to have almost R3,000 in cash available. The vast majority of our salary earners find it quite impossible to raise this amount.</p>

<p>A second matter relates to building premises in built-up areas, such as in Pretoria West. Houses are extremely scarce and the Department of Community Development may possibly consider granting loans not only for new houses but also for houses completed a few years ago.</p>

<p>A third matter I want to mention relates to housing schemes and loans for workers of Iscor which are controlled by a few subsidiaries of Iscor. I want to point out that Pretoria West is connected with Iscor to the extent of about 60 per cent directly or indirectly. These loans and schemes make money available for rent as well as purchase schemes at a rate of interest of 5 1/4 per cent. This is better than any other scheme, and Iscor has drawn and retained many people as a result of the fact that housing was cheaper and more readily available. A change has now set in. The loans of other institutions for the income group up to R3,000 per annum are now less than 4 per cent.</p>

<p>When the House adjourned Friday evening, I was speaking on housing loans for officials at a reduced rate of interest. This is a major and welcome concession.</p>

<p>However, there are three matters which arise from this and to which, as I see it, further attention must be paid. I have already spoken about how the man in the private sector is being affected and also about the shortage of building sites.</p>

<p>The third factor is the way in which it affects the Iscor worker. Up to now it has been possible for him to obtain a loan at 5 1/4 per cent. This is also the rate at which interest is calculated where houses are rented, with a few exceptions. These rates of interest have always been lower than those of other bodies and have been one of the attractions for the Iscor worker. Things have now changed. Loans can be obtained elsewhere at 4 per cent, where the official falls into the R3,000 or lower income group. And this is in fact the income group in which the vast majority of the Iscor workers fall. Whereas the Iscor loans were obtainable at 5 1/4 per cent and the interest rate of the loans under discussion has been reduced to 4 per cent, the difference of 1 1/4 per cent on a loan of R9,000 comes to the considerable amount of R9.37 per month. It would now seem to me as though the logical step would be for the Iscor estate and other subsidiaries in Pretoria, Vanderbijlpark and elsewhere to reduce their rate of interest as well. If it has to be in relation to the former position, it ought to be lower than 4 per cent. This would be a major attraction and would consequently mean fewer changes in the labour force of one of our key industries. This would once again prove that the National Party is the true friend of the worker.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should also like to touch upon a matter which deals with our youth.</p>

<p>As Afrikaners we have always had reason to be proud of our young people. This we saw throughout our history, in the days of the Great Trek&#x2014;here we call to mind the sons and daughters of the Trekkers&#x2014;in the pioneering days and also in the course of the Second Anglo-Boer War, and here we think of the cubs of the Three Year&#x2019;s War. Then, just as is the case to-day, the young people were in the forefront and were a source of inspiration and pride to us.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are two matters which are really a cause for concern. At a few universities there are misguided people who believe that the mantle of a Danny the Red has fallen on their shoulders and becomes them. We were grateful to hear this morning that the students of the Rand Afrikaans University had expressed their full confidence in our leaders and in our Government. We are also very grateful for the very positive steps the Minister is taking, and I want to assure him that he has the whole country behind him in his efforts to collar these people who want to give free rein to their emotions.</p>

<p>The other case I want to mention, worries me more because it is nearer home. There are a few, actually just a small number of individuals, who are either wilfully or out of frustration or as imitators of an English magazine in Pretoria, publishing their own little rag. In this respect one can really say as they did in the olden days&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the old cock crows&#x2014;in English, So crows the young&#x2014;in Afrikaans.</block>

<p>They are allegedly opposed to Liberalism and Communism, and then they avail themselves of the very methods employed by these two pernicious schools of thought to disparage everything in which our nation believes, everything which is good and noble and sacred to us, and everything which has made our nation a strong one, including the principles and the leaders of our nation. For what sinister purpose this is being done, they alone will know.</p>

<p>Let the youth fight for their ideals; it prepares them and makes them strong for the future when they eventually have to take over the reins, and it also purifies their spirit. But they should never avail them of these despicable methods. For that reason I want to condemn these publications and methods in the strongest terms possible. They do not serve any good purpose or national cause, but are nothing but destructive, and they are digging a pit for themselves in which, eventually, they will and ought to fall, because these methods of disparagement will definitely still be used against them one day.</p>

<speech by="#hertzog">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HERTZOG</person>:</from>

<p>We are now approaching the closing stages of this debate, and first I just want to refer briefly to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who devoted his speech mainly to the manpower shortage and to the rate of development. Everyone of us knows, and every economist emphasizes, that <span class="col_3877-3878" refersTo="page_0426"/>the rate of development of South Africa is already very high; that it may already be too high. And to increase this rate of development now, would simply mean that we would greatly increase the economic problems of our country, at the least. Yet the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that as a result of the &#x201C;population explosion&#x201D; of the Bantu, the black man, who is increasing twice as rapidly as the white man, it is now essential for us to accelerate and to increase this development, &#x201C;technically, industrially and economically&#x201D;. The purpose of that, as he said, is that &#x201C;more non-Whites would have to be drawn into the skilled and semi-skilled jobs&#x201D;. If we were now to accede to the wishes of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, we would not only be heading even more rapidly for greater economic problems for ourselves, but we would also be heading for political problems. In order to clarify this I want to refer to the words used by no less a person than Sir Alec Douglas-Home, in a message to British financiers in which he impressed upon them that they should assist the &#x201C;economic expansion of South Africa&#x201D;. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Economic expansion does and will confer on non-Whites a growing economic power that will inevitably lead to a measure of political power.</block>

<p>He then continued, according to the report, by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa, where all is calm and on the surface tolerably harmonious, racial tensions could build up sharply as the non-Whites from an economic power base growing stronger all the time start to press for concessions in the social and political spheres. It can only be a matter of time before this happens.</block>

<p>And then, strangely enough, he appealed to the financiers to assist and to expedite this economic development, this exceptional growth of South Africa, and he did so with this soothing encouragement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is indeed a happy circumstance when self-interest seems to coincide so neatly with the national interest and the making of profits can be represented as a patriotic duty.</block>

<p>That &#x201C;patriotic duty&#x201D; is to see to it that the black man obtains political power here in South Africa, and once that begins the power will, of course, eventually be in his hands exclusively. The report stated that these words were uttered by Sir Alec &#x201C;as the result of his recent visit to South Africa&#x201D;. We can deduce for ourselves that during that recent visit he saw many members of the United Party, and perhaps he saw the Leader of the Opposition as well. I do not for a moment want to suggest that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, in his call for an increase in our economic activities, has the same object in view as Sir Alec Douglas-Home, but the end result of his proposal will be the same.</p>

<p>You know, Sir, after having listened so constantly to the speeches of our friends on the opposite side of the House, I cannot help gaining the impression, and I think this is true of many of us sitting here, that the United Party is chiefly concerned about the black man. It is chiefly concerned about the so-called and imaginary injustices towards the black man. It is not really very much concerned about the white man. This is the conclusion we come to. It gives us the impression that it is not particularly concerned about the white man, who has made South Africa what it is to-day, who has brought South Africa to its present position, who has made it possible for South Africa to be a worthy home for all the races in the country; that it is not concerned about that white man, without whom everything in South Africa must collapse and cannot continue to exist. If the white man were to leave South Africa, it would entail not only misery for the black man, but also chaos. To-day I want to speak as we as Nationalists always speak, with the thoughts which we as Nationalists always have. Our first thought is for the white people of South Africa, that white nation without which nothing in South Africa can continue to exist and without which even white civilization will eventually perish.</p>

<p>In the first place we must look around us at the political situation. With the greatest appreciation we observe the alleviation of the tensions in respect of South Africa at international level, and we hope that that alleviation will be a lasting one. But we must be soberminded. We must prepare ourselves for the possibility that that alleviation may be only temporary and that the tensions against South Africa may in the near future perhaps mount up further and to a very high peak. This is almost inevitable, because the fundamental objection which the world has against us is not the way in which we treat the Bantu, not the fine way in which we treat the other population groups in South Africa; their objection against us is that we are here in South Africa as Whites, that we rule the country as a minority. This is their objection. The outside world insists that the majority must rule. It makes no difference how barbaric, how unqualified the majority are; nor does it make any difference what the consequences will be. The outside world demands that the majority must rule. Is this not in fact precisely what the American Secretary of State, Mr. William Rogers, said the other day&#x003F; Is this not precisely what Mr. Wilson said at the United Nations in connection with Rhodesia&#x003F; Is this not the same principle that the U.N., with the support of America, put forward in respect of South-West Africa&#x003F; Is this not perhaps the same as was put forward, albeit quite shamelessly, by the American advocate Gross, the applicants&#x2019; counsel in the International Court <span class="col_3879-3880" refersTo="page_0427"/>case on South-West Africa, when he recently made an appeal to the American Government &#x201C;to end white rule in South Africa&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

<p>I say that the focal point around which everything revolves in South Africa is the fact that we as white people, the civilized people, the knowledgeable people, the competent people, dare to rule the country as a minority. As long as we rule we must be prepared for the possibility that the tensions against South Africa may build up, and build up higher. We must prepare ourselves for the possibility that as a result of the communist penetration in Tanzania and Zambia these tensions may be increased still further. It is said that in Tanzania and Zambia there are at present at least 1,000 Chinese communist technicians engaged in making a survey for the railway line between the copperfields of Zambia and the coast of Tanzania. As soon as a start is made with that railway line, we should be prepared for communists entering both Tanzania and Zambia in large numbers. And with the increase in the number of communists there, one may be sure that communist propaganda will be greatly intensified. Communist propaganda follows a pattern; this pattern is always to stir up hate. They stir up hate between one tribe and another, between one black man and another, and between the black man and the white man. We already see this in those smouldering terrorist camps near our borders, camps which were openly established and in respect of which it is openly stated that they are aimed against South Africa. In the long run we must expect this propaganda against South Africa to cause the enmity and feelings against us to be greatly intensified. Our Government is aware of these things, and therefore it has all along systematically built up our defences so strongly. In the present Budget, provision is made for those defences to be further strengthened.</p>

<p>Every sensible person knows that when you are in danger, you do not discard your weapons. On the contrary, you grab every weapon you have and you try to improve it. You look after, develop and strengthen it, because if you discard a weapon which you could have used, you are weakening yourself and strengthening your enemies. We as a nation have one great weapon, perhaps the strongest and most powerful weapon we possess, and that is our white nation itself. You can win a war without weapons and without supplies, especially in the case of present-day unconventional warfare, where you obtain weapons and supplies by taking them from your enemies. But you can never win in any struggle without a tough, intrepid and spiritually well-equipped nation.</p>

<p>Now, it is the position in our country to-day that we are spending between R280 million and R300 million on armaments for and the organization of our Defence Force. At the same time there are forces at work in our country which are breaking down and destroying the spiritual powers of resistance of our nation, thereby weakening us. Our white population is our most powerful, our greatest asset. This white population of ours consists of two sections in the main: The English-speaking section on the one hand and the Afrikaans-speaking section on the other. We already have a great deal in common. However, there are still many differences too, matters in which we differ from one another. But, be that as it may, each of our two groups has wonderful qualities, qualities which have enabled them to make splendid and major contributions to the development of our country and to ensuring our survival. If we now want to make the best use of these two large sections of our population, we must understand them properly. We must understand their characteristics, so that we can make the best use of that great potential. Between these two groups there are what I want to call &#x201C;intermediates&#x201D;. There are people who have partly the characteristics of the Afrikaner and partly those of the English-speaking section, in varying degrees. But we must admit that on the whole the large mass of the English-speaking people still form a homogeneous group, and so do the Afrikaans-speaking people form a homogeneous group displaying the same characteristics.</p>

<p>I now want to deal for a moment with the Afrikaans-speaking section of this robust population of ours. We Afrikaans-speaking people are still mainly anchored in our church and our religion. We are still mainly Calvinists. We are permeated by that great complex of principles called Calvinism, that code of moral, ethical and religious principles. They form part of our pattern of life. They form part of our being, of our upbringing. We cannot be anything else. In that pattern of life there are a few principles which I want to mention.</p>

<p>The first is the basic principle of Calvinism, i.e. that one must always act in an upright and just manner. We may differ among one another about what is just and upright, but one dare never differ in the implementation, the pursuit and the practical application of what is upright. That is why everyone who knows the Nationalist Afrikaner, this Calvinistic Afrikaner, knows that he need never fear injustice from him. Do we not have a striking example in our very first Nationalists of the Transvaal, the Voortrekkers&#x003F; Is it not striking that those Voortrekkers trekked into the country but that they never deprived others of even the smallest part of their land or territory, not even when those others were far weaker than they were&#x003F; This is part of the Calvinistic view of life. It is part of the Calvinistic principle of life.</p>

<p>But there is a second principle which is also of importance here, i.e. that every Calvinist recognizes the diversity of creation. In other words, he recognizes the worth of other groups and other peoples. Because he recognizes this, he must acknowledge their right to be themselves. He must acknowledge their right to their language, culture, way of life, <span class="col_3881-3882" refersTo="page_0428"/>customs, everything which is their own, whether they are a highly civilized people or whether they are a primitive section of the population. This principle is also part of the Calvinistic code of African Nationalism. That is why the English-speaking people need never fear that the Calvinistic Afrikaner or the Nationalist will ever deny the English-speaking people any of their rights. They need never fear that the Calvinist, the Nationalist, will want to deprive the English-speaking people of their rights. They know that the rights of the English-speaking people and those of every other section of the population are as safe in the hands of the Afrikaans-speaking Nationalist, the Calvinistic Nationalist, as in their own hands. [Interjections.] I should like to reply to the hon. member for Transkei&#x2019;s interjection, but my time is very limited.</p>

<p>The third and great principle in the life of the Nationalist and the Calvinistic Afrikaner is his love of freedom; freedom of the individual and of his people. No one, not even an individual or a government, dare interfere with that freedom. For that the Calvinistic Nationalist has always sacrificed everything; and for that he will never cease to fight in the future against anyone who dares to interfere with those rights.</p>

<p>The fourth characteristic of this Calvinistic Afrikaner is the principle that he subjects himself to authority. He will assert himself strongly against any element which wants to put an end to authority in an unlawful way. He will not hesitate to act and to act strongly. He will not hesitate to use the 90-day provision; he will not hesitate to use the 180-day provision; he will not shrink from house arrest, from curtailing freedom of movement or curtailing freedom of agitation. However, there is always one limit to that. That is that he will not hesitate to maintain authority, as long as that authority over him is just and upright in its actions. Throughout history the Calvinist has always rejected such authority as soon as he became convinced that it has changed into tyranny. This is the guarantee for everyone in South Africa.</p>

<p>This is because the Calvinistic Afrikaner subjects himself to authority in this way; it is because he has those ideals and principles which I have briefly mentioned that the Calvinistic Afrikaner, the Nationalist, makes such a good, such an ideal fighter and such a good soldier for white civilization. That is why he is still in existence here in South Africa, while all around us in the world so many other civilized nations have collapsed; while so many have disappeared from Africa. That is why he will also stand firm when the forces of the future again threaten our civilization and our white population.</p>

<p>Let me now come to the second section of our population, our English-speaking Afrikaners. Our English-speaking Afrikaners have wonderful virtues by which they have rendered tremendous services to South Africa.</p>

<p>However, basically they are not Calvinists; basically they differ from the Nationalist Afrikaners; basically the English-speaking Afrikaner is liberal. I do not want to explain how I see and sum up the English-speaking Afrikaner. I should like one of them to speak here himself, one who was a leader among them and who is to-day still a leading figure. It is none other than &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; Calpin, and he testified as follows in his recent work: &#x201C;At last we have got our country back&#x201D;. The hon. members opposite can judge for themselves whether he is correct or not. Notwithstanding the fact that the hon. members are laughing, they will nevertheless agree with me eventually that he is correct. Calpin states:</p>

<block name="quote">The English seldom get rid of their Englishness and there is a bit of Englishness in the majority that reflects the broad liberalism of British politics. They still cling to a few British ideas about freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, the rule of law, the sanctity of the individual and the right of every man to be afforded a fair trial. However vague their interpretation of individual liberty, they believe in it as the cornerstone of democracy. Their interest in these things may be blurred, their vigilance dimmed by distance and environment, but these things still form part of every Englishman&#x2019;s heritage, the product of his upbringing and education. There are things being done which do not accord with their idea of what is right and what is just; things like the usurpation of the powers that rightly belong to the judges, tampering with the rule of law, the 90 and the 180 days detention without trial, without charges being laid, the house arrests and the bannings that are a denial of free speech.</block>

<p>I think that none of the members on the other side will say that Mr. Calpin is not absolutely correct in his description of the English-speaking people. This liberalism forms part of the very being of our English-speaking friends. They can no more divorce themselves from that than we can divorce ourselves from our Calvinistic background. That is the reason why our English-speaking people fall victim to the onslaughts of the communists and of the new leftist movements which always use their freedom to destroy freedom. This liberalism is so deeply ingrained in our English-speaking compatriots that they themselves find it difficult to take action against those communistic and leftist movements when those movements make an attack upon them. This is the reason why the English-speaking people have been forced out of Africa. This is perhaps the reason why they are to a large extent being displaced in their own country to-day.</p>

<p>When Mr. Macmillan came to South Africa with his message of liberalism, his aim was <span class="col_3883-3884" refersTo="page_0429"/>specifically to get our English-speaking friends to surrender and to paralyse them. But it was his intention to paralyse us, as the Calvinistic and Nationalist Afrikaners, as well. We as a white nation would have collapsed if our English-speaking friends had had to stand alone, because they did not see their way clear to identifying themselves with the means which Calpin mentioned, i.e. the 90-day provision, the 180-day provision, house arrest and the silencing of the agitators&#x2014;those measures which were so absolutely and inexorably necessary if we wanted to maintain ourselves and a white civilization in South Africa. The man who displays those qualities of being able to stand as a champion, as the soldier, not only for himself but for the entire white civilization in South Africa, is the man who has been his own salvation throughout the decades, and has in the process saved his English-speaking compatriots and civilization. That man is the carrier of the code of powerful moral, ethical and religious principles, those principles which strengthen one spiritually to withstand the mightiest onslaughts. It is this Afrikaner Nationalist and these Calvinistic principles which have helped to establish civilization so forcefully here in Southern Africa for 300 years. In the struggle which lies ahead for us, perhaps the fiercest and greatest that lies ahead for us, it will once more be the man who is the bearer of these wonderful Calvinistic principles who will fight at the forefront of the struggle for our civilization. But there is a condition attached to this. This condition is that we shall be able to rely on him only as long as he is in fact the bearer of those Calvinistic principles. The moment he forsakes those principles his power will collapse. If it is our earnest intention to safeguard this civilization of the white man, to resist the onslaughts which are going to be made upon us in the future, it is inexorably necessary for us to put an end to these onslaughts, these continual, subtle onslaughts upon our spiritual make-up.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have always had the greatest respect for the person of the hon. member for Ermelo. That is why I should, at this stage, also prefer not to indulge in any disparaging remarks about this hon. gentleman. However, I must say that it was a profound disappointment to me that an hon. member with such a good reputation and such a good background could make the speech he made here this afternoon. Just look at his simplistic view of the English-speaking section of the South African nation. According to him they are an incorrigibly liberalistic group. [Interjections.] This is a simplistic view. To him Calvinism is quite irreconcilable with that. Anybody who knows anything about Calvinism, also knows that at the time when Calvinism itself originated it was attacked for being liberalistic. If this irreconcilable conflict between the Afrikaans-speaking and the English-speaking groups does allegedly exist, the question is, what is wrong with the National Party&#x2019;s attempt at creating national unity&#x003F; It is disappointing to see that a man such as that hon. member has made no progress whatsoever in his thinking in the politics of South Africa. Although it is very easy for me to do so, it stands to reason that I cannot react to his whole speech now. I want to deal with the Budget as well. But let us just look at a few of the statements the hon. member made. Firstly, he said that we on this side were only concerned about the black man, whereas his Party was concerned about the white man.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is easy to say that, but it is untrue. What we on this side are concerned about, is the question of justice. This is the point at issue as far as we are concerned. We are concerned about the position of the white man, even more so than hon. members on that side are, for the simple reason that we know that, unless the white man in South Africa is fair towards the other race groups, he has no future in this country. Therefore, when we make a plea for the black man or the brown man, it should be seen as a plea that the power which we as the white rulers in South Africa have exclusively in our hands be used in such a manner that the non-Whites may look upon us as friends and allies and not as enemies. It is no use the hon. member holding up to us here the terrorism on our borders. It is no use bringing up here the hostility which is mounting up against us abroad. Of course, it is true that this hostility is mounting up. In fact, far from improving, our position abroad is deteriorating. What the hon. member for Ermelo and the Government should tell us, is what they are going to do locally to ensure that, when dangers arise on our borders on a large scale, the black man and the brown man will look upon the white man as a friend and an ally and will not turn against him. That is what we want from the Government, and when that hon. member can rise in this House and tell us what the Government is doing towards making the non-Whites the friends of the white man, I shall say that it is a Party which looks after the interests of the white man. He came forward with the same old story that the whole outside world only had one thing in mind, namely to squash the white man in South Africa.</p>

<p>That is the biggest nonsense I have ever heard. After all, hon. members on that side are not the only members who are familiar with countries abroad; here on this side we also have a few members who are familiar with them. I myself have never met a statesman or a responsible politician in the outside world&#x2014;I <span class="col_3885-3886" refersTo="page_0430"/>am not referring to the lot of communists&#x2014;who wants to see the end of the white man in South Africa. This is a very easy method of stirring up feelings. The world, Mr. Speaker, is a world of diversity. South Africa&#x2019;s problems are not unique. When we appeared before the World Court, our own advocate mentioned 50 countries which had the same problems South Africa had. That was our strongest argument, i.e. that there were 50 other countries which had the same problems we had. The world is a world of diversity. All over the world there are differences as regards languages, religions, cultures, colours, and they are being accepted as such; but all over the world people try to govern in such a way that the one man does not exist at the expense of the other. I have never met anybody in the outside world who was not in favour of the survival of the white man in South Africa; nobody is against that.</p>

<p>I would admit it, most certainly, but let me say this to the hon. the Minister: We are trying our best to break away from it. When one takes over a government, one inherits certain circumstances which cannot be changed overnight. But the difference is that that Government is making a virtue out of discrimination. At least, we admit that this is something from which we should try to break away. That is the difference. We are not the only people who say this. It astonishes me that the Minister should ask me such a question if what the Minister of Foreign Affairs is propagating abroad is that it is the object of his Government to do away with discrimination. [Interjections.] We do not deny that there is discrimination in South Africa, and if we were to take over to-morrow, we would have to contend with the problem of discrimination. [Interjections.] But we are not going to make a virtue and a holy cow and an ideology out of discrimination. That is the difference.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo had a great deal to say about the justice Calvinism requires, but can he honestly and truly say that justice is being done to the Coloureds&#x003F; They do not have a homeland of their own, but what is done in the case of the Coloureds&#x003F; They are given a separate &#x201C;little parliament&#x201D;, which from the nature of the case is nothing but, or cannot be anything but, a forum for discussion. It can never become a parliament in the true sense of the word. It cannot impose any taxes whatsoever. It has no autonomy. In actual fact, in that respect it does not have the power of a divisional council. I think it is tragic that a party such as this one, which was born out of the struggle against imperialism in South Africa, should now call the Afrikaner to a new kind of imperialism, this time against the Coloureds. The Coloureds must remain subservient and subject to the imperium for ever; they can never become part of it. I think this is a tragic shift. I want to know what morality there is on the part of a party which went from strength to strength in its struggle against imperialism, and now we have the shift from the old British imperialism towards the Afrikaner to Afrikaner imperialism towards the Coloureds.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>We shall deal with that again. We shall still thrash out this whole matter. We shall have to speak to the Prime Minister as well. [Interjections.] I cannot go on replying to all the points raised by the hon. ex-Minister, but let me say that it was a disappointment to hear a speech of this nature from him.</p>

<p>The Budget debate of the past week showed once again that the task of analysing and criticising measures taken by the Government fell almost exclusively on the shoulders of less than a quarter of the members of this Parliament, i.e. the Opposition. One finds that in the British Parliament, from which we have taken over certain practices, members of Parliament differentiate between two aspects.</p>

<p><span class="col_3887-3888" refersTo="page_0431"/>They differentiate between the political policy and the principles they support on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the administration of the Government. That is why one finds that a Government member in the British Parliament feels as free to criticize Government measures as do members of the Opposition; and I think that this is the right approach. But what do we find here in this House&#x003F; Here we find that the majority of the members on that side are apparently of the opinion that the only function which a Government member has, is to take stock of the Opposition, its past, its present and its reputed policy, as if we were the party that was in power. There are a few exceptions.</p>

<p>There was the hon. member for Waterkloof whose plea was that the purchase tax should rather be levied at the selling point so that one might eliminate the pyramidal growth of prices. We had the hon. member for Sunnyside who would rather have had a capital gains tax. We had the hon. member for Humandsdorp who wanted to do away with divisional council rates and taxes and wanted there to be a uniform burden on all the taxpayers in the provinces. And there was a speech which made a favourable impression, i.e. that of the hon. member for Windhoek, who made his maiden speech here to which I should like to refer for a few moments. I just want to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate him on what he said and the way in which he put it. It stands to reason that we on this side will not always agree with his political views, nor will he with ours, but I think I can give him the assurance that the House will always grant recognition to his extensive and profound knowledge of the affairs of South-West.</p>

<p>I want to pause for a moment at the position of South-West Africa, since the hon. member made a plea here to the effect that there were special circumstances in South-West Africa which did not apply here and special problems which were different from what was the case in the Republic. I am sure that what the hon. member would have liked to have added, was to make this appeal to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;an appeal which, however, he could not make openly&#x2014;namely that South-West Africa should as a result be treated differently as well. It is a pity that that speech could not have been made here a few weeks ago, for at that time we had a very serious debate here on the position of South-West. We on this side adopted the attitude that we must differentiate between unity and uniformity and that in the political sphere South-West had already reached political unity with the Republic years ago; it has in fact been granted as many as 10 representatives in the two Houses of Parliament. For all practical purposes South-West has become part of the sovereignty of South Africa; it could, therefore, not attain a greater measure of political unity than it already has. But in addition to that unity it was privileged, owing to its special problems, which the hon. member for Windhoek outlined, in that it was granted a special measure of administrative and taxation autonomy which enabled it to deal with its special problems at first hand and on the spot, without delay and in accordance with its own needs. This was a privilege which the Republic was quite willing to grant and allow South-West.</p>

<p>But what did we subsequently find here&#x003F; Every hon. member for South-West Africa rose and made a plea not for unity, because the territory already had that, but for uniformity and for doing away with the privileges the territory was enjoying. The Government encouraged them and the Government issued a White Paper in which it gave South-West an undertaking in two places. Firstly, the Government said that it was extremely desirable that any rearrangement should cause the population of South-West as little disruption as possible and should not impose additional burdens on the taxpayers of the territory. The same undertaking was confirmed in the White Paper in another place. I should be glad to hear from the hon. the Minister of Finance what his attitude is in regard to this position; and perhaps the hon. the Minister of the Interior, who launched the legislation through this House, should also tell us what view he takes of this undertaking now, in the light of the Budget as it was presented.</p>

<p>I can see the difficulty the hon. the Minister of Finance has. If he gives better treatment to one section of the taxpayers in his care than he does to another section, then he is going to have trouble on his hands, and if he does not do so in the case of the South-West taxpayers, then he also has trouble on his hands. I can tell the hon. the Minister that his own side will level the accusation that the Government displays a lack of loyalty. The official mouthpiece of the Government in South-West has already done so in almost as many words, and this is what it says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government made it very clear in the White Paper that &#x201C;it was extremely desirable that any rearrangement should cause the population of South-West Africa as little disruption as possible and should not impose additional burdens on the taxpayers of the territory&#x201D;. Therefore, if the interpretation that the above forms of taxation will in fact be applicable to South-West, proves to be correct, it would not be in line with the Government&#x2019;s undertaking given in the White Paper. (<i>Die Suidwester</i>&#x2014;28.3.&#x2019;69.)</block>

<p>I do not think there is any need for me to quote what was written about that in the Opposition newspapers. They prove that in some cases certain groups of taxpayers in South-West are now paying up to R100 more than people in the Republic who fall into the same group. I shall leave the matter at that in the hope that the hon. the Minister will <span class="col_3889-3890" refersTo="page_0432"/>give us clarity in regard to this situation. As for the rest we shall simply have to leave it to the South-West members to manoeuvre themselves out of this position.</p>

<p>The Budget speech which the hon. the Minister made on 24th March, is undoubtedly one of the most interesting speeches I have heard for a long time. I must admit that my first impression was a very favourable one. The hon. the Minister removed the tax bulge. Our own attitude was that this was an unfair bulge. In the light of the fact that the Government has regularly been over-taxing the country by millions, we have always felt that this was an unnecessary tax bulge which could be removed. He made a concession in regard to the earnings of married women. Our attitude is that something is better than nothing, but we nevertheless feel that the Government should tax men and women who were married out of community of property separately.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. the Minister held out the prospect that provincial taxation would be eliminated in due course and incorporated in the general income tax. That is a welcome development. To-day one often hears the concept &#x201C;one-stop bank&#x201D; mentioned. The plea I want to make to the hon. the Minister is that he should become a &#x201C;one-stop tax collector&#x201D;. I hope he will consider the possibility that in due course even radio tax, such as radio licences, and perhaps even motor car tax on the basis of the weight of the car, may be included in a one-stop tax assessment, so that waste and duplication may be eliminated and economizing may be promoted in South Africa.</p>

<p>Of course, the biggest disappointment we had in the Budget, was the following: I do not know whether we listened inattentively, nor do I in any way want to create the impression that the hon. the Minister deliberately gave us the wrong impression, but most of us were firmly under the impression that the purchase tax would only be in respect of non-essential goods. It was on this basis that we accepted the idea of a purchase tax. But what do we find now&#x003F; After all, the hon. the Minister should be aware of the fact that over the past year or two a whole new class of rich people has come into existence in South Africa. A new plutocracy has come into existence all of a sudden. People who had nothing or very little, have become millionaires and semi-millionaires through the Stock Exchange. There are thousands of them. I should like to know how many people do in actual fact give Hollard Street in Johannesburg as their business address to-day. I do not mean this in a figurative sense, because I personally know of many young men who have given up their normal jobs and are studying stock lists virtually day and night in order to examine what they call buying signals and in this way to make thousands of rands on the Stock Exchange. I do not criticize this. There is nothing wrong with a man using his talents or his intelligence to enrich himself in an honest manner. My point is that the gap between the rich and the poor in South Africa has grown into a colossal one. I want to go so far as to say that the gap between the rich and the poor has widened dangerously in our country, owing to the circumstances I mentioned. I am not blaming the hon. the Minister. In fact, the entire country would have been much more prosperous if we did not have the politics of the Government. But in the present circumstances, whereas there is such a colossal gap between the richest and the poorest at present, there is something which the hon. the Minister should try to avoid like the plague. He must not allow that gap to widen by imposing additional burdens on the poor and the average. This is exactly what he is going to do this year. I do not wish to repeat what has already been said, but, surely, the Minister cannot tell us that articles such as soap, matches, umbrellas, tableware, spoons and forks, electric bulbs, motor cars and combs are not essential articles. Even motor cars. There is such a thing as a luxury motor car, and nobody would have minded if the hon. the Minister had levied a tax on luxury motor cars. But the prices of motor cars are high as they are, and now the Minister levies another tax of R100 on a motor car which costs R2,000 to-day. That will be the basic assessment, i.e. without the increases which will be added before it reaches the retailer. I must say that we did not expect this from the hon. the Minister. He is the person who in former years was in charge of a major Reddingsdaad organization in South Africa. At that time his plea was that mothers should not be forced through economic circumstances to go to work outside their homes. Well, what does the position look like to-day&#x003F; There are income groups in which there are few women who are not forced through economic circumstances to go to work outside their homes. As matters are today, 300,000 South Africans land in court every year for non-payment of debts. One is keen to see what the figures would be in the future as a result of this new tax. Less than five months ago the Minister still appeared before the nation in his old attire. That was when he opened the Fiat factory at Rosslyn. Let us listen to what he had to say on that occasion. &#x201C;A motor car for every family should be our own aim.&#x201D; The following report appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> of 22.11.&#x2019;68 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A chicken in the pot for every family in France every Sunday&#x2014;that was the aim of King Henry IV. Dr. Nic Diederichs, Minister of Finance, has now spoken in another direction: &#x201C;A motor car in the backyard of every family in South Africa. I am convinced that we can make this our aim in South Africa, but it means that the income of our people must be increased. Once we have done so, we shall have struck a great blow for progress. King Henry thought that he would be a good king if he <span class="col_3891-3892" refersTo="page_0433"/>could give every family a Sunday chicken, but with the exception of housing, a family spends most of its money on a motor car. Therefore, if we want to make a motor car available to every family, the price of motor cars will have to be brought within the reach of every family.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That is what he said only five months ago. To-day we have, instead of a kindly King Henry, a King Midas before us. What is the reason why the Minister does not tax luxury motor cars only&#x003F; Let the people who want to drive in such black ships, such as those which are parked here in Parliament Street, pay for them. Why should the man in the street be taxed as heavily as is the rich man with his limousine&#x003F;</p>

<p>This Budget has already been given many names&#x2014;a champagne budget, a rich man&#x2019;s budget, and so forth. In the olden days we had the Hoggenheimer figure in our politics. I can well imagine what a cartoonist such as Boonzaier would have done with this Budget if it had been presented by a United Party government. He would have presented it like this: Hoggenheimer with the broadest smile possible and two cigars in his mouth. For, there is no doubt about it, here we have a Budget which bears the stamp of Hoggenheimer. The weaker are being swamped with taxes in order that the stronger may be accommodated.</p>

<p>I know that when we level criticism at budgets, the Minister wants to know from us, by way of a fair counter-question, what other means he should employ in order to obtain funds for the State. What are our proposals&#x003F; This is a fair counter-question and as far as this Budget is concerned, the hon. member for Constantia has furnished a satisfactory reply. Without a doubt he has proposed the most constructive amendment I can remember in my time in this House. As far as the longer term is concerned, the answer is as clear. I say that the time has come for the Government to review its apartheid programme, to see where waste, futilities, duplication of services and white elephants may be eliminated. The way a certain Government newspaper put it recently was that apartheid was struggling unnecessarily under superfluous burdens, burdens which it ought to discharge. For a young country such as we are, we are at any rate living too far back in the past. The time at my disposal will not allow me to mention more than one or two examples. Just look at the excessive urge to legislate on the part of the Government, while knowing that every new law entails new staff, new offices and new expenditure for the country. Look at the excessive Pretorianism in South Africa. Even the most insignificant matter has to be referred to Pretoria to-day. I think it is outrageous for us to have a situation where a member of the Cabinet has to decide whether a non-White may attend a white sports meeting or whether a white person may appear before a nonwhite audience. These are things which cost time and money.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now reached the Third-Reading stage of this Bill, a Bill where a Minister has taken it on himself to form a university for the Indian people of Natal, to cobble it, if I may put it that way, on exactly the same last as that used for the universities for the other racial groups. We on this side have again and again made the point that the Minister is making a grave and serious mistake in adopting word for word and comma for comma the Bill which has been drafted also for the other racial groups, irrespective of the degree of education and of the progress which each one has made and the contribution each one is making to their own education processes. By doing this, the Minister was short-sighted.</p>

<p>Consequently, throughout this debate we have tried to put forward amendments which would create a situation better suited to the needs of the Indian community as it exists today, but we have come up against a blank wall as far as the Minister is concerned. We have been unable to call forth a change of heart. We have been told that this is what the Department has put up; that this is the plan for the Indian community. What is more, we have had nothing from the Minister to give the Indian community any indication of what the future holds for them.</p>

<p><span class="col_3893-3894" refersTo="page_0434"/>Sir, when we now come to the Third Reading of this Bill, we have to consider what the Minister has created. What he has created is a university which is in effect an extension of his own Department. What has happened is that he has created a council which will run the affairs of the university, but which will be under the day-to-day control of the Department. The Minister&#x2019;s power will in this case obviously be delegated to the Secretary, and through the Secretary to various officials charged with the affairs of the university. The Minister will not deny that the council is bound hand and foot and head and tongue by the Department. What is in fact going to happen is that the council, which consists of white people appointed by reason of their familiarity with such matters or their ability to cope with the demands of running a university, will be at the Minister&#x2019;s beck and call. They will have to answer to him for every decision they make. In many cases they will be incapable of making any decision at all, without the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s permission. This position, which is bad enough, will be compounded, because, in terms of the Bill, an advisory council is appointed, which will consist of Indians. The whole purpose of the advisory council is that they will learn from the council how to run a university. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that the only thing they can learn from the council under the present terms of the Bill is how to say &#x201C;ja baas&#x201D;. That is about all that can happen, because they will have to consult with the council, somehow or other. They are going to have to learn from the council how to run a university, but the council itself, in terms of the Bill which we have before us to-day, is not entrusted with the running of the university as such, except in regard to the most pedestrian matters. All the most important decisions are taken by the Department, and the Department will in effect be responsible for the really important decisions that are taken by the council in the running of this university. I am quite certain that the hon. the Minister will not attempt to controvert that statement.</p>

<p>There are large questions which have been left open in this matter. The hon. the Minister, when he replied to some of the questions put to him during the Committee Stage, said in passing that there is nothing in the Bill which prevents him from appointing an Indian senate. I wonder whether he will tell us whether he intends doing so. All he is going to have now is a white senate and an Indian advisory senate. In regard to the future of this unversity, the intention is to allow the Indians to take over the university, if and when they become fitted to run a university. At no stage at all during the whole of this debate has the Minister set any kind of guide line by which the Indian people can fashion their participation in the running of this university. We have no idea whatever of what the Minister will regard as being fitting evidence of the fact that they have learnt enough from their association with the council that he has appointed.</p>

<p>How are the Indian community, who are going to accept this university and who are, I believe, going to show a tremendous interest in it, going to know that they are working in the right direction&#x003F; How are they going to know that they are even getting warm when it comes to the question of the taking over of the running of this university&#x003F; Obviously a community such as the Indians will be desperately interested in acquiring full control of their own university, because this is a prestige symbol, if ever there was one.</p>

<p>The only suggestion we had throughout the whole of this debate was from the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, who said that the Indian community can take over the control of their university when they can pay for it. On two occasions I have asked the hon. the Minister whether that is his opinion and whether that is the policy of the Department. If it is, will he tell us how the Indian community are going to acquire the financial resources to pay for the running of this university&#x003F; Will it be through their council, or will it be by means of taxation that they are going to raise sufficient money for this purpose&#x003F; Will those powers then at a later stage be extended to the council&#x003F; This Minister is the Minister of Indian Affairs. He is responsible to the Cabinet, bur surely to goodness it is his responsibility to indicate to the Indian community what their future is going to be, and in what direction it lies&#x003F; Surely he must indicate to them what they must aim at and what they must achieve. This whole Bill is one gigantic question mark as to what the future of this university is going to be, how that future is going to be determined, and what the relationship between the council and the advisory council is going to be when it comes to the question of when the one is going to take over from the other.</p>

<p>What we have had from the hon. the Minister is what might in other circles be called a diplomatic silence, but I feel that in this particular case it is not a diplomatic silence at all. It is something which is to be deplored, and I feel that the hon. the Minister, when he replies to this debate, could quite well let us have some idea as to how he thinks these things are going to develop and how he feels that the Indian community must act and must shape their path and their course in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I might just for a moment speak in a lighter vein: This, is, of course, an academic subject, and it is a matter of a university which will obviously have a faculty of English literature. We on our side would like to suggest to the Minister and the Department that they should make compulsory a study of the poetry of Robert Browning. We have found something which we felt was very appropriate to this particular Bill; it is under the heading of &#x201C;Dramatic Romances&#x201D;, and it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What&#x2019;s become of Waring</block>

<block name="quote">How he must have cursed our revels!</block>

<block name="quote">Ay and many other meetings,</block>

<block name="quote">Oh, could I have him back once more, This Waring, but one half day more! Back, with the quiet face of yore.</block>

<p>We felt that this was a matter which the hon. the Minister was perhaps getting a little upset about. To go a little bit further, Sir, it occurred to me that the ghost of Mr. Shastri may well be extremely interested in the development which is taking place here at this particular time, that great man who had the cause of Indian education so much at heart. If he were with us to-day, he might well say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let Waring end what I begun!</block>

<block name="quote">Then he steals out,</block>

<block name="quote">Only the night conceals his face</block>

<block name="quote">While small birds said to themselves</block>

<block name="quote">What should soon be actual song,</block>

<block name="quote">And young gnats by tens and twelves,</block>

<block name="quote">Made as if they were the throng.</block>

<p>Sir, this is something which the hon. the Minister might quite well suggest to his Department should be made compulsory reading.</p>

<p>Sir, we on this side want to say that we will oppose the Third Reading of this measure because it fails to indicate to the Indian community what they can expect of the hon. the Minister; it has given them a form of university education without any of the real substantive powers that make a university as such. We feel that this is something on which the Minister could quite well have given way; that he could quite well have formed it in another fashion; that he could quite well have placed his trust in the Indian people, and for that reason we shall oppose the Third Reading or this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at this stage we have listened to numerous words from the hon. the Opposition on this series of Bills. Most of their objections dealt mainly with the machinery and the methods to be applied in order to implement what actually is the two main provisions contained in these Bills. These are the elevation of the institutions to university status and the granting of university and academic autonomy to these institutions. We were sorry to learn through the mouth of the hon. member for Mooi River that the Opposition was going to vote also against the Third Reading of this Bill. We expected to hear more concrete arguments being advanced even at this late stage of the debate why the Opposition was not in favour of this measure. I shall go into this more deeply, but first I want to make a few remarks about what was said by the hon. member for Mooi River. This Bill had been taken virtually word for word from the old Act of the University College and corresponded virtually word for word to the Acts on the Bantu Universities. The Opposition must realize that this Bill is before this House in its present form after very thorough consultation with the council as well as the advisory council of the university college. Sir, the hon. member is pulling a sour face&#x2014;I should really say more sour than usual&#x2014;but the fact of the matter is that the Indians prefer this Bill in this form with all the implications it has, and when I say this, I ask the hon. member please to take my word for this. The idea took root in Natal that because this university was an Indian university, the people would not necessarily be dependent on state funds to keep the university going; that the Indians themselves were in a position already to pay for their own university training. This specific point was taken up with the Indian advisory council and their reply was that they were not ready as yet to provide their own finances.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River also spoke of a &#x201C;ja baas&#x201D; relationship. To me this does not sound very true or very sincere; nor does it sound to me as though the hon. member knows the Indians very well, because on that level I surely do not know the Indians as &#x201C;ja baas&#x201D; people. The advisory council of the university college for Indians takes an active interest in everything done at their university. At the same time they take great pride in it. But even the Indian advisory council has never asked to become the council and to take over the university at this early stage. In any event, I do not want to rely solely on the question of finance as a factor which will determine when this university can be taken over by the Indians themselves, because to me the academic maturity attained by this university is of much more importance than the financial aspect. I ask the hon. member for Mooi River to come to the realization that out of a total establishment of 141 there are only 27 Indian staff members at the present time. This still is a very small percentage and this percentage of Indian staff members is still working under the guidance of the white staff members.</p>

<p>We are sorry that the Opposition is again adopting this attitude also at the Third Reading of this Bill. Sir, let us discuss the matter more fundamentally. What we are dealing with here is the fundamental difference in principle between the National Party on the one hand and the United Party on the other hand. We still believe&#x2014;and we shall not deviate from this standpoint&#x2014;that open universities must lead to and move in the direction of integration, and this we do not want. Not <span class="col_3897-3898" refersTo="page_0436"/>only do we believe this to be anthropologically and pedagogically wrong, but we also believe that it is not in the best interests of the education of these people. The United Party is in fact still clinging to the view so clearly expressed in 1959 when Nusas said, &#x201C;We state as a principle the abolition of the colour bar in education&#x201D;. The country should know that this is the real objection of the Opposition to this specific Bill. As a matter of fact, this attitude with regard to the removal of the colour bar in education was recently repeated in this House by the hon. member for Houghton, and along with her, by none other than the hon. member for Durban (Central). On the other hand, the Leader of the Opposition maintained that they had no objection to the establishment of separate universities for non-Whites, provided that there was a demand for such universities. [Interjection.] But the hon. member for Durban (Central) says that he does have objection to that. This is the very point I am trying to make. Now we are entitled to ask whether 1,701 students are not sufficient proof of a demand which exists for this type of education to be given&#x003F; If the hon. member for Mooi River wants to speak as a sensible educationist, we have to accept him as such. I do not know what special knowledge he has of teaching and of education, but I want to accept his <i>bona fides.</i> I did not gain the impression before that he specifically had any fundamental objection to this Bill. This simply concerns minor and less important matters. But then we are entitled to ask: If he and the hon. member for Kensington speak with the same voice, and we notice that they do not have fundamental objections in principle to the Bill, we ask on whose behalf he is speaking&#x003F; Is he speaking on behalf of the entire United Party or is he also speaking on behalf of the hon. member for Houghton, and then again, along with her, on behalf of the hon. member for Durban (Central)&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>I do not even know whether the hon. member can distinguish between what is nonsense and what is not. Is he speaking on behalf of the Japie Bassons or on behalf of the John Wileys in his party&#x003F; You know, Sir, there is quite a difference between those two. Is he speaking on behalf of Mr. Douglas Mitchell or on behalf of Mr. Mike Mitchell&#x003F; There is a world of difference between those two. I should very much like to know this. I think it is important for us to know these things. I should not like to accuse the wrong people when I speak outside this House about the attitude adopted by the Opposition in regard to this Bill. I want to suggest that there are people on the opposite side of this House who support this Bill practically 100 per cent, and I do not have any doubt when I say this, but there are also people opposite who hold the same views in respect of this Bill as the Progressive Party does. Surely we are entitled to say therefore that the Official Opposition does not speak with one voice as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>The question is still being asked why the Indians cannot receive higher education along with the Whites in the same institution. I am going to quote what Dr. Louis Bosman said at one time, and he used to be a United Party Member of Parliament for Gardens as well as a member of the Executive Committee of the Council of the University of Cape Town. He made this statement (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Neither the White nor the non-White is happy at the same university. The non-White does not feel at home because of, as he says, a lack of respect, and the White feels uncomfortable because he cannot fraternise with the non-White.</block>

<p>But the hon. member for Durban (North) also wanted to hold forth on the so-called difference in education in the white and in these non-white institutions. He spoke of the &#x201C;difference in education&#x201D;. I do not know whether he meant &#x201C;teaching&#x201D;. He asked whether there was any difference. I do not know whether he distinguished between teaching and education, nor could I deduce that from his use of words in this particular case. But I want to put it very clearly that education as a phenomenon is universal, just as knowledge and truth are universal. I can give him the assurance that education is being put into practice and cultivated at the non-white institutions just as at any other institution in the world. Knowledge is being disseminated and absorbed in the same way, just as one would always work with people in their different circumstances. The truth, as universal reality phenomenon, also remains valid for all times, therefore also at these institutions. To ask therefore whether there now is or in future will be any difference in education at these institutions, is a foolish question. I should have liked the hon. member for Mooi River to have elaborated more on these aspects of the matter. We believe that teaching and education can best be brought to the student at these ethnically classified institutions as a continuation of precisely the ethnically classified school education as it is at present being applied throughout our country and as it was applied in years past and not only under the policy of the government of our party. Surely these hon. members would not deny the need of differentiated education. If man, every person, as unique being may lay a claim to differentiated education, how much more valid is this truth also in respect of different races&#x003F; I take one example. Is the intellect or intelligence of the American Negroes the same as that of the white Americans&#x003F; Is the intelligence of our non-Whites in South Africa the same as that of the Whites in this country&#x003F; We may quote even more striking examples when we quote comparisons between Eastern nations and Western nations.</p>

<p><span class="col_3899-3900" refersTo="page_0437"/>You must understand me very well, Sir, I am not maintaining&#x2014;repeat, not maintaining &#x2014;that their intelligences differ in that the one is higher and the other lower. Therefore I am not making a quantitative difference when I speak of the difference in intelligence. I do want to make a qualitative difference. I want to contend that the intelligences are not necessarily higher or lower, but merely different. This is an anthropological fact which surely cannot be denied, and to me the essence of the existence and the continued existence also of this institution with which we are dealing to-day is rooted in that. I am making a qualitative difference based on the situational and the relational as the basis for the differences amongst people. The phenomenon of education as a primeval phenomenon peculiar to man as a spiritual and existential being is rooted precisely in a knowledge of human nature and is therefore an anthropological-phenomenological-pedagogical phenomenon which we only come across amongst people, as psycho-physical and spiritual beings. Now, the situation and the relation of each person in respect of education do not only differ from person to person, but also from nation to nation. Hence the positive foundation of ethnic institutions such as these as unitary as opposed to pluralistic institutions.</p>

<p>I proceed. The Indian college has already distinguished itself because of, in the first place, the peaceful relations which have always prevailed on the campus, and, in the second place, because economic conditions have not caused friction amongst students. As members of the same nation, poor and rich can tolerate one another on the campus, in spite of economic class distinctions. In the third place, social considerations in respect of language, culture and way of life can be and have been adapted by them at this institution without any difficulties. In the fourth place one can only praise the very successful lecturer-student relations existing at the Indian University College.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to clause 32 of the Bill which makes provision for institutes. One notices that in the application of this clause, particularly in a city like Durban, which is a multi-racial city, and in which this idea of institutes can be extended further, it can be made possible for different faculties and departments to join forces and to launch research projects. I do not know whether this is the original intention of this clause, but it most definitely is a possibility which can be developed in future. In this connection I must mention the fine work which is already being done and which will continue to be done in future, especially under the new dispensation, by the extra-mural classes arranged in the city by this Indian University College.</p>

<p>The United Party must tell us now whether they are opposed to this Bill merely for the sake of the debate or whether they are opposed to the University for Indians. I think we are entitled to ask them this and that we are entitled to receive a reply in this connection. Would they have liked, if this were in their power, to do away with this university, or are they simply yelping for the sake of the outside world and the hostile Press&#x003F; This is a major factor and one which is possibly going to be brought to the forefront again this week. Or are they perhaps inspiring undermining activities from outside once again&#x003F; I can give the Opposition the assurance that as far as these non-White university institutions are concerned, very little undermining has ever come from inside. Undermining has always been carried in from outside by people who sneak on to the campuses even at night to cause trouble under the cloak of student organizations. Even religion has been dragged in in order to bring about undermining on the campuses. I want to ask the Opposition to-day whether their objections to this Bill are not again simply aimed at bringing about this type of undermining from outside. Is their opposition to this measure intended to help the Indians&#x003F; What do the Indians themselves say about the attitude adopted by the United Party in respect of this Bill&#x003F; Does the United Party perhaps in fact agree with the Progressive Party and the Suzmans of that Party where the issue is the protests we apparently have to expect later this week according to newspaper announcements&#x003F; These protests are to commemorate the decennial establishment of these separate institutions for non-Whites. I am now asking the Opposition whether they support this or whether they are opposed to it. I may ask this question because some of their members do in fact agree with the Progressive Party about these matters. I want the Opposition to speak plainly. I do not believe there is a middle course in this regard. Let us get to the heart of the matter. It either is the promotion of the best interests of the Indian students by passing and promoting this Bill or it is cheap politicking, the object of which is not quite clear to us. The speaker who is going to follow me has every right to tell me this. It is either the best interests of the Indian student or it is cheap politicking. I want to ask the Opposition to speak clearly on this matter please and not to blow hot and cold.</p>

<p>I think it is better that that comment be left uncommented upon. The hon. member for Zululand asked whether we want to see this university come to nothing. He also made the statement that all that has been said by hon. members on this side of the House had been said only for overseas consumption. He knew that those statements were wrong when he made them. He also knew the answer to the question when he asked it. Members on this side of the House have spoken throughout this debate with the utmost responsibility. Criticism which has been levelled from this side of the House has been constructive, and not merely destructive. I resent the inference of the hon. member when he inferred that hon. members on this side of the House were not acting in what we consider to be the best interests of the Indian people themselves. That was the only factor which motivated this side of the House. We heard this afternoon from the hon. member for Ermelo and also from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout about the attitude of English-speaking South Africans and I want to say that I associate myself wholeheartedly with what was said by both those hon. members. We are motivated by a sense of fair play. There are no votes for me in fighting here for better opportunities for the Indian people. They have no vote, but they also have no representation in this House. It is up to us, the members of the Opposition, to represent their opinions and to try to protect their rights, because nothing is done by hon. members on that side of the House. It is for this reason that, once again, we will vote against this Bill at the Third Reading.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand asked us to accept his word and that of the hon. the Minister when they said that they had consulted the council and the senate of the university college before this Bill was drafted and presented to Parliament. We accept their word and we know that this was done. We accept their <i>bona fides,</i> but the hon. member for Zululand must not say that this Bill is, therefore, accepted by the Indian people. I deny any contention that is based on this fact. This council and senate are not elected or appointed by the Indian people themselves. This council is appointed by the hon. the Minister. It is his council, and not that of the Indian people, which has accepted this measure. If the hon. member for Zululand was not referring to the council of the university college &#x2014;it was not clear to which council he was referring&#x2014;and he was perhaps referring to the Indian Advisory Council, I want to say again that that is also a body which does not necessarily represent the views of the Indian people in South Africa. This is also a council that is appointed by the hon. the Minister and it is not a <i>sine qua non</i> that their acceptance of this Bill means acceptance by the Indian people. I want to throw back to the hon. member for Zululand the question he threw at us, namely what do the Indians themselves say&#x003F; The hon. member asked this question, but he did not provide an answer. He did not prove in this House that the Indian people accept this Bill as it is drafted.</p>

<p>To which financial relations did he refer&#x003F; Sir, it is not good enough for the hon. member to come with this. So, let us get on to something else which he said. He took exception to my hon. friend, the hon. member for Mooi River, saying that all we are going to teach the Indian people, the advisory council and the advisory senate, was to say &#x201C;Ja, baas&#x201D;. The hon. member saw in that a denigration of the Indian people by the hon. member. But this the hon. member for Mooi River never did. Let me ask the hon. member; if these two bodies are going to sit separately, how are they going to assist to teach the Indian people and help them to advance&#x003F; The hon. member, having been a teacher himself, will know what I mean when I say that example is better than precept. We say, and we have said all along, let these people come together&#x2014;the Indian people and the white leaders. Unfortunately, Sir, it is to be deplored that this is not to take place because of the Bill as it stands to-day.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of academic maturity. With that I shall deal a little later. Towards the end of his speech the hon. member uttered certain very big words. He spoke about the anthropological and pedagogical development of the Indian people. As far as I am concerned, this Bill is merely another manifestation of this Government&#x2019;s preoccupation with the policy of separate non-development&#x2014;separation in all spheres, including education, and non-development for the non-White groups, particularly in the educational sphere. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana is unfortunately not here, because I should like to read to the House what he <span class="col_3903-3904" refersTo="page_0439"/>said in the Second Reading debate on this Bill. In column 3387 of Hansard he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The National Party still proceeds from the standpoint that each population group has the right to retain its own identity and to develop. As long as the National Party&#x2019;s policy is carried out in South Africa, that pattern will be maintained.</block>

<p>Why, Sir&#x003F; Why do we need that&#x003F; Let me pose that question to the hon. member in the same way as he posed his question to us. Why do we need this separation&#x003F; We find it expressed in clauses 2 and 22 that this university is to be for the Indian people only. Therefore, only the Indian people will have free admission to this university. Any other person shall first have to obtain the Minister&#x2019;s permission. I am not, of course, referring to Whites. We accept clause 21.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I accept clause 21. As a matter of fact, we have not opposed this clause at any stage. There is, therefore, no need for the hon. member for Zululand or for the hon. Minister to come and say that we plead for integration. The hon. member for Zululand tried to do that when he tried to tie us to the policy of Nusas, which wants no colour bar in education. The hon. member on our side who is to follow me will have something more to say on this aspect and on our attitude generally towards these non-White universities. Let me, for my part, tell the hon. the Minister that if he had come with a Bill which made this a real university he would have had all the support he needed from this side of the House. He would then not have had the opposition which he has had. As I was saying, the only people who, in terms of the Bill, will have free admission to this university, are the Indian people themselves. This is to be deplored. In Natal we have a vast population of Coloured people and we have an even greater population of Bantu. The greatest concentration of these groups exists in the Durban-Pietermaritzburg complex where this university is situated. But because of the inflexible decision of the Cabinet to establish separate universities for each group, members of the other non-White groups in the Durban-Pietermaritzburg complex will now be compelled to suffer the added inconvenience and extra expense of having to go to some other centre to get their higher education.</p>

<p>This question of separation is carried further in the council and in the senate where, on the Minister&#x2019;s own admission during this debate, they will all be White, and they will all be appointed by the Minister. The advisory senate and council will consist of non-Whites, primarily Indians I assume.</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of non-development. In terms of this Bill the Indian people are going to have no say whatsoever in the running and functioning of their own university. I know the Minister has referred to the advisory senate and the advisory council, but what powers will those bodies have&#x003F; Their names imply they will be merely advisory, and then they will only be consulted on such matters as are referred to them by the Minister through this council that he himself will elect.</p>

<p>We also deplore the fact that there is no provision in this Bill for a convocation. There are many thousands of Indian graduates in South Africa who would welcome the opportunity of taking part in the education of their own people, who would welcome the opportunity of being able to do something constructive for their own university. They are being debarred now because of the inflexibility of the Cabinet. I am not going to blame the Minister for this because I know he is tied by a Cabinet decision. But I do regret he was not able to take the advice of hon. members on this side when they said to him, &#x201C;Do not tie yourself to the other non-White universities&#x201D;. The Indian people are a group on their own and they should have been considered as such and treated as such. The Indian people cannot even donate money to their university, the university for the education of their people, without the prior permission of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>These are some of the reasons why we have opposed this Bill through all stages and why we will vote against it again at this the Third Reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I had hoped that during the Faster recess the Opposition would have arrived at a better insight and would support this Bill at the Third Reading, but this was unfortunately an apparently futile expectation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) claimed that the criticism against the Bill was constructive. I would say that it would actually have been strange to receive constructive criticism from this hon. member while he was in the process of making scornful remarks about the hon. member for Zululand&#x2019;s speech. The hon. member also made another claim here. The hon. member said&#x2014;if I understand him correctly&#x2014;that the reason why the Opposition was taking up the cudgels for the Indians here was because here they have no representation. [Interjections.] I may have understood the hon. member wrongly, but this is the conclusion I drew from his words, i.e. that that was the reason why the United Party had to take up the cudgels for the Indians here. I want to ask the hon. member when the Indians have ever asked the Opposition, or asked him, for that matter, to take up the cudgels for them here, especially in connection with this legislation&#x003F; When have the Indians ever asked the Opposition to discuss this legislation here on their behalf&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_3905-3906" refersTo="page_0440"/>The hon. member referred to clause 21 and I am very glad that he made such a frank admission in respect of it. In the course of my Second-Reading speech I asked the Opposition to say where they stood in connection with clause 21, and now I have received the reply. I am very glad about that. I am glad that progress has been made by the Opposition, because it was the hon. member for Orange Grove who, in 1959, when the Extension of University Education Bill was being discussed here, pleaded for the admission of white students to the University College for Indian students that was then still to be established. I do not have the time now to quote it chapter and verse, but he nevertheless pleaded for that. I am truly glad that the Opposition has now gained other insights, especially in these days when there is so much talk about university autonomy and freedoms, etc.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River said, <i>inter alia,</i> &#x201C;The only thing they can learn is to say &#x2018;Ja, baas&#x2019; &#x201D;. This was with reference to the Indians. But surely this is untrue, surely this is completely untrue. In the course of my speech I shall indicate where Indians, except on the advisory council and the advisory senate, will, according to this measure, be afforded the opportunity of having a joint say in respect of educational matters. If hon. members opposite would listen carefully and be a little more patient with their interjections, they would find out in a moment.</p>

<p>The policy of the establishment of universities in individual national contexts has unquestionably begun to prove itself in respect of the University College for Indians. We on this side of the House pointed out that when the Government decided to establish the University College for Indians in 1960 or 1961, that decision was not exactly welcomed with open arms. We pointed out that during those days that institution had to take its first indecisive steps in a hostile atmosphere. That atmosphere was loaded with prejudice, criticism, antipathy, hostility and mistrust. Those first students actually reported to the university college in a state of uncertainty and confusion. However, in due course the institution began to inspire a great deal of confidence, affection, respect and admiration, and this may be ascribed to a dutiful rector and a very hard-working staff. It is also attributable to the fact that the State and the administrative staff of the Department set, as its point of departure, the ideal of giving only the best to that institution as far as staff and facilities were concerned. The acceptance of this Indian nationally orientated university by the Indian students and the community followed, and in due course the prejudice therefore disappeared. The initially prevalent attitude changed into one of pride in the College and the realization took root that the College was there to serve the Indian community in all respects. The realization took root that the University College had been created to serve the community, to educate the Indian youth academically and otherwise, so that in due course they could hold their own in the Indian community. The realization also took root that the State&#x2019;s intentions were sincere in respect of the Indian population group. Like a tremendous flood-wave that realization engulfs the petty opposition which may still exist.</p>

<p>It is indeed true that criticism does still exist. And that there is perhaps still a lack of interest. Thus, <i>inter alia,</i> it is claimed that the Indians are still being discouraged from studying because posts ostensibly do not exist for Indians with high qualifications and experience. This is a purely political argument. As the process of separate development progresses further, the demand for trained Indians increases all the more. Neither will they displace the Whites on the labour market, because they give vocational guidance and service, and they are destined to give it to their own people. No one realizes this better than the Indians who have already assumed leadership in the Indian community. In the November issue of last year&#x2019;s monthly magazine, <i>Fiat Lux,</i> published by the Department of Indian Affairs, reference is made to a speech which the chairman of the advisory council of the Indian University College held. In that magazine the following appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In stressing the university&#x2019;s important role in meeting the demand for skilled labour, which had increased especially since the last war, Mr. Rjab (chairman of the advisory council) said that more and more non-Whites had to be trained to fill the gap. More and more jobs (according to the chairman) were being done successfully by non-Whites, as it became clear that the White sector could not provide all the manpower necessary to fill the needs of the rampaging economy.</block>

<p>Since its inception, since the first conferment of degrees in 1963, that university college has made tremendous progress. I have here a long list of statistics which I do not want to bother the House with, to indicate what tremendous progress has been made in respect of academic achievements and the obtaining of degrees. These academic achievements of the Indian University College over the past years were good and they are constantly improving, as the statistics also indicate. Everything points to the fact that under the new dispensation the academic achievements will at least be maintained. It is hoped and expected that they will even improve in due course. Then one asks&#x2014;and I associate myself with what the hon. member for Zululand said here&#x2014;why the Opposition is kicking up such a tremendous fuss, in many cases with extremely ill-founded arguments, especially about this new dispensation in connection with the academic autonomy which is being given to the Indian University College. All these arguments about the advisory council, which will, of course, consist only of Indians, about the inferior role it is to fulfil, about the fact that it will only consist of Whites <span class="col_3907-3908" refersTo="page_0441"/>and about the inferior role which the advisory senate is to fulfil, do not hold water. They actually fall flat if one sees them against the background of future additional development of this Indian University. But if we really subject these arguments of the Opposition to the test of reality, the demands of the times and the tests of level-headed thinking, they lose all their apparent force.</p>

<p>But let us in conclusion test them against the feelings and the viewpoints of those directly affected. In the first place the staff are affected. The staff of the university concerned, both white and Indian, welcome the legislation. The hon. member who spoke before me must please tell me whether he can repudiate my statement. Why do they welcome it&#x003F; Because it affords them greater academic scope and independence. In the second place the Indian advisory council of the university college does not oppose it. On the contrary, after they had discussed it very thoroughly they accepted it. I once more ask the hon. member to repudiate this statement I am making. Sir, he remains silent. Thirdly, as far as I have heard, the Indian community are also happy about this legislation. They are happy about the rapid progress and about the confidence which the State places in this university college by allowing this increase status to take place at this moment. I now ask once more, is this correct&#x003F; If the hon. member does not have information to the contrary, he must accept my statement. But the United Party is actually opposed to the dispensation which the State wants to grant to this university college, or by its policy statements, at least wants to delay it. The additional progress and facilities which the Government, as guardian, wants to afford the Indians, at the highest academic level, i.e. the tertiary level, are being opposed by the Opposition. They did the same thing by opposing another excellent measure which was passed in 1965. It was the measure providing for the transfer of primary and secondary education for Indian children to the Department of Indian Affairs. As we know, good progress is at present being made and there is a tremendous amount of development in respect of education as such.</p>

<p>The amendment which the Opposition moved in the Second Reading debate, i.e. to refer the measure to a Select Committee, and the debate in the Committee Stage which lasted for days, is merely proof to me of their delaying tactics and of how they begrudge this advanced community that which could prove of very great and positive value to them in the academic sphere. The Indian community has definitely taken cognizance of this attitude of the Opposition in its rejection of the sincere aims of this legislation.</p>

<p>I promised the hon. member for Mooi River that I would very briefly explain where the Indians were in fact going to obtain a greater say in connection with this legislation and its implementation. In addition to the fact that the Indians will have seats on the advisory council and the advisory senate, although hon. members regard them as secondary councils, they are being brought into the picture as regards study and educational matters. If the hon. member were to study that legislation well, he would especially find three provisions which I want to emphasize here. According to subsection (7) of clause 10 the senate can appoint anyone as an assessor member of a committee of the senate. Such a person may participate in all the proceedings of the meeting but shall not have the right to vote. I believe and accept, as the hon. member probably does as well, that assessor members will to a large extent be Indians. In addition, the council and the senate may, in terms of subsection (1) of clause 12, appoint joint committees of the council and senate for such purposes as the council may determine. Indians may also be involved in such committees. According to subsection (7) of clause 8 the council may appoint committees consisting of members of the council as well as other persons. The council may transfer its functions and certain powers to such a committee. I want to put it to him that under those circumstances, since they are academic in nature, Indians will also probably be appointed.</p>

<p>I merely want to state that responsible Indians do not want further rights or responsibilities transferred at this moment to the Indian population in respect of the University, because they cannot accept it. They are not yet qualified to extend it further. It is a fact that responsible Indians are at this stage very satisfied with the Bill as it stands because they themselves still feel unqualified to take over control and greatly appreciate guidance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Koedoespoort has with great difficulty and a long introduction shown three small points&#x2014;it must have taken him a long time to find them&#x2014;which in his opinion are approaching integration. Those were three small points at which the Indians and the Whites might, not certainly, be permitted to meet in order to discuss and settle matters regarding the university. The hon. member must have a most limited and, I would almost say, dependent idea of the standing of a university if at the end of a debate like this he has struggled to find three minor points on which the Indian and the White man may perhaps meet on a comparatively equal footing.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, but it does not show.</p>

<p>With regard to the hon. the Minister I can understand that his colleagues in the Cabinet, particularly those who are in charge of Bantu universities, feel that such universities must have guiding strings and a certain degree of official control apart from the control of the university authorities themselves. One must <span class="col_3909-3910" refersTo="page_0442"/>remember that the education which the hon. Ministers are giving to these people is in order to civilize them; to improve their civilization; to make the life they lead of a higher standard. However, here the hon. the Minister is dealing with a civilized people. They do not need the guiding strings of the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs. They can guide themselves. They have guided themselves from a very low standard of living, which they had when they first came to this country, to an extremely high standard of living. They also have a high standard of community feeling. It is a distinguishing characteristic of the Indian people that they have a community feeling and that on the whole, those who become wealthy share their wealth with the community as a whole. The hon. the Minister said that he was hurt because I was personal towards him during the Second Reading Debate in saying I regarded the Indians as being unfortunate in that they have come under his personal control. I would have been delighted to withdraw that remark; I would have been pleased indeed if I could have withdrawn that remark at the end of this debate. However, unfortunately these people are still unfortunate. I want to explain to the hon. the Minister why they are unfortunate. They are unfortunate, because while he knew little about them when the hon. the Minister took over this portfolio, he does not know any more now. Had he studied these people; had he given them the attention which his post requires him to give them, he would have realized that he was not dealing with an uncivilized group. He would have realized that he was neither dealing with an aggressive group nor with a people who are un-South African. He would have learned quite easily, as those of us who live in Natal have realized, that here he has a people who are co-operative, who are law-abiding and who are only too willing to join other communities in a national effort. Instead of that, these people, whose ancestors invented writing and language at the time when the Western world understood only the roar of threat, the pantings of fatigue, the moans of pain and the wails of grief, these people who spoke and wrote thousands of years ago, are to be treated like naughty children or if not naughty children, at least children with the possibility of being naughty and irresponsible. Here is a group of people who will make this university a success, because as I say, they are a co-operative people. They will make the best of a bad job, but they cannot make it a university in the international sense, in the thoughts of the people outside this country. The Minister has seen to it that their degrees will receive no recognition but that of degrees of a low standard. The key point of this Bill is that he has taken away from them the possibility of obtaining, outside that of the medical school, a degree in the true sense of the word. He has taken away the blanket cover which they had from the University of South Africa. That is the greatest blow he has dealt to the Indian people, because it will be known that this university is under a dictatorship. Nothing can be done, because every member of the staff, every ounce of salt which is purchased, every lecture which is delivered and every student who is accepted must receive the stamp of permission of the hon. the Minister. What sort of autonomy is this&#x003F; I really cannot understand how the hon. member for Koedoespoort who, as he has said, has served on the council of a university for 20 years, can talk of autonomy in the same breath as this university. This university has no standing and never will have any standing as a university. I am sorry that we have to say that this university will never gain acceptance outside this country. As I have said, the Indians will make it a success, they will benefit by it because they are a people who are prepared to make the best of anything they can get, but the best they can get is a degree which has no value outside this country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to add a word to what the hon. member has said at this final stage of the passage of the Indian University Bill. I should like to deal first with the hon. member for Zululand who, I am sorry, is not here now. Although he is a man of academic experience, he does not seem to understand the question of the autonomy of universities and the position of these university colleges that we have had. I should like to enlighten him as far as I can. I was a member of the commission that sat ten years ago&#x2014;a select committee which became a commission. Today the young people at our universities and the members of their staffs remember what happened ten years ago, and I should like to refresh the memory of hon. members here. We had a Bill before us to establish separate university institutions, but the Bill said that we should have universities for Whites only, universities for Coloureds only, universities for Africans only and for Indians only. We fought the Bill on these grounds; we said that we stood for the autonomy of the universities. If a university wished to admit Whites and Coloureds or Africans, they should have the right to do so. We said that that was fundamental; we said that the university should have that right. We fought for that at every stage. Mr. Speaker, you will remember what happened; we lost that fight. We said: &#x201C;We do not mind how many university colleges you establish; you can establish university colleges for Africans, for Coloureds and for Indians but leave the universities that you have to enjoy their own autonomy and to admit whom they wish.&#x201D; We did not oppose the establishment of separate university colleges. Now we come to the second stage. After the Bill had passed its Second Reading, it was referred to a select committee. What should our attitude have been&#x003F; Should we have said that we disagree with that principle and that we refuse to cooperate or should we have said what we did say: We will co-operate in this select committee after the Second Reading and try to <span class="col_3911-3912" refersTo="page_0443"/>draft a better Bill&#x003F; That is the Parliamentary procedure that I shall refer to later. Having lost on the question of principle, we tried to get a better Bill. We sat as a select committee and then as a commission. I have the report of the commission here. I think because of the misunderstanding that some hon. members have shown here to-day l should show what the points of difference were ten years ago. There were nine points that we formulated: (1) We rejected a council and an advisory council. We wanted one; we did not want an advisory council. (2) We rejected a senate and an advisory senate. (3) We said that the council should be a body corporate. That was finally agreed to. (4) We said that the council was to have representatives on it other than those recommended and nominated by the Minister. (5) We rejected exclusive ethnic divisions. We said that if the Fort Hare College of those days wished to admit Indians or Coloureds in addition to Africans, they should have the right to do so. (6) We rejected the idea that the finance for the Bantu university colleges should come from the Bantu Education Account. That account was established for primary and secondary education. (7) We said that instead of associating these colleges with the University of South Africa, they should be associated with existing universities&#x2014;Fort Hare with Rhodes, the College of the North with Pretoria and the Witwatersrand and so on. (8) We said: Postpone the closing of the open universities; allow them to admit non-Whites for ten years, for the transition period, and we also said that the Minister for these colleges should be the Minister of Education. We said: Postpone proclamation of the Act for ten years, and here we are today after ten years and the Government still have not established separate colleges. There are over 100 Coloureds at the University of Cape Town today. In other words, what we said ten years ago holds good today. What the young people are protesting about at the universities today is not the establishment of these colleges; they are protesting because their universities&#x2014;the Witwatersrand, Cape Town, Rhodes and Natal&#x2014;lost their autonomy. I hope that is quite clear. I have been very anxious to make this clear so that the hon. member for Zululand will understand the position. If people say, as he did, that the United Party is in favour of mixed universities they are wrong. The United Party has never said anything of the kind. What the United Party has said is that we stand for university autonomy. Let us take the two universities here, Cape Town and Stellenbosch. Stellenbosch, in the exercise of its authority, says &#x201C;We do not want non-Whites,&#x201D; and we say that Stellenbosch should have the right to say that. We do not want any law to say to Stellenbosch, &#x201C;You must admit Coloureds.&#x201D; Cape Town University today admits Coloured students&#x2014;I do not know about Africans&#x2014;at the request of the Minister. We say that they should have the right to do so, and they do it. I may say that in doing so they save the face of the Minister because the Government has not been able to provide separate facilities after ten years.</p>

<p>Sir, I think that the hon. the Minister in introducing this Bill missed a very valuable opportunity. He followed slavishly what had been done by the Minister of Bantu Education and his Deputy. They had prepared Bills which were suitable for the Bantu and the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs followed them. He should not have done that. His Bill was in a completely different category. This university college for Indians was in a position to be organized quite differently from, for example, the University College of Zululand, and the Minister should not have followed his colleagues in the Cabinet. He should have ignored them and drawn up his own Bill, but he did not do so. Sir, the numbers of students at the University of Westville/Durban, are sufficient to justify the creation of a university. There is no question about that; the necessary numbers are there. The next important thing, I thought, was that last year the Minister&#x2019;s own Department of Indian Affairs established a tradition of a council of Whites and non-Whites. The Indian Affairs Department in establishing the Higher Technical Education College in Natal said that they <i>must</i> have a mixed council, because they said that if you have donors, the donors must be represented and the donors can be Indians or they can be Whites. The Department of Indian Affairs therefore made provision for a mixed council. Here we are dealing with a much superior institution, a university, and they do not follow the same principle! I think that is a mistake.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>To-day we do not have Whites and Indians on the council of this university. The members are all nominated by the Minister and he nominates Whites only. I think that is a mistake. I think the Minister should have departed from that. Now we come to this question of the senate. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will introduce an amendment to make it possible for a non-White professor to sit in the senate. I think that is essential. If he does not do that, then a Professor is being humiliated in his own college before his own students. I think that should be rectified as soon as possible. What is the next step&#x003F; What is the Minister going to do in the future&#x003F; Is he going to give this college an opportunity to establish a university controlled by themselves with a measure of autonomy&#x003F; I think that is the next stage. Sir, when I talk about a university, I mean a university on the model of White universities. The hon. the Minister of National Education is introducing a Bill in which he does not recognize these new universities as real universities. He excludes them. They are not in the same category as other universities.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one other point that I should like to mention. During the course of the debate the Minister enunciated a new principle <span class="col_3913-3914" refersTo="page_0444"/>of parliamentary government. He said that the party that he represented in this House was the Government. They, as the Government, introduce legislation and they will force that legislation through the House regardless of the attitude of the Opposition. Sir, this is a very serious statement to make because it strikes at the whole basis of democratic parliamentary government. The Opposition is here to participate in the government of the country; that is what we are here for. The hon. the Minister said &#x201C;You must wait until the next election, and if you, the Opposition, win at the next election, then you can introduce your legislation.&#x201D;</p>

What is the next step&#x003F; The next step will be to control elections.

I am very sorry that we have had to conclude this Third Reading debate on this note. I think the Minister missed an excellent opportunity, as I said in the beginning.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I feel I should, first of all, just answer the last point raised by the hon. member for Kensington. I appreciate that the hon. member for Kensington is a very serious-minded member and I always listen with attention to what he has to say, but this time he comes here and accuses me of all sorts of amazing things. He says I am bringing a new principle of parliamentary government into this House, the principle that the Opposition no longer participates in Parliament. But we have heard them for weeks! He says they have no influence, and he says we are moving towards a totalitarian system and a Nazi system. Really, I think that is quite pathetic. What it amounts to is that they want to rule the country, and they want to do so with 40 seats. They put amendments which we were not prepared to accept. They wanted a mixed council. But that is against the principle of this legislation. But they wanted it and they proposed amendments to that effect, and when we rejected the amendments they say that we are dictators. [Interjections.] I want to put this to hon. members. This old claptrap of totalitarianism I thought would have been dead in this House by 1969, but it still comes out. The hon. member for Durban (Central) did not refer to me as an inadequate Minister, or say that he felt sorry for the Indians, but he said that I was worse than Molotov; I would not accept amendments. But what amazed me about the hon. member for Durban (Central) who was so courageous this afternoon, was that when it came to clause 21 of the Bill he disappeared from the House, whereas previously on the Fort Hare Bill he voted against the principle that that university should be for non-Whites only. Now it is not morality or any principle; now it is just a matter of political convenience on the part of the hon. member. With all his big talk I wonder why he did not refer to this particular clause in regard to which he was so courageous when he stood there alone behind the hon. member for Houghton. But this time he kept very quiet.</p>

<p>Now let me get back to the original matters which were raised. The hon. member for Mooi River criticized my attitude to the Indian community as a whole. He said that I turned my back on them and I was like a stone wall in my attitude towards the Indian community.</p>

<p>To our amendments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He said I was opposed to the amendments which were moved by hon. members opposite, proposed by them by virtue of their great interest in the Indian community. He said I treated them with a certain amount of contempt because I produced the same sort of Bill which was introduced in regard to the Bantu. He said I should not have brought in the same type of Bill as was introduced for the Bantu universities. He said my diplomatic silence to the Opposition was to be deplored. Let me just analyze the position. I admit that I listened for many days to the hon. members opposite, not only in the Second Reading but also in the Committee Stage, and I accepted certain thoughts that they produced and I made amendments where I thought it was necessary to do so. But I was not prepared to accept amendments on matters of principle; so I turned them down, and I did not care whether the Opposition liked it or not or whether they shouted to high heaven. This is how we on this side of the House intend <span class="col_3915-3916" refersTo="page_0445"/>this Bill to go through. I might also say that I am not even going to reply to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, because I am not going to be treated by that hon. member in the way he treated me personally. But are they really concerned about the Indian community&#x003F; I think they are only trying to create suspicion in regard to this university. This department had discussions with the Indian Advisory Council. We went into the whole of the legislation with an all-Indian body, but the hon. members are trying to indicate that this is inadequate and unsatisfactory and that the whole attitude of this Government is really to ignore the Indian community, and it is not so. But of course those hon. members have been taking this line for so long that they have become used to it. But they are not making any headway. To-day their so-called influence that they had in the past is waning with the Indian community. I have spoken to the Indian Council and from those discussions has come some constructive work. But I do not find much constructive effort on the part of the Opposition in this House. All the aspects of this matter were discussed with the Indians. But the hon. member says we should not have coupled this legislation with the other legislation for the Bantu. But it was explained to them that this is their charter. This is not their time-table. The whole time-table of development is not tied to one bit of legislation; it is tied to a charter. This Indian university legislation can be amended. It can be implemented much faster than that for the other universities, depending on what the Government considers is in the interest of the Indians and to the best advantage of the country as a whole, and we will do that.</p>

<p>Because this was the pattern which this Government applied to all the non-White universities. Eventually there will be all non-White control. We feel that this is the best way of doing it. Hon. members opposite prefer a system in which you mix them together in a council and they say the White members are then able to advise the non-White members far better. But we disagree fundamentally. [Interjections.] Hon. members know our views in regard to this university and I want to read something to hon. members to show how essential it is because there has been an attempt to suggest that this should not be an Indian university to which the Indians should be admitted freely and the other non-Whites should only be admitted with the consent of the Minister. But our view is that it should be known as and operate as an Indian university, and it will not have a mixed council. Eventually the idea is that it will have an all-Indian council. But I want to read out something to show hon. members how ticklish the whole racial pattern is. This is a report I took from the <i>Sunday Express</i> of March 30th. It does not have a direct bearing on the council, but it refers to the unfortunate development in what is called the &#x201C;open&#x201D; universities. And this comes from Durban. The heading is &#x201C;Non-Whites Jeer at White Students&#x201D; and the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Relationships between White and non-White students at the University of Natal have cooled considerably after an incident this week in which four White student leaders were forced to leave a mass meeting. &#x2026; The White students were shouted down and were jeeringly addressed as &#x201C;Ja, baas&#x201D; by the non-Whites. They eventually decided to leave the meeting without addressing the non-Whites. Feelings between White and non-White students on the campus have been strained ever since last year when the local S.R.C. voted against having non-White students at a graduation ball in Maritzburg&#x2019;s City Hall.</block>

<p>It continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The non-Whites said they wanted nothing more to do with the White racialist S.R.C.s.</block>

<p>The view of this Government is that there should eventually be separate non-White universities and that the Indian University should have complete freedom to have its dances and its sport and that it should not be mixed sport. That is the object of this Bill and it is no good hon. members telling me, because I tell them this and they disagree, that I am being a dictator. It is the way in which the Government is going to develop these universities, and the proof of the success of this Indian University, as the hon. member for Kensington admitted, is the number of students who have already registered at the University, and the proof of the bona fides of the Government is the fact that it is spending a large amount of money in developing this Indian University at Chiltern Hills. These are facts and that is why we on this side of the House say this is the pattern we are following. When I say that the Opposition can change that pattern when they move over to the Government benches, that is a <span class="col_3917-3918" refersTo="page_0446"/>fact too. But they cannot expect this side of the House to accept amendments which will fundamentally change the pattern we on this side want. When we point this out to them, it is no good the hon. member for Kensington complaining that this is a complete revolution in parliamentary procedure and that the matter should be reported to the Prime Minister. Is that the position, or is the correct position as I have described it&#x003F; [Interjection.] In a democratic country the Government governs and it has to take the consequences of its actions. If the people do not want it to be returned to power because its actions are wrong, they will kick it out. Hon. members opposite are already picking their shadow Cabinet; so they must be very optimistic. Then why all this diatribe about us acting undemocratically&#x003F; I now want to deal with the Second Reading amendment of the hon. member for Kensington. In the Press world, when there is doubt whether something could be libellous, there is a saying &#x201C;when in doubt leave out&#x201D;. The Opposition, however, say &#x201C;when you are in difficulties ask for a select committee&#x201D;. That is all hon. members on the other side did during the Second Reading debate. The hon. member for Houghton supported them in this regard and the reason she gave was that it was a complete rejection as far as she was concerned. She therefore voted in favour of the appointment of a select committee. There it was: The constructive suggestion for the appointment of a select committee! Would the hon. member for Houghton, who completely rejected the principles of this Bill have supported the hon. members on that side of the House if their request for a select committee was a constructive request&#x003F; Of course not. The hon. member for Kensington moved an amendment providing for a new university council which would also include nominees from the South African Indian Council.</p>

<p>The next member of this council is Mr. Bodasing, Chairman of the Natal Indian Cane Growers&#x2019; Association; then there are Mr. Desai, who is an industrialist, prominent in various Indian organizations; Dr. Ismail, a medical practitioner; Mr. Joosub, a director of companies, Pretoria, and Chairman of the South African Indian Council.

<p>You know, Mr. Speaker, I do think that the personal remarks coming from that side of the House are most objectionable. I really do. On previous occasions I have complained and I think the personal remarks made by hon. members towards a Minister are most unparliamentary, and I would bring this to the notice of the hon. member for Kensington, who tries to maintain Parliamentary procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to add one final word, and that is that I am convinced that this Indian University is going to develop from strength to strength, as it has already done, and that it will be a credit to the Indian community. It will be run on the basis of collaboration and discussion between the Government and the Indian people. It will not be conducted on the basis of exploitation by the Opposition. It will not be deterred by all their nasty comments and all their attempts to belittle the good work this Government is doing.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during the course of the Second Reading debate I went briefly into the various uses to which the sea off our coast and the sea-shore were being put, and I referred in particular to the multiplicity of regulations which were being made by various local authorities under the Sea-shore Act. The Bill itself, as the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech, gives local authorities the power to differentiate between different kinds of users of the sea-shore and the sea adjacent to the coast. As he said, it gives them the power, for example, to discriminate between members of maritime clubs and non-members; it gives them also the power to discriminate between different kinds of boats used on the sea, for example, power boats and yachts, and one can easily imagine a considerable conflict of interests can arise between such users. I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention, regarding the differentiation between different users of the sea areas, the fact that there is no uniformity of regulations governing the inland waters, and I want him to deal with that matter at some appropriate time. Secondly, the Act permits the Minister to let the sea-shore for certain specified purposes, for example, for the erection of beach facilities, beach huts, pavilions, quays and landing stages. It also provides for the removal of certain marine matter, for example, seaweed and sand, and for the delegation of powers to Government officers for the purpose of enforcing regulations.</p>

<p>The reason why I have decided to speak at this stage of the Bill is simply to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that there are a number of amendments to the Sea-shore Act, and that there are a great number of regulations made by local authorities under the terms of the Sea-shore Act. I should like to suggest to him that the time has come for a consolidated Act to be brought before Parliament. I commend that to him. I think particularly of the need for consolidation of the law governing the seashore, the sea adjacent to the coasts, the bed of the sea and the territorial sea. I have raised such matters as the width of the territorial sea under the Vote of the Minister of Economic Affairs. I believe that the time has now come for a consolidation of all regulations governing the sea-shore and the sea adjacent to our coasts. I would commend this to the Minister for his consideration.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the Second Reading stage of this Bill the hon. member for Newton Park indicated that we on this side of the House accepted the principle, but we felt that the objects set out in this clause, the new section 4, were objects which were proper for the guidance, powers and privileges of a body such as the National Parks Board of Trustees, and so on. I do not say anything against that. But dealing with the English side of the Bill, I must say that I hope that the Minister before the Third Reading will get somebody to have a look at it. I frankly do not like the misuse of the English language as it is set out here; particularly when I look at the use of the word &#x201C;object&#x201D;, as used in the sentence &#x201C;The object of the constitution of a park is the establishment &#x2026;&#x201D; Then it goes on &#x201C;preservation and study therein of wild animal, marine and plant life&#x201D;. I do not like the terms &#x201C;wild animal&#x201D; and &#x201C;plant life&#x201D;. Those are not good terms for our legislation.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Chairman, fair enough. But when all is said and done, it is all qualified now by the word &#x201C;establishment&#x201D;. This is the new word that has been brought in. It shows that the object is the &#x201C;establishment&#x201D;, etc. Then the following new lines are inserted, namely &#x201C;or objects relating to the said life or the first mentioned objects or to events in or the history of the park&#x201D;. That has to be related to the establishment of the park. I am sorry, but the wording that is used by importing the existing wording in the Act after the word &#x201C;establishment&#x201D; and before the words that are underlined in lines 11, 12 and 13, wrecks the grammar of that clause completely by the mere introduction of the &#x201C;establishment&#x201D;. So long as the object was the &#x201C;preservation and study therein of wild animal&#x201D;, etc., it was quite all right. But when once one brings in the question of the word &#x201C;establishment&#x201D;, the matter takes on a different flavour altogether. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister who is piloting this Bill, will really take an opportunity between now and the Third Reading to have a good look at it and see whether he would not like the language changed to bring it more into line with the accepted rules of the English grammar.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think I can agree with the hon. member for South Coast in this respect. The drafters of the Bill had the erection of a statue in mind. That is why they introduced the word &#x201C;establishment&#x201D;. The word &#x201C;establishment&#x201D; is used in respect of a statue. But they forget that &#x201C;wild animal and marine life&#x201D;, etc., are mentioned in the same breath. We shall go into the matter and then I shall give a further explanation at the Third Reading stage.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subsection (2); in line 11, to omit &#x201C;with the approval of the Minister&#x201D;; and to omit subsection (4).</block>

<p>In subsection (1) certain powers are granted to the University of the Western Cape, powers which one would normally expect and which are peculiar to an independent institution. Moreover, it is quite clear that this institution is capable in law of suing and being sued in a lawsuit. As I have said, this is something peculiar to an independent institution. Normally <span class="col_3925-3926" refersTo="page_0450"/>this provision is included in other university legislation as well. Immediately following subsection (1) there are certain subsections which gives evidence of a lack of confidence in those people whose duty it will be to run an institution such as this. Moreover, it is also clear that the hon. the Minister is interfering quite openly in this regard. There is no obvious reason for this interference, unless the hon. the Minister is able to give one during the Committee Stage of this Bill. When an institution such as this is placed on the road to higher status, it should also be entrusted with additional responsibility. For this additional responsibility greater confidence should be placed in the council and the senate which are going to excercise control over this institution. However, by including this provision in this clause, the hon. the Minister gives this institution to understand that it will always be a university college and that it is merely the name or description of the institution which is going to be changed. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that in terms of clause 2, the one which has just been approved, the University College of the Western Cape will become the University of the Western Cape as from a particular date. We do not think the hon. the Minister will do this overnight, for example, from the moment this Bill is approved at the Third Reading. One can expect this to take quite some time before this institution will really be a university in the true sense of the word. I therefore think the hon. the Minister should accept this amendment of ours. Let us, for example, observe subsection (3) of this Bill. In terms of this subsection the institution may not accept any donation without the approval of the hon. the Minister. I find this provision in terms of which the institution may not receive any donation without the approval of the hon. the Minister, quite preposterous. Personally, I think this will have a detrimental effect on the development of this institution. Why should the acceptance of a donation of this nature, when it is made, be subject to the approval of the hon. the Minister&#x003F; The Coloured people are on a much higher stage of development than any other non-white race group in South Africa. Moreover, I think the Coloured people are among those who are most experienced when it comes to the University College of the Western Cape. Quite a great deal more can be entrusted to both the council and the senate of the institution than can be entrusted to any other institution for any other population group which is not a white population group. Therefore I do not think a provision such as the one contained in subsection (3), for example, would be to the advantage of this institution. Moreover, this undoubtedly makes it very difficult for any donor who wants to make a contribution or bequeath money to this institution in some form or other, whether in a will or otherwise. This immediately places the University of the Western Cape in a less favourable position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> any other institution. I think the prospective donor will be hesitant to make a donation of this nature when he knows about a provision such as this, because he knows the donation is subject to the approval of the hon. the Minister. I cannot see how anybody wanting to make a donation will make it to the detriment of the institution or that he will lay down conditions which the senate and the council of this institution are not prepared to accept. If a donor were to make a donation the conditions of which are not acceptable to the council or the senate, it could be left to them to decide, but why expect that the Minister himself should give his approval when a donation of this nature is made&#x003F; Subsection (4) of clause 3&#x2014;we propose that it be deleted<i>&#x2014;inter alia,</i> lays down&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The University may acquire for its use such stores and equipment, in such manner and on such conditions as the Minister may determine.</block>

<p>Here an explicit lack of confidence is displayed once more in the possibility that this university might be in good hands. I do not know of any similar provision which applies to one single white university to which autonomous powers have been granted and in the council of which we have placed our trust. I do not know of one similar provision at any of the white universities. I am satisfied that one may quite rightly and confidently leave these powers in the hands of the authorities of the institution concerned. I do not think they will do anything which will be to the detriment of that institution. Neither can I imagine that they will purchase their stores and equipment in an extravagant way, thereby exceeding the limits of the funds which this institution has at its disposal. Why choose this way to disturb the sound order and the sound working of this university by prescribing ministerial approval&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister places the institution on the road towards higher status, but the provisions contained in this clause do not amount to a higher status. It simply means that the university will be curbed even further, that the hon. the Minister will either approve or disapprove while the authorities who should really have that responsibility should not have this power. During the Second Reading debate hon. members on the opposite side of the House took pride in saying that it was essential for the University to have this higher status. If this higher status is essential, let us display sufficient confidence in those authorities in this clause by amending it in the way we on this side of the House proposed in this amendment. I trust that the hon. the Minister will accept it in that way.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. W. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Newton Park said that this provision was not one you would expect to apply to an independent institution such as the University of the Western Cape. I just want to tell the hon. member that this <span class="col_3927-3928" refersTo="page_0451"/>institution cannot be completely independent and that this institution therefore is not completely independent. The institution will not be independent financially. It was said here&#x2014;and this is so&#x2014;that the State contributes more than 70 per cent towards the cost of the universities. If need be, this may be considerably more in the case of the non-white universities. In other words, financially this institution will be dependent on the Government. The hon. member said there was a lack of confidence in the institution in its infantile stage. This is the second mistake he made, because what about the Rand Afrikaans University&#x003F; I do not find it necessary to advance arguments of this nature again, because mention has already been made of this before. It was said that section 4 (2) of the Rand Afrikaans University Act lays down that the university shall not let, exchange or otherwise alienate any immovable property or grant to any person any real right in or servitude on its property without the approval of the Minister. Does this also amount to a lack of confidence&#x003F; No, financial control and accountability is absolutely essential. For that reason such control is essential, particularly in the initial stages when an institution such as this has not found its feet yet. Interference is justified in this case. After all, the old saying goes: &#x201C;He who pays the piper calls the tune&#x201D;. Even though one would not like to apply this in its entirety on universities, it is, in any case, quite necessary to apply it in this case at first. The imposition of responsibility is something which takes place gradually. Also, the entire idea of higher educational institutions is a process in which responsibility, from the college to the university, is obtained gradually. In the case of the universities of the non-white population groups we should not act too hastily in giving those people full responsibility, because they do not have the finances. But even if this is of minor importance, they still do not have the academicians and the people who are willing to accept this responsibility. In view of this, I do not want to discuss this at length, but I want to come to the conclusion that this is no reason why we should now give powers to institutions such as that of the Western Cape or to any of those universities which remains to be established and leave them entirely to themselves, as it were, while we are not prepared to give these powers to an institution such as the Rand Afrikaans University which, surely, is entitled to handle their own affairs in their own way to an even greater extent. This process of granting responsibility gradually, is embodied in the whole of the policy of apartheid, in the relationship as it exists at present and this is also how the Government view these matters. This was stated as long ago as 1959. I do not think hon. members should be concerned that we are not engaged in a process of gradually granting more and more responsibilities to these people as they become increasingly able to bear them.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with respect to the hon. member for Gordonia I do not know whether he really knew what he was talking about when he referred to a gradual assumption of responsibility. The university is quoted here and the university is defined in clause 4 as consisting of the council, the advisory council, the senate and a whole lot of people appointed by the hon. the Minister. So with respect to the hon. member I really do not think he knew what he was talking about. What I find so strange about this particular clause is that in clause 3 (1) the university as a corporate body has the power to do a great many things. The university through the council and the senate, consisting of all the people whom the Minister himself appoints, has power to sue in a court of law and to take all sorts of far-reaching actions on its behalf. This can be done in very extensive and responsible fields. We are quite happy about that. Clause 3 (1) is in fact identical with the same section in the University of Port Elizabeth&#x2019;s statute which was the last one passed in this House. But when it comes to the Minister&#x2019;s approval having to be given for receiving donations&#x2014;I do not intend repeating the arguments used by this side in regard to these universities&#x2014;we disapprove of this proviso completely. I find it so strange that this Bill should have been drafted on precisely the same lines as the Fort Hare Transfer Bill of 1959.</p>

<p>There may have been some justification for using this legislation as the prototype for the so-called Bantu universities. I agree entirely with my colleagues, who argued that it should not have been the prototype for the Indian University Bill. I find that this is the strangest aspect of the whole thing; that the provisions of this Bill are in fact identical with the provisions of all the other Bills. Surely, the stage of development of these different groups of our population is something that the authorities must take into consideration in drafting their legislation. May I say, Sir, that when it comes to the question of controlling the supply of equipment and stores under subsections (4) (a) and (b), the deletion of which we have moved, surely the hon. the Minister must know that Coloured principals to-day in charge of secondary and high schools have more responsibility and in fact far greater rights in this regard than are going to be given to the council of this university or to the university as a Whole, in terms of this Bill&#x003F; Although the members of the Council are all going to be Europeans. With the exception of the members of the advisory senate and the advisory council, the Minister himself is ultimately responsible for approving these appointments. I find it most peculiar that in this instance the control of stores and equipment needed for the running of the university, should not be left to the people who presumably are going to act responsibly, or else they would not be appointed by the hon. the Minister in the first place. I do not wish to say any more, Sir, except that I would like the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation of the fact that a <span class="col_3929-3930" refersTo="page_0452"/>secondary school principal has greater powers of control over stores that he orders for his establishment while in fact the council of Europeans appointed by the Minister at this university is not going to have as much control over stores.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. STOFBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Both the hon. member for Newton Park and the hon. member for Wynberg proceeded from the assumption and complained that this University of the Western Cape was being treated too much on the same basis as the universities for Bantu in the provisions of the law, and then the argument was advanced that the stage of development of the Coloured people was much higher than that of the Bantu and that the restrictions imposed on the Bantu universities should not be imposed on the Coloured university. But hon. members make the error in their reasoning by not treating the Coloured people as a separate group, but immediately to enforce and demand for them the same privileges and rights as that of the white universities. It is typical of the Opposition to advance the argument that the Coloured people should be treated as a separate group, but then they always do so in terms of the requirements laid down for white universities. After all, it is evident both from the Bill as a whole and from the clause concerned that the Government and the Minister, in this situation are very definitely and very thoroughly taking into account the circumstances of the Coloured population and the stage of development they have reached, which is not yet the same as that of the Whites. Consequently, we cannot treat the Coloured university on the same basis as white universities in this case.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>We have to view this provision and the others on which amendments were moved, against the background of what the objects of this measure are. It is the object of this measure to grant academic independence, not to grant autonomy; this is what lies at the root of this provision. I admitted in my Second Reading speech that we were not granting autonomy in terms of this measure. This is not so and we do not intend misleading the Coloureds or anybody else, but that this is a great move forward in the development of the university, is as clear as a pikestaff. Something which also concerns this matter is the fact that the State provides virtually all the finances of this university. All its current expenses are borne by us. All in all it amounts to the State contributing almost all the finances and because this is so and because we have to account to this Parliament for the way in which public funds are spent, it is the duty of the Government to see to it that it has means at its disposal and that it should adopt measures to enable it to exercise control over these financial aspects.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>While this university has only reached this stage of development, we have to see to it that no donations are made to this university with ulterior political motives. We are aware of the fact that donations with ulterior motives were made in the past, and when people make donations with political motives it is the duty of the Government, through its Minister, to take the necessary steps, but if no ulterior motives are attached to donations, there is no reason why donations may not be made to the university. But until such time as we are convinced that this method is not going to be abused the Government will retain these powers.</p>

<p>Reference was also made to subclause (2). The hon. member for Gordonia has replied to this clause in a proper manner and I do not find it necessary to repeat what he said. The Opposition also wants subclause (4) to be deleted. This power may be delegated either to the Secretary for Coloured Affairs or to an official or to the council itself in terms of other powers provided for in this measure. In practice instructions will be framed to exercise sound control over the stores and equipment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg expressed her regret that this measure was framed on the basis of the Fort Hare measure. This is so; we said so in no uncertain terms. This measure arises out of the 1959 Act and as such this is a major step forward. The fact that this measure bears a resemblance with the Fort Hare measure does not serve to disqualify this measure, but at the same time it is no guarantee that university measures will all be the same in future. We are beginning a new deal for these universities where each one of them is now getting its own statute. Rather than coming to this House with one umbrella measure covering all these university colleges, we felt that each university college should be given its own statute, not only to give the university college a feeling of pride but also to make possible its development within that statute. The university institutions of the Bantu, the Coloureds and the Indians will probably not develop at the same rate. The rate of development of these universities will depend on the various population groups, and as the universities develop this House will be asked in future to amend the law and it may be that the Bantu Universities Act and this Act may not be amended at the same time. This will be determined in future by the people attached to these institutions themselves. This is a challenge to them and I do not doubt that the Coloureds will accept this challenge to show what this institution can do on its way to autonomy.</p>

<p>I was very interested in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply and I hope not unduly encouraged by what he had to say. Can we justifiably gather from what he has said that the time may well come when this university, according to the rate at which it <span class="col_3931-3932" refersTo="page_0453"/>progresses and establishes itself and builds up a good tradition, will have a statute of its own just as other universities in the country have their own statutes&#x003F;</p>

<p>Yes, certainly. The object of our policy of parallel development&#x2014;and I am confining my remarks specifically to this university&#x2014;is that this university should become an absolutely independent and autonomous university; it is our ambition and our aim that the staff of this university will ultimately consist of Coloureds only; it is our ambition that the rector of this university will be a Coloured in course of time; it is our ambition that the council of this university will consist of Coloureds in time to come. How long it will take to achieve this, depends on the Coloured people and not on the Government. I want to say again what I have been saying to Coloured deputations all along and as I said to them last week again, namely that we as Whites will not forsake them before they are able to stand on their own feet. I am giving that assurance again now as far as this development is concerned. It is the aim that they should ultimately provide all the staff for these universities and take them over, but until then the control provided for in this measure is absolutely essential.</p>

<p>I rise just to deal with the statement which has been made by the hon. member for Gordonia and referred to by the hon. the Minister, i.e. that a provision similar to subclause (2) appears in the Act of the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit. Sir, that is quite correct; the wording is identical, but I think the point that has to be borne in mind is that in the case of the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit, the council which is vested with the power to govern and control the university, is not an appointed council; it is elected and the members are nominated by various outside bodies. In that instance the argument that the Government must retain control can be justified because it has no power over the appointment of the council itself.</p>

<p>I think it should be recorded that there is this difference. In this particular instance the council is, of course, nominated by the Government. The Government has that power of control over the proposed Coloured university in that the members of its council are nominated by the Government, as against an elected, independent council in the case of the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit. I appreciate that it will make no difference to the reply which the hon. the Minister has given. He has expressed his views with regard to control but I thought that for the sake of the record it should be stated clearly that the two are not identical because of the method of constitution of the councils.</p>

<p>It is interesting that the United Party wants this clause deleted. After all, this is the normal position. Somebody has to accept responsibility. While the State is responsible for all the finances, it has to carry the responsibility, even as far as the universities are concerned. The State cannot simply dish out its money. The State is <span class="col_3933-3934" refersTo="page_0454"/>responsible to the taxpayers. As it is, this Government and this Minister are also responsible for the Coloureds, who are taxpayers along with the Whites in the same way as, for example, at schools for Whites. This is the normal position in all the ordinances and in all legislation. In terms of the ordinances the Administrator is responsible for the property of the State. Somebody has to accept the responsibility. From the nature of the case the Minister will not accept all these responsibilities himself. There are certain powers he delegates to the officials. But somebody has to accept the responsibility and I think it is extremely irresponsible for the Opposition to have suggested this. They do not come forward with an alternative. They do not say who should be responsible. [Interjections.] It was said during the Second Reading&#x2014;and the Minister has said so too&#x2014;that one would have liked these people to accept the responsibility, but such people were not available. The hon. member for Wynberg spoke about confidence; we are supposed to display a spirit of noconfidence in the Coloureds. But who placed more confidence in the Coloureds&#x2014;this side of the House or that side&#x003F; After all, they were also in power for a number of years and under their regime a Coloured person never had the opportunity of becoming an inspector or be appointed to a high position in the Public Service.</p>

The Minister wants that power, and the hon. member for Malmesbury also wants to know where those people must come from. Here are the people who can do all those things, and the power which is given to these people is, in any case, so insignificant that I think the Minister may quite rightly give it to them.

<p>The rest of the amendment concerns the advisory senate and the advisory council. I need hardly say that as far as we are concerned on this side of the House, for all practical, administrative and academic purposes, these advisory bodies have no real value, as we see it, particularly in view of the composition of the advisory senate. I cannot help drawing the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the following by means of comparison. He refuses to have sitting on these bodies Whites and Coloureds, however well qualified, at the same time, but the Minister knows very well that under this Administration for many years Coloured representatives and white representatives sat together on the old Cape School Board, and under this Administration that still happens on other bodies including the local authorities. Surely there must be a great deal of day-by-day co-operation within the Department of Coloured Affairs itself. I refer to the process of handing over a large section of the Department which we have recently been told about, to the Coloured people themselves. Can the Minister tell us that the white senior officials are not going to sit round a table and thrash out their difficulties with these Coloured people&#x003F; Of course that must be (the case. In regard to this advisory council and the senate, it is very curious that our friends in the Nationalist Party apparently have no difficulty in meeting these people at various levels in the Defence Force or in the Police Force, where Coloureds are being trained, and in regard to so many aspects of their lives where they are in the process of training. I cannot understand for the life of me why in this instance Coloured academic people, who would not be appointed to academic posts unless they were competent to do the work, cannot be allowed to cooperate on the senate. Why cannot they and white lecturers work on the same body for academic purposes&#x003F; It absolutely defeats me, and I do not know whether the Minister can really adduce any adequate argument in defence of his proposal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to deal with the question of the councils and advisory councils and their constitution. The clause of course, is silent as to whether the councils or the advisory council should consist of one or other race group, or whether they should be mixed or entirely of one race group. We accept, and I take it that it is correct, that it is the intention that the council and the senate should in each instance consist of white persons and that the advisory council and the advisory senate shall consist of Coloured persons. I want to project into the future the approach which the hon. the Minister has so far as this university is concerned. It is that it will develop, improve in status and, one can anticipate, will become a Coloured-controlled university in the years to come. There is a period of change from what it is now, that is to say, completely white-controlled as far as the executive powers are concerned, to complete Coloured-control. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not agree with me that there must come a time in the course of transition when the white and Coloured persons must sit together on either the council or the senate. I appreciate it that that is not prohibited by this clause as it is. There is nothing in this Bill before us to prohibit that. However, I, for the life of me, cannot see how that transfer can take place without an intermediate period of co-operation and sitting together on these bodies. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would perhaps indicate to us how he visualizes this transition taking place which he hopes and we all hope will take place within the reasonably near future when the Coloureds will have control over their own university. I would appreciate it and I ask it, because it is a problem in my own mind.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think we should spend some time on dealing with this amendment moved by us. The amendment seeks to do away with the advisory senate and the advisory council. This matter was discussed during the Second Reading. At that time the hon. the Minister gave, in advance, his point of view in connection with this matter. As it were, he revealed in advance that he would not accept such an amendment. The explanation which the hon. the Minister gave in his speech as well as across the floor of the House was that that would amount to &#x201C;integration&#x201D;. His reply amounted to his being able to see that Whites and Coloureds could work together, sit together and study together. They could mix socially at the university, they could mix academically and they could mix culturally. He could see them mixing in virtually any capacity, except in an executive capacity. In terms <span class="col_3937-3938" refersTo="page_0456"/>of his definition this was therefore inadmissible, as this alone constituted integration.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is extremely fond of the word foolish (&#x201C;sotlik&#x201D;). If he were to go through his Hansard he would see that he very often applied that word to the arguments of others. I want to avoid that, however, because I want us rather to make an attempt to view this matter in a serious light. I must say, however, that that is the kind of word I would have used if I had wanted to react in the same way as the hon. the Minister did. I prefer to say that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s view of this matter is completely wrong. There is no such thing as a kind of integration which the hon. the Minister can describe with one word and say that that alone constitutes integration. There are different kinds of integration. There is in fact executive integration, but also work integration. When people work together, that constitutes work integration. Then there is social integration. There can also be cultural and academic integration, as in fact there is here. There is biological integration, there is residential integration. There is a whole number of forms of integration. For the hon. the Minister to single out only one, i.e. people mixing on an executive level, and to say that that alone was integration, does not hold water and is not an intelligent argument. What does our amendment embrace&#x003F; We do not like to use the word integration in relation to people, because the Government has unfortunately given it an unfavourable connotation. That is why it is a pity that the hon. the Minister used that word at all in connection with this Bill when the Whites are bent on helping the Coloureds to make progress. We view this matter in a practical light. We are and remain what we are. One remains an Afrikaans-speaking or English-speaking person, one remains a White person or a Coloured person. Where one is living with others in the same country and is sharing the country with others, however, there are certain levels on which there will have to be co-operation and mutual consultation without sacrificing personality or identity. Here we have a Coloured university. As regards this university it is a foregone conclusion that Whites and Coloureds co-operate on many levels.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I have never deviated from it. There is co-operation between Whites and Coloureds in the academic sphere at this university, there is co-operation between Whites and Coloureds, in the cultural sphere. There is also co-operation in the general operation of the university. Surely it cannot be otherwise. If not, the university cannot make any progress. Surely there must be co-operation and consultation in connection with libraries and organization. Everywhere on the campus there is going to be co-operation and consultation between Coloureds and Whites. It cannot be otherwise. Seeing that we already have work integration, academic integration and cultural integration at the university, what then is the real reason why these people may not sit together in order to work out the general welfare of the university&#x003F; We are not speaking of integration. On the contrary, we are speaking of co-operation. What this amendment seeks to achieve is that there should be co-operation in the highest body between all who are concerned in the welfare and the future of the university. After all, this is a Coloured University for Coloureds. They have competent people and I think they are entitled to serve on the highest executive body of their university. I do not think there is any logic in the standpoint of the hon. the Minister. As far as we ourselves are concerned, I hope the hon. the Minister will not advance the argument once again that this constitutes integration. To us this constitutes co-operation. Such co-operation is nothing new. The hon. the Minister cannot say in any way that this is a matter of principle as far as he is concerned. In all churches, including our own church, the Dutch Reformed Church, the white minister sits with Coloureds on the church council of a Coloured congregation. Consequently there is &#x201C;executive integration&#x201D;. Such &#x201C;executive integration&#x201D; also exists in the Synod. If this is wrong in principle, then I ask myself how can one be a member of a church which accepts this&#x003F; The hon. the Minister calls it integration. We call it cooperation. The hon. the Minister cannot, however, accept it as the policy of a political party. Is the one then so much more important than the other&#x003F;</p>

<p>If I had not promised to avoid the use of that word I would have liked to use it. That surely is not integration. When I, in my capacity as Minister, with my officials conduct official discussions with those people it is not an occasion where they are deciding with me, as Minister, on how things are to be done. It is an occasion where I, as Minister, listen to their representations and where I can reason with them, where I can give them explanations, but it is not a matter of deciding together about how money is to be spent on this University. That is the basic difference which the hon. member apparently cannot or will not grasp. That is why we have to accept that this is a fundamental difference between this side of the House and that side of the House as far as our views are concerned. We do not believe that we can serve this country in the field of good racial relations with this system of Whites and non-Whites governing together. This is the basic difference. Now the question also is whether this advisory council has any practical value. The hon. members on the opposite side of the House would very much like to belittle the functions of this council. It is to be deplored that this is the case, because this advisory council of the University of the Western Cape has done particularly useful work during the years of its existence. I am going to give you a few examples of the useful work which has been done by them. In 1960, immediately after the constitution of the advisory council, they had the opportunity to join the council and the administration in devising and planning the whole complex of buildings which now exists. They also contributed their ideas on that fine complex of buildings. They had a share in the introduction of new courses such as Law, Commerce, Administration, and so forth. They felt the need for that amongst their own people and they discussed the matter. It was laid before the council and has been embodied in the steps which have since been taken. They advocated classes to be held after hours and they made out such a strong case for such classes that they have since been introduced. At the moment there are already 130 students who attend classes held after hours. This actually is something which resulted from this advisory council&#x2019;s awareness of a need which existed. They granted assistance in connection with providing students with board and lodging; a very important and necessary task which they are continuing. They started the development fund and they play a particularly active role in this regard. In connection with all these matters they were fully consulted and informed, and their opinions were embodied in this legislation. But to maintain that this body is useless, is surely not the right thing to do; in fact it really is a blot on the zeal of and the sacrifices made by these council members.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Chairman, I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment of the Opposition because basically it advocates integration.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to go into the arguments advanced by the hon. the Minister in reply to other hon. members, but I should like to ask him why he gave no reply to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Wynberg in respect of the rector, who is also the vice-chancellor of the University. The hon. member for Wynberg moved that &#x201C;shall&#x201D; be omitted and that &#x201C;may&#x201D; be substituted.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>She may not have pleaded for that, but she did move the amendment. I want to argue that this amendment is a very good one, for the simple reason that under the original clause the vicechancellorship is limited to the rector. There are many universities in South Africa which <span class="col_3941-3942" refersTo="page_0458"/>accept the position that the rector shall also be the vice-chancellor, but then there are also many universities which prefer the vice-chancellor not necessarily to be the rector. If the hon. the Minister accepts the amendment moved by the hon. member for Wynberg, the rector can still be the vice-chancellor, but under the present clause he is obliged to be the vice-chancellor as well. I can foresee the possibility that in future the university will want somebody else as vice-chancellor. The University of Stellenbosch is an excellent example in this connection. There the rector is not the vice-chancellor. The vice-chancellor is somebody else, and in that case he is fulfilling an additional duty and function from which that establishment is deriving great benefit. I do not recommend that this clause should provide for something similar, but I do recommend that the hon. the Minister should accept the amendment moved by the hon. member, because it would leave the door open in the event of subsequent changes. If the clause remains as it is, he is obliged to make the rector the vice-chancellor.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not prepared to accept the amendment that was moved by the hon. member for Wynberg, and which has now been supported by the hon. member for Newton Park. I have heard no plea from that side, but the essence of the matter is that this provision, as it stands here, provides that the rector shall be the vice-chancellor. This provision is in full agreement with the position at the Rand Afrikaans University and the University of Port Elizabeth. If it is good for them, it should also be good for the University of the Western Cape. But apart from the fact that it is good for them, it is the best for the University of the Western Cape at this stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say a word about the so-called mixed councils and the mixed senates. I do not want to anticipate the discussion of clause 9, but I just want to quote from one subsection. Subsection (7) of clause 9 illustrates the point I wish to make. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The chairman of the council may, and the rector or his representative shall, attend meetings of the advisory council and may participate in the proceedings but shall not have the right to vote.</block>

<p>In other words, there it makes provision for a mixed body. I cannot see what all the argument that we cannot accept a mixed body for a council or a senate is about.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are dealing here with the clause which describes the constitution of the university. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The University shall consist of&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) a chancellor;</li>

<li>(b) a rector, who shall also be the vice-chancellor of the University;</li>

<li>(c) a council;</li>

<li>(d) an advisory council;</li>

<li>(e) a senate;</li>

<li>(f) an advisory senate (if an advisory senate is established under section 11);</li>

<li>(g) the professors, lecturers and students of the University; and</li>

<li>(h) a registrar and the other staff of the University.</li>

</ol>

<p>I also want to quote section 5 of the Rand Afrikaans University Act, which describes the constitution of that university. This university is the latest university which was established by an Act of this House. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The University shall consist of&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) a chancellor;</li>

<li>(b) an officer who shall be styled the principal of the University and shall also be the vice-chancellor of the University;</li>

<li>(c) a council;</li>

<li>(d) a senate;</li>

<li>(e) a convocation;</li>

<li>(f) the professors, lecturers and students; and</li>

<li>(g) the administrative and library staff of the University.</li>

</ol>

<p>Now, what are the differences&#x003F; The differences here are that with the University of the Western Cape we have an advisory council and an advisory senate added and with the Rand Afrikaans University we have a convocation for which there is no provision in this clause. It appears that the Minister has made no provision at all for a convocation at this university. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if it is his intention that graduates of this university should continue to associate themselves with this university in any way at all. Is it his intention that they should retain a link with their Alma Mater&#x003F; Is it his intention that there should be &#x2026;</p>

<p>Will the Minister then tell us how he intends this should take place&#x003F; How does he intend to give encouragement to graduates of this University, to give them an opportunity to take part in the running of their own university&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to come to another aspect. The Minister in his reply just now said he is a practical person and I accept that, but he came with rather an illogical argument. He said the basic difference between this side of the House and that side is that they do not believe in integrated meetings, but he went on to say there will be times when he will meet with Coloured people, with the representatives of the Coloured people. These are integrated meetings. In a previous debate we had the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education telling us how this consultation was going to take place when he said that certain members of the council will sit with and consult with members of the advisory council. Similarly on other occasions certain members of the advisory council will sit and consult with members of the council. Is that not an integrated meeting&#x003F; We had the late Dr. Verwoerd and we have had the hon. the Prime Minister saying that the meeting together of people of the different racial groups at the highest level is not integration. I will accept that. But this is the highest level of education in this country, and surely we can have a getting together at this high level without the whole of the social structure of South Africa crashing around our ears. Surely the fact of 15 or 20 persons of each group getting together in the interests of education, in the interests of the highest level of education of the Coloured people is not going to break down the social structure of South Africa. I do not want to see this traditional structure of ours being broken down any more than the hon. the Minister does. But he says he is a practical man, so let us be practical about it. Will he tell us how he intends that his council and his advisory council will consult without getting together&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened attentively to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, particularly in that in his argument he makes use of concepts which are usually applied by Nationalists. He is skillful enough to give a United Party flavour to the concepts we use, and by so doing he creates a kind of confusion when we want to clarify the fundamental differences between the National Party&#x2019;s point of view in regard to the essence, the constitution and the ideals of a university and that of the United Party. He toyed with various concepts here this afternoon and ranged far and wide. I want to say this to him, Sir, if you will permit me. In respect of tertiary education as well&#x2014;and also as far as it affects the Coloured population&#x2014;the National Party has never suggested that there would not be contact or discussion or what ever you want to call it between the Coloured population group and the National Party at a particular stage or at certain times, in regard to whatever facet it may be. However, the difference in approach is the following. We see the establishment of a university for that community in the light of the fact that in respect of the Coloured people too, as in respect of the other non-white communities, the Whites stands in the relationship of guardian to the community in respect of which it maintains the guardianship. In that sense we accept responsibility in respect of that community as well. Consequently, when we come with an <span class="col_3945-3946" refersTo="page_0460"/>innovation such as a university for that community, it will be <i>sui generis.</i> It will have a particular character. As a rule we define a university as a community consisting of students and lecturers, established in order to undertake the threefold task of education, instruction and training, assisted by a management which governs and controls, as well as an administrative staff.</p>

<p>When we look at the constitution in clause 4, we see that it makes sufficient provision for the phenomenon that the white man will act as guardian here and that he, in his own particular ways, will indeed come into a contact situation with the Coloured community. We see in paragraph (g) that the university shall consist of &#x201C;the professors, lecturers and students of the University&#x201D;. In other words, there will be a great deal of contact between the Coloureds and the Whites; I am referring now to the white professors and the white lecturers. But in the case of any contact situation one can analyse the situation and say various things. One may say that the contact, the meeting may take place with a certain ideal in mind. The meeting may take place with a particular idea in mind. The meeting may have a particular result. The meeting may have certain causes. There may also be particular arrangements for the meeting between two different communities or race groups. The National Party&#x2019;s approach in this clause as regards contact with the Coloured people is that it must not be laid down in principle in such a way that it can develop into organic unity with the Coloured community. This is in contrast with the view of the United Party, which wants to see this contact as the beginning of a growth towards organic unity between the Coloured and the white community.</p>

<p>Therefore it is correct that the hon. the Minister said that where we are dealing here with a council and a senate, it is in principle our view that when one forms a controlling body from different groups, one is accepting in principle that that contact could lead to greater organic unity. That is the basic fundamental difference between the view of the National Party and the view of the United Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, my real reason for rising is to thank the hon. the Minister for once. Before doing so, I just want to reply to the hon. member for Rissik. The trouble with the hon. members on the other side is the fact that they are applying a double standard. They regard one kind of contact as being integration and another kind as not being integration. We on this side reject that. We feel that when we use a word, it should have the same meaning in all situations.</p>

<p>I should like to thank the hon. the Minister for at least having provided this measure of clarity. What the Minister really wanted to say, was this. He is satisfied with all kinds of contact. He and his officials may sit with the Coloureds, but the relationship must always be one of master and servant. [Interjections.] He did not say it in so many words, but that is what he really meant.</p>

I want to thank the hon. the Minister, but I also want to say to him that there is a fundamental difference between his side and our side. The difference is very clear and we are very grateful to know that we are on a different side. We think the time has come that a white man can, without losing his identity or self-respect, discuss with a Coloured person, in his own right, the mutual interests of both.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to say that with this amendment the United Party has thrown off its disguise. They can no longer try to tell anyone that they are not an integration party. Of what weapon are they trying to deprive us now&#x003F; They want to abolish the advisory senate and the advisory council. That is the only place of training for the Coloured population where they can come into their own one day so that they will be capable of serving themselves. If we were to discard these two bodies, there would be no other means by which we could bring forward the human resources of the Coloured population in order to give them experience to be able to serve their own people in time to come. This is our only weapon. The United Party wants us to delete this. That would amount to integration. They want a joint council where the Coloured people will never have the opportunity of gaining experience so that in time to come they may perform the task that lies in store for them. Then we would be back where we were in the past. As the Minister said, as long as we are in power, we will never establish a joint council.</p>
