<from>The MINISTER OF HEALTH:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) No. However, on the 3rd March, 1968, representations for the institution of stricter control over the advertising of drugs were considered by the Drugs Control Council, which decided that steps should be taken to that end. As the Council had already decided on the principle contained in the Bill, it was not considered necessary to submit the wording of the amending clause to the Council.

<ol>

<li>(b) No. In view of the reasons given in reply to 1 (a), it was not deemed necessary. Moreover, time did not permit of such a procedure. This consideration was clearly indicated by me on introducing the amendment during the Committee Stage on 28th July, 1970; Hansard, column 566: &#x201C;The fact that the definition in the clause, as it reads at present, is not in strict accordance with the explanation I furnished to the House yesterday, came to my attention only last night.&#x201D;</li>

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>I wish to emphasize that the Department of Industries does not aim at the extermination of sea animals or birds, but merely concentrates on the controlled exploitation of seals in an endeavour to maintain their numbers within reasonable limits with a view to the conservation of the country&#x2019;s fish resources. Against this background the required particulars are as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) No; (a), (b) and (c) fall away; because observations by the Department of Industries and the decreasing guano production indicate that special steps in this regard are unnecessary.</li>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not suppose that it will come as any great surprise to the House to know that I intend to oppose the Third Reading of this Bill. I opposed the Second Reading and I gave my reason for doing so, and that is that I object to clause 15 which I consider to be a very objectionable clause indeed. There have been no changes, of course, in the Committee Stage and one did not expect that there would be any changes. The Third Reading is now upon us and I intend to be consistent and to follow the same line that I adopted at the Second Reading and at the Committee Stage. I intend to oppose the Third Reading. In so doing, I am also being consistent in following the line that I have taken on previous occasions when General Laws Amendment Bills have come before the House and have contained a variety of clauses. Where a clause has been inserted in such a Bill which I have considered to be thoroughly objectionable I have opposed those Bills. I will give you one example, Sir, and that is the General Laws Amendment Bill over various years containing the Sobukwe clause. I opposed the Bill <i>in toto</i> because of the insertion of that clause, and there have been other examples as well. I intend now to follow exactly the same line.</p>

<p>Sir, various arguments have been advanced in the course of this debate as to why clause 15 is in fact not objectionable. I must state again that my main objection to it is that I consider that it abrogates one of the essential elements of the right of assembly and that is the right of citizens to hold peaceful processions. It may well be said that peaceful processions will be allowed. Unfortunately, Sir, it is not possible to judge beforehand exactly what is going to happen when a procession takes place, but there is no doubt that from now on it is going to be much easier for the authorities to prohibit processions. All the arguments that have been used about this clause by the Opposition, the bringing to bear of judicial authority and the judicial mind on the subject and the possible danger to law and order, can be used as far as the holding of any meeting is concerned or any other form of protest. I say that it may not be very long indeed before the very same arguments which were used in this debate about the holding of processions may possibly be extended to the holding of protest meetings. Hon. members should ponder on this. The same arguments will be advanced by Government speakers as to why the measure is necessary and they will be trapped by the very arguments which they have used in this particular instance where only the right of holding a procession is affected. Once one starts on this slippery slope, whittling away what are normal civil rights, it is very hard indeed to put a stop to the process.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with the arguments put up by the Opposition that clause 15 constitutes an improvement on the present position. The first argument is that the judicial mind, that of the magistrate, is now to be brought to bear on the question of the holding or not holding of a procession. I want to say at once that first of all the fact that the magistrate does not, by law, have to take into account the views expressed by different organizations, is one factor that has been overlooked or ignored by Opposition speakers. They have assumed that the magistrate will take into account all the arguments for and against the holding of a procession and they have accepted all the Minister&#x2019;s assurances in this regard as well. But I have had enough experience of legislation in this House to know that unless the law actually contains provisions to make it necessary, for such matters to be taken into account, the assurances come to mean nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class="col_5033-5034" refersTo="page_1074"/>I would like to ask the Official Opposition why, if it is so important to have the judicial mind brought to bear on the subject when the city council or the local authority has said yes to a procession, is it not also important to have a judicial authority bring its mind to bear on the subject when the city council has said no to a procession&#x003F; If it is so important to have the matter weighed up by this judicial mind, then surely the Official Opposition should have moved some amendment in the Committee Stage to make it necessary, where the city council has forbidden a procession to take place, to refer that also to a magistrate. But no, once a negative answer has been given, that is the end of it and the judicial authority is not necessary. But if the city council is not to be trusted to say yes, why should it be trusted to say no&#x003F; Why can we then not also demand, if the Opposition considers it so necessary, that the judicial authority shall also bring its mind to bear on the case where the city council has refused the authority&#x003F; On the basis of their own argument, they surely should have taken advantage of the opportunity in the Committee Stage to move such an amendment.</p>

<p>Now I have been accused of treating magistrates with disrespect. I think that was the sort of implication in what was said by hon. members on this side and, I Chink, the hon. the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>The chief magistrate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the chief magistrate. By the way, one of the arguments about the chief magistrate is that he would consult the Police and that he was always in the position to cross-examine policemen. So he would be in a very good position to know if what the Police said was correct or otherwise. It is very unlikely that the chief magistrate is going to consult the sort of policeman who appears in the witness-box. He would consult the Commissioner of Police, and I think it is unlikely that he would disregard any advice given to him by the Commissioner of Police.</p>

<p>But let us get back to the chief magistrate. I have no disrespect for magistrates, but I do not think they are infallible. I Chink it is ridiculous to bring this sudden sort of sacrosanct element into the consideration of the magistrate&#x2019;s judicial authority. They are not infallible by any means and I would rather leave it to the judgment of elected bodies than to the judgment of a single magistrate. I might say that magistrates&#x2019; decisions everywhere are subject to review. They are not considered infallible even in ordinary terms by law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Are the city councils infallible&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course they are not, but they are elected people and they are responsible to all the other citizens. That is the whole thing; that is the basis of democracy. That is why I place more weight on the judgment of an elected body which is responsible to the community which put them there. [Interjections.] This is how democracy functions, and if we had true democracy in this country they would not be sitting there, as the hon. member knows, but never mind about that now. The point is that magistrates are not infallible and in terms of our ordinary law, cases where magistrates have imposed sentences of, I think, three months&#x2019; imprisonment or corporal punishment are all subject to review and I think certain sentences which involve fines over a certain amount are also subject to review. So one cannot just accept a magistrate&#x2019;s opinion as being infallible. But, as I say, if one does, as the Opposition appears to do, think that magistrates have an infallible judicial mind, then they should have moved an amendment that where the city council has refused permission in the first instance, that also will be subject to review by the judicial authority.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Durban (North) has accepted that the argument he used at an earlier stage, that the penalties are less, was wrong, and I hope he has realized that he has made a mistake. He has made a serious mistake in this regard. The penalties are not less, as the hon. the Minister agreed with me yesterday. In the first instance, persons who in fact infringe the law by holding a procession which has been banned in terms of clause 15 are subject only to municipal by-laws, but thereafter they may very well be subject to all the very stringent provisions of section 1 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, an Act which provides for a maximum of three years&#x2019; imprisonment if found guilty, a whipping of ten strokes and a fine, or any one of these three penalties or all three. These are very severe penalties indeed.</p>

<p>I should remind hon. members that that Act of 1953 was introduced for the precise purpose of stopping any defiance against the law, and defiance was considered any organized form of protest. Therefore the penalties are as stringent as they were before. It is true that the Riotous Assemblies Act is now excluded, but the very stringent provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, section 1. still apply if anybody is found guilty of breaking any law as far as protest against any existing law is concerned. That includes holding a procession or taking part in any protest against an existing law. The hon. the Minister explained to me that he was unable to be present here to-day. but he agreed yesterday that I was perfectly right in my interpretation of that clause.</p>

<p>Now I come to the Minister&#x2019;s extraordinary admission yesterday and the day before that the chief magistrate of Johannesburg had cancelled the Johannesburg procession of Witwatersrand students in May earlier this year because certain bodies had come to him and told him&#x2014;he says under oath, although I honestly do not see the relevance of this; if <span class="col_5035-5036" refersTo="page_1075"/>they are warning him, they are warning him, and presumably they do not do this capriciously&#x2014;and warned him that there was going to be trouble if the procession took place. Because of that, the magistrate, acting on his own initiative but supported eventually by the hon. the Minister, cancelled the procession. Now, what should the magistrate&#x2019;s reaction to those people have been&#x003F; Let us look at the circumstances which can be repeated in terms of clause 15. The circumstances are that a procession was allowed. The City Council, having weighed up the possible consequences and having consulted the police, decided that it was all right to grant permission for the procession to be held. At the last moment the magistrate cancelled the permission in terms of the Riotous Assemblies Act and he did so because various bodies came to him and said there would be trouble. What should the magistrate of Johannesburg have said to these people&#x003F; We do not know who they were, of course. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister who is acting to-day has been given this information, but I would be very interested to know who these organizations were. Who were they&#x003F; The Herstigtes, the Nationalist Party or students at the R.A.U.&#x003F; ([Interjections.] It has everything to do with it. Do not try to get away from it. It has everything to do with the Bill. Who were they&#x003F; I want to know who they were. It would be very interesting to know who these people were who threatened to break up a lawful procession. Let us take an imaginery instance where a lawful procession of Government supporters was going to take place, showing their support for certain measures taken by the Government. Various anti-Government organizations went to the Magistrate of Johannesburg and threatened that, if this procession took place, they would break up. Or, alternatively, that we know that there are going to be people who are going to break it up. What do you think would have happened&#x003F; The Chief Magistrate and the hon. the Minister would have said: &#x201C;We will put the police on you. We are determined to maintain law and order. You do not have the right to come along, as disorderly elements, to break up a peaceful procession. We will put the dogs on you.&#x201D; Alternatively, they will have one of these paramilitary manoeuvres which they have been known to carry out against students. That is what would have happened, but since this procession was anti-Government and since the people who came along to warn that there was going to be disorderly behaviour were pro-Government the procession was cancelled. What sort of law and order is that&#x003F; Is there not a very obvious analogy between this and what happened in England in June, when the cricket tour was called off&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Hear, hear&#x201D;, says the Opposition! That is really wonderful and it is from the back bench too! I want to point out that, at the time when that happened the hon. the Prime Minister said that the British Government was giving in to disorderly threats. It was giving way to blackmail, because demonstrators had complained that, if the cricket tour went on, they were going to break it up. Here we have the position where a peaceful procession, for which permission had been obtained, is cancelled because there is the threat by disorderly elements in South Africa. Do not the Prime Minister&#x2019;s words also apply here, that the Government gave way to blackmail&#x003F; If I may quote his words on that occasion, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would like to say that every lawyer &#x2026;</block>

<p>And I hope that junior and senior counsel are listening to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I would like to say that every lawyer will tell you that, if you once pay a blackmailer, you will have to meet increased demands as time goes on. For a government to submit so easily and so willingly to open blackmail, is to me unbelievable.</block>

<p>Well, it is unbelievable to me that the Chief Magistrate of Johannesburg and the Minister representing the Government should also have submitted to blackmail; in other words, that the procession was going to be broken up by demonstrators. That is my case. I think that, once you start on this line, there is no end to it. Anybody can protest about a meeting, or about a procession, or whatever it is, and the magistrate can take the necessary action in terms of Clause 15.</p>

<p>Let me come to this final point, to which I may say members on both sides of the House always resort when they cannot reply to an argument. They resort to this one favourite point, when there is nothing left for them to say in reply to an argument: &#x201C;You are not in favour of law and order!&#x201D; &#x201C;You do not want this Bill, so you do not want law and order!&#x201D; That is of course nonsense. I am not even going to be bothered to examine this ridiculous proposition in any detail at all. It is just nonsense from beginning to end. No thinking person any longer takes any notice of this sort of argument. This was actually proved by the election in Houghton, where every trick of the trade was pulled in this regard. I am not even going to be bothered with it. Let me only say that law and order is very important and it must be maintained in a country, but other things are also important. Those things are the maintenance of normal, democratic, civil rights, such as are <span class="col_5037-5038" refersTo="page_1076"/>maintained in every country in the world that is democratic. As I pointed out before, there is plenty of law and order behind the Iron Curtain, but there is very little liberty. One has to weigh these things in the balance.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I am prolonging the debate, Mr. Speaker, but I think I am entitled to use my time in trying to express my opposition to this Bill. I want to conclude, since I have now covered all the points that I intended to cover. I have covered all the points I wanted to cover and I would not sit down a minute sooner, I can promise the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I want to say that it is too easy to use this threat about law and order, in order to abrogate those rights. We have had a constant procession of Bills of this kind in this House and always this has been the excuse that was used. I say that no real reason has been advanced. This Bill makes it easier to prohibit peacful processions. The Government does not want the embarrassment of having to countermand permission which had been given by local authorities. In future that permission means nothing, unless the permission of a magistrate is also obtained at the same time. The whole object of this Bill is to save the Government any embarrassment as far as cancellation of processions after the local authority has given permission, is concerned. For all these reasons I intend to vote against the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton has dealt at some length with the procession of the students of the Witwatersrand University earlier in the year. Let me say at once that, in as much as she criticizes the handling of that affair by the Government, then certainly she has a point. However, the point that the hon. member for Houghton misses is that this Bill is designed to prevent exactly that sort of thing happening again. This is the object of this Bill. The hon. member for Houghton said that the judicial officer concerned, the Chief Magistrate, does not have to have regard to representations, but, when application is made, certain reasons are submitted with the application. As I have indicated already, the Chief Magistrate of Johannesburg has said that he will in fact hear all interested parties. The hon. member is concerned only with Johannesburg. I want to remind the hon. member of the fact that the persons concerned are the most senior of our judicial officers in the service of the country. They, by nature, in making a decision of this sort, will want to hear all sides. They most certainly will want to hear the Police on this subject. They are the ones, who after all are enjoined with the task of maintaining law and order. They will want to hear the local authority, the persons concerned and anyone else who wishes to make a representation in respect of that protest march or that procession.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton asked some questions, one of which was why permission is not given to appeal to the magistrate, if the local authority refuses permission. I think that the answer to that is that these are two quite different fields. What the local authority is concerned with is the question of traffic jams and so forth, in other words the effect that a procession of this sort will have in those fields. In the field of the maintenance of law and order, it is our submission that a senior magistrate, hearing the persons concerned with it, is in a far better position. People who could object and could make representations to the Chief Magistrate, which is something the hon. member for Houghton seems to have forgotten altogether, are the other people whose rights might be affected by a protest march. They also have rights and not only those who wish to be in a procession.</p>

<p>What the hon. member for Houghton has now repeated again, is I think a shameful reflection on our senior judicial officers.

<p>It makes no difference who it is. This is our case. It is as simple as this.

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask for the privilege of the half hour.</p>

<p>I would like to begin by mentioning the two really encouraging features in this year&#x2019;s Budget, which of course are the additional sums of money allocated to our universities, in the first place, and the taxation remission proposals both to companies and individuals on donations to universities for specific research projects or for general academic use. May I say that we have been pleading for this type of action to be taken by the Government for the past 10 years and more. It is a great relief that at last something is being done about it. The Government&#x2019;s aid to universities during this financial year will increase from R32.2 million to R47.3 million, an increase of more than 50 per cent. Nevertheless a total of only R71.7 million is being voted for Higher Education this year. As usual this is a relatively minor item in the Minister&#x2019;s record Budget for the current year. It is high time that this pattern with regard to education and the allocation of funds was drastically changed. Let me state very clearly here that our future economic development will depend to a very great extent on the quantity and the quality of the education and training that are available to all the people who have to participate in the productive process.</p>

<p>Fortunately, one form of education&#x2014;I refer specifically to training on the job&#x2014;can be provided by employers without cost to the taxpayer. At this critical stage of overall neglect of our education and training facilities, a very heavy burden will be placed on the shoulders of commerce and industry during the next few years to fill the gap the Government has largely helped to create.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the Manpower Planning and Research Committee. This committee was established in 1964. It was connected with a number of highly significant research projects and then, according to the hon. the Minister in reply to a question of mine this Session, it <span class="col_5041-5042" refersTo="page_1078"/>was dissolved on the 31st March, 1969. What was the need to dissolve it&#x003F; Surely this type of committee should remain in office indefinitely&#x003F; Shall we not need continuous surveys of the manpower and planning position&#x003F; Let me quote to the House some of the matters the committee considered during its five years of existence. They were of vital importance. They were the following: training of apprentices, financial aid to university students, a report on school leavers, an estimate of the size and occupational composition of the economically active white population in the Republic in 1970, the economic development of the Bantu homelands, a report on the demand fox and supply of town and regional planners for the period 1968 to 1980, a report on the labour potential of a group of retired graduates, an estimate of the demand for engineers, a report on the qualification requirements of high-level manpower in the private sector, a report on the supply of medical practitioners and an estimate of the demand for and supply of manpower in 1971 according to occupational groups in the Republic of South Africa. Asked by me what plans the committee had for the future, the Minister replied that the committee was dissolved at the end of five years and that of course its future falls away. The people represented on that committee represented a very wide field. I just want to remind the House of the people who served on that committee. They were representatives of the Railways, of the C.S.I.R., of Rhodes University, of the National Advisory Council on Education, the Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister, representatives of the Departments of Labour, Bantu Administration, Bantu Education, Planning, Immigration, Indian Affairs, Coloured Affairs, Agricultural Affairs, Planning, Education and Defence, the Public Service Commission, the Bureau of Statistics, the Transvaal Hospitals Department, representatives of the provinces and another representative from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council. It is significant that no representatives of commerce and industry or of the private sector were called to serve on that committee. This is precisely the type of interdepartmental committee which could have been enlarged to incorporate members of the public and which the country has needed for the past 20 years. Yet five years after its establishment, the committee is dissolved. What is the outcome of its deliberations&#x003F; No one knows how much action arose out of its recommendations. Knowing how this Government has made a habit of shelving one vital plan after another for the development of our educational services, my guess is that the communal wisdom of this committee is probably languishing in some dusty files somewhere in the Department.</p>

<p>Why should their findings be confidential&#x003F; That is what we would like to know. What kind of nonsense is this&#x003F; Is the country not entitled to know what is going on in one of the most important spheres of our national life&#x003F; The general educational picture remains exceedingly bleak. If the truth were told, it would be found that education in South Africa to-day is in a mess in spite of all the surveys that appear to have been made. The inescapable conclusion is that the Government has all the relevant information necessary for the proper correlation of the country&#x2019;s labour requirements as well as its potential, but that, for reasons of political expediency, it refuses to make this information known.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Oh no.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Oh yes, that is quite correct. The reason for that unquestionably is that if the true facts were known, I suggest, the appalling shortages of trained personnel in both the teaching and other professions, would shock the country and would prove to a frightening extent, the Government&#x2019;s failure to plan ahead in the educational field ever since it came into office. I am not referring specifically to this hon. Minister. The neglect in this field has now become nothing less than a form of national subversion. In certain parts of the country the hon. the Minister must know the education system is on the verge of collapse. We know that that is so particularly in the Transvaal. The Government&#x2019;s failure to do anything really positive and dynamic, maintaining the correct degree of emphasis on the right things at the right time, is enough to make one despair. If there is any single social service upon which the whole of the nation&#x2019;s welfare depends and in respect of which there is an imperative need to plan ahead, it is in the field of education. Everything stems from there, whether it be the labour situation, race relations, political stability or economic development. It applies to everyone at the same time. All we have had in reality since 1948 are a series of short spurts here and there, unco-ordinated and sporadic action. We had a whole series of committees, education councils, inconclusive departmental surveys, a commission or two, a select committee or two and at the end of it all an acute lack of unity and drive in nearly every instance. There was little or no positive action taken in the end. Each committee or commission or departmental investigation has proved to have had either an inconclusive ending or produced an evasive report or remained confidential as is so often the case.</p>

<p>Where reports did contain definite recommendations the administration invariably for one reason or other dragged its heels over their implementation. A lot of internal squabbling has been going on at the same time. We know that. The country is sick and tired of the while ineffectual bag of tricks. We had in 1967 the National Education Act which is held to be the blueprint for future development. The Educational Services Act sets up the necessary machinery for the application of the policy set out in the former statute. And yet if one looks at the present report of the Committee of Educational Heads which was tabled this Session <span class="col_5043-5044" refersTo="page_1079"/>what does one find&#x003F; Not that they have not worked. But that practically every decision taken is still either pending, under consideration, referred to someone else or merely remains a recommendation. It is not only pathetic. It is something of a disgrace.</p>

<p>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the curiously vague conclusions come to by this leading committee. One wonders how much finality there will ever be about any of their long drawn out deliberations. I am quite aware of the fact that their main functions are to submit recommendations and to advise the Minister. But their last term of reference states specifically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The good co-operation within the committee enables it to ensure through its resolutions that action in these cases is uniform and in the best interests of education as a whole.</block>

<p>I should like to see where the &#x201C;action&#x201D; is. I say so because one subject after another is either deferred, referred back or handed over to somebody else for their recommendations, advice or decision. You can go through the whole list and you will find with one or two exceptions that no action is recommended anywhere. This has been going on for more than 20 years and we are no nearer an adequate deal for teachers. We are no nearer to differentiated school courses. This matter is still on the agenda of the National Education Council. We are no nearer to the subsidizing of university students on a large scale. We are no nearer any scheme for allowances to assist secondary and high school pupils of ability to remain at school than we were when this Government came into power. It is mo wonder that the teachers in the Transvaal and Natal have demanded publicly of the Minister that the national expenditure on education be doubled. The hon. the Minister had a resolution from them to that effect. They also demanded an immediate and dramatic increase in teachers&#x2019; salaries and that a professional teachers&#x2019; council be established to co-ordinate their standards and requirements and to enable them to negotiate with the department on a proper professional basis. That is what they ought to be able to do. Small wonder that at this stage the teachers are demanding angrily that they should no longer be tied to the Civil Service but that they should be treated on an independent professional basis just like the doctors, architects and everybody else in the professional field.</p>

<p>A letter was addressed to the Leader of the Opposition by the president of the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association on 4th August which incorporated this resolution. This letter containing the resolution which was sent to the hon. the Minister ends with the following desperate appeal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We urge most strongly that you do your Utmost to support our plea at a time when the very foundation of our country is being threatened by the breakdown of an effective education system.</block>

<p>That comes not from amateurs but from people in the profession themselves. Those are the people who are talking about a breakdown in our education system. I would say that the country deserves an answer from the Government and from this Minister. I must say that I have always found him an extremely courteous person to deal with. But until recently the hon. the Minister was holding a diplomatic post overseas. He has returned to the Education Department to find a legacy of muddle, disputes and inefficiency of an unprecedented kind.</p>

<p>Nothing in education can ever be discussed or decided in a vacuum. This is the important point to remember. One aspect impinges upon another. If one point in the cycle is neglected then all else is automatically affected. Nothing can be done without teachers. Teachers cannot be trained unless there are sufficient matriculated students for that purpose. Matriculated students will continue to be in short supply until more of our able children are financially assisted to remain in high school for the full period to which so many of them are entitled. An insufficient number of these high school pupils will go on to achieve higher qualifications, either technical or academic, as long as they are forced, prematurely, out into the labour market after standard 8, because with the constant rise in the cost of living&#x2014;a rise of 70 per cent since 1948&#x2014;the parents cannot afford to keep them at school. I suggest that unless their education is subsidized by the State this wastage will continue and our general educational standard will be pegged at an artificially low level. This has been happening for years and years. Unless a percentage of white youngsters move on up the ladder in this way, there will be no place for others who are urgently needed in the skilled and semi-skilled trades.</p>

<p>Apprenticeship training is declining and we are already having to accept lower standards, which is a great pity. When standards decline the economy suffers unless these boys and girls are given the opportunities for promotion which they deserve.</p>

<p>There is another point I would like to make. No sound training can be achieved without a broad-based educational foundation, linked with values that instil initiative, a spirit of service and dedication at work and a sound concept of citizenship together with the responsibilities attendant upon that. A lot of this should be quite simple, but ideologies of one kind or another have predominated and led to endless internal bickering and disputes within the Government itself. It has nothing to do with us. The sound practical values that should unite all of us in this field have largely been lost sight of in the Government&#x2019;s passion to play the education game always with their, own slight political overtones. We are really <span class="col_5045-5046" refersTo="page_1080"/>so tired of it all. All this is done at the expense of practical considerations.</p>

<p>Universities cannot make an adequate job of training and research without properly paid staff, capital funds for development and unfettered academic freedom. These can only be guaranteed in the last resort with Government backing. We lose our place in the modern world of technology without sufficient scientists to take the lead. A dearth of scientists and technologists means economic retrogression. Economic retrogression again means less money available for education and training. So it is all a vicious circle or a productive circle, depending entirely upon the policies adopted and the action taken. Where policies are confused and action is deferred, the situation becomes stagnant as it has in the Republic today. It is our indictment of this Government that they have failed the country in this most vital field. We are smothered in committees, sub-committees, surveys, projects, recommendations and half-baked proposals, with little hope or sign of the firm co-ordination that is needed if our educational system is to be saved from collapse.</p>

<p>Provincial Council M.E.C.s in some of the provinces to-day refuse to answer awkward questions on educational matters. Every year more and more teachers resign and accept more lucrative positions in the private sector. Fewer and fewer student teachers enrol at our teacher training colleges and universities. What future is there for them in teaching to-day with the salaries paid to them&#x003F; University lecturers themselves are inadequately paid and those interested in vital research projects, find their only real hope of fulfilment by accepting positions overseas, where expense is no object, relative to the importance of the work that has to be done. Sir, for years a large percentage of our most brilliant people as the hon. the Minister must know well have left the country not out of dislike for or any disloyalty to South Africa but because the necessary research facilities were not available at home.</p>

<p>How do we retrieve that position and all the others&#x003F; The one certain thing about educational planning is that it is essentially a long-term business. Nothing can be done overnight. And where these years have already been wasted I make so bold as to say that the deleterious effect upon the country as a whole will be felt in South Africa for several generations to come. Taking the higher echelons of employment we are desperately short of teachers, engineers, architects, quantity and land surveyors, builders, chartered secretaries and accountants, librarians, university lecturers, scientists, public relations personnel, marketing and managerial personnel and executives of every description. At this level our own only surplus appears to be a plethora of lawyers and politicians neither of which categories is productive or if I may say so with respect adapt at anything except the manipulation of words which may sometimes be necessary but not always very productive.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I am not a lawyer. Sir, if you take the lower echelons of employment the situation is just as bad. Just for the record let me tell the hon. the Minister what we would have done in the Government&#x2019;s place. The first thing we would have done would have been to enlist the aid of commerce and industry in carrying out a nation-wide survey of the country&#x2019;s labour requirements&#x2014; in all fields and at all levels&#x2014;based on projections for a period of 25 years ahead. Such a survey would have incorporated all racial groups. If this information is available to the Department, nobody is told about it; it is all confidential and we want to know why. Sir, from there we would have set up a statutory planning and co-ordinating body consisting of members of the public, experts and officials, to decide first upon the priorities and then the location of training centres&#x2014;vocational, technical and academic. The provinces would have been heavily subsidized by us to carry out immediate experiments in the introduction of differentiated courses in the secondary schools. School boards would have been given powers to allocate family allowances, under provincial supervision, wherever able pupils required financial help to remain at school up to matriculation standard. We would have encouraged the provinces to introduce a post-matriculation course to mitigate the high first-year failure rate at the universities. Extensive categories of students would have been encouraged by us to apply for State assistance for study purposes at technical colleges, technological institutes and universities, as they are overseas. University lecturers would have been placed in very high pay brackets indeed, so as to attract the most highly qualified personnel possible, and research grants, from our point of view, would have been generous. Donations to institutions of higher education from the private sector, although there might have to be a ceiling, could very well have been tax free, instead of merely earning a remission of tax. Apprenticeship contracts could well have contained exciting bonus incentives on the acquirement of certain standards in different trades. Sheltered employment schemes could have been greatly expanded to absorb and protect those incapable of a high standard of academic or technical achievement. Then, Sir, in-service training by employers would have been encouraged by us by a system of tax remissions for those in the process of working overtime in order to improve their skills while they are on the job.</p>

<p>Part-time classes for early school-leavers as well as for adults&#x2014;we know that they are held at the moment&#x2014;would have been provided on a very much wider scale than at present. Others could have been established in active co-operation with employers and their employees, with the allocation of certificates for efficiency and achievement, for promotion purposes <span class="col_5047-5048" refersTo="page_1081"/>in employment, when they had attended classes for a certain period. Teacher-training and conditions of service would have received top priority from us, and the teachers, apart from having their own professional council, would have been divorced from the Public Service with all its inhibiting provisions in a field such as education, where adaptation and change are every bit as vital as security of tenure, particularly in the teaching profession. We would have introduced a scheme specifically designed to attract married women back into the profession, and we would have conducted an extensive and active teacher-exchange system with other Western countries to keep our ideas, systems and syllabuses up to date. Let us keep our minds open with regard to what is going on elsewhere in the world. I know that this exists in a small way but we would have done it on a very much more extensive scale.</p>

<p>I want to end, Sir, by saying that with real imagination, energy and drive, and, above all, with the close co-operation of the private sector of our economy, which is essential, we would have been able to utilize our labour potential, as well as our professional classes, in an exciting and very productive way. As things, are our education system is in a hopeless muddle. I would like to conclude by saying that anyone who has the misforune to take over the control of education from this Government will have a herculean task in attempting to rebuild all that has been allowed to crumble or to lie fallow and undeveloped. Only a new administration with new ideas can hope to clear up the confusion and indecision. which is the hallmark of so much that has been done&#x2014;or rather left undone&#x2014;by the present Government.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>In her speech the hon. member for Wynberg covered a very wide field in connection with educationsl matters. In the very limited time at my disposal it is, of course difficult for me to reply to all the matters she raised. I agree with certain of the things she said, but there are many other allegations on which I differ strongly from her. Towards the end of her speech she said that education ought to receive the highest priority. As an ex-educationist I agree with that contention of hers. She also referred to other matters here that I hope to react to in the course of my speech.</p>

<p>Sir, it is known that both the Secretary for Higher Education, Mr. M. C. Erasmus, and the Secretary for Cultural Affairs. Dr. J. J. P. Op&#x2019;t Hof, who was previously Secretary for Education, Arts and Science, are retiring on pension. Both these men have devoted the best years of their lives to education in various capacities. We on this side of the House want to express to the two gentlemen our highest gratitude and appreciation for the solid and fruitful work they did in the course of many years. We should like to give them our blessing, and wish them prosperity and good luck in their well-earned pension years. We hope that they will enjoy good health for many more years.</p>

<p>Sir, on my part I should also like to express my warm thanks to the Departments of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs for the various reports we obtained from them. I want to thank the Department of Higher Education for its annual report that was made available to us in another format&#x2014;a very attractive one. It is a very interesting report. I should also like to refer to the annual report of the Statutory Committee of Educational Heads. This is also a very informative report, which was already tabled quite a while ago, and which offers very interesting reading matter. We are also grateful for the report of the National Education Council, that proves to us what the council is doing at present. Regardless of the criticism expressed here by the hon member about the general progress of the work being too slow, good progress is being made. Then there is the attractive report of the Department of Cultural Affairs. We should like to express our thanks for the interesting information contained in this extensive report.</p>

<p>Sir, the most striking item in the Budget of 1970-&#x2019;71 is the sweeping increase in connection with financial assistance to the universities. The hon. member for Wynberg also referred to this. For the financial year 1970-&#x2019;71, an amount of R47,146,000 is being appropriated, an increase of 51.8 per cent on the previous year. I also want to refer to the funds for bursaries and loans that increased by 75.7 per cent in respect of the previous year. I should also like to refer to the subsidies for the Colleges for Advanced Technical Education, an increase of 22.1 per cent on the previous year.</p>

<p>The universities took note, with a great deal of thanks and appreciation, of these increased State subsidies. I attended the meeting of the University Council in Pretoria on the 17th of this month, and on that occasion these increased subsidies were gratefully noted. That council, of which I am a member, asked me to thank the Minister here in the House for the increased subsidies. But it is not only one university that is thankful for it. In this connection the decision of the committee of university heads reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been decided that letters of thanks for what was achieved by them in connection with financial provisions to the universities, are to be sent to both the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Education, and that the Chairman of the Committee of University Heads shall sign these letters.</block>

<p>The hon. member alluded to this in her speech, and in the censure debate she also said that if the United Party were to have come into power they would have made R80 million available as subsidies. Apart from the fact that it is a hypothetical statement, it is, of course, also nonsense, because how could the <span class="col_5049-5050" refersTo="page_1082"/>universities suddenly absorb such an increase&#x003F; It is definitely impossible. But in addition to these increased subsidies, which I have already mentioned, I also want to point out that the Provincial Administration also obtained increased subsidies from the Government. I do not want to mention the amounts for all the provinces, but for the Transvaal it is R4.6 million more than the previous year, and the largest amount is being spent by the Provincial Administration on education that is controlled by the Provincial Administration. The Transvaal has budgeted for R85.5 million for white education for 1970-&#x2019;71. This is an increase of 9.8 per cent as far as education in the Transvaal is concerned, as against the previous year&#x2019;s amount. This proves to us that the Government takes education seriously.</p>

<p>At this stage I should like to ask the hon. the Minister a question in connection with a matter I raised in a private motion in 1969. It concerned the Joint Matriculation Board, and on that occasion I advocated a more realistic approach in connection with the requirements for admission to the universities. I just want to ask the Minister whether any progress has been made in connection with that investigation which the previous Minister also mentioned.</p>

<p>There is a shortage of teachers. We cannot argue the fact away, and it is also a matter of concern to the Government and to everyone interested in education. There are various reasons for that, but I do not have time to go into them now. However, I want to mention one important reason that I have already mentioned in this House before and want to emphasize to-day. Our English language compatriots are neglecting their duty in connection with education. The English language schools to-day&#x2014;and I speak in particular of the Transvaal&#x2014;that I have some knowledge of, are to a very large extent staffed by Afrikaans-speak-ind teachers. I am not the only one to say so; let me quote what the Administrator of the Transvaal said recently in this connection. He put it this way (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another alarming phenomenon in our bilingual country, with its approach of equal facilities for both language groups, is the scarcity of English-speaking teachers. With few exceptions the English schools have more staff problems than the Afrikaans schools, particularly the high schools.</block>

<p>Is it not strange that even in high schools today one finds that English Higher is being given by Afrikaans-speaking people&#x003F; I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Consequently the staff of many English schools consists largely of Afrikaans teachers. With more English-speaking teachers the shortage of teachers in both Afrikaans and English schools would to a large extent be relieved, over and above the good influence it would have on the English language and culture.</block>

<p>I want to make the statement that if the English-speaking people to-day could just provide their share of the matriculants, i.e. 40 per cent, more or less, because we calculate that the English-speaking people constitute approximately 40 per cent of the total white population&#x2014;the shortage prevailing at Afrikaans and English-speaking schools could, to a large extent, be covered.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the Department of Cultural Affairs, but before coming to that, I want on behalf of the Opposition to express our appreciation to the two retiring Secretaries for the devoted service which they have rendered to South Africa.</p>

<p>The Department of Cultural Affairs has only been in existence for the past three years. Although a change is now being made&#x2014;and I would be glad if the hon. the Minister would inform us about this&#x2014;I want to say that although we on the Opposition side always warn against a multiplication of departments, the activities of the Department of Cultural Affairs, as they will continue, will always have our sympathy and will always be followed by us with the greatest of interest.</p>

<p>Firstly, I should like to compliment the Secretary and his staff on the excellent report which has been submitted to Parliament this year. It is as comprehensive and thorough as one could expect of any department. I do, however, want to say in passing that it is a pity that these reports are published in this kind of format so that they cannot stand upright on a shelf, with the year and the name on the back. It seems to me the departments forget that Members of Parliament have to deal with masses of reports, which grow in number over the years and that, in dealing with reports such as these which lie flat, one always has a great deal of difficulty in finding one for reference purposes in later years. Perhaps the Department of Education can take the lead in this direction and design a format which can serve as an example to the other departments.</p>

<p>With reference to the report and the Estimates there are a few questions I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. The first is in connection with the Africa Institute, for which there is an amount of R131,000 on the Estimates, an increase of R29,000 as compared with the previous year. Earlier during the session I asked the hon. the Minister a question in connection with the Africa Institute. It dealt with a commission which had been appointed to inquire into the activities of the Institute. The Minister then told me that on 13th May a commission had been appointed to investigate <i>inter alia</i> &#x201C;the extent to which the Institute carries out its duties in the light of its objects&#x201D;. There were a few other terms of reference as well. I am sorry that the hon. <span class="col_5051-5052" refersTo="page_1083"/>the Minister does not see his way clear to submitting the report to Parliament. After all, a Minister ought not to have such a lack of candour towards Parliament, particularly not when the public and Parliament are asked to provide a very large amount to such a body. I also asked another question in connection with the total amount provided to the Africa Institute. The Minister replied that up to that time a total amount of R742,000 had been granted to the Africa Institute. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I myself am a member and a supporter of the Africa Institute. I support its objects. Earlier this year I had occasion to conduct certain correspondence with the Chairman, Dr. F. J. de Villiers. In consequence of that, he was kind enough to invite me to pay them a personal visit and inspect their activities. I am still going to avail myself of that invitation. I have not yet been able to do so. I must say that until such time as I have availed myself of this opportunity, I shall reserve criticism in respect of the Institute. I know that important staff changes have taken place there. There definitely was room for improvement. It has always amazed me that persons such as Dr. Paul Weiss and Dr. At van Wyk were in control of an organization such as the Africa Institute and its publications until fairly recently. I do not mention this because I have anything against those people as far as their integrity is concerned. It must be very clearly understood that this is not my intention. I hope I shall not be misunderstood on this point. I grant them the same right to holding a political opinion that I claim for myself. However, I do not know how it happened that persons who, in their personal political views, advocate a kind of anti-contact policy in respect of non-Whites could have been placed in charge of an organization with the activities of the Africa Institute. This has always been incomprehensible to me. I would be glad if the hon. the Minister could clear up that aspect for us. As an increased amount is now being granted to the Institute, I hope that the new director will be someone who will not be embarrassed if he finds himself in the company of a black man.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to ask the hon. the Minister to inform me whether non-white South Africans can also enjoy the benefits of the Africa Institute. I am thinking in particular of non-white students, as this Institute is in fact the only one of its kind. Can they also enjoy the benefits of membership and of the activities of the Institute&#x003F;</p>

<p>There are a few other questions and proposals I want to put to the hon. the Minister. One sentence in the report of the Secretary for Cultural Affairs which has given me great pleasure, appears on page 4. There he says that &#x201C;the effectiveness of music as a medium for stimulating general cultural development cannot be over-estimated&#x201D;. I want to endorse this 100 per cent. I am speaking from personal experience; and in my own constituency there is the Athlone Boys&#x2019; High School, which has a magnificent school orchestra. That orchestra has a very great refining influence on the school. In this connection I should therefore like to suggest that the Department should see whether it cannot do more by way of subsidizing musical instruments for schools. In addition, I want to suggest that the Minister should consider making a national music festival of school orchestras possible annually so that school orchestras can compete with one another. National prizes can then be awarded for the best performances. I do not think it ought to be difficult to enlist the support of private initiative for something like this.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the National Monuments Act now makes statutory provision for the State paying a subsidy in respect of the purchase, restoration and maintenance of monuments, I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a principle which applies in America. The American tax system provides that a donor of a painting, an antique or books is allowed to deduct an agreed amount from his tax. The donor keeps the work of art or the books as long as he lives. After his death it then goes to the relevant public institution such as a library or museum to which it was bequeathed. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to investigate this system and determine whether it cannot be introduced in this country. I understand that in America this has been a definite incentive to people to bequeath works of art and antiquarian items to libraries and public institutions.</p>

<p>On the Estimates there is an amount of R75,000 for the &#x201C;integration&#x201D; of immigrants. The report refers to 18 projects which were undertaken last year. I would be glad to learn from the Minister how the people who qualify for these projects are selected. I should also like to know what results are being achieved and how successful this undertaking has been in respect of the integration of immigrants.</p>

<p>On page 5 of the report it is stated that the Cabinet approved the purchase by the Government of a number of the best Afrikaans and English literary works by writers &#x201C;who are South African citizens and who are resident in South Africa&#x201D; for distribution to foreign visitors.

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout will pardon me if I do not reply to the questions and proposals he put to the Minister. He made certain positive suggestions. I am sure he will in due course receive replies to those questions from the hon. the Minister. Sir, you will, however, allow me to refer to one or two matters which the hon. member for Wynberg mentioned in her speech. In this connection I should like to associate myself with what the hon. member for Koedoespoort said. The hon. member for Wynberg referred to a letter which the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association <span class="col_5053-5054" refersTo="page_1084"/>sent to the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and in which they referred to the state of education, <i>inter alia</i> in the Transvaal. Hon. members opposite do not understand the one cardinal problem. They must also address a very urgent appeal to the English-speaking section in South Africa not to disregard the teaching profession but to do their share in education in South Africa. The hon. member for Koedoespoort rightly said that if only we were to reach the position, corresponding to the language division of approximately 60 per cent to 40 per cent, that 40 per cent of the teachers were to come from the English-speaking section, we would have far less problems in our Afrikaans-medium and English-medium schools. However, those hon. members often blame the wrong group when there is a shortage of teachers. The former hon. member for Kensington, for whom we had great respect, said in passing that there was a shortage of English-speaking teachers, but no urgent appeal was addressed to the English-speaking section in this regard. I think the most urgent appeal which came from the opposite side in this regard, was the one made by the hon. member for Mooi River. Unfortunately I do not have the hon. member&#x2019;s Hansard reference here. Apart from that we have had no urgent appeal from their side, and we must get assistance from them. I want to point out something interesting now. I have here a cutting which puts forward a reason why English-speaking people do not join the teaching profession. The cutting reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The English Press can be partially blamed for the low number of English-speaking students who take up teaching, says Mr. M. Armstrong, Deputy Principal of the King Edward VII High School.</block>

<p>I do not want to read everything, but the cutting continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The recruiting figures of all Afrikaans Teacher Training Colleges are up, but at the local English Colleges they are the same, which means in terms of population growth, that they are down. Newspapers should not use education as a stick with which to beat the Government.</block>

<p>I want to say the same thing to those hon. members. They must not paint the education position so black and speak so disapprovingly of it and then expect to get people to join the teaching ranks. They may criticise, but they must also express the necessary thanks now and again. The word &#x201C;thanks&#x201D; is sometimes belittled to such an extent by that side that one hesitates to use the word where it is justified.</p>

<block name="quote">The English Press should give education a boost, but that does not necessarily mean that there should be no favourable comment.</block>

<p>Let us have more of that. Then we shall perhaps be surprised at what the reaction of the people whose services we need will be in this regard. We can continue in this way. I have here a whole number of cuttings concerning the very matter we are discussing here. Most of them are from English-language newspapers.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the report of the National Education Council. On page 2, paragraph 10.3, of this report, it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Conditions of service and salary scales, however, fall within the scope of section 2 (1) (j) of the National Education Policy Act, on which the Council still has to advise you.</block>

<p>On page 16 of the report of Educational Heads reference is also made to salary adjustments of white teaching staff as well as the adjustment of salaries for promotion posts, etc. I just want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has already been advised on these salary scales and conditions of service&#x003F; I should like to relate this to the announcement by the hon. the Minister of Finance, i.e. that an improvement will be effected to the salaries of Public Servants and also to those of teachers. Will these improvements which the hon. the Minister of Finance announced be effected according to the pattern of the advice which he has now received from these two bodies&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then I also want to add one thought to that. I assume that the commencing salaries of teachers will be made quite attractive. This is also necessary so that we may attract new recruits to the teaching profession. However, I want to make an appeal in this connection. If this is done we should not let those people down who have been rendering loyal service for years, those who cannot break away and seek a position elsewhere. We should give recognition to the services they have been rendering over the years and compensate them for that in their salaries.</p>

<p>While I am speaking of this, I want to say that it has become evident to us over the years, and we are realizing this more and more every day, that education is passing into the hands of women. I believe that this pattern will work out this way in the coming years. No matter what we do to attract more recruits to the teaching profession we shall be getting mainly women in that way. It therefore becomes necessary for us to give ever more attention to the conditions of service of women staff as well as the salaries paid to them. It is an interesting thing that attention has already been given to certain of these matters. In this report of the Educational Heads there is, for example, a resolution as to how the declared breadwinner, in the case of a woman, should be compensated financially and in what way assistance should be given. Specific attention has therefore been given to a matter which affects women. Where we are now heading for the position where <span class="col_5055-5056" refersTo="page_1085"/>education will be passing more and more into the hands of women, the serious question has arisen as to whether we have not reached a stage where the salary position of the women has to be rectified and whether the principle of equal pay for equal work should not be accepted&#x003F; This is what I want to advocate. I have always been a champion of this. It is not something I want to advocate only today. I was a member of the teaching profession myself, and that time I already found it a strange phenomenon that a woman in a post equal to mine and offering the same subjects, was not receiving compensation equal to mine. We must pay the same salary for equal posts. We should disregard the fact whether a man or a woman is occupying that post. In this way I think we shall attract more women to the teaching profession. I believe that those who are trained and who do not see their way clear to teach will be drawn back in this way. We talk a great deal about the hand which has to rock the baby in the cradle. All this is fine. But the task of the woman has become very difficult and important also in professional life to-day. Her duty has in fact doubled itself. She still has to rock that cradle, but she has to take her place in professional fife as well. We must also justly compensate those people who come to take their place in professional life in this way. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman it was very pleasant to hear from the hon. member who has just sat down that there should be equal pay for equal work. This is something for which this side had been pleading for a long time. The hon. the Minister may rest assured that he has the full support of the Opposition in this connection. There can be no objection to an appeal to people to enter the teaching profession. It is easy enough to make an appeal to English-speaking or to Afrikaans-speaking people to do so but I think the hon. member will be realistic enough to realize that appeals which we make here will not help a great deal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Why not&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Well it is simple. I now make such an appeal. Let us see what will come of it. In the long run there is only one way which will help and that is to make the working conditions so attractive that people would like to become teachers. There is no other way out.</p>

<p>In any case I should like to complete the questions which I have to put to the hon. the Minister in connection with cultural affairs. I quoted from the report in connection with the purchasing of certain Afrikaans and English literary works. I would be glad to learn from the hon. the Minister why there is this provision that a South African writer who qualifies must necessarily be resident in South Africa. I somehow got the impression that it is to exclude Breyten Breytenbach. But perhaps this is not the case. Then I would also appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would tell us what books came into consideration for this amount of R2,400.</p>

<p>The I find in the report that very serious concern is expressed by the Department about what in terms the &#x201C;deterioration in language usage in the Public Service&#x201D;. According to the report it is &#x201C;disquieting that some officers not only have an inadequate command of their second language but also make mistakes in their first language which one would not expect at their level of education&#x201D;. I think in this respect everyone can sympathize with the hon. the Minister. Admittedly this is not a problem which can be solved easily. We should nevertheless like to hear what attention the hon. the Minister is giving to it and whether he has any plans to improve the position.</p>

<p>Then there is a very serious observation in the report where reference is made to the Language Services Bureau and the serious shortage which exists in the posts structure. The report goes so far as to state that &#x201C;failure to meet at least part of the need for technical terminology within a few years may prejudice the prestige of Afrikaans as an official language&#x201D;. This is a very serious statement to make. If this is the case this is something which certainly deserves priority attention from the Government and the hon. the Minister. I would be glad to hear from him what ideas he has in this connection.</p>

<p>Then on page 21 of the report I find that the South African Library Association has decided to award one scholarship annually to each. of the &#x201C;friendly African states&#x201D;. We should like to know which African states were concerned here where the holders of these scholarships have studied and how successful these scholarship awards have been.</p>

<p>Then I am also interested in an observation in connection with a catalogue of banned books. This is something in which we are always interested. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether the catalogue compiled by his Department is intended for libraries. Is it available to the public as well&#x003F; Is it offered for sale&#x003F;</p>

<p>A further question I want to ask is in connection with cultural relations. We have cultural relations with three countries, i.e. Belgium. the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of West Germany. At present there is a vacancy, i.e. the post of Mr. Badie Badenhorst in Brussels. I would be glad if the Minister could tell us whether the post has already been filled and by whom. But what I really want to ask the hon the Minister is whether the time has not arrived for an extension to be made in this field. My own experience is that the cultural agreements which we have with these three countries are of very great value. This is striking if one considers the attitude of these three countries towards South Africa. One would therefore like to see extensions <span class="col_5057-5058" refersTo="page_1086"/>being made if it is at all possible. I have in mind a country such as Portugal which is becoming more and more important to South Africa and with which we shall have closer and closer relations in future. I have wondered whether we should not consider establishing such relations with a country which is so closely associated with South Africa and is our nearest important neighbour.</p>

<p>Reference is made in the Estimates to bursaries which have been awarded to foreign students in various countries. The relevant amount is R43,500. All that I should like to know from the hon. the Minister in this regard is whether these bursaries which we are awarding to foreign students are of a reciprocal nature. Have we received similar offers from the other countries from which we have received students&#x003F;</p>

<p>I should like to refer to what I shall call a lamentable remark made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. When he was asked following an appeal made on that side of the House to the effect that also English-speaking people should devote their energies to education the hon. member if I heard him correctly said that they would join the teaching profession if the conditions of service and circumstances of employment would improve.</p>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>I think that even the English-speaking people will hold it against him. The way the hon. member has put it implies that they are only interested in the material aspect and that they do not have any ideals.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg even referred to the year 1948 and subsequent years and tried to suggest that education has deteriorated under the National Party Government. There are a few matters I want to raise with the hon. member. I am speaking as a former teacher who was actively engaged in the teaching profession prior to 1948. At that time it was the Afrikaans-speaking people who formed the backbone of education. At that time there was a surplus of teachers who were unemployed. That was not attributable to their education system. The reason was that there were no other opportunities for Afrikaans-speaking boys unless they were prepared to do pick and shovel work. They did not make any provision nor did they create education facilities at that time.</p>

<p>If I furnish the hon. member with certain figures she may possibly change her views. She will then probably express her gratitude towards the National Party Government for having created opportunities for the Afrikaans-speaking boys so that they did not remain the poor Whites they were during the &#x2019;thirties and the &#x2019;forties. In 1948 that is the year to which the hon. member referred there were 446 vocational and secondary schools in South Africa. At present there are approximately 900. This is twice the number of schools we had in 1948 while our white population has not even doubled during that period. The number of high schools in South Africa increased from 106 in 1948 to 430. That is four times as many. The number of children attending vocational schools for example increased from 6,200 to almost 40,000 over a period of 22 years. I wonder what the hon. member has to say about that. We admit that there is a shortage of teachers. To that one should add that the National Party Government has always been aware of its duty towards and responsibilities in respect of education. This will continue to be the case in future.</p>

<p>We appreciate the importance of education. The importance thereof is as clear as pikestaff. We know that the future of the Republic is in the hands of a highly educated and developed people. We also appreciate that the education system of a people reflects the culture, religion, spiritual viability, labour potential and economy of a country. We know and appreciate the fact that there are problems as regards the shortage of teachers. This does not however apply to education only. There is a general manpower shortage. There are bottlenecks in many professions other than education. I believe that the importance of our education should be evaluated correctly and that conditions of service and salaries should be arranged accordingly.</p>

<p>The teachers in South Africa are fulfilling an enormous task under difficult circumstances in the interests of the education of our youth today. This is particularly the case where parents are leaving, to an increasing extent, their educational task to the teachers owing to circumstances, such long working hours. To my mind people have a completely wrong conception as to what the duties of a teacher are. The ordinary person regards a teacher as someone who works only five days per week, that he works six hours per day from the moment the bell goes in the morning until it goes again in the afternoon when the school closes. They are under the impression that a teacher goes on holiday four times a year. Whereas the work pattern is a five day working week, the teacher is one of the few people who has to cope with a six day working week to-day. He is one of the few who has to work more than eight hours per day. This is attributable to the numerous duties he has to fulfill after hours. Over and above that, teachers are responsible for fund raisings and out-door activities as regards sport and cultural affairs.</p>

<p>If only we would realize the magnitude of the tasks of the teacher over and above education, we would adopt a completely different attitude as regards his conditions of service. The hon. member for Germiston has already referred to the teacher and to his. conditions of service. In this connection I should like to make a few suggestions to the Minister. In order to <span class="col_5059-5060" refersTo="page_1087"/>retain a good teacher and to draw young men and women who are suitable for the teaching profession, I want to ask him that they be afforded greater encouragement in the form of more rapid promotion opportunities. In addition, I want to say that I do not believe that there are sufficient posts for people to be promoted to in education. I also want to associate myself with the plea put in by the hon. member for Germiston as regards equal pay for female teachers and more specifically for those of them who have made education their lifetask. I also want to say that I honestly believe that a higher maximum salary should be attached to the highest posts in education. In this regard I want to quote the following example. I honestly believe that the principal of the largest high school should earn more than R6,900. If we could increase that maximum considerably, we would have more scope to improve the salary scales in respect of the lower posts.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort referred to the investigation conducted by the Joint Matriculation Board into subjects required for admission to universities. I want to put in a plea with the hon. the Minister that we should give as soon as possible very serious attention to the elimination of those subjects required for admission to universities, viz. mathematics and the third language. I believe that we are keeping away from the universities very promising and very talended young men by insisting on these subjects. We will be able to draw a great number of these young people to education to teach Afrikaans and English, subjects in respect of which there is scarcity of teachers. But in view of the requirement laid down in that they should take a course in mathematics and a third language, we simply close the gates for these young people. I therefore want to put in a plea with the hon. the Minister that we should do away with these so-called qualifying subjects.</p>

<p>I should also like to appeal to commerce today, to our industrialists and business men to refrain from their piracy on education by enticing away some of our most able people. They should realize that the labour potential of a country and its economic future are in the hands of the teachers and that they are simply harming themselves by enticing away those able people who are responsible for the training of the technicians who have to serve our country in future.

<p>Sir, I want to refer to the lonely war graves of Boer and British soldiers which lie scattered over the battlefields of South Africa. These graves are often in a state of neglect, their whereabouts unknown and forgotten, but they are the unhonoured milestones along the course of our history. It is the task of the South African War Graves Board to restore and maintain these graves and graveyards, and also to establish gardens of remembrance. However, it has been becoming less customary to restore and maintain graves. The remains of Boer and British soldiers are being exhumed throughout the country and reinterred in mass graves at central points where large monuments are erected and gardens of remembrance are laid out. Thus the Magersfontein Monument between Kimberley and Modder River was unveiled by the hon. the Minister of Defence on 10th October, 1969. Kosie Briedenhann, one of the unknown young Boer heroes, the Dirkie Uys of the Anglo-Boer War, was buried there in grave 5A together with ten of his comrades, removed from the place where he committed his act of heriosm and removed from the historical context. The British troops surprised Kosie Briedenhann&#x2019;s commando early in the morning in their camp in the veld where they had spent the night about half a mile from his parents&#x2019; home on the farm Downs, approximately 12 miles from Campbell in the Northern Cape. After he and his fellowburghers had fled to safety on horseback, he raced back against the vicious cross-fire of the British troops in order to try to save his commandant, who could not mount his nervous horse. His commandant got away safely. Kosie Briedenhann was left behind alone on the battlefield&#x2014;struck down by a bullet in his forehead. His grave had always been well maintained and held in honour with wreaths and prayers. However, his remains were exhumed and reinterred in a mass grave at Magersfontein more than a hundred miles away, removed from the place where he committed his act of heriosm and the historical context. When I visited the original grave a year ago, the old gravestone was still there. We found pieces of his leather braces at the plundered grave as well as small remnants of his bones and a piece of tooth. This is how our heroes are being honoured by the South African War Graves Board. They should leave the graves in peace even if they want to erect mausoleums and monuments at central places. Numerous complaints about this are being received from all over the country. At the communal grave of the Black Watch at Magersfontein which was removed to the garden of remembrance in Kimberley, pieces of human bones were found on the surface. Buttons turned up as souvenirs among the owners of farms on which the graves of British soldiers had been exhumed. Even gold coins from plundered graves came into the possession of private individuals and were displayed in hotels, bars and clubs.</p>

<p><span class="col_5061-5062" refersTo="page_1088"/>It is generally rumoured that gold coins were exchanged at a shop in Modder River by prison labourers employed by a tombstone contractor while reinterments were being carried out. Reports were received from Bronkhorstspruit of gold coins taken from graves which turned up in the bar and were sold there. One monumental mason of integrity has been in possession of buttons, cartridges, bandoliers, boots, spurs, watches and numerous other souvenirs for many years, while awaiting official written instructions as to what to do with these articles. Other contracted were unable to hand in anything, and we suspect that these souvenirs were given away or sold in the trade. Hundreds of tombstones and military iron corsses from British graves are to be found in the backyards of monumental masons. Broken tombstones were smashed even further and iron crosses were buried in the garden of remembrance in Kimberley. Some of these historic military iron crosses were even sold at an auction in Natal, according to a report published in the <i>Argus</i> of 25th July. No wonder that in Kuruman the London Missionary Society refused to allow the remains in four British graves to be reinterred. Messrs. Marais and Jacobs, the owners of the land on which the Paardeberg battlefield is situated, also quite rightly refused to allow the graves of the Boer dead to be removed to Magersfontein. The reason is that the activities of the South African War Graves Board seem to us to be more like the violation than the maintenance of graves. We could honour the graves of the fallen far better if we left them in peace and let them fall into a state of disrepair rather than to have the violation that is taking place now. As a result of the erection of mausoleums and monuments, many of these milestones in our history are being lost. Gravestones which could indicate the course of a battle on a battlefield are being removed and one looks in vain for one&#x2019;s family and forefathers on the battlefields in South Africa. One might find their names in the gardens of remembrance. Twenty-eight battles are commemorated in the garden of remembrance in Kimberley, but on the new monument there is no indication anywhere in which of those 28 battles any particular soldier was killed. What is more, hundreds of mistakes occur in the transcriptions of the names on the various main monuments. One need only compare their names with those on some of the gravestones which were subsequently erected around these main monuments. To mention only a few examples: On the new main monument, among the names of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the name of Corporal J. Movatt is spelt with a &#x201C;v&#x201D;. On the printed list of the War Graves Board his name is given as Corporal Mouatt, spelt with an &#x201C;u&#x201D;, while in the regimental history his name appears as Corporal Mowatt, spelt with a &#x201C;w&#x201D;. To mention another example, the name of the second, officer in command of Roberts Horse appears on his gravestone as Captain Henry Grylls Majendie, but on the monument his name is given as Captain Grylls H; in other words, his surname was omitted. Regiments, ranks, initials and surnames are given incorrectly everywhere. The correction of the mistakes alone appearing in all these monuments will cost so much money that there will be little left for the other activities of the War Graves Board. In addition to all this, money is being wasted through being spent injudiciously. To mention one example, not far from here, in Simonstown, an architect was paid R6,000 to design a new garden of remembrance, which was to have cost R200,000. This plan fell through, but the account of the architect had to be paid. Furthermore it is the intention of the War Graves Board to exhume the remains, of many boer prisoners of war buried at Simonstown for reinterment at Magersfontein, although they were taken prisoner at Modder River and had nothing to do with the battlefield at Magersfontein. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate these irregularities. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we are still waiting for the Opposition to appeal to the English-speaking people to give more attention to and display greater interest in the teaching profession. It seems as if the Opposition is running away from education, because the last speaker we had, was the third on that side of the House to devote his speech to cultural affairs. As far as I know, we had only one speaker on the Opposition side who discussed the question of education.</p>

<p>On this occasion, where the hon. the Minister is dealing with this vote, National Education and Cultural Affairs, for the first time, I want to say to him once again that we are glad of the fact that he is the Minister of National Education and Cultural Affairs. We want to wish him every success and in doing so, we are fully aware of the magnitude of his task and its attendant problems. I do not have to deal at length with the times we are living in. However, I just want to make a few remarks in regard to the enormous &#x201C;explosion&#x201D; of knowledge where specialized knowledge particularly has become essential; the challenges mankind is being faced with to-day; and, of a more local nature, the problems of the manpower shortage. It seems to us that the solution lies in specialization, automation and mechanization. I want to deal with specialization in particular.</p>

<p>The increasing development and its attendant problems concerning manpower shortage emphasize the necessity to develop every pupil student to his fullest and maximum potential. Then I want to say that, where education serves as the preparatory period fo every person to take his rightful place in the community, the basis or the point of departure of our approach towards education should be the saving of labour through the utilization of labour. We cannot over-emphasize this idea. <span class="col_5063-5064" refersTo="page_1089"/>This should be our point of depature in our education and training. More stress should therefore be laid on differentiated education, and it is essential that we should deal more fully with differentiated education for a moment.</p>

<p>In the first place we have the kind of differentiation as far as the choice of subjests is concerned, and nobody can have any objection to that. Then we have differentiation in regard to streaming and that is where the A stream and the B stream or the U stream and the N stream comes in. I want to say to-day that to me it is quite absurd that there should be two standards of training in the same subject and with the same standard and two standards of examinations. To my mind this U stream and M stream differentiation can only have disadvantages, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister to what extent this is being observed and what his views are as regards this differentiation as far as streams are concerned and whether there is any possibility of this differentiation being abolished. The ideal differentiation is specialized vocational training in accordance with interest, aptitude and ability, and we will have to expand our psychological services in order to develop and expand these. Our vocational guidance services will have to be expanded; these services will not only have to be expanded but should be made an integral part of our entire national education system. We will have to give a great deal of attention to the training of our psychologists even at this stage. At present we have psychologists only at the industrial schools and this will definitely have to be extended to other schools as well, and the sooner we make a start with this the better it will be. Testing and guidance form the basis of differentiated education. This can only succeed when it is made an integral part of our entire education system. Now, this presents a problem as far as I am concerned&#x2014;and it is for that reason that I ask the Minister that this matter should receive our immediate and urgent attention&#x2014;in that it takes a long time to train psychologists. This is absolutely a specialized service. Then I come to the second aspect, and that is the provision of buildings in which clinics, etc., can be accommodated. The provision of buildings also takes a long time. It takes at least five years to provide a building and to have the necessary equipment installed. In order to use our human material correctly and in the right place in order to obtain the maximum productivity, we will have to provide these services as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I have another problem I want to raise with the hon. the Minister. This concerns the danger there is as a result of rumours which are being spread in respect of the commercial high schools and the technical high schools which have been transferred to the provinces., in that there is a tendency to have the technical training, the commercial training and the academic training under one roof. I may be wrong, but I am afraid that we will have comprehensive high schools in future. I should have liked to keep the commercial schools and definitely the technical schools separate in that atmosphere and climate to which they belong. I therefore want to put in a plea that the hon. the Minister should have this matter investigated.</p>

<p>There is also the question of commercial schools. In view of the fact that commercial schools are already in existence in the rural areas, we do not want these commercial schools to run empty and for that reason I feel that we should place the Std. 6, 7 and 8 pupils in these commercial schools during the period of transition.

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Speakers on the other side of the House have indicated that they feel we have not reacted directly to appeals made for our youth to take up the teaching profession. May I say that this matter will be dealt with by subsequent speakers, but I want to make it quite clear that we on this side of the House regard it as a priority that young people from both language groups, English and Afrikaans, should be encouraged with all the means within our power to enter the teaching profession. If I may say so on a personal note with some pride, the appeal which has been directed to the youth in our family circle has met with some success and that we have people in our family who will become and who are already dedicated teachers.</p>

<p>But what we must not overlook is the distraction and outside competition which at present are playing a very important part in the decisions which some young people are called upon to make. I want to quote certain aspects of these problems, particularly in relation to the actual present position of teachers <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> employees in other sectors. I believe this can only be done by quoting specific examples, which I quote not in a sense of destructive criticism but purely as facts. I want to take the case of a male teacher who at present is in the E Grade. This man has been to university for five years. He is the acting head of a department at a high school. He is a specialized teacher. What is his basic salary&#x003F; His basic salary at present is R235 a month, which after deductions means that he has for himself at the end of each month R196, and that for a man who has been to university for five years! What are the comparisons&#x003F; We have the case of a motor body builder, a younger man with a Std. 8 education, who is earning a net salary of R260 a month. Then I refer to an advertisement which appeared on behalf of the City of Germiston recently, where they are seeking the services of tractor-truck drivers. The salary offered is R175 to R250 per month, with leave bonus plus a 5 per cent bonus on pensionable salary. What are the qualifications required for this particular post&#x003F; Std. 6 and three years of experience. In other words, it could be the equivalent of a Std. 9 education, and the salary is equivalent to male teachers on the C Grade. Then we <span class="col_5065-5066" refersTo="page_1090"/>have another case in an older section of our society. That is an appeal directed to pensioners by the Pretoria City Council in which they advertise for temporary traffic inspectors and they are prepared to offer a salary of R200 a month, plus a free uniform, plus leave bonuses, plus privileges for anyone who has the qualification of Std. 8 or its equivalent. Is this the incentive we hold out for young people starting a teaching career in South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then I want to deal briefly with one example concerning the female staff, because I believe it is just as important as regards this aspect and I also want to congratulate the hon. member for Germiston on his appeal for equal pay for the sexes. I believe that this will be a positive way of dealing with this problem. Take a young C Grade female schoolteacher, who has spent three years at teachers&#x2019; college after having matriculated. To-day this person is a specialist subject teacher at a high school. She is in fact teaching Matric. &#x201C;boys who are in some instances only three or four years her junior. She has responsibilities, I think, beyond her age, and she is managing, but what does she recieve in the way of salary&#x003F; She receives a gross salary of R130 a month and a net salary of R118 a month. How does this compare with commerce&#x003F; We can refer to the City of Germiston, which recently had an advertisement. We find that they are prepared to pay typists with a qualification of Std. 8 and no experience a commencing salary of R108 a month, rising to R225.</p>

<p>So I could go on in this vein, but I want to come to the question which the hon. member for Durban (Central) dealt with under the Social Welfare Vote last night. This is the question of teachers&#x2019; pensions. I know it is a difficult matter. It falls within the ambit of two departments, but I want to make a special appeal to the hon. the Minister to give very seious consideration particularly to the older teachers. Many of them have contributed in proportion a greater portion of their salary than the present teachers and many of them are living almost on the breadline. And old lady teacher receives R50 a month, whereas a married male teacher receives a pension of R100 a month. I want to suggest that in many instances these people are becoming backyarders; they have to live in quarters which they find in the backyards or in the alley-ways and passages, because they cannot afford to live in circumstances commensurate with the standard to which they are entitled as people who have served their country. I know that the benevolent funds sponsored by teachers help to overcome this, but I do not believe that people of this category should have to exist on charity.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he could give me some information in connection with the Straszacker report. The hon. the Minister will be aware that the commission of inquiry into the method of training for university degrees in engineering, known as the Straszacker Commission, has now sat for twelve years. It has cost the taxpayers of South Africa R80,000, and has now submitted three abridged reports. In the meantime, while the report of the Straszacker Commission was being finalized, a colleague of the hon. the Minister, the Minister of Planning, appointed a committee to investigate the need for further training facilities for engineers at South African universities. We know that this committee&#x2019;s report has been submitted. We know that it was no great drain on the taxpayers&#x2019; money, because it cost only R2,000, compared with the R80,000 in the case of the Straszacker Commission, but what was the need and the object of having another committee investigating a matter which was already being thoroughly investigated by men fully qualified to do so&#x003F; Now that the report of the Straszacker Commission has been tabled, can the Minister inform us what immediate steps are being taken by his department to implement some of the recommendations which I believe are becoming increasingly urgent. I say in passing that it is interesting to note that here again the report of the commission says that more attractive salaries and conditions of service are essential for people who teach in engineering. They recommend as a guiding rule that supply and demand should have some influence on the actual salaries paid.</p>

<p>In the short time left to me I should like to deal with the question of educational statistics. I realize that it is difficult to co-ordinate statistics and to obtain up to date statistics in regard to education. When one refers to the report of the National Education Council, one finds that under the section dealing with the Human Sciences Research Act, the collection and collation of educational statistics are subject to Ministerial approval. My question to the Minister is: Will the figures be made available either to Parliament or to interested parties&#x003F; I notice too that the Statutory Committee of Educational Heads referred to educational statistics as well. In this connection it includes the Department of Statistics. It says; &#x201C;Uniform basic tables should be made available to each education department to make good the backlog in tabulation and publication of educational statistics.&#x201D; [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, underlined quite clearly at the beginning of his speech the basic difference between that side of the House and this side of the House, in that he said that remuneration was in fact the main cause for the shortage of teachers. He made certain comparisons between the remuneration received by teachers and the remuneration received by people in other careers, something which is not really at issue in this regard. In other words, he concentrated on the material aspects. As regards teachers, he did not take into consideration the fact that there are other requirements which have to be taken into consideration <span class="col_5067-5068" refersTo="page_1091"/>apart from the material aspects. There are other requirements, such as the spiritual aspects, which are much more important than purely the money aspect. I am very grateful to be able to say this morning that our teachers in this country have never made a point always to complain about the money aspect. The standards they set for themselves are much higher than that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni also spoke about education matters earlier. He made the statement that teachers to-day were not as well qualified as they used to be. He did not furnish proof of this absurd statement he made to the House. That is not the case, and he should know it. On the contrary, when one looks at this year&#x2019;s Budget, one will see how much money is really being spent on the training of teachers. For example, universities are being given increased grants. It is clear that, in the light of this change in our approach towards education which has revealed itself over the past few years, we are concentrating on improving the training of our teachers. How is it possible for the hon. member to make such a statement&#x003F; It will merely serve to cause concern in the country when stories are bruited about to the effect that the teachers of to-day are not as well equipped as they used to be in the past. To my mind this is a most irresponsible statement for the hon. member to make.</p>

<p>There are a few matters I want to raise in regard to cultural affairs, but before doing so, I want to say that, as far as I am concerned, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made quite positive contributions on two occasions this morning. He referred to the necessity of expanding and strengthening our cultural relations with countries overseas. We do not disagree with him. All I want to say, is that we have put in a serious plea last year and also prior to that that consideration should be given to the appointment of more cultural attach&#x00E9;s in our foreign missions. If that is what he is pleading for this morning, we want to support him, but then we want to point out that he is really the person who supported this side of the House in the pleas that were made in this connection in the past.</p>

<p>In the few minutes left to me, I want to come back to the question that was raised here before now. I want to say at the outset that we are very grateful for the fact that the Government has once more seen fit to appropriate R2,400 this year for the purchase of the works of deserving authors. It is not necessary for me to-day to discuss the importance of the part played by our creative artists. What I do want to do, is to bring to the attention of this House once again the need of these people. I have an example here of one of our most prominent authors in this country. The example is typical of the circumstances under which our authors have to produce their best. This particular person received royalties to the amount of R33.51 over a period of six months. The cost of publication, which had to be deducted, amounted to R33.51. He therefore did not receive anything. Apart from that, he still owed to the publisher R6.49 at that time. In addition, the author had to pay R40 to a typist for typing his manuscript. I want to point out that this person is trying to devote his energies on a full-time basis to the production of cultural products of a high standard. His income from this source in one month amounted to approximately the following: The royalties in respect of Book A was R5.59; on Book B, R2.65; on Book C, R25.59 and on Book D, R22.03, giving a total of R55.87.</p>

<p>I now ask in all fairness: How is it possible for a person to produce his best under such circumstances&#x003F; In view of this amount of R2,400, which is actually being voted to give some assistance to such people in their attempts to produce work of a high standard, I want to put in a plea with the hon. the Minister this morning that he should consider the possibility of extending the assistance to our authors in particular. I want to say that I am convinced that any assistance given to these people will be an investment towards the spiritual viability of the people of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I want to refer to and which concerns our performing arts. An amount of R1,166,000 is being appropriated for this purpose. We appreciate this a great deal, but what is worrying us in this regard is the fact that so many artists are imported from overseas. This is not necessarily wrong. I want to say this immediately, but in view of the fact that our local artists have such a Limited field, it does not seem right to me that we should import people on such a large scale from overseas literally to take the bread out of the mouths of our local artists. I wonder whether we could not do more to enable our local artists to come into their own. These people do not have sufficient security to enable them to devote their energies on a full-time basis to the calling of being artists. I think the time has come that some attention should be given to this matter as well.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to say that we should have liked to have had an indication as to when the investigations into the establishment of cultural centres will be finalized. This is a very important matter and I think that this is an appropriate occasion to pay tribute to the retiring Secretary for Cultural Affairs, Dr. Op&#x2019;t Hof. for the task he has fulfilled and the initiative he has displayed to make possible the establishment of cultural centres. I want to say that the time has come that serious attention should be given in this country to find something to counteract all the foreign influences which are being brought to bear on our country. I have here in my hand the results of an investigation into the estrangement of our youth.</p>

<p>According to this investigation the main causes of this estrangement are as follows: <span class="col_5069-5070" refersTo="page_1092"/>Excessive and injudicious bioscope attendance, the foreign clothes and hairstyles worn by young girls and boys, various modern dances such as rock and roll, and so forth, the foreign and wild music, taking part in the various types of Sunday sport, lack of church ties, alcoholism, gambling, &#x201C;jukebox&#x201D;, loitering, poor family relations, familiarity towards adults, faulty and careless use of language, neglect of family ties, and so forth. I want to say that I believe that these cultural centres will be an excellent <i>quid pro quo</i> for these kinds of phenomena.

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was completely amazed and surprised by the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Springs. He seems to be living completely in a dream world of his own. In fact, it looks as if he is totally divorced from the realities of to-day and out of touch with teachers as such. Hence his statement that the teachers of to-day are no longer interested in the material aspect of their profession. He mentioned this in particular to illustrate what he called the fundamental difference between this side of the House and that side of the House. The hon. member challenged the hon. member for Benoni to substantiate his remark that if you compare the qualifications of the teachers of 1948 with those of to-day, you would find that in 1948 we had teachers with higher qualifications. This in fact proved that he is completely ignorant about the situation as it exists to-day.</p>

<p>I am sorry that he did this. I am sorry that he wanted to play politics in this respect. By doing so the hon. member is forcing me to give the House certain information which I would have preferred to remain silent about. Survey have been conducted in certain high schools and an analysis has been made of the staffing situation in schools in 1964 as compared with that of 1969. I am going to quote, for the benefit of the hon. member, some of the conclusions of this survey. Then we can talk again whether there is a lowering of standards and qualifications. I am going to refer to some of the conclusions:</p>

<block name="quote">The percentage of qualified graduate teachers has declined steadily over the past six years, from 64 per cent to 57 per cent. This amounts to an average decrease of over 1 per cent per year. The percentage of non-graduate teachers has increased steadily over the past six years, from 304 per cent to 37&#x00BD; per cent. This amounts to an average increase of 1 per cent per year. It appears that the decline in graduate teachers is being compensated by a proportional increase in the number of non-graduate teachers. The percentage of non-graduate teachers with no qualifications in their subjects increased from 34 per cent at the end of 1964, to 11&#x00BD; per cent at the end of 1969, a net increase of 8 per cent.</block>

<p>My advice to the hon. member is to make sure about his facts before he comes here to challenge us to prove our statements. Furthermore, in so far as the material aspect is concerned, let us look at this further comparison:</p>

<block name="quote">In 1964 over 41 per cent of the teaching population had over 15 years&#x2019; experience. In 1969 only 20 per cent had over 15 years&#x2019; experience.</block>

<p>I suggest to the hon. member that perhaps one of the reasons why some of those people left the profession is because they were concerned about the material aspect of their profession.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will in replying to this debate give us greater clarity about the general education policy in South Africa, especially in respect of the following aspects: Firstly, the position of the teacher. Here I refer in particular to the status of the teacher. Then there is the matter of the shortage of teachers. I would like to have the hon. Minister&#x2019;s views about the shortage of teachers and about possible means of combating it. Secondly, I would like to refer to the place of the teacher in relation to his profession; in other words, the place of the profession in the general educational scene. My last point is the possibility of the introduction of a proper differentiated system of education.</p>

<p>A few months ago, Professor H. B. Thom, the chairman of the National Education Council, in a broadcast over the radio indicated that at present South Africa does not possess the means to bring about revolutionary changes in education. He also expressed the desire that the educational changes should be left to the process of evolution. I accept this statement as being basically sound. However, I must immediately express my doubts about the direction this evolutionary process is taking education at present. Is it in fact progressing gradually or is education slowly being subjected to a process of deterioration&#x003F; I have no hesitation in saying, if we allow education to develop on the present lines, the hon. the Minister and his advisers will find that when they eventually manage to formulate the educational policy, the application of that policy will be impossible, due to an infinitely worse situation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this whole attitude of leaving everything to the process of evolution has resulted in too many urgent educational problems permanently being placed into cold storage. One only has to read through the various reports of the statutory Committee of Education Heads and the National Educational Council to realize the extent of this. I want to refer to one in particular. This is the matter of the establishment of a registration council <span class="col_5071-5072" refersTo="page_1093"/>for teachers. For many years, in fact for many decades, we have had the South African Federal Council of Teachers, urging the Government to implement this. In 1964 they even went so far as to submit a draft Bill in this respect. When I asked the hon. the Minister about this a couple of months ago, he quite rightly referred me to the Consolidated Report of the National Advisory Educational Council on <i>The Teacher</i> which was published in 1968. Let us have a look at this. In chapter five we find that &#x201C;the Educational Council has decided to defer its consideration of the question of a teaching council or registration council for the time being. That is to say, the Council at this stage does not identity itself with or reject&#x201D; the recommendations. I believe I am fully justified in saying that this has been placed in cold storage. I think that 40,000 teachers are entitled to a definite answer in this respect. It is quite clear to me that the hon. the Minister and the authorities have serious objections why they cannot entrust teachers with the responsibility inherent in the creation of a council for teachers. Are teachers inferior to our nurses&#x003F; Are they inferior to our doctors, to our surveyors and to our architects&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to know from the hon. the Minister on what grounds he bases his assumption that any future body of teachers will be better qualified for this task. If the present body of teachers cannot do this on what grounds does he base his attitude that a future body of teachers will be better equipped for this&#x003F; Recently he has had requests from the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association and he also had a request from the N.T.S. about the status of the teacher I may add that the T.T.A.&#x2019;s request had the support of Professor Du Toit, the Chairman of the T.O. He said, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Professor Du Toit, president of the Transvaalse Onderwysersvereniging and Rector of the Pretoriase Onderwyskollege, said to-day that the T.O. also felt very strongly about the crisis in education and he personally considered the pleas made by the T.T.A. in the telegram sent to the Minister &#x2026; were justified.</block>

<p>During the debate on the hon. the Minister of the Interior&#x2019;s Vote, we on this side of the House advocated the separation of education from the Public Service Commission. We did this, because we believe this is the first prerequisite towards granting teachers professional Status. I want to say that the hon. the Minister of the Interior ignored my plea, but I believe that this hon. Minister will give us his views about this matter. I believe he will give us his views because I believe that as long as the teaching profession is limited to work within the framework of the Public Service Commission, we will have in South Africa salary campaigns conducted by teachers.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chaiman, I do not intend to react to the variety of subjects the hon. member for Durban (Central) mentioned. However, when he quotes the percentage of qualified teachers I want to point out that he is losing sight of certain other facets, i.e. that the percentage of teaching posts in all the provinces increased at a greater rate than the school-going pupils. I want to point out further that in our secondary schools the relationship of the percentage of matriculants to the percentage of pupils with Std. 6 increased by more than 12 per cent. What are the facts&#x003F; The facts are that in the past six years in the Cape alone, 8,965 candidates entered teaching in terms of a bursary scheme for education students. There was an increase of more than 800 in one year. What is relevant is that in 1953-&#x2019;54 there were 7,770 teachers in the Cape, while there are 11,311 this year, an increase in teaching staff of more than 45.6 per cent. It is very easy to think and speak euphorically, and to say that we should remove the teaching profession from the Public Service structure. However, there is not a single profession that hon. members opposite do not ask us to remove from the Public Service structure.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni made the irresponsible statement that the teachers of today are less well qualified than the teachers of 1948. That is, surely, not only nonsense, but also an insult to the teaching profession in this country, because the obverse is true. It is very easy to play the sacrosanct role and to say that education should be kept out of politics, as the hon. member said, but to-day I want to make a general accusation to the effect that hon. members opposite are the ones who are bringing education into the midst of the political battlefield. I expect them to react to certain irresponsible statements of certain hon. members on their side, and I expect them to do so his afternoon. I want to lay the accusation at the door of hon. members opposite, i.e. that they do not truly and essentially want to serve education, but that they want to use the educational institutions, which ought actually to form the basis of the State, and apply them for the purposes of political expediency. What hon. members opposite are doing here, and what their speakers are saying outside this House, do not tally. It is very clear that in respect of education the United Party does not want to do any basic and fundamental thinking, as with any other subject of importance, but that they allow themselves to be swept along by the circumstances they find themselves in at a particular moment. The United Party must tell us whether they agree with the Leader of the United Party in the Cape Provincial Council. I told the hon. member for Wynberg I was going to speak about this.</p>

<p>There are two basic principles that obtain here. The first is that a principle exists that has an educational basis, i.e. that a child should be educated in his mother tongue. The United Party does not agree with this. The United Party says that in the medium of a child&#x2019;s education the educationally based principle should not have the upper hand and be the deciding factor; the parental choice must be the deciding factor. In other words, the United Party is prepared to sacrifice a principle, inherent in every controlled investigation, and in the report resulting from the investigation that took place, for purposes of political expediency and the supposed recognition of the democratic right of the parent to make a choice about the medium in which his child must be educated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>But let us go further. What is the historic development&#x003F; In this country the historic development of education in respect of the medium of education involves recognition of and respect for this principle. This involves, for example, the exclusion of parental choice as far as the medium of education is concerned. This was placed on the Statute Book by kindred spirits of hon. members opposite during their period of office, They did so in 1911, 1919 and 1925. One of their predecessors, Senator F. S. Malan, also said that the parent had as little right to choose the medium of education for his child as he had to determine the course for a B.A. degree. While we are now continuing to build progressively on the same accepted principle, hon. members opposite say that this principle is no longer decisive. Parental choice is now decisive&#x2026;.</p>

<p>But I want to go further. There is a second facet in respect of which the parent can exercise a choice, i.e. the school his child attends. The Leader of the United Party in the Provincial Council now says that a single medium school is an absurdity, it is ridiculous. What is the practice&#x003F; It is very clear, Sir, that in really wanting to judge the Opposition&#x2019;s standpoint you find a contradiction between their actions and their words, a contradiction that one finds in all their actions. What is the truth&#x003F; The United Party clamourously advocates the policy of parental choice with respect to the medium of education. But parental choice in sending a child to an English, Afrikaans or parallel medium school is being eliminated. Which hon. members in this House send their children to parallel medium schools&#x003F; We begin there. When National Party members want to have their children educated in their mother tongue for the same educational reasons, the United Party advocates parental choice. But when it comes to the question of single or parallel medium schools, the United Party expects National Party parents to be denied their democratic right to choose the school to which they want to send their children. What are the facts&#x003F; In the Cape there are 41 English medium schools with 16,000 children. I now ask, who established them&#x003F; There are 50 schools where Afrikaans is the medium of education. But there are 958 declared parallel medium schools. Who send their children there&#x003F; In these declared parallel medium schools in the Cape there are 190,000 children. This represents 82 per cent of the school-going children. But I have now asked pointedly, must we make the existing English medium schools in the province parallel medium schools&#x003F; The hon. member for Salt River in the Provincial Council said &#x201C;Yes, we must make all of them parallel medium schools&#x201D;. The Leader of the United Party in the same Provincial Council says &#x201C;No&#x201D;.</p>

Then he says: In respect of future development we must please make them parallel medium schools. In other words, the established right which the English-speaking child has obtained must be protected, but when it comes to the extension of educational services, the same opportunity for parental choice in respect of the medium of education must not be allowed.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, since the last time we were together here, quite a number of changes have taken place. <i>Inter alia</i> we have a new main speaker on educational matters on the Opposition side in the person of the hon. member for Wynberg. I want to congratulate her on the distinction which has come her way. The English-language newspapers have even commended her as the <span class="col_5075-5076" refersTo="page_1095"/>shadow minister of education. Now that we have a new dispensation in education in the sense that our earlier legislation on educational matters has been finalized, and the persons who were most closely concerned in that have disappeared from the scene, I was justified in expecting that we would be able to start afresh and that we would be able to hold positive discussions on education and planning in this country. I am very seriously convinced that if we are not able to approach this matter in a positive way from both sides, there are difficulties in store for us. In spite of the great expectations I cherished, the speech made by the hon. member for Wynberg was one of the greatest disappointments I have ever experienced in this House. I do not want to be personal now. I am talking about the content of her speech. I want to couple the hon. member&#x2019;s speech to what was said in other debates during this Session, for quite a number of references were made to educational matters which I cannot allow to pass without comment. I shall in the course of this summary return to a closer examination of what the hon. member for Wynberg said. On 20th July the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said <i>inter alia</i> (Hansard, column 32).</p>

<p>The educational policies of this Government have been a crime against South Africa.</p>

<p>In the same speech the hon. member said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But for the Government&#x2019;s race policy and lack of educational policy &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is where it affects me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the South African economy could outperform every other industrial country in the world, with the possible exception of Japan.</block>

<p>Sir, to that I couple references made by the hon. member for Wynberg in that same debate, the censure debate. She referred to the De Villiers report which appeared in 1948. In that connection she said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is 22 years since those were written by the De Villiers Commission. I suggest that they have receive the scantest possible attention from this Government during that whole period of 22 years.</block>

<p>In the same debate the hon. member made the statement she repeated to-day, i.e. that our educational policy and our educational system was allegedly 25 years behind the times. This is a quotation which also appears in the official document of the United Party. &#x201C;You want it, we have it&#x201D;. She exulted in the fact that that quotation was taken from <i>Volkshandel.</i> She went further. She said that Mr. Werner Pauw of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, and one of the members of the board of <i>Volkshandel,</i> discussed vocational education and that he expressed a certain measure of concern at the lack of planning between commerce and industry and the educational authorities. But if it is read in that context, it creates the impression&#x2014;I am not saying that she deliberately wanted to create that impression&#x2014;that Mr. Werner Pauw had allegedly said that our educational system was 25 years behind the times. I want to say with the greatest emphasis now that if that is what she deduced, then her deduction is completely erroneous. I want to deal with this matter. What did the De Villiers Report deal with&#x003F; The hon. member for Wynberg is now saying that in 22 years this Government has given no attention to that report. The De Villiers report pointed out certain deficiencies in vocational education and suggested certain recommendations. The most important point around which everything centred, whether those deficiencies could be remedied or not, was the question of divided control over education on the secondary level. Mr. Greyling, the director of <i>Volkshandel,</i> also referred specifically to this point in the leading article in <i>Volkshandel.</i> I agree with them that this is a matter which should have been dealt with 25 years ago. But if that is true, then it is the United Party which should have remedied this matter, and not this party which must now eventually, after so many years, remedy it. I am now asking the hon. member for Wynberg, what was her standpoint when she served on the Provincial Council&#x003F; Did she express her concern in regard to vocational education, and more specifically in regard to commercial education&#x003F; I never heard her do so, nor was I able to find anything on that score in writing. But she wants to charge this Government with having done nothing about this extremely important matter in 22 years. I want to say now that the facts refute what she said here. There have been 11 Government commissions since 1910. All of them have admitted that Parliament has the right to effect that change. I am now asking the hon. member why her party, if it was so active in regard to this matter, did not remedy it a long time ago&#x003F; It required a National Party Government to cut this Gordian knot. It was with the Educational Services Act, Act No. 41 of 1967, that we ended this divided control and transferred vocational education to the Provinces. Eighty-one of our schools and approximately 2,500 teachers were transferred. It took planning and courage and daring to achieve this. In all the years the United Party was governing, they did not have that courage and daring. Mr. Chairman, if one has listened to the speech made by the hon. member for Wynberg and to the statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and one wants to argue in an honest and objective way in regard to this matter, one asks oneself what did the hon. members envisage with such statements&#x003F; What is the hon. the Leader of the Opposition envisaging with such a vague, non-committal statement, which he did not support in his speech&#x003F; He merely mentioned it and then left it dangling in mid-air. <span class="col_5077-5078" refersTo="page_1096"/>He then went on to discuss the labour question. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did South Africa a disservice when he made the allegation that this Government&#x2019;s educational policy was a crime against South Africa and the people of South Africa. I am sorry that he expressed himself in such strong language.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can quote other examples which were mentioned here. Just take for example the allegation made by the hon. member for Yeoville in his speech. He is not present in this House at the moment, but he also wanted to participate in this chorus of criticism, only he was quite unaware that his note was false. He came forward with the allegation that our greatest deficiency was a lack of technicians. He said that in 1948 we had had four technical colleges in this country, and that today we only had five and that the shortage had increased. Unfortunately the hon. member is not present here, but this is the only opportunity I have to reply to him. He does not know what he is talking about, and I want to advise him not to give himself out to be an authority on educational matters. What he should have said was that in 1967, in terms of Act No. 40, we established the Colleges for Advanced Technical Education, which provide training to technicians, and that to-day we do not have five, but we have six. Sir, what have we produced in this short period&#x003F; The technicians&#x2019; courses were introduced for the first time in 1958, and let me say this for the benefit of the hon. member for Wynberg, who claims that we have no liaison with commerce and industry, these courses for technicians were drawn up in consultation with commerce and industry. Commerce and industry has been and are being consulted in all these matters, and what is being done there, is being done according to their requirements, and in so far as we determine it to be educational. What have we achieved in these few years&#x003F; We have achieved this position that we have introduced 106 courses for technicians; that last year there were 6,043 students at these colleges for advanced technical education, and that there were 24,365 subject enrolments and that more than 4,000 technicians have already been fully trained in these institutions. Sir, I ask you, what do you think of such allegations such as those made here by the hon. member for Yeoville&#x003F; Surely he was talking nonsense.</p>

<p>Sir, I come to the other point raised by the hon. member for Wynberg, i.e. that this Government had allegedly done nothing about the situation which arose in regard to people who left school at an early age, the Std. 6 people. She spoke in the censure debate on people who were leaving school with only a Std. 6 certificate, and to-day she spoke about people leaving school with Std. 8 certificates. Sir, let us have a look at these particulars in order to prove that the hon. member still has a great deal of studying to do. I still have a lot to learn in this portfolio, but I want to tell the hon. member that I think that she has more homework to do than I have. I should like to furnish you with a few particulars, Sir. She said that increased school-leaving after Std. 6 was the order of the day, and that this Government was doing nothing to counteract this. In 1948 only 27.5 per cent of those who had been in Std. 6 in 1944 passed their matriculation examination. In 1958, ten years later, 32.8 per cent of those who had been in Std. 6 in 1954, passed their matriculation examination. In 1968 47 per cent of those who had been in Std. 6 in 1964, passed their matriculation examination. Sir, if you take these figures, i.e. 27.5 per cent, 32.8 per cent and 47.2 per cent, does that look like deterioration to you, after &#x201C;years of neglect&#x201D;, as the hon. member described it&#x003F;</p>

<p>May I ask the Minister a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I first want to finish my argument. The hon. member, before she became shadow minister, wrote a series of articles in <i>The Argus.</i> She called the series &#x201C;The state of education&#x201D;. It consisted of four articles. I read them, and I must say I was shocked when I read them. I was amazed when I came here to-day and heard her quoting extracts only from those articles. [Interjections.] If I can find the time, I shall point out to you from the speech all the particulars which you used in that series of articles. It is obvious that the hon. member will demur now, but the facts are there in black and white, and we can always check on them.</p>

<p>What did the hon. member do&#x003F; She alleged that more and more people were leaving school after Std. 6 and this Government was doing nothing about it. I have shown you the particulars, I want to go further. I have here figures which are taken from a report of the Human Sciences Research Council which in 1965 tested the entire Std. 6 school population of that year and followed them through the years. What did they find&#x003F; They found that 1.65 per cent of the pupils eventually left school without Std. 6. They found, secondly that 8.53 per cent left school with a Std. 6 certificate, and that 10.18 per cent left school with a qualification equal to or less than Std. 6. Surely this is a damning refutation of the allegation made there by the hon. member. But I shall leave it at that. What has this Government done&#x003F; The Government has laid down our policy for all Departments of education in the country that every pupil shall remain at school until the end of the year in which they turned 16 or until they passed the final examination of the secondary school, whichever is the sooner. Now I am asking whether this is not the greatest of encouragements, and to an extent even compulsion to keep those children at school so that they can equip themselves further&#x003F;</p>

<p>But the hon. member went further and said that nothing was being done for these people. <span class="col_5079-5080" refersTo="page_1097"/>On the one hand she pleaded for consultation with trade and industry and on the other hand she stated that nothing was being done for these people who left school with such low qualifications. I want to tell you what has been done. The requirements for apprentices are laid down in consultation with industry. The courses are drawn up in consultation with them. It is obvious that the industrialists expect an apprentice to have a measure of theoretical knowledge of his subject as well, and they determine, to a very large extent, what has to be learned. Let me tell you that most of the children leaving school with those low qualifications unfortunately do not have the intellectual ability to make further progress. What becomes of them&#x003F; They cannot become apprentices when they are unable to complete the theoretical studies, and they enter fields where one can receive only practical training and where one can make a profitable livelihood. In his plea for better salaries for teachers the hon. member for Berea referred to panelbeaters who were earning more than some teachers. Sir, do you know that many of those people who are doing panelbeating work are in fact some of those Std. 6 and Std. 7 pupils who were unable to progress further because they simply did not have the intellectual ability to do so&#x003F; I maintain that for the hon. member to come forward with these allegations now is by no means in accordance with the facts. After I had listened to what the hon. member had to say here, and after I had read her articles in the <i>Argus.</i> I must tell you that if our teachers are really in such a state, then things are really going very badly for us, but thank goodness this is not the situation, and let me tell you, Sir, the hon. member herself knows that this is not the case. As far as I am concerned, I whould have welcomed it if she had come forward with a positive approach so that it would have been possible for us to conduct a constructive dialogue on this matter. I now want to lay this at the door of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. In contrast to what he alleged, South Africa has an educational policy and an educational system which, within the framework of our economic ability and our potential in this country, and also as far as its aims and achievements are concerned, is at least as good and efficient as that of any comparable country in the world. Our educational system and educational policy has produced men and women who need not in any sphere take second place to any person in the world. We have produced scientists and research workers of world renown. It is for this reason that we have the problem that they are being enticed away&#x2014;precisely because they are such outstanding persons. But now I do not want to imply that our educational system is perfect and has no shortcomings. In fact, I want to state with emphasis that if innovations and adjustments in education do not form the basis of our progress in this country, we are building on sand. By terminating divided control over secondary education, every Department of education is more capable than ever of supplying education which takes into account the aptitude, interest, competence and intellectual ability of every pupil. With a view to that we must think together, plan together and work together. This is not the time for negative criticism and for sowing suspicion in regard to our education. This is not the time for disparaging the faith and confidence of the teacher in the profession he has chosen. Our education now needs a period of tranquility, a time for reflection, and the Opposition ought to be able to make a valuable contribution, if it wants to. We now have a new Minister and we have a new shadow Minister and we are getting new officials. The struggle for our statutory framework is over. Now I want to ask the main speaker of the Opposition on education to help us to make something positive of this educational debate, through which we can achieve something for our country. When it came to my attention that the hon. member for Wynberg was the new shadow Minister of Education on the Opposition side, it reminded me of something. I then paged through my newspaper clippings and found one of just a few months before in which it was stated that the shadow Minister of Education on the Opposition side was Senator Horak. It seems to me we have an Opposition which not only has two shadow Ministers, but one which is going to follow a dual course in the field of education, to judge from the speeches we have heard so far.</p>

<p>I now want to give attention to some of the specific matters which were raised. I shall first discuss educational matters, and then matters which were raised under the &#x201C;Cultural Affairs&#x201D; Vote. I have already said that since 1967 we have had a new dispensation in education, since the passing of the Act of that year. I do not want to go into the implications of that legislation now. But perhaps it would be a good thing if I gave a survey of what has happened in this time. I want to do so because there was a good deal of uninformed criticism on the part of the Opposition, and also because such a survey could perhaps be relevant to the teaching profession. My task as new Minister of National Education is to give effect to the legislation of the period 1967 to 1969. I want to say that I do not accept my task in the sense that I feel I am a reformer and that I must break down what existed and rebuild from scratch; I realize that I cannot draw a pencil line through history and simply begin making history anew. When I come across a quotation such as this one from the article written to <i>The Argus</i> by the hon. member for Wynberg, in which she spoke of &#x201C;wide powers of indoctrination given to the Minister under the Act and the four Administrators waiting to take their orders on the sideline&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from><span class="col_5081-5082" refersTo="page_1098"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is now saying that it is quite correct. I want to ask her quite honestly whether she is not ashamed to write an article like that and to confirm such an allegation in this House. The hon. member had a good deal of criticism to level at the slow progress we are making. Let me inform the hon. member that we are dealing here with the reconstruction of existing systems and organizations, and that one cannot simply carry on without taking into account what was done in the past and what achievements were accomplished by these people in the past, of which they are justifiably proud. The hon. member said that the Committee of Educational Heads, according to their report, had apparently accomplished nothing. She barely referred to the Education Council, although this is one of the most important bodies in this new set-up. I really hoped that one of the hon. Opposition speakers would have something to say about this matter, but they did not even do so.</p>

<p>For that reason I want to say here to-day that I have the greatest appreciation for the work which has been done in this short space of one year by the new Education Council under the chairmanship of Prof. H. B. Thom. In doing so I do not in any way detract from the work which was done by the former National Advisory Education Council, under the chairmanship of Prof. Rautenbach. Together this work forms a sound basis on which we can build with confidence. In the report of the Education Council what has already been done and what still has to be done is clearly set out. I want to inform hon. members that our first task in this reconstruction was to restore human relationships. As a result of the struggle in the past relationships among people who ought to have co-operated with one another had been marred. The same applied to bodies which ought to have co-operated with one another. I want to say here to-day, at the beginning of my accession to office, that at the moment I have the closest personal and official contact not only with all our Administrators, but also with all our educational heads in the country. I may also say that I have already attended meetings of the Committee of Educational Heads and the Education Council, and that I know precisely what is going on at their meetings. The Education Council is doing work which one cannot make a great to-do about. Many of the matters raised in this House in other debates were of little value for the future of our people, but they were given big headlines in all the newspapers. I want to inform the hon. members that these bodies, namely the Education Council, the Committee of Educational Heads and all the various Departments, are doing work which is of a permanent nature, for which I will be eternally grateful to them. In respect of the teachers I also want to say, and we must make no mistake about this, that education has not become easier; it is becoming more difficult each day.</p>

<p>Well, of course.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is why it would be more fitting if the hon. member who is now saying &#x201C;of course&#x201D; adopted a more positive standpoint in the debate to see whether we cannot do anything to alleviate the burden of those people. I just want to say that the Educational Council has already formulated policy provisions which have been promulgated as the policy of the Government in respect of the medium of instruction. I do not want to elaborate on this. They have announced a policy in respect of compulsory schooling, in respect of free education, and in respect of the co-ordination of curricula. What did the uninformed criticism of the hon. member for Wynberg consist of, however. She hauled out the history syllabus of the Cape secondary schools and persuaded a poor newspaperman, who was of course even more uninformed than she, to make a copy of it and to publish it. She then said that this syllabus reminded her of a comic strip. If the hon. member denies this, I shall show her the clipping. She said the history syllabus of the Cape Department of Education was a comic strip. I shall now inform hon. members how that syllabus came into being. The Committee of Educational Heads coordinates the syllabi. Secondary schools syllabi are departmentally co-ordinated. Serving on this committee are teachers, active members of the teaching profession in all provinces. If the hon. member were now to ask me on whose opinion I placed the most reliance, i.e. that of practising teachers and a responsible committee, such as the Committee of Educational Heads, or her opinion, then she must not take it amiss of me when I say that I think nothing whatsoever of her opinion.</p>

<p>I want to go further and say that the Education Council has made a good deal of progress with the formulation of the Christian character of education and also with its national character. It would interest the hon. member to know that the Education Council agreed unanimously, both Afrikaans-and English-speaking members in that council, on this formulation. However, these matters take time to finalize because so many bodies have to be consulted. In terms of law I am obliged to consult the Education Council, as well as the Administrators, the Committee of Educational Heads, and I must also&#x2014;and this is not stated in the Act and to my regret I subsequently discovered this&#x2014;the law advisors. I want to reiterate that we have already made a good deal of progress, in this respect.</p>

<p>I come now to a matter which was raised by various hon. members, i.e. differentiation and guidance. I want to say, and I know that my predecessor said the same thing, that we have progressed to such an extent with the formation of policy in regard to differentiation that we will in the very near future announce the details in this regard. I believe that when this happens we will have clarity on many of the matters which were raised here. There were <span class="col_5083-5084" refersTo="page_1099"/>hon. members here who discussed differentiation and guidance, as well as differentiated university admission. In the restricted time we have available for this debate, I want to summarize these matters and say that not only has good progress been made with all these matters, but also very encouraging progress. We have made such progress that I am tempted to say more than I may say. I hope, however, that during the next session we will be able to discuss the content of these matters. As far as university admission is concerned&#x2014; an extremely important matter, because this is the point where one find the connection between the school and the university&#x2014;I want to inform hon. members that the progress made is already such that the Matriculation Board will probably be able to take its final decision in this regard at the beginning of next year. If the decision turns out as the recommendations so far have indicated and have been accepted by all the other committees, I think it will satisfy all the hon. members who discussed this matter, without specifically mentioning any names now. The matter of guidance is of course very closely interwoven with this; it is related to this and will also receive attention along with it.</p>

<p>The psychological services to which the hon. member for Hercules referred, are an extremely important aspect. Of course psychological services are being applied at all schools. But if we will at this stage be able to provide so many psychologists that each school will be able to have one, is of course something which we will have to leave to the future.</p>

<p>I should also like to say that the Education Council plans to devote to education in the very near future an important year&#x2014;let us call it an &#x201C;educational year&#x201D;&#x2014;and that as highlight of that educational year we will be able to hold a truly national, and perhaps even an international educational congress, here in South Africa. This also requires prolonged and thorough preparation and I do not want to elaborate any further on that matter now.</p>

<p>It seems to me I must, in pursuance of the course taken by the debate up to now, say something further about the shortage of teachers. I want to state categorically here, as the hon. member for Koedoespoort has already done, that a definite shortage of teachers is now becoming discernible. I am not mentioning any figures here. I tried to furnish hon. members with figures, but the figures differ from one day to the next and that is why it is virtually an impossible task to give truly final figures. In particular a shortage of secondary school teachers is being experienced, and more specifically in the so-called &#x201C;scarce&#x201D; subjects. The &#x201C;scarce&#x201D; subjects are in particular the two national languages, Afrikaans and English, mathematics, physics and chemistry, general science, domestic science, commercial subjects and music. In addition we are experiencing a shortage of male teachers in the primary schools. Then, too, there is a shortage of women teachers for infant schools and pre-primary education, and in the grade classes. I want to say with the greatest emphasis however that our problem is the same as is being experienced in most Western countries. Our problem is not a problem as a result of the policy of this or that government. As far as I am concerned, it is not a problem as a result of the policy of the National Party. This shortage which we are experiencing is closely related to the manpower position in our country, as well as to a series of other factors which I shall go into later on. I heard one hon. member saying that I am looking for an excuse. I am not looking for an excuse for anything. I have mentioned a fact here and I am prepared to face up to that fact. I am going to discuss it with hon. members. I want to say that if the shortage of teachers will make our general public, our parents, aware of the importance of education, then it may even be possible that the shortage of teachers will have a positive effect on our people. But unfortunately I find that too many parents are only concerned about the shortage of teachers if some of their children are sitting in a class for which there is no teacher. The moment that immediate problem has passed, they forget it. In the second place I want to say that this has also been my experience with the hon. Opposition. We have from the Opposition side, in all the years I know about, really had no positive contribution in regard to this matter. Let us now mention an example. My colleagues from Germiston and Koedoespoort, I think, also referred to this. We are faced here with a shortage of teachers. Sir, do you know what the English-language teachers and English-language parents are doing&#x003F; For example, they established on the Witwatersrand an organization which they called PACE (Parents&#x2019; Action Committee on Education). The lady chairman is a certain Mrs. Jammy, who was a candidate for the election of the Witwatersrand School Board. I take it that this explains quite a good deal of her interest at this moment. Do hon. members know what that organization is doing&#x003F; They are sending letters to all schools, including Afrikaans-medium schools, with an already formulated petition attached. The schools, including the Afrikaans-medium schools, must merely sign that petition to say that they associate themselves with that organization. Let me say at once that I associate myself with many of the matters mentioned in the petition. I have no intention of obscuring the facts in this connection, but if this Mrs. Jammy, with her Parents&#x2019; Action Committee on Education, her like-minded associates, would rather make an honestly-intended attempt among her own people, the English-speaking people of this country, to furnish me with suggestions in regard to what we can do to recruit more English-speaking persons into the teaching profession, instead of merely eliciting grievances from teachers, we would solve our problem immediately. The hon. members for Koedoespoort and Germiston <span class="col_5085-5086" refersTo="page_1100"/>did in fact point this out. I may say that this problem even exists in Afrikaans-medium schools, where we cannot always find properly qualified teachers to teach English. I maintain that we have in the past received little assistance from the Opposition in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni, to whom I shall return subsequently in regard to his remarks on the War Graves Council, said in regard to education that teachers to-day are not as well qualified as they were in 1948. With that he meant of course that there were more teachers who were not suitably qualified in regard to certain subjects which they were teaching. The hon. member for Durban (Central) who knows more about this matter, explained the matter. What are we doing now in regard to this entire matter&#x003F; I want to mention two aspects in this connection. The Opposition implied that the problem had arisen only as a result of salaries and conditions of service. The hon. member for Berea stated, in a very courteous manner, that we should compete with trade and industry. In the first instance I want to say that, as regards steps to meet the needs of teachers, I believe that the Biblical truth still applies, i.e. that the labourer is worthy of his hire. In addition I believe that whatever is spent on education, it will never be enough. I think that those who are members of the teaching profession, particularly the good teachers, will never earn enough. I want to emphasize this and I want to state categorically that the teachers of South Africa can accept that they will have in me a champion for all reasonable demands and requests which may be put forward. I may say that this will not only be the case because I happen to be the Minister.</p>

<p>We must act in a sober and realistic manner in regard to these matters. I know that the teachers, in a questionnaire to the Education Council, stated salaries to be only the third most important point on their list of grievances. I appreciate that. It is true that attention should be given to their salaries. If demands are put forward which cannot be met at this moment, then they cannot be met and then we must also display the discernment to accept it in this way. Let us glance for a moment at the question of salaries for teachers. I am not saying this to exonerate this Government, but I am saying this to prove this Government&#x2019;s interest and care for the teachers of South Africa. On 1st October, 1958, improved salary scales for teachers were applied. On 1st April, 1953, further salary improvements were applied, which amounted to an average percentage improvement for men of 18.6 per cent and for women of 27.7 per cent.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I beg your pardon &#x2026; the first adjustment was on 1st October, 1958. The next was on 1st April, 1963 &#x2026; not 1953. The next was on 1st January, 1966, with an average percentage improvement for men of 17.7 per cent and for women of 15.15 per cent. On 1st April, 1969, another adjustment was made. In reply to what the hon. member for Germiston asked, I want to say that this adjustment was based on the recommendations which were submitted to me in regard to the question of salary structures. This was an adjustment which amounted in the first place to an increase for every teacher of at least 10 per cent, but in addition one of the most important concessions, for which teachers have been agitating for years, i.e. that there should be a notch per year adjustment, was granted. The hon. member for Durban (Central) will know what this means. He knows what appreciation there is among the teachers for that major concession.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the latest announcement of the Minister of Finance and of the Minister of the Interior, because some of the hon. members addressed specific inquiries in this regard. I want to state with the greatest emphasis that there is another small increase coming for the teachers, over and above these increases which I have just mentioned. In passing I did not even refer to the accellerated consolidation, because that was really related to the last salary increase. I have said that there was another small increase, because newspapers have aroused expectations among the teachers that, as one newspaper put it, there are &#x201C;fat cheques&#x201D; on the way for the teaching profession. This is misleading the teachers. I do not want to mislead these people. I have in my possession a lengthy and thoroughly motivated memorandum from the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, in which there is a thorough elucidation of the problems and the deficiencies which still exist in regard to teachers&#x2019; salaries and in regard to certain conditions of service. I have already replied to them that that memorandum is being considered, but it is a memorandum which consists of quite a number of folio pages, all of which envisage drastic amendments. That is why I hope that the House and my teacher friends outside will understand that it will not be possible to remedy all these matters overnight. But I have already said that I am a champion of the interests of the teacher, because I have the interests of the teacher at heart. I want to give them the assurance that as far as I am concerned. I shall attempt, as far as it is within the overall framework&#x2014;because I have also learned that if you are in the Cabinet, you cannot dish everything out to Peter and leave only a crumb for Paul&#x2014;in order to look after their interests. The teaching profession can be certain that they have in the National Party Government a government which takes into account the importance of their profession and which will do its best to take care of them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston asked: Why not equal salaries for equal qualifications&#x003F; This is a very important point, the more so because for years we did not have it <span class="col_5087-5088" refersTo="page_1101"/>in the Public Service, but that the Public Service has now recognized it. I want to say here to-day, without being able to compromise the Government, that I have always regarded it as my ideal that we should also try to establish this criterion for our married women and our unmarried women teachers. When I say that this must remain an ideal, then I am saying this because the facts of the situation have proved to me that we cannot effect it at the moment. But I am prepared to say that since the State is the employer of teachers, nurses, people in the Defence Force and people in the Public Service, the teaching profession can at least compete on an equal footing for the favours of those 40,000 or more matriculants who leave our schools annually. If the teaching profession cannot do this, then it cannot expect to draw people to the profession who do not have an interest in education. Sir, I do not believe a good teacher can be bought or should be bought. I believe that a good teacher, as far as it is in our ability to do so, should be remunerated according to merits, but I do not believe in buying someone simply in order to have that someone in front of a class.</p>

<p>Having said this, I think that I have elaborated considerably on the salary position. I think there is still one point which caused teachers concern, and that is that everyone did not benefit, as they said, from the accelerated consolidation. With that they mean that they did not at present, with this acceleration, also get something extra or are going to get something extra. Sir, the reason for that is that they have in the process of adjustment on the notch per year increase already received what they are entitled to receive, and for that reason are not receiving anything extra, but I hope that with this increase which is in the offing, there will in fact be a further encouragement for our teachers.</p>

<p>Sir, I also want to reply to this question which was put to me: What are we going to do to deal with the situation&#x003F; This is a very important matter. I first want to inform you of what we are already doing. As far as conditions of service are concerned, to which the hon. member referred, we have arranged matters so that new teachers begin their service on 1st January, and not on the date on which they actually begin with their classes. This is a minor improvement, but it does mean something as far as pension benefits and salaries are concerned. There are more posts for advancement. Some hon. members said that there were too many opportunities for advancement in education. This is a matter which is continually receiving attention. I am convinced that in due course there will be more posts for advancement in education. A new grading of schools was established which creates possibilities for the teaching profession. Sir, it is now possible for a teacher to pay off his study debts through service. Housing loans have been introduced for the teaching profession, obviously subject to the availability of money by the building societies.</p>

<p>Mention was also made of teachers&#x2019; pensions. This is of course a matter which depends on the civilian pensions of everyone in this country and it is really a matter which falls under my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Pensions, but I want to say that the Education Department have introduced more favourable pension contributions from the teacher&#x2019;s point of view; in other words, the teachers are paying less in contributions to the pension fund than they had to pay in order to maintain the fund.</p>

<p>Then there are lesser benefits. There is, for example, a disruption allowance in regard to posting which, as can be understood, is always an unpopular measure. There are better leave conditions. There are increased vacation savings bonuses and travelling and accommodation allowances and there is also an allowance to bring down high rates of interest on housing loans. I think that if we take all this into account, and if we want to be honest and view the matter objectively, we must concede that this Government need not feel ashamed at what it is doing for its teachers. With that I am not saying that we are finished now and that nothing further need be done. I repeat that the needs of the teacher are continually receiving attention and it is not necessary, as the United Party propaganda is now stating with a view to the provincial election, to appoint an ombudsman committee to keep a watchful eye on the conditions of service and the salaries of teachers. The National Party itself is maintaining that surveillance and the Minister responsible, with his statutory bodies, is the person who should maintain surveillance. The Teachers&#x2019; Associations have the right of access to the Administrator in the case of the provinces, and through the Federal Council, to me. I want to give the assurance once again that those representations which have been made, are not merely being put away in a drawer. They are receiving attention, and we will do what we can.</p>

<p>Hon. members have asked what the Government is doing to deal with the situation, and I want to raise a few points here and I want to let that suffice and first give hon. members another chance to speak. I want to emphasize in the first place that the teaching profession is one of the few professions in the country where it is possible for a young woman or a young man to receive training free of charge even to degree level This a tremendous concession and a privilege which is being presented to prospective teachers. In addition I want to say that the study leave benefits of teachers are among the most favourable in the world and I am not exaggerating now, because I do not come from America. I want to mention to you that the Transvaal, for example, makes available no less than 1,000 bursaries of R300 each for acting teachers, and in addition to that three correspondence courses for teachers who want to improve <span class="col_5089-5090" refersTo="page_1102"/>their qualifications or who want to concentrate on subject training. This is also the reply to the hon, member for Benoni, who complained that teachers with insufficient training had to cope with certain subjects. We are doing what we can to enable the teacher to attain a higher level of training. The Transvaal Education Department has R1,000 bursaries for Honours students to enable them to obtain the Master&#x2019;s Degree. In addition they have five R2,000 bursaries for their senior teaching staff to equip them for general educational leadership. In addition there are part-time post-graduate courses. There is also early employment of part-time post-graduate students as well as of full-time students in emergency cases, by allowing them to complete their courses on a part-time basis. I know that there is criticism in this regard. There are people who are saying that we are living off our capital, but the fact of the matter is that this is an interim measure to deal with the situation.</p>

<p>Then here is a system where acting teachers fill certain vacancies in a part-time capacity for additional remuneration. A mathematics teacher at one school, for example, also teaches mathematics at another school and obtains additional remuneration for that. One finds a system where a teacher who has long leave, helps out in an emergency, if he is a specialist in his subject, at other schools who do not have a teacher for the class, and receives an additional salary for doing so. We have just commenced with a system in terms of which married women teachers can be employed permanently for periods of five years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Then it is not permanent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is for five years, and then for another five years. One must take a calculated risk with a woman whom you appoint permanently. In the beginning of 1969 only 60 per cent of the teaching staff in the Transvaal was permanently appointed. As against that the percentage at the beginning of 1970 was 76.5 per cent. I think this is attributable to a very large extent to the appointment of married women on a semi-permanent basis. All these measures I have mentioned are measures which still do not solve the problem for us. In my opinion the solution to this problem lies therein that plans must be made to try to reconcile supply and demand. The hon. member for Hercules also referred to that.</p>

<p>How can this be done&#x003F; We are now going so far as to try to bring training facilities, particularly for English-speaking persons, closer to them. They will then have no excuse for not entering the teaching profession. We have transferred educational training of secondary teachers to the universities. The scheme is not operational yet since a considerable amount of preparatory work is required. Teacher training will also take place at universities. Now it is the case that certain English-language universities here in our country have never before, for reasons of their own, given teacher training. I do not want to elaborate on those reasons of theirs now, nor am I finding fault with them. That is their business. These English-language universities will also, in the very near future, begin to train teachers. I trust that the reaction of the English-speaking people in our country will be such, now that they can obtain degree training for their teaching profession, that they will feel drawn to those educational institutions.</p>

<p>Then there are additional scientific methods of recruitment. There are many matriculants who have certain ideas on what they want to do and subsequently find that they made a wrong choice. There are also those who because of their achievements could not obtain admission to some faculty or other. Attempts are now being made by means of scientific methods to try to attract these students to teacher training. I think that when certain of these temporary measures, which are semi-permanent, together with the future measures of which I gave the House a glimpse, are in full operation, we will be able to solve the problem.</p>

<p>There is one other very important aspect which I still want to emphasize. This is the status and prestige of the teacher. The hon. member for Durban (Central) also referred to this. This matter of a professional council for teachers is a very important matter. But it is a matter which one cannot tackle haphazardly. It is true that the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations even went so far as to draw up a Bill. But, drawing up a Bill is one thing, and subjecting it to the test of experts in all the various branches of the Government adminisration is another. I regard this matter of a professional or registration council of teachers as an extremely important matter. That is why, when I accepted my office as Minister. I gave instructions to the effect that the National teachers&#x2019; Council should devote serious attention to it. After the hon. member for Durban (Central) asked me the question, I asked the Education Council what progress had been made in regard to this matter. The reply is lying on my desk here. It is stated therein that it is an extremely thorny and difficult matter, with which a great deal of progress has been made, and in regard to which they hope to be able to submit a recommendation to me early next year. I think this ought to satisfy the teaching profession, as well as the hon. member, that that matter has not been shelved, and that it is in fact an important one.</p>

<p>There are other matters in this regard that I want to emphasize. I want to say that in South Africa far too much undermining of the authority of the teacher is prevalent. When I say this, I do not want to single anyone out. I am not reproaching anybody; I am not reproaching the Opposition; I am not reproaching the governing party, but it is and remains a fact, that there are too many people in South Africa who are undermining the authority of <span class="col_5091-5092" refersTo="page_1103"/>the teacher. From time to time we see petty things in our newspapers, so petty that someone who is not attentive to these matters may not even take it seriously. For example, a newspaper writes about a school principal who stipulated that the girls in his school, for reasons of his own, were not allowed to wear jewellery. Then one finds parents who kick up a great fuss about things like this, who run to the Press or who run to the Police because a teacher punished the child. What I want to say now is the other extreme of this matter. I grew up in a house where the teacher was always right. The result of this was that I never had the courage, no matter how mischievous and naughty I may have been, to go to my father and tell him that certain things had happened to me at school, because I was afraid that my father would give me a hiding because of it. This is perhaps exaggerated, and subsequently I discovered that there is another method. I take it my father followed that method, i.e. he went to the principal and discussed these matters with him. The most important aspect is, however, that he did not take my side against the teacher. Let us now examine our own conscience and let all the parents, who may hear something of what is said here to-day, examine their own conscience and let them ask themselves whether they are not guilty of undermining the authority of the teacher in this way. This point is one of the most important factors which contribute to the frustration of the teacher. I want to let what I have said so far suffice for the present, and I shall subsequently reply to other points raised by individual members and also in regard to cultural affairs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as the Minister&#x2019;s reply to me is concerned, he devoted quite a large part of his reply to some newspaper articles of mine which appeared in <i>The Argus</i> some months ago. Quite frankly I did not base my speech on those articles to-day in the very slightest degree. I think he must have written his speech in anticipation of what I was going to say. The hon. the Minister then went on to talk about the number of pupils who are in Std. 6 and in Std. 8 which has increased considerably, since 1948. He mentioned this as if this he was refuting any arguments I had used about how long children stay in school to-day. This is not an argument that carries any weight at all. The population generally has increased <i>pro rata</i> so that you would expect the number of pupils in Std. 6 and Std. 8 also to increase <i>pro rata.</i> Then the hon. the Minister went on to say that there was compulsory schooling for everybody up to the age of 16 years and that this was a very good thing. We entirely agree with him, and then the hon. Minister said that I have a great deal to learn. I have no doubt that he is correct, but in one respect, I want to tell him that he has a certain amount to learn as well. I served on the local school board in Cape Town for 13 years, partly as a nominated member and later as a elected member. One of the sub-committees on which I sat for years and years was what is called the Exemptions Committee.</p>

<p>The Exemptions Committee considered all cases of parents who wanted their children to leave school before the statutory age of 16. We had a file for each one and without exception the reason why they wanted their children to leave school, and we considered hundreds of them during my period at office, was because the parents simply could not afford to keep them in school. They did not have the funds for uniforms and for their upkeep and all the rest of it.</p>

<p>When you consider with what lack of success we have been pleading for years for a system of family allowances or some form of assistance for these students to stay at school so that they will not be prematurely thrust into the labour market, I think the hon. the Minister's suggestion that his predecessor&#x2019;s attitude was correct in this regard, is not correct at all. Our pleas have always fallen on deaf ears. No attempt has been made to subsidize people in this position.</p>

<p>I want to remind the hon. the Minister of something very interesting in this regard. When we discussed the National Study Loans and Bursary Bill in this House in 1964, I made a plea to the then Deputy Minister of Education, who now happens to be the present Minister of Labour, and I begged him to extend the scope of that Bill to children in Std. 8 to enable them to go up to Matriculation under the bursary system. Shall I tell the hon. the Minister what his predecessor&#x2019;s reply was&#x003F; I want to quote from Hansard, Vol. 12, Col. 8665 of 19th June, 1964. The then Deputy Minister of Education said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have a great deal of sympathy for the plea of the hon. member for Wynberg that this concession should also be given to those who are not matriculated, but unfortunately, that is a matter which does not fall within the framework of this Bill. The time may come, after the Act has been in operation for a year or so, when the grants will be such that one may then be able to consider enlarging the scope of the measure in this way. I hope that when that time arrives the hon. member will plead her case with the same zeal as that in which she has pleaded her case here to-day.</block>

<p>In other words, he found it a perfectly logical case to plead for more assistance to children from Std. 8 to matriculation, precisely as we have done in this debate and in countless others. The hon. Minister then went on and said that there was nothing positive in my speech at all to-day and that as far as he was concerned, all I did was to be destructive. I asked Hansard to let me have my notes back so that I could have the second half of my speech here with me which the hon. the Minister heard perfectly clearly and <span class="col_5093-5094" refersTo="page_1104"/>which is headed: &#x201C;What we would have done in the Government&#x2019;s place&#x201D; and where I stated for the record that this is what we would have done. The hon. the Minister knows perfectly well that I used every single word of my notes.</p>

<p>The hon. member for False Bay was a colleague of mine in the Provincial Council. He accused us of making politics over educational issues. May I say that until the hon. member for False Bay spoke in this debate there was no single hint of a political discussion of any kind under this Vote. The hon. member for False Bay dealt with the question of parental choice and said how we had overemphasized this point and made it a political issue. He produced a completely false equation here and suggested that parental choice is of necessity in conflict with good educational principles. That was his point. What I want to know is what makes the hon. member think that any parent gives precedence when he is considering the schooling of his child, to anything except the educational benefit which he is going to get from it&#x003F; If he does not make that his main choice, he is being very stupid. I want to tell the hon. member exactly where we stand and to answer all his questions here this afternoon. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than that. As far as the United Party is concerned, we are in favour of the minimum of State interference in these matters. Let us get this quite clear. Parental choice is of primary importance to us, but I repeat that it will be for the parents to choose whatever language medium they like and to change that language medium in midstream if they wish to do so.</p>

<p>It has always been our policy. It is our hope that&#x2014;and I use the word &#x201C;hope&#x201D; advisedly&#x2014;that the majority of parents will choose mother-tongue instruction as the medium certainly up to their end of their children&#x2019;s primary school education and that if they choose otherwise it is entirely up to them. But no action would ever be taken by us to prevent it where parents of either language group in any community specifically desire a single Afrikaans-medium or English-medium school. If they want it, they shall have it. That has been set out in our policy for years and years. Hon. members should know that.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. member&#x003F; Does the hon. member share the view of the hon. member for Salt River in the provincial council that the existing single medium schools should be converted into parallel medium schools&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I will make my own speeches, if hon. members do not mind. I am setting out quite clearly in this House our policy here and now for the provincial council elections. The hon. member for Salt River in the provincial council was talking about certain schools in this area which have been English-medium schools since the cows came home. He was talking about specific schools and not about the matter as a question of principle. We take the view that society must decide these matters for itself. That is correct.</p>

<p>What we do consider to be a wise and a workable ideal, is to create a climate of opinion amongst South African parents in which increasing numbers of both language groups will become anxious to establish and to maintain parallel medium schools. That simply means one thing. Wherever possible and where the local community has no objections, we shall establish parallel medium schools, for the obvious reason that they guarantee two very important matters, namely mother-tongue instruction for both groups, which is important, and the chance of getting to know and becoming familiar with each other&#x2019;s languages and to form corporate loyalties and feelings of pride on behalf of their schools. Now it is our view and our hope that loyalties built up on this basis in the schools amongst our young people, with respect for and continuous usage of each other&#x2019;s languages, will help to lay even firmer foundations of partnership and loyalty on a national basis. Is there anything basically wrong with that&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is not my intention to follow the hon. member for Wynberg to any great extent, but I should like to ask her whether she, the United Party and the policymakers on that side have never taken cognisance of that very well-known premise in education, namely that one proceeds from the known to the unknown&#x003F; This also holds good in respect of the language medium. I also want to tell the hon. member that she should not believe that parallel medium schools will be the solution to bilingualism. It is simply unacceptable. <span class="col_5095-5096" refersTo="page_1105"/>I want to continue by making, in all modesty, the observation that I believe that next time when these Votes come up for discussion again, we should deal with them separately. This morning the hon. Opposition evaded the issue and appeared to be the greatest culture lovers we have ever come across. They never got down to discussing education, until we forced them to do so. No, Sir, one actually started to gain the impression that the hon. Opposition was going to face this election without dragging education into it as well. Actually this is merely the lull before the storm. The hon. member knows this. She is one of the first who will go from platform to platform in order to disparage the present system of education. This is true.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) has only been here for a short while. He suggested here that the hon. member for Springs should really not have talked along those lines, as it would oblige him to come closer to talking politics. These evasions are of no avail. Sir, once this House has been prorogued, education will be propagated, and also disparaged, from platform to platform. I think it is necessary for us to consider the policy of that party for a while. The hon. the Minister has already mentioned the quotation taken from <i>Volkshandel.</i> The hon. policymakers opposite deemed it fit to say: &#x201C;We are not going to commit plagiarism. We apologize now.&#x201D; Let us take cognisance of an atrocious piece of mutilated language with which the United Party started the exposition of its education policy. Literally and verbally translated they state in the Afrikaans version of this booklet of theirs, under that quotation: &#x201C;Ons is verskuldig aan <i>Volkshandel</i> vir hierdie verklaring.&#x201D; This is not Afrikaans, and these are the people who pretend to be so concerned with equal treatment being accorded to both languages. I want to make more references to this booklet of the United Party. After all, it is their booklet. There is no doubt about that. I shall show them the colour of this booklet. Here it is. It is theirs.</p>

<p>No, hon. members should not waste my time. In this booklet the United Party starts by saying: &#x201C;Education is specially important in South Africa because our children must maintain their position on the continent of Africa in the future.&#x201D; I agree. The second sentence reads as follows: &#x201C;Education is specially important in South Africa because under the National Party racial division begins in the schools.&#x201D; What do we have here&#x003F; Hon. members must take cognisance of the fact that we shall take advantage of that statement. We are going to exploit that statement. They go on to refer to &#x201C;education free of political bias&#x201D;. The hon. member for Durban (Central) is still very young and does not know about these matters, but I want to put this question to those hon. members who are old enough: Whose actions made it necessary for us during the war years to establish in Pietermaritzburg the Voortrekker Ho&#x00EB;rskool, since justice was not being done to the Afrikaans child in Natal&#x003F; Who was in power at that time&#x003F; It was not the National Party. The United Party has put its foot into the trap, and I believe that we should lay this at the door of their policymakers. In reading this kind of language, and everything that is said in this booklet, one sees two figures before one. They are the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Hillbrow. They are the policymakers. This is their kind of language and their kind of ideas.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come to another point. Quite a number of reasons were advanced for there being so few teachers. There were frequent references to those subjects in respect of which there is a particular shortage of teachers. It is commonplace to hear that those subjects are the two official languages, mathematics and science subjects. Mr. Chairman, I believe it is high time for us to stop saying where the fault lies or merely to say that shortages do exist in these respects. Should we not perhaps come a little closer to the classroom and then try to find the reason for these shortages&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to start with the two languages. We have heard enough examples in this House to-day as to why this is the case especially in respect of English. It is because the English-speaking person fail to offer his services to this profession. I just want to point out briefly to hon. members what Dr. McMagh, an English-speaking educationist, wrote in this regard in <i>New</i> Nation<i>.</i> She puts this question: Where are all the people with degrees in English&#x003F; Then, in reply to that question, she writes that they have simply never existed. Then she asks whether they will ever exist. This person is by no means an obscure personality, and this is the question she asks. Recently I also read something that had been written by a certain Mr. Brigish. He is one of the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s candidates for the provincial election. He calculated that there was a shortage of 20,000 English-speaking teachers. This is the position. Unfortunately I cannot elaborate on this at the moment, since I still want to deal with Afrikaans as well.</p>

<p>Language instruction at school is one of the most difficult subjects. Nothing will induce me to abandon this point of view, since English and Afrikaans are taken by every child at every school&#x2014;I am referring to the high school in particular. The same does not apply to the other subjects. For instance, part of the class may take science and mathematics, whereas the others may take other subjects. <span class="col_5097-5098" refersTo="page_1106"/>In other words, the language teacher has a full class every period. The nature of the work, seen in the light of correction work, etc., is such that a language teacher is continually engaged in hard work, from January to December. In view of the fact that he is a language teacher, he is also expected to be a bearer of culture in his environment. He is given more and more work until that little flame eventually burns itself out. This is being noted by young people at universities and others; it is something which puts them off.

<p>I should just like to tell the hon. member for Durban (Central) that when he spoke a moment ago, he quarrelled with the wrong person altogether when he referred to the hon. member for Springs as having said that in a discussion on teachers and the teaching profession, the principles involved were not only materialism, but also idealism. That is what the hon. member for Springs said. Sir, I notice that the hon. member for Benoni is on the point of leaving the Chamber. I should like to speak to him, too, if he does not mind. The hon. member for Durban (Central) should actually have quarrelled with the hon. member for Benoni. As we all know, the hon. member for Durban (Central) was a teacher until shortly before he was elected. The hon. member for Benoni said that the qualifications of our teachers at present were not nearly as good as were those of teachers, male and female, in 1948. In other words, the hon. member for Durban (Central) was horribly insulted in this House to-day by the hon. member for Benoni [Interjections.] The hon. member for Benoni said that the hon. member for Durban (Central) did not have good qualifications at all. Mr. Chairman, I used to be a teacher, too. and was trained more or less at the same time when the hon. member for Durban (Cntral) received his training, and the hon. member for Benoni said here to-day that the younger generation of teachers did not receive good training at all. I want to tell the hon. member for Benoni that he did not only insult the hon. member for Durban (Central), but also all the younger teachers trained since 1948: that is more or less a whole generation. I can take him to schools and show him what the academic qualifications of all these teachers are. For a number of years I myself taught at the university, where my lectures were attended by many education students, and I can assure you, Sir. that the standard and content of the lectures is. I can almost say, raised every year. I want to say more about the hon. member for Benoni and the hon. member for Durban (Central). The hon. member for Benoni did not only insult the hon. member for Durban (Central), but as regards <span class="col_5099-5100" refersTo="page_1107"/>the War Graves Board, he adopted an attitude to-day which is directly in conflict with the attitude which the hon. member for Durban (Central) adopted earlier in this session. Sir, listen to all the things which the hon. member for Benoni said about this Board to-day; in view of the fact that it is the policy of this Board to centralize the widely scattered graves of soldiers killed in action, he said <i>inter alia</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is how our heroes are being honoured by the South African War Graves Board.</block>

<p>He referred to this board with contempt. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They should leave the graves in peace even if they want to erect mausoleums and monuments at central places. Numerous complaints about this are being received from all over the country.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Messrs. Marais and Jacobs, the owners of the land on which the Paardeberg battlefield is situated, also quite rightly refused to allow the graves of the Boer dead to be removed to Magersfontein. The reason is that to us the activities of the South African War Graves Board seem to us to be more like the violation than the maintenance of graves.</block>

No, I am afraid that in this respect the hon. member for Benoni went too far to-day. But I want to contrast the two with each other. He concluded his speech by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to ask the hon the Minister to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate these irregularities.</block>

<p>But let us deal now with the hon. member for Durban (Central). When he spoke here earlier this year, on 29th July, on the War Graves Bill, he said the following, hardly a month ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This board has become the conscience of the nation to a certain extent.</block>

<p>This shows how strongly that hon. member felt about if, but to-day the hon. member for Benoni says that they are violators of graves. That hon. member went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think the amendments which are being made remind us once again of the fact that the board is performing a task on our behalf.</block>

<p>And then he goes on to plead for these graves, which are scattered all over the country, to be centralized, and a moment ago I quoted to you, Sir, the passage where the hon. member for Benoni pleaded with might and main that we should not centralize these graves, which are so widely scattered all over our fatherland, in order that proper care might be taken of them. Listen to what the hon. member for Durban (Central) had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Here I am thinking in particular of the tremendous task which awaits the board, one in which they are engaged, i.e., the consolidation of the Magersfontein graves. Here one finds spread over an area of approximately 2,000 miles&#x2014;that is the distance from one grave to the other, from Warrenton in the north to Douglas in the south &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; graves which the board is at present consolidating into garden of remembrance at Magersfontein.</block>

<p>But listen to what the hon. member for Durban (Central) said here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think it will be a pity if people are unreasonable and refuse permission for the exhumation and reinterment of the mortal remains &#x2026;</block>

<p>But to-day the hon. member for Benoni comes along and cries to high heaven because this is in fact being done by the board. Sir, with the United Party it is a case of &#x201C;as the old cock crows, so crows the young&#x201D;. [Interjections.] Basically, in principle, they are divided between liberalism and conservatism. No sooner have those two young hon. members been elected to this House, and they are only sitting four seats apart from each other, than they are already differing with each other. [Interjections.] I want to continue by saying that over the past 22 years we have had proof of stable growth in every facet of the pattern of life of the South African community, and the universities are proof to that effect. Go back to the University of Pretoria. I think the hon. member for Durban (Central) also knows what it looks like there. Consider the conditions that prevailed in 1948 as regards students and administrative and technical staff, buildings, faculties, etc., and go there now, in the year 1970. and see what is happening there at the moment.</p>

I want to take this opportunity to say that from 1948 to 1970 the University of Pretoria had one principal in the person of Prof. C. H. Rautenbach, who retired recently. Having been a student, also a student leader and later on a lecturer while he was the principal of the university, I feel that if there is one person who has really carved his name boldly in the history of the universities of our country, that person is Prof. Rautenbach. He was a very capable university graduate, an excellent administrator, a leader in his field, a good patriot and a friend and a father to his students. On this occasion I want to thank him for what he did over the years when he was principal. I also want to express the hope that for a very long time to come we shall be able to avail ourselves of his services in our society. At the same time I want to convey my best wishes to the new principal, Prof. Hamman, and express the hope that he will hold that office for as long a period and render services which are as good.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter to which I want to come back briefly. In Newsletter No. 15 of the Human Sciences Research Council it has been announced that genealogical research will now be done.

<block name="quote">In the light of these facts, and on account of representations, the board has decided to carry on the significant genealogical labours which, up to the present, have mainly been the result of autodidactic zeal.

<p>If ever I was pleased about a member entering any debate, it was about the hon. member for Rissik entering this debate. He furnished us with proof of the dilemma in which the National Party finds, itself. The moment hon. members opposite find that something is wrong in South Africa, they take it amiss of us if we discuss it; then they want us to neglect our duty by keeping quiet. Let me illustrate this with what was said in regard to war graves. When I made my maiden speech a few months ago, I discussed the principle of this matter. And I am still saying to-day that the War Graves Board should act as the conscience of our nation. But what am I to do now if it has been brought to light by another hon. member that in the performance of their activities, activities which I commended and will always commend, they indulged in malpractices&#x003F;</p>

<p>I must accept it. What am I to do now&#x003F; Should I do what hon. members opposite are doing and tell the hon. member for Benoni to keep quiet&#x003F; If I do that, I shall be neglecting my duty. In actual fact, I am pleased that the hon. member for Benoni presented this side of the matter, and I am sure he has proof for saying what he did.</p>

<p>Let us transpose this phenomenon to education. I think the entry of the hon. the Minister into this debate resulted in something positive. We found that we struggled in this debate to find a common basis for a dialogue, for one cannot conduct a dialogue without a common basis. Up to time when the Minister entered into this debate, it was difficult for us to find such a common basis. I found that hon. members opposite were not prepared to accept that something was in fact wrong with education in South Africa; they were not prepared to accept that there was a shortage of teachers. For that reason I appreciate the admission made by the hon. the Minister, i.e. that such a shortage does exist.</p>

<p>I think that it is now possible for us to proceed and to deal positively with the matter. We must analyse the matter. I should like to do this now, and I say that to certain extent this has a bearing on the salaries paid to teachers. I see a similarity between the salary and the status of the teacher. Furthermore, reasons are being sought for the fact that people from certain homes or people with a certain background do not want to enter into the teaching profession. To my mind the cause is a very obvious one, namely that to a certain extent certain people have the idea that the moment teachers have qualified, they are doing work without the restrictions of professional standards and codes. It is for this reason that one finds that there are certain people who are not prepared to enter into this profession. <span class="col_5103-5104" refersTo="page_1109"/>I believe that we can remedy the matter through the introduction of professional status for teachers.</p>

<p>I want to come back to this question which, to my mind, is a cardinal one, namely that the moment we grant professional status to teachers, we should prevent them from ever becoming personally involved in campaigns for higher salaries. I hope the hon. the Minister will give me a reply in regard to this question, i.e. that separation between education and the Public Service Commission is in actual fact a condition for the establishment of any professional council for the teacher. I think that basically this is the reason why the hon. the Minister referred here to-day to a small increase for teachers. The reason why he had to phrase it that way, is that the salary structure and the posts structure for teachers have to be adjusted in accordance with the restrictions imposed by the Public Service Commission. I accept that this is his problem. I believe that this is one of our priorities, and this is a positive suggestion which is being made to the hon. the Minister from this side of the House.</p>

<p>The second positive suggestion which I want to make and which, to my mind, has a great deal to do with the matter of the status of the teacher and the image the public has of him, is to grant more recognition to the teachers&#x2019; associations. This can be done by way of negotiations. The hon. the Minister mentioned here something which is of great importance. He said that next year the National Education Council would inform us about the status and what the position was in regard to the establishment of a registration board. Prior to this report being submitted to us as members of Parliament, I believe that it should not only be forwarded to the Federal Council for Teachers, but also to each of the nine teachers&#x2019; associations in South Africa. The same applies to differentiated education in South Africa. There is a certain fear amongst teachers that they will have to give effect to a plan which will merely be presented to them. I accept the fact that on the various councils, i.e. on the National Education Council and on the departmental committees, there are people who work out these matters and who are conversant with the teaching profession. However, there is a feeling amongst practising teachers that they are not going to be consulted sufficiently in regard to these matters, and that they are going to be presented with an accomplished fact once these plans have eventually been drawn up. For that reason there is a great deal which we can do within our present limited framework.</p>

<p>For instance, if one reads the report of the Statutory Committee of Educational Heads, one finds that there is a certain sub-committee. One finds this in the Erasmus Report of 1968 concerning the representation of teachers on educational committees and bodies. The position is that certain recommendations were made, and that it was conceded that teachers&#x2019; associations could in fact nominate members for appointments. But in order that the travelling and subsistence allowances may be paid for, the final appointment has to be made by the Education Department or by the hon. the Minister. To a certain extent this system actually amounts to being a motion of no confidence in teachers. Normally they are asked not to nominate one person only, but to send in a list containing the names of three or four persons. Then it is left to the education council and other education departments to select one of those persons. I think this is a major disappointment to teachers. I can speak from personal experience. When we fight for the principle of the matter of gaining representation, it is announced that it is possible for teachers to have representation. The next moment we are told, &#x201C;Give us three or four names.&#x201D; Teachers must be trusted, and it must be accepted that they, and particularly their associations, are a responsible group of people. Allow them to select a person whom they think is capable of doing the work.</p>

<p>Now I want to come back to the question of the qualifications of teachers, in regard to which it would appear to me as though hon. members opposite are trying to distort the facts a little. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban (Central) will pardon me if I do not adopt a tone similar to his in this debate. I want to raise a matter that is of great importance to us all, particularly to English-speaking people in South Africa. It deals with the official translation of our National Anthem. I want to say that I have corresponded with many universities about this matter. It is a fact that the English-speaking person in South Africa cannot sing our official translation of the National Anthem with the same spirit and the same passion as the Langenhoven original. For the purposes of my argument I just want to read the first verse of the official translation of the National Anthem. I then want to base the various points I make on it. It reads as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>Ringing out from our blue heavens,</li>

<li>From our deep seas breaking round;</li>

<li>Our everlasing mountains, where the echoing crags resound;</li>

<li>From our plains where creaking wagons Cut their trails into the earth&#x2014;</li>

<li>Calls the spirit of our country,</li>

<li>Of the land that gave us birth.</li>

<li>At thy call we shall not falter.</li>

<li>Firm and steadfast we shall stand,</li>

<li>At thy will to live or perish,</li>

<li>Oh, South Africa dear land.</li>

</ul>

<p>It is interesting that the Langenhoven original makes no mention at all of &#x201C;seas breaking round&#x201D;. The second point is that in the original there is not a single word written about &#x201C;wagons cutting trails into the earth&#x201D;. This translation in no way accords with the original. <span class="col_5105-5106" refersTo="page_1110"/>What is more, neither does Langenhoven make any mention of &#x201C;the land that gave us birth&#x201D;. To-day in this country, for example, we have many British immigrants. When they sing the first verse of our National Anthem, this line must, of necessity, put them in mind of their country of birth, Britain. It must remind the German, who is a prospective immigrant, of Germany, which is his country of birth, and not of South Africa. It is also very interesting to note that the lovely words that we have in the Afrikaans text, i.e. &#x201C;Ons sal offer wat jy vra&#x201D;, which are, in my opinion, key words in our National Anthem, are not translated at all in the official English translation.</p>

<p>I have here a translation that I should like to quote. It was drawn up by a Mr. Stuart Barter, an inhabitant of Otjiwarongo. He has written several volumes of poetry and displays great talent. He made a translation which he handed to me. I submitted it to virtually all the Departments of English at our universities in South Africa. One and all preferred Mr. Barter&#x2019;s translation to the official one. There are various reasons for this. Here, for example, is a letter&#x2014;I just want to read one&#x2014; from Mr. A. Lennox-Short, head of the Department of English at the University of Cape Town. He praises Mr. Barter&#x2019;s translation. Then he says the following in respect of the official translation:</p>

<block name="quote">I would like to see the official translation reconsidered&#x2014;it is, for instance, rather dated in expression, especially in the use of <i>thine</i> and <i>thy.</i></block>

<p>He thinks that in the modern idiom they ought not really to be there. But then he goes even further and states why he prefers Mr. Barter&#x2019;s translation.</p>

<p>In the few minutes at my disposal I should like to read the first verse of Mr. Barter&#x2019;s translation. Then hon. members will agree with me that he has actually given a better interpretation of Langenhoven&#x2019;s feeling when he wrote &#x201C;Die Stem&#x201D; than the existing official translation does. Instead of &#x201C;The Call of South Africa&#x201D;, he calls it &#x201C;The Voice of South Africa&#x201D;. The first verse reads as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>From the azure of our heavens,</li>

<li>From the deepest ocean spring;</li>

<li>From eternal mountain ranges,</li>

<li>Where the crags with echoes ring;</li>

<li>Through our vast and lonely prairies,</li>

<li>Where the sturdy wagons groan,</li>

<li>Comes the murmur of our true-love:</li>

<li>Of South Africa, our own.</li>

<li>We shall rally to your calling,</li>

<li>Give our all to serve your need;</li>

<li>Bravely stand or proudly falling;</li>

<li>We are yours, South Africa!</li>

</ul>

<p>That is the opinion, not of myself, but of people who know the English language. As I have said, I submitted this translation to the various Departments of English at our universities, and they agree that it is a better translation. But I think that Mr. Barter&#x2019;s translation of the second verse, in particular, is something distinctive. I think I must read it just to get it on record. He also published it in the S.A. Banking magazine. This is one of the verses of his translation that made a particular impression on me. I am now going to quote it:</p>

<ul>

<li>In our inward strength and power,</li>

<li>In our spirit, heart and soul;</li>

<li>In the fame that bred a nation,</li>

<li>And our hope as years unroll;</li>

<li>In our will and work and leisure,</li>

<li>For as long as we may live;</li>

<li>Other land we shall not cherish&#x2014;</li>

<li>All our love to you we&#x2019;ll give.</li>

<li>Fatherland, your noble standard</li>

<li>We with honour shall uphold.</li>

<li>As South Africans, that fire,</li>

<li>In our hearts shall not grow cold.</li>

</ul>

<p>I think that this is a very excellent translation. I feel that this translation has a greater effect on one when one reads it or sings it. While we in South Africa, on both sides of the House, are working towards national unity, I think that our official translation of the South African National Anthem should also be such that it moves the English-speaking persons. Everyone who has made South Africa his fatherland, regardless of whether he landed here with Jan van Riebeeck, or whatever the year of his arrival was, even if it was only this year, and regardless of whether he was born in another country, must sing the National Anthem in such a way that he regards this as his only fatherland. As I have indicated, with the official translation he cannot rightfully and with pride sing the South African National Anthem if it refers to his country of birth. That is why I should like to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to give attention to this matter. I do not know what will eventually be the best translation. I do not think that any hon. member in this House is able to say that this or that translation will be the best. But I think there are sufficient English-speaking people in South Africa who can put their heads together to translate this National Anthem of South Africa in such a way that it can move everyone and can be sung by everyone with the same enthusiasm and dedication as the Afrikaans-speaking persons can sing Langenhoven&#x2019;s &#x201C;Stem&#x201D; to-day.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Middelland has dealt with a delicate matter as far as the national anthem and its translation are concerned. I think it is an accepted fact that most South Africans like to regard the national anthem in the Afrikaans language, in its existing form, as our national anthem. Expressing my own personal views, I believe that it should remain as it is. It should be sung by both the English-and Afrikaans-speaking peoples in the language in which it <span class="col_5107-5108" refersTo="page_1111"/>was originally composed. I feel that it is up to the English-speaking people, who do not know the national anthem in Afrikaans, to make it their business to learn the anthem as soon as possible. Furthermore, the new South African citizens should make it a point to learn the anthem and to realize what it means and the spirit in which the anthem is sung.</p>

<p>However, I wish to deal with another matter that falls under the Minister of Education. Although it is included now as an item in the Vote of the Department of Higher Education, it is in fact not higher education at all. I refer to the question of the re-education of those persons who are accommodated at, or in many instances committed to, schools of industries and the reform schools in South Africa. This is not only a matter of rehabilitation, but also a matter of re-education. I think it is fitting that this sphere of work should fall under the Minister of Education, because obviously, in efforts to rehabilitate these people, the emphasis is on re-education rather than on punitive measures. It is, however, interesting to review the position from time to time as far as the industrial schools and reform schools are concerned. We know that there are approximately 2,000 white children committed to various childrens&#x2019; homes each year in South Africa. We know that many of them particularly the elder ones, are committed to an industrial school in the first instance. I believe that, at present, there are about 18 industrial schools in South Africa. I think it a pity that there is not a greater degree of grading of these schools. We find in a number of instances that children&#x2019;s homes, if they find that a girl or a boy is becoming difficult, apply for a transfer for this child to an industrial school. We know, too, that there are also children, under the age of 18, who are committed by the Children&#x2019;s Court or by a juvenile court to a school of industry. It seems a pity that there is not a school of industries which can provide for and differentiate between those young persons who have been committed on the grounds of uncontrollability or the development of certain deviate behaviour problems and those who have shown no such behaviour problems. This I mention with regard to the grading of such schools. The youngsters who are committed on the basis of neglect or ill-treatment by their parents are also sent to an industrial school. I believe it is important that, in order that a stigma is not attached to some of these young people who are attending industrial schools, these schools should be graded. This would bring about a better co-ordination of the services that these schools are performing. I do not wish to criticize the services of these schools. I believe that they are doing excellent work and it is certainly a most important field of operation that they have with regard to our young people. It does, however, appear that the industrial schools face a problem of abscondment. I would like to briefly refer to a case which occurred earlier this year of a boy of 15 years of age, who was shot dead by Police on the Witwatersrand. He had stolen a car. This I believe is a case which illustrates the difficulty involved as far as absconders from the schools of industry are concerned. This particular boy had absconded from the school on, I think, seven occasions before he was eventually committed to a reform school. Then again he absconded from the reformatory and ultimately met his end unfortunately when he was shot dead by the Police. The difficulty that arises is that when an abscondment occurs, the disciplinary action is that that boy or girl must be returned to the institution from which he or she has absconded. However, it does make rehabilitation exceedingly difficult if the pupil himself continually absconds. I believe the hon. the Minister should have an inquiry into this whole question of the number of absconders from the industrial schools particularly as one realizes that the reform schools are dealing with a much more difficult type of person. Indeed, most of the persons accommodated in a reform school have committed criminal offences. If one looks at the question of absconders, one sees that approximately 500 persons abscond from these schools per year. It would appear that, taken over the last three years, an average of about 350 per year are returned to the school. Another 50 are transferred to other institutions. In many cases, such as the case of the 15 year old boy I have referred to, persons are transferred to a reform school. Approximately 100 are not traced or they had extreme difficulty in tracing them, and over a period of time they are often discharged from the committal order. I believe that in the grading of these industrial schools, there should be set aside at least one school which has tighter security in regard to the absconders so as to discourage abscondence of this nature. I know that psychologists and so forth agree that it is perhaps not in the interest of the pupils to have a tighter degree of security. However, where we have a situation where a boy continually absconds, I think it is a pity that greater measures are not taken to prevent him from absconding from the industrial school in the first place. Otherwise, if he has a record of continual abscondment, he is eventually transferred to a reform school. Of course, at the reform school he is then associating with a large number of young persons who have committed offences and who are in fact criminal offenders. There again the position of abscondment arises. However, I believe that the grading of these industrial schools is an important factor. I also believe that the Department should endeavour to establish an industrial school in the province of Natal for boys. There is already a school for girls at Utrecht. But as far as the boys are concerned there is no school in Natal. It is looked upon as one of the means of assisting in the rehabilitation of some of these people to not entirely lose contact with their own homes and with their own parents. It does make it exceedingly difficult for parents in Natal who have sons or daughters who are committed to industrial <span class="col_5109-5110" refersTo="page_1112"/>schools which are often a thousand miles away from their home. It makes it almost impossible for them to maintain any physical contact with the child and to visit that child and to continually show an interest. I believe that the hon. the Minister should endeavour to have an investigation into the success or otherwise of the present system of the school of industries. Some years ago I had an opportunity of studying a report by Dr. J. M. Lötter, a report that was subsequently published in other periodicals. This document, &#x201C;Die Rehabilitasie van Blanke Jeugoortreders&#x201D;, was produced under the National Bureau for Educational and Social Research. This was a study of former pupils of the school at Constantia. Although these boys are perhaps in a slightly different category to the general trend of the type of person accommodated at schools of industries, it does show rather alarming figures in that the follow-up of past pupils of this Constantia school showed that only 26.3 per cent could be consider as having been successfully rehabilitated at that reform school. This means that the success is based on the fact that they were not convicted of any offence within five years after their discharge or release on licence from the reformatory. Then, Sir, another 10.1 per cent could be classified as partial failures because they were convicted of one or two offences of a less serious nature during that same period of five years after their discharge; 16.1 per cent could be considered as failures because they were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment within five years after their discharge; 3.5 per cent were unclassified because they could not be traced. This means that in spite of the whole programme of re-educating these persons at reform schools, in spite of schooling, the commercial training, the trade instruction and the psychological treatment provided at the reform school, there was only a very small percentage of successes.

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to take this opportunity at the beginning of my speech to thank the hon. the Minister briefly for the very clear and positive guidance which he gave us in this House to-day and which he will also give in the future. I know that I am speaking on behalf of all of us on this side of the House in saying that we have full confidence in the hon. the Minister, and that we have full confidence in those councils which assist him, such as the Education Council, the Committee for Educational Heads and the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, all of which will, in conjunction with him, in the light of the admirable disposition which he displayed here to-day and the proof which he furnished to this effect, afford us the opportunity to eliminate in the near future the bottlenecks which may and do exist in education. Sir, the National Party, this side of the House, has always been the greatest friend of education in South Africa. Furthermore, the National Party has always had the greatest appreciation for the teacher in the Republic of South Africa. The teacher is still in very high repute with the National Party, and this is not the case because it wants to make some political capital out of teachers. The National Party has always stood by the teaching profession and the teacher. Accordingly the National Party is appreciative of the services which teachers have rendered to the country, and it has respect for the grand task performed by them and the sacrifices they are making.</p>

<p>Sir, in the course of my speech I want to touch upon, in the few minutes which I have at my disposal, a few matters which I should very much like to put to the hon. the Minister. The first matter which I want to mention, is the promotion system. It is a well-known fact that if one is a member of the teaching profession, one will try to gain promotion to the post of vice-principal and eventually to that of a principal. If it is true that the best teachers are those persons who are promoted to the posts of vice-principals and principals &#x2014;and everybody will probably agree with me that this is in fact the case&#x2014;then it has this effect, i.e. that the &#x201C;scarce&#x201D; subjects, about which we heard there to-day, are actually being used as promotion subjects in many respects. This is what I mean by saying this: When a post is advertized and a specific person has the qualifications which are required in that school, his chances of promotion are good as a result of his having those qualifications; and what effect does this have on the teaching profession&#x003F; If such a person is promoted to the post of a principal or even to that of a vice-principal, he is placed in a position where he has to devote a great deal of his time, attention, capabilities and experience to administrative work; therefore, he is taken out of the classroom. What my argument amounts to briefly, is that I want to ask that the educational authorities should devise plans for a system to be designed whereby it will be possible for us to promote the teacher in the classroom itself. By that I mean that we should keep him in the classroom, where we need him and where he is of great value to the pupils. We know from experience that a great deal of a school principal&#x2019;s time is merely being devoted to administrative work, which can perhaps be done just as effectively by other people. But if we could have a system whereby that teacher could, in this way, gain promotion and a higher salary and still remain in the classroom, I think that we would already have wiped out to a large extent this shortage of teachers, especially in the scarce subjects. I know that I am touching upon a very difficult matter, but I believe that if we tackle this problem seriously, we are in fact going to devise a plan whereby these problems will be surmounted.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to plead another cause. This relates more particularly to the area from which I come, i.e. the Witwatersrand. The position there is that there are only a few schools which have hostels. I feel that if we <span class="col_5111-5112" refersTo="page_1113"/>can design a system whereby schools in densely populated urban areas can be granted more hostels, it would also, to a certain extent, solve one of the problems with which teachers are struggling a great deal at present, namely housing. I know that where I come from, many teachers apply for posts in the rural areas, not because they really want to go to the rural areas&#x2014;I have no objection to their going there&#x2014;but many of them go to the rural areas merely because they can be admitted to hostels, where they then find it easy to obtain accommodation which they would not otherwise have had. But this would also have another advantage, namely that, especially in the poorer parts, those pupils who have to do without parental supervision for a major part of the day, would then be concentrated in hostels, where they would be under the supervision of the teachers. This would be of more value to them than to be aimlessly running around in the streets. But, in the third place, it would also afford thousands of working mothers peace of mind to know that their children are being cared for properly. I know that these two matters will require a great deal of deliberation, but I know that they contain the germs of a partial solution to many of our present problems.</p>

<p>In the short while which I still have at my disposal, I want to say a few more words about the status of teachers. A great deal has already been said about this matter, and I am particularly grateful for the fact that the hon. the Minister has already referred to it and that he adopted a very sound attitude. However, I want to endorse what was said and what was done to-day in regard to the increase in the salaries of teachers. I definitely want to support the case that was made out for it, and I believe that the salaries should be adjusted in such a manner that they will attract the right persons to the teaching profession, and that they will also keep in the teaching profession the right persons who are serving in it at present. Those salaries should be adjusted in such a manner that it will be an attractive proposition to men to enter into this profession, as has already been said today. If we are in earnest about the teaching profession, I want to make this appeal, not only to this House, but also to the public outside, i.e. that in future we shall have to pay more in order to obtain the services of the right teachers in sufficient numbers. But over and above the salaries there is another very important aspect, namely the conditions of service, which were also discussed to-day and on which I do not wish to elaborate again. I just want to say that fringe benefits are also of great importance to the teachers to-day, for merely earning a bigger salary means that one has to hand over a greater part of it by way of income tax, and consequently an even better pension scheme and an even better medical scheme and even better housing loans and even better study bursaries and territorial allowances are things which will, so I believe, contribute a great deal towards making the teaching profession even more important and acceptable to our people. In conclusion, therefore, I want to associate myself with what has already been said in regard to the status of the teacher. I want us to come down to earth and not to be floating up in the clouds. Status is very closely bound up with what one earns in one&#x2019;s profession. It definitely has a great deal to do with one&#x2019;s income. However, status is also determined according to the way in which the teacher and his profession are accepted in public and in private life. What is the attitude adopted by many of our parents in this regard&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg says that we are trying to revive and rehash old suspicions. Let us deal with that straightaway. The Leader of the United Party in the Provincial Council started off an election campaign in Port Elizabeth on the 19th September this year. There he made a most <span class="col_5113-5114" refersTo="page_1114"/>deplorable statement. He said: &#x201C;United Party slates white apartheid in education&#x201D;. Now, what is the basis of that statement&#x003F; He goes on and says that the basis of this statement is the policy to establish single medium schools in this province. When the Minister of National Education declared his policy as to the medium of instruction in schools, this declaration of policy had to be implemented by an ordinance in the Provincial Councils of our country. To this ordinance which had to implement this policy there was an objection in principle by the United Party. And what was the basis of the objection to the ordinance&#x003F; In the first place the United Party said that they believed in mother tongue education, but that the deciding factor must be parental choice. It is a fact that in the ordinances of 1911, 1918 and 1925 there was no parental choice. It was obligatory that the child should be educated in its mother tongue. The United Party accused us of white apartheid because we established single medium schools. Now I put the question to the hon. member for Salt River in the Provincial Council and I quote from the debates of the Provincial Council, column 258. In reply to the accusation that we preach national unity but are not practising it in the schools I said&#x2014;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the short time at my disposal for replying to the second half of this debate, is not sufficient to enable me to reply to all the questions. I know that I still owe replies to the hon. member for Wynberg, the hon. member for Durban (Central), the hon. member for Hercules, and a few other hon. members, but I am afraid that I shall not be able to come to them, nor shall I have time to make the statements which my colleagues the hon. the Minister of Defence and the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions said I would probably make on my Vote. I am afraid the time will be too limited for that. I shall therefore confine myself to the few matters which I shall be able to dispose of in the remaining time.</p>

<p>I should like to start with the hon. member for Benoni. I do not want to repeat the shocking remarks he made in this House, but I want to say to him that he should go home and read what he said, and that he should be ashamed of what he said here. The hon. member made an unjustified and, in my opinion, a shameless attack on the integrity of the South African War Graves Board. I want to say to hon. members that this is a very honourable body and that it performs very difficult work in delicate circumstances. I concede that there can be difference of opinion on whether or not one should centralize the graves of those killed in action; in fact, we have seen that he and the hon. member for Durban (Central) hold different views. However, there is nothing wrong with that. There are probably persons on this side of the House who also differ with one another on this matter. I dealt with it at length when the War Graves Amendment Bill was considered here. Therefore I want to say that if Mr. Marais or Mr. Jacobs or whoever has a different opinion in regard to that, they are entitled to have their own opinions on the matter. However, I want to come back to the hon. member for Benoni, who stood up here as a backbencher and made such allegations and still had the audacity to request that a judicial commission of inquiry be appointed to investigate this matter. What are the facts&#x003F; The South African War Graves Board consists of two committees, namely the British Forces Committee and the Burgher Graves Committee. They are divided equally, and I want to tell the hon. member who the persons are who serve on that board as members of the British Forces Committee. They are the following&#x2014;</p>

<ul>

<li><span class="col_5115-5116" refersTo="page_1115"/>Captain Smedley Williams.</li>

<li>Lt.-Col. Kenyon.</li>

<li>Mr. G. A. Chadwick.</li>

<li>Brig. Kriegler.</li>

<li>Mr. A. C. Long.</li>

<li>Commandant G. R. Duxbury.</li>

</ul>

<p>They are all men who are in the closest contact with the ex-servicemen&#x2019;s organizations and regimental organizations. They are persons who do this work out of piety, and I deplore it most strongly that the hon. member went so far as to raise in this House the work which has been done in regard to the reinterment of the Black Watch. I can say to hon. members that this work was done by the British Forces Committee according to their lights at the time about what action should be taken in such cases. They did this <i>bona fide</i> to the best of their capabilities. I think it is really excessive of this hon. member to come forward subsequently and to make such a scandalous allegation. I want to make an appeal to the hon. member for Green Point, who I know has very close contact with the organizations of ex-servicemen, to apologize on behalf of the hon. member for Benoni to the gentlemen whose names I have mentioned here, for his having tried to throw suspicion on their work in this way. I am sure that if the hon. member had merely taken the trouble to discuss the matter with the hon. member for Green Point, the hon. member for Green Point would have cleared up that whole matter for him. I have said that this is a delicate matter. I have said that reinterment and centralization are necessary in certain circumstances and I do not want to elaborate further on this matter now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni also referred to buttons, medals and coins which are allegedly available in bars everywhere and which come from the graves of soldiers who are reinterred. I have received the assurance from the Ware Graves Board that the closest supervision is exercized in the case of exhumations and reinterments. The hon. member is shaking his head to and fro. I want to say to him that he should lodge a complaint with the War Graves Board and substantiate it; I cannot now discuss specific cases which are past, such as that of the Black Watch. If the hon. member had had any positive criticism to offer, I would have listened to it gladly, but the way in which he handled this matter does not become him and I am very sorry that he has cast these aspersions on the good work of these people. The hon. member also mentioned crosses which had been removed from graves of soldiers and which one finds in the shops of scrap metal dealers in Natal. He referred to crosses lying around everywhere.</p>

<p>Yes, that is correct I now want to read a letter to the hon. member. I have here a copy of a letter with the letter head of the Provincial Building Service Department, Bramhill Building, Pietermaritzburg. This letter is dated 7th August, 1970. I can furnish the hon. member with the reference number as well if he questions this letter. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir,</block>

<block name="quote">Ware Graves Crosses.</block>

<block name="quote">As explained telephonically, the sale of metal war grave crosses at our storage yard in Pietermaritzburg on 25th June, 1970, was entirely the fault of the Provincial Building Services. The Press unfortunately soon learned of this. However, I made it quite clear to them that the crosses were sold in error and steps were being taken to repossess them. This has been done.</block>

<p>I hope that the few remarks I have made will bring the hon. member for Benoni to the realization that although you sit in the back benches, you still have a great responsibility, especially if in this House you want to drag through the mud the name and the honour of such an honourable organization as the War Graves Board. The point which the hon. member for Durban (Central) made here to the effect that one wanted to draw attention to a wrong state of affairs, cannot be applicable here. The way in which the hon. member did so, is not at all above suspicion.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I think we should proceed in lighter vein. As the Minister under whose jurisdiction the South African Merchant Navy Academy Gen. Botha falls, I put it to the Cabinet that the Academy at Granger Bay would be the starting point of the January Cape to Rio yacht race, that several similar oversea institutions have entered and that our own Acadamy&#x2019;s ketch, the Howard-Davis, would be a worthy carrier of the South African flag across the ocean. The Cabinet accordingly resolved that it would financially make it possible for the Council of the Academy, if it decided to enter for the race. This resolution was passed on the 11th September and it now affords me great pleasure to announce that the South African Merchant Navy Academy will enter the Howard-Davis for the race, and, what is more, that it will be commanded by Captain-Superintendent Nankin and manned by a crew of predominantly Botha Old Boys. I need hardly emphasize that all steps necessary to safeguard the safety of the vessel and the crew will be taken, that both the vessel and crew will be appropriately insured and that a Lloyd&#x2019;s certificate of seaworthiness will be obtained. I am convinced that I speak for all hon. members when I wish Captain Nankin and his crew success with their preparations, as well as fair winds and a pleasant voyage.</p>

<p>I should furthermore like to reply to those who raised certain matters <span class="col_5117-5118" refersTo="page_1116"/>on the Cultural Affairs Vote. I shall start with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He referred to the Africa Institute. I shall speak rather briefly about that, and I hope he will not take it amiss of me. I just want to say to him that the increase of R29,000 on the Estimates is due to the creation of two professional posts, increased rent and, improved salaries, which normally applied. In regard to the appointments of Prof. Weiss and Dr. Van Wyk, these were of course done by the Board of Control, and my Department has no control over that. Therefore I cannot accept responsibility for it. The services provided by the Africa Institute, i.e. their information and publications, are made available to all race groups who want to make use of them. In regard to membership of the institute, the general accepted policy of the Government in regard to membership of scientific societies applies.</p>

<p>The societies co-operate voluntarily and also make free use of the information. There is no question of compulsion.</p>

<p>In regard to the purchase of musical instruments for schools. I just want to say that this is a matter which does not fall under my Department. It is actually the concern of the provincial administrations. I know, however, that there are certain provincial education departments that are doing something in this regard. My Department is concerned with adult education.</p>

<p>In regard to donations of works of art to public institutions, I may say that such donations are free of tax at the moment. The hon. member actually proposed something else. That aspect can be considered later. The decision, of course, rests with my colleague the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>In regard to the integration of immigrants, I just want to say that the selection of students for courses and camps, educational journeys, etc., are initiated by the regional offices of the Department of Cultural Affairs, in consultation with school principals and voluntary organizations, both Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking, which organize such undertakings. If one were to judge by the reaction of the parents and the children, the success which has been achieved is very encouraging. We are operating on a sound and fruitful basis in this regard. About 40 of these projects take place annually and they are attended by several thousand pupils.</p>

<p>The hon. member further inquired about the bursaries in librarianship for students from African states. These are bursaries which are made available to the University of South Africa by the South African Library Society. I do not know to whom they have awarded or award them. Therefore I cannot reply to that point. It is actually a matter which is dealt with by the University of South Africa.</p>

<p>In regard to cultural treaties&#x2014;both the hon. member for Springs and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout pleaded for the expansion of cultural contact with foreign countries&#x2014;I just want to say that in principle we are completely in agreement with that. It is hoped that the vacancy in Belgium will soon be filled. The problem has been to find someone who speaks French, but we hope to be able to fill the post before long. I may point out that we have considerable cultural contact with foreign countries apart from cultural treaties. In fact, there is a system of bursaries apart from these treaties, although no formal agreement exists in that regard. Therefore, although we are progressing along this road, it remains a matter of &#x201C;make haste slowly&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs also discussed the encouragement of good books. In this connection I may just say that the selection of Afrikaans books is done by the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns and of English books by the South African English Academy. The hon. member remarked quite rightly that the amount made available for this purpose is not a large one. Seeing that the matter concerned here is a very important one, we will have to try to obtain more in future. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked why we restrict ourselves to writers in South Africa. Well, this is in order to encourage writers in South Africa. There are no ulterior motives.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs also drew attention to the dangers inherent in importing too many artists from overseas to participate in our performing arts. We are fully aware of that danger and I can assure him that it is not the intention to take the bread from the mouths of local artists, but to ensure that our own artists make progress and improve their standards. Sometimes it is necessary, especially in the performance of operas, to get artists from overseas, because we do not always have the people in South Africa who are able to do justice to those roles. In any case, we shall guard against the danger which the hon. member thinks he spotted.</p>

<p>Inquiries were also made here in regard to the report of the committee which investigated the distribution of culture. It is hoped that this will be available by the second half of next year.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I have now replied to all the questions in regard to matters on <span class="col_5119-5120" refersTo="page_1117"/>this Vote. Have I perhaps omitted something&#x003F;</p>

<p>I undertake to furnish written replies later to the questions which I could not reply to now due to lack of time. In the time left to me I just want to say that on this occasion we have to take leave of two of our most senior and respected officials&#x2014;the Secretary for Cultural Affairs, Dr. Op&#x2019;t Hof, and the Secretary for Higher Education, Mr. Erasmus.</p>

<p>Dr. Op&#x2019;t Hof is retiring after 44 years in the Public Service. Of those 44 years, he spent 41 years in Cultural Affairs and Education. Hon. members will agree with me that his retirement is a great loss to us. He has come a long way and has achieved a great deal. I trust that he has received other than mere monetary reward for the service which he has rendered.</p>

<p>Mr. Erasmus is retiring after 42 years&#x2019; service in education. Of those 42 years, he spent 24 years in Higher Education.</p>

<p>The careers of these two officials should serve as an example to all officials who are in the Service to-day and also to those who are still to come. I learnt to know Dr. Op&#x2019;t Hof in the most unfavourable circumstances. This was when we were agitating in Johannesburg for the establishment of a commercial school. He was the Secretary for Education at the time. In the meanwhile, I have become Minister of the Department and therefore know him well. One of Dr. Op&#x2019;t Hof&#x2019;s outstanding characteristics has been that he has literally exemplified the term &#x201C;civil servant&#x201D;&#x2014;he has indeed been a civil and courteous servant of the public. Both these officials have been competent, friendly and helpful. Both studied hard in order to equip themselves better for the responsibilities attached to their posts. They entered the Public Service at a time when there were far fewer training facilities than there are to-day. But during their periods of service they equipped themselves further. If there is one man who is concerned about the correct use of language, it is Dr. Op&#x2019;t Hof, and this applies to both English and Afrikaans. As far as this is concerned, he set a fine example to his Department. Mr. Erasmus came the whole way&#x2014;from a teacher in a one-man school, to principal, school inspector, chief inspector, professional advisor, Undersecretary. Deputy Secretary and then Secretary for Education. This is a long career.</p>

<p>Can any of us assess the true value of what these two gentlemen meant to us during their periods of service&#x003F; Who can thank them properly for what they have done for us&#x003F; To a certain extent they have already received recognition for it during their periods of service. Dr. Op&#x2019;t Hof, for example, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Stellenbosch. But there were also other forms of recognition for their ability and courtesy. As far as I am concerned, I am speaking on behalf of all of us when I say to them that we have a high regard for them as persons and great appreciation for their work. On behalf of myself, the Department and the Government, I want to thank them and wish them everything of the best for the future.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, the Department of Higher Education and the Department of Cultural Affairs are again being combined into one Department. The new Department will be under the leadership of Dr. J. T. van Wyk, at present the Director of Education in South-West Africa. I shall say more about his abilities next year. I am convinced that he will be a worthy successor to the two gentlemen who are now leaving the Service. Then I also want to announce that the Deputy post in Higher Education is being filled by Mr. S. C. M. Naud&#x00E9;, the Director of the College for Advanced Technical Education in Johannesburg. I think this is an appointment which will also meet with general approval and I am sure that he will also serve this cause as he has served the Department in the past. Sir, my time has expired.</p>

<p>Sir, in view of the lateness of the hour, the privilege of the half hour in this important Vote will be sought when the debate is resumed, possibly on Monday or on a subsequent date. At this stage I would like merely to put before the Committee certain thoughts in regard to this Department. I refer now particularly to the Department of Planning. But before I go on to that, in view of the fact that the Vote of the Department of Statistics has also been put, I. think that I ought at this stage to say to the hon. the Minister that we hope that he will be able to give the Committee at least some preliminary indication of the results of the recent census. I think that this Committee and the country as a whole are keenly interested to have information on this subject and, if possible, preliminary figures.</p>

<p>Before I go on. Sir. the Department of Planning is now in the hands of a new Secretary, and I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of this side of the House to congratulate him and to wish him well in this new position. We know him well from his functions as chairman of the Committee for the Location of Industry, and we are sure that he will fulfil his task in this new post with distinction.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>As I said a moment ago, I believe that the Department of Planning is possibly one of the most important of all Departments in the present context of the new decade of the seventies. I believe that the time has come for the hon. the Minister to review the functions of this Department and to broaden those functions and the whole vision of the Department of Planning in this country. It has tended in the past, I believe, to concern itself almost exclusively&#x2014;I emphasize &#x201C;almost exclusively&#x201D; because it is not exclusively&#x2014;with the establishment of group areas and border industry areas, two obviously important functions in terms of Government policy. But I believe that a Department of Planning of any State should see its function in a far broader light, and I hope that now that the Department is in the hands of a new Minister and a new Secretary, thought will be given to the question of broadening these functions. Sir, we must not forget that we are living in times of great expansion and of large-scale developments. We are living in a rapidly changing world where this expansion and these developments change rapidly almost from year to year. If we want to keep pace with the developments that are taking place in the rest of the world, and if we want to continue to do big things in South Africa, as I am sure all hon. members on this side do want, then we must be prepared not only to think big but also to plan big. I believe that the function of this Department should be to lay down the broad basis upon which the plans which are to be made for the future, can be properly made. I want to emphasize, Sir, that we must not lose sight of the fact that because of the nature, the scale and the rapidity of the developments that are taking place in all spheres in the modern world, these developments carry inherent dangers if they are not wisely controlled and imaginatively planned. I would like to emphasize these two things&#x2014;wisely controlled and imaginatively planned.</p>

<p>Sir, what should the Department of Planning be doing&#x003F; First of all, before any sort of planning can take place, before any broad plan for the future of South Africa can be drawn up, what is perhaps one of the most fundamental things is a reasonably accurate population projection because without that, plans made for the future will tend to be inaccurate and to go astray even, and I believe that it is in this sphere that the Government has failed in the past. The population projection figures that we have had in the past have been found to be wholly inaccurate, and one of the most glaring examples as the population projection upon which the Tomlinson Commission based its report. Sir, what is the value of broad-base programmes of that sort when the very base of these projects, namely the population projections upon which they are based, are shown to be wholly inaccurate as time goes by&#x003F; I believe that the first task of the Department of Planning should be to establish reasonable population projection figures. Obviously one can never be absolutely accurate with projections of the population but I believe that those that we have had in the past have been so inaccurate that this is something to which the Department of Planning must give its attention as a priority. Having done that much, one is then in a position to know what sort of population has to be catered for in this country; one must then, as the next step, make a close study of the material resources of the country, and from that one is in a position to take the next step, to determine the areas of growth. Sir, I believe that it is things of that kind which the Department of Planning should be doing on a broad base. From that, the ensuing stages should be planned on a regional basis. I believe that regional planning should be left in the hands of the provincial administrations. I believe that it is quite wrong for the Department of Planning to concern itself with that type of planning. But on the other hand I do believe that regional planning &#x2014;and the statistics upon which this regional planning is based should, I believe, be prepared by the Department of Planning&#x2014;has become more and more important and necessary in the light of the growth which is taking place.

<p>I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Musgrave who conveyed his congratulations to the hon. the Minister of Planning and also to the new Secretary. Because of a lack of time we do not want to dwell on this at any length; we just want to wish the hon. the Minister and the Secretary a very profitable period of office. I think that at this stage we can only express the hope that this Department will correctly evaluate the task it must carry out, and determine its policy accordingly. If that is done, and we know precisely what the task of this Department is, then it will develop into one of the most important departments in our entire national economy, as the hon. member for Musgrave also said.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Musgrave expressed certain ideas here about future population surveys. We do not want to contradict the hon. member altogether, but while conceding that it is very important, we must nevertheless also not lose sight of the fact that at present we already know where we have the largest concentration of certain population groups, for example Whites, Bantu, Coloureds or Indians. Those could be good projections, but I do not think for one moment that we should, at this stage, so concern ourselves about that that <span class="col_5123-5124" refersTo="page_1119"/>we spend too much time on it. I agree with the hon. member that this Department must take a look at regional planning, but I do not think I can agree with him completely when he says that this must be left to the provinces. I would rather say that we should have regional planning and that this Department must play the primary role in it, while doing everything in its power to obtain the co-operation of the provinces and local authorities. We hope that this Department will do everything in its power to let balanced growth take place in South Africa. In passing I just want to tell the hon. member for Hillbrow that we must be very careful in talking of our growth rate; that we should not simply say that we must aim at maintaining South Africa&#x2019;s growth rate at 10 per cent, for example, as he put it. Sir, growth is a good thing, but then it must not continue unchecked. I want to conclude by telling the hon. member for Hillbrow that we, as practical people, know that a plant can, for example, grow in such a way as to smother itself; it grows watershoots and eventually there is nothing left of it. We must have growth, but it must be planned and balanced growth; it must be growth at a rate that we can afford and maintain in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, this afternoon I just want to touch upon one small matter here, a matter which has not only been emphasized in recent times and during the recent sitting, but actually over-emphasized. It is this question of the manpower shortage we are allegedly experiencing in South Africa now. No-one on this side of the House wants to belittle that problem in any way, but what we want to do on this side of the House, and what I want to do now, is to emphasize that labour, and the availability of labour, do not constitute the only fact, for example, in the establishment of industries. There are also other factors, such as the availability of capital and of land, the cost of land and the accessibility of water. In this connection I just want to refer to the report we obtained from this important commission of inquiry into water affairs. On page 2 they state clearly that water is not always freely available in our metropolitan areas and that the metropolitan areas are not always situated near large rivers. That is why this water factor is so important. Then there is also still the question of the infrastructure. If we were simply to allow labour alone to determine where we are to establish our industries, we would have this large concentration of industries in our metropolitan areas, resulting in congestion that will make us realize that we must do something in this connection, and we now want to say this, and say it very clearly: This Government believes in the decentralization of industries. That is the statement I am making. I want to state clearly that we believe in decentralization, and if we had the time we would have replied to this in full, but one of the measures we now want to use to implement this process, and which we have already used for this purpose, is Act No. 88 of 1967, the Physical Planning Act, particularly sections 2 and 3. The Prime Minister made it very clear to us how far we have already progressed in this connection. I want to endorse this. From the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech it has become clear to us that there were, in round figures an extra 130,000 Bantu requested for expansion and for the establishment of industries in our metropolitan complexes, and 94,000 were granted. There we kept 35,000 Bantu away from those areas. That is not to be sneezed at. In other words, we are in fact doing a great deal towards decentralization, but we are not doing it at the expense of our industries in South Africa; in other words, we shall not strangle our industries. I have here the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 7th August, in which it is stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is a new breed of consultants advising industry about moves to border areas.</block>

<p>They state that now there is a new group of people acting as consultants to advise our people to leave the metropolitan areas for the border areas. One of those consultants is a Mr. Hurwitz, and what does he say&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Border industry concessions, claims Monty Hurwitz, are not worth twopence. To a firm considering moving to a border area, it is far more important to obtain an assurance from Pretoria that its competitors on the Reef or in other controlled areas will under no circumstances be allowed to employ additional African labour.</block>

<p>That is what this consultant wants. He says: Do not give these people concessions and border industry benefits. Just tell them: We shall ensure that not a single Bantu in your line of business is allowed to offer his labour in the metropolitan areas, and the Government cannot agree with this because we would then be strangling established industries to death.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down told us what the Government believes in. but I would rather hear about what the Government has done. For 22 years we have heard what the Government believes in; I would like to see some material benefit resulting from this belief. But I would like to deal with something entirely different. I would like to bring the Minister back to group area proclamations and reproclamations.</p>

<p>Since 1958. 12 years ago, the Grey Street complex in Durban has had the sword of Damocles hanging over its head. This is 20 years after the Group Areas Act was passed; yet in answer to a question not many weeks ago in this House, the hon. the Minister said to me that it was not possible at this stage to <span class="col_5125-5126" refersTo="page_1120"/>say when a final decision would be reached with regard to the Grey Street complex. I would like to ask the Minister just what is the problem with regard to Grey Street. It is 95 per cent Indian-owned; so there is no problem there. R54 million worth of Indian property is involved as against roughly R3.5 million worth of white property; so there is no problem there either. Every single authority in the area, the Durban City Council, the Chambers of Commerce and every single other authority of any weight, say it should become Indian or stay Indian; so there is no problem there either. In 1963 the then Minister said it would remain Indian and would be developed for Indians. In 1964 the then Secretary for Planning made a similar statement. What has happened since then&#x003F; Twenty years after the Act was passed and 12 years after Grey Street was first looked at, it is still uncertain as to its future. Why the delay&#x003F; Slum conditions are now beginning to come about in the Grey Street area because of the controls imposed through the actions of the Department of Planning and the Department of Community Development. Everybody in authority, as I said, has asked why it should not remain Indian. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister in all fairness to the people concerned&#x2014;and there are many thousands; the whole economy of the Indian community in Natal revolves around the businesses in the Grey Street complex&#x2014;to make a statement in regard to Grey Street. This uncertainty cannot continue. If it does continue, then all the scorn we can heap on the Minister&#x2019;s Department would be richly and fully deserved. Surely 20 years is long enough for the Government to make up its mind about an area which is so important to a large community. If this is the way in which the Government plans, if this is the reaction of the Department of Planning, I wonder about anything that they do in fact plan. Will it take 20 years to put some of their other plans and airy-fairy schemes into operation&#x003F; This is a matter which can no longer brook of any delay. Speculation among the Indian community is rife. They are nervous about their future. Surely we owe at least this to them after 12 years of investigation, to be able to say: This is what we will do with Grey Street. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I would now like to deal with the reproclamation of a particular area. In answer to a question earlier on to-day. The hon. the Minister told me, dealing with the reproclamation of Ladysmith, that one of the people who gave evidence was Mr. Stahlhut on behalf of himself and another white person. I would like to ask the Minister to tell me who this other white person was. Is it possible for him to tell me now&#x003F; I would like to know this, because the Minister in his reply very correctly and carefully gave me the names of the other people who gave evidence for and against reproclamation, but in this one particular instance we are not told the name of this person. He said Mr. Stahlhut gave evidence on behalf of himself, and another white person. I think we are entitled to know who this white person is.</p>

<p>No. There are other matters in regard to Ladysmith which I would like the Minister to clear up for me. In an earlier debate the Minister of Community Development told me that reproclamations had nothing to do with him at all; they were not his province; yet in a reply a couple of weeks earlier during this Session, a reply from the Minister of Planning, he said that the reproclamation took place after a thorough investigation and consultation and consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances and after more than one inspection <i>in loco</i> by the two responsible Ministers. This was the reply of the hon. the Minister of Planning. I would like to ask again, who was the other Minister&#x003F; I put a question this morning to the Minister of Planning and he replied that at Ladysmith the inspections <i>in loco</i> were made by the Ministers, by Dr. De Wet, who was then the Minister of Planning, and Mr. Blaar Coetzee. But Mr. Blaar Coetzee, the Minister of Community Development, says he has nothing to do with reproclamation. I would like the hon. the Minister to explain to me how it is, if he has nothing to do with reproclamations, that he was involved in this inspection <i>in loco</i> in Ladysmith. The Minister also said that the reproclamation only took place after full investigation and I would like to ask him how many members of the Indian community did these two Ministers see when they made the inspection <i>in loco.</i> Because I want to tell the Minister that in this particular instance, at this particular inspection in 1968, they never saw a single member of the Indian community, and yet the Minister says in his reply earlier on, on 21st July, that a full and thorough investigation had been made. How full and thorough could that investigation have been if they did not even see any members of the Indian community, the community affected by the reproclamations&#x003F;</p>

That is why I want to know the name of this mysterious white person who was mentioned in answer to the question this morning when every other name was given, and what people did the Minister see when they visited Ladysmith.

<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for the honour! Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, put certain direct questions to the Minister, and I leave the matter at that. In the few moments at my disposal I should like once more, as in the past, to make a plea for the establishment of a master plan for the greater Western Cape. I believe that the inhabitants of this region have never before been activated for what I want to call a master view of the future, and the handling of concrete problems that the new times bring along with them, as is the case at present. What is the situation here&#x003F; What brought about this attitude to which I am referring&#x003F; There is a history attached to this to some extent. The publication of the Tomlinson Report in the early &#x2019;fifties served at the time as an important incentive for the initiation of new interest in the whole future pattern of the Western Cape. The first result of this new interest at the time was the report known as the Western Cape Research Project, which was undertaken by the staff members, if I remember correctly, of about 12 departments and other fields of study at the University of Stellenbosch, under the leadership of Professor Schumann. Eventually about 25 official studies were completed, and the results were gathered together in 1964 in a single publication under the title <i>Western Cape, a Socio-economic study.</i> It is a neat, basic piece of work about the fundamental circumstances of the future of this particular region.</p>

<p>This was followed by the Report of the N.R.D.C., known as the Haak Report, which embodied further incentives for the creation of a new attitude towards development among the inhabitants of the Western Cape. Since then numerous regional studies have been completed over smaller regional units within the larger framework of the Western Cape. I want to refer to the studies in connection with the Namaqualand vicinity, the central West Coast and the Olifants River area, that were completed under the leadership of Professor Page of the University of Stellenbosch, together with a few students in the Department of Planning. There were other studies about certain parts of the Cape Peninsula. There was also a study about the entire regional set-up in the Southern Cape. Then there was the important Slater Report, which also created great interest at the time.</p>

<p>This basic work did not only stimulate a new attitude towards development among our people in the Western Cape, but after these reports appeared attention was given on the part of the authorities to very important aspects concerning the general growth pattern of the Western Cape. Noteworthy work was done by the authorities. In the little time at my disposal I just want to mention a few without motivating my statements.</p>

<p>Firstly, new and deliberate attention was given to the modern concept of regional planning in general, and to the establishment of regional associations. Secondly, problems involving transport and communications received attention as a result of these reports. New industrial establishment in backward areas within the Western Cape pattern was investigated. Agricultural labour received attention. A Water Plan for the Western Cape, in connection with which the first part of a report was recently presented to the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, received attention. The fishing industry received attention, particularly in respect of the provision of fishing harbour facilities. Early school leavers among the Coloureds received attention. In other words, this work that was done in various fields received attention from the authorities, and we reaped the benefits.</p>

<p>In spite of what I am saying here this afternoon, there is still some concern about the general growth pattern in the Western Cape. I cannot motivate this in detail at present, but in passing I want to mention three aspects that are causing us concern. The first concerns the definite signs of an over-concentration in the Cape Peninsula and environs. About 80 per cent of the total population of the Lesser Boland are at present concentrated in the four magisterial districts of Cape Town, Simonstown, Wynberg and Bellville. In Cape Town there are at present 3,240 persons per square mile. In the Wynberg magisterial district there are 2,080 persons per square mile, in the Bellville area, 1,100 and in Simonstown 320 people per square mile. At the same time the concentration in the rest of the Boland is about 82 persons per square mile. I want to assume that when the new statistics appear we shall probably obtain an even less favourable image in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="col_5129-5130" refersTo="page_1122"/>As far as the background in this connection is concerned, there is one aspect in particular that is creating a great deal of concern within our Western Cape pattern, i.e. the tremendous concentration of our Coloured population the Cape Flats. I do not want to speak about that now, but I am just referring to it in passing. The second great concern, which I also do not want to elaborate on, is the seizure of some of our best agricultural land in our Boland growth pattern. Thirdly there is the suction that Cape Town and its environs are still exercising on the water potential of the Greater Boland. I do not have the time to elaborate on that, but the latest example is the pipeline from the Vo&#x00EB;lvlei neighbourhood, through which about 40 million gallons of water are sucked to Cape Town and its environs daily. However, I do not want to discuss the merits of this case, but I am just mentioning it as a phenomenon.</p>

<p>In short, the entire growth process in the Western Cape is to-day still being initiated by too much of what I want to call cash-economic thinking and too little socio-economic thinking in our planning framework for the future. The total absence of proper advanced planning in this region in the past results in the fact that to-day we have to come along with a very costly process of subsequent planning. I would be able to mention numerous examples of this, but unfortunately I do not have the time.</p>

<p>I briefly want to say that the desirability of rounding off industrial development and residential area development in the Cape Peninsula and environs, and a further shift of all forms of growth to other Western Cape regions, have to-day reached a new urgency in this larger context. The time has now come for all the research work and regional reports to which I have referred, and which have been compiled in recent years, and also the stimulus that developed as a result, to be pooled together, so that we may build up a master view or a master plan for the Western Cape from the present development attitudes in this field. Here we have a reasonably new Department, i.e. the Department of Planning. Here we also have a new young Minister who wants to look ahead. As I have said, a new Secretary has also been appointed to the Department. They all have a great measure of enthusiasm and zeal for the creation of a new future pattern in South Africa, and it is against this background that I want to advocate to the hon. the Minister that we come along with such an overall view of this area.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING AND OF STATISTICS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to express my thanks to hon. members who to-day congratulated me and the new Secretary for Planning on our appointments. I should like to assure them that we appreciate their words of congratulation. To-day, unfortunately, I cannot make mention of the Secretary for Planning who retired at the end of August, because I hope he will be present on Monday and I should prefer to direct a few words to him on that occasion.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to assure hon. members, especially the hon. member for Musgrave, that I appreciate the words of congratulation which they expressed to me and the new Secretary in my Department. At this stage I am not going to reply to the questions put to me, because I think that to save time it will be better if I reply after nearly all the members have spoken, because I believe we are pressed for time if we want to finish next week. In passing, I can just say to the hon. member for Port Natal that I will try to give him the name of the other person whom he has inquired about. I can also say that the matter of the Grey Street complex will receive my very earnest consideration and attention during the recess. I know that the Group Areas Board have completed their investigations. They have also completed their report and their recommendations, and I have personally undertaken to make an inspection <i>in loco</i> during the recess and I hope that the decision will then be made very soon after that. In regard to the other matters raised by the hon. member for Musgrave, these were general matters and I think I will reply to them during the course of the debate.</p>

<p>*This applies also to the hon. member for Moorreesburg in regard to the points which he raised, and to a large extent I am sure that the points which the hon. member for Smithfield raised, will again receive considerable attention in this debate, whereupon I shall deal with them by way of summary in my reply.</p>

<p>At this stage I just want to say that this afternoon I am able to make a statement on the first data which have become available as a result of the 1970 population census. I had hoped that it would have been possible for the hon. the Prime Minister to have done so during the discussion of his Vote, but that, unfortunately, was not possible. Therefore I am now availing myself of this opportunity offered by the discussion of my Vote, to give this House the data.</p>

<p>Since the 1960 population census, South Africa has undergone basic constitutional changes, whereas a rapid rate of growth has been experienced in the economic field. Even in the early planning stages the prevalence of these circumstances in the country created the realization that the 1970 population census would be the most important census to date, and for that reason all attempts had to be made to carry it out as thoroughly as possible.</p>

<p>In order to promote thoroughness and quality in the survey, the Department made an intensive study of previous censuses made in South Africa and in certain major Western countries, as well as the directives published from time to time by the United Nations Organization.</p>

<p><span class="col_5131-5132" refersTo="page_1123"/>Of special importance in the determination of the census task was, <i>inter alia,</i> the identification of the Bantu homelands which did not exist in 1960 and the population numbers of the various Bantu national units which were also unknown in 1960. So as to enable the drawing of meaningful comparisons, the Department was obliged to make geographic adjustments in such a way that the then Bantu areas would cover the same areas geographically as the Bantu homelands as demarcated for the purposes of the 1970 census. Therefore, in the 1970 census, the Bantu homelands were recognizably separated from the white areas, and consequently a separate statistical service will be established for the homelands which will facilitate and promote planning and development.</p>

<p>In order to make the census even more practicable and at the same time to lay the foundation for the purposes of geographic adjustments, economic and physical planning, the Republic had to be divided into 25,000 sub-districts, in each of which approximately 800 to 1,000 persons lived.</p>

<p>With the sub-districts as basis, the Bantu areas of 1960 could be reconciled with the Bantu homelands of 1970 to such an extent that a true comparison could be drawn and the population numbers of the various national units within the white area and the Bantu homelands could be ascertained.</p>

<p>A requirement for the successful and qualitative fulfilment of the census task, was that reliable staff had to be appointed. For this purpose the Cabinet approved of public servants being used for the survey. Furthermore, inter-departmental negotiations resulted in other services, for example, the Departments of Defence, Education and Prisons, also releasing staff. The staff at the disposal of the Department was utilized in such a way that the non-white national units were served mainly by members of their own people, something which ensured very good co-operation.</p>

<p>For the rest, the Department made use of the Press, the radio, films and talks to inform the public everywhere in the country, even in the most outlying districts, of the proposed population census.</p>

<p>An intensive plan of training was also launched for the purpose of preparing enumerators thoroughly for their task, and for eliminating in this way delay and slipshod work when the survey was due to start.</p>

<p>The organization which was set up after intensive study and research had been carried out, operated so successfully that the provisional numbers of the various national units, inside as well as outside the white areas and the Bantu homelands, can now be made known. The figures show, <i>inter alia,</i> the growth of the various national units, the ratio between the numbers of Bantu in the homelands and in the white areas, as against the numbers for the corresponding areas of 1960.</p>

<p>According to the census survey, the number of Whites in white areas and in Bantu homelands increased from 3.1 million in September, 1960, to 3.8 million in May, 1970, an increase therefore of 22.4 per cent. In the Bantu homelands alone, the number of Whites decreased by 6,000 (25 per cent)&#x2014;from 24,000 to 18,000. Seen as a whole, the ratio of Whites in the total of all national units in white areas as well as in Bantu homelands, decreased from 19.3 per cent in 1960 to 17.8 per cent in 1970, but in the white areas the ratio of the Whites to all national units in the white areas increased from 25.8 per cent in 1960 to 26.2 per cent in 1970.</p>

<p>Over the period of nearly 10 years the number of Coloureds increased from 1.5 million (1,509,000) to almost 2 million (1,996,000), an increase of 32.3 per cent. As regards the Coloureds in the Bantu homelands, the number decreased from 15,000 to 13,000, i.e. by 13.3 per cent.</p>

<p>The number of Asians increased from 477,000 in 1960 to 614,000 in 1970, i.e. an increase of 28.7 per cent. The number of Asians in the Bantu homelands decreased from 6,000 in 1960 to 3,000 in 1970, i.e. by 50 per cent.</p>

<p>The total number of Bantu in all areas increased from 10.9 million (10,928,000) in 1960 to 14.9 million (14,893,000) in 1970. Of the total number of Bantu of 14.9 million (14,893,000) 6.9 million (6,918,000), or 46.5 per cent, are in the Bantu homelands, as against 8 million (7,975,000), or 53.5 per cent, in white areas. In 1960 4.1 million (4,101,000), or 37.5 per cent, of all Bantu were in the homelands, whereas 6.8 million (6,827,000), or 62.5 per cent, of all the Bantu were in white areas. The increase from 37.5 per cent to 46.5 per cent in the Bantu homelands indicates a considerable movement of Bantu from the white areas to the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>The movement of the Bantu from the white areas to the homelands can be seen more clearly from the following analysis:</p>

<p>Expressed as a percentage, the increase in the total number of Bantu in white areas as well as in the Bantu homelands from the 1960 census to the 1970 census, was 36.3 per cent, i.e. 14,893,000 in 1970 as compared with 10,928,000 in 1960. But during the same period, the number of Bantu in the homelands increased by 68.7 per cent, from 4,101,000 in 1960 to 6,918,000 in 1970, whereas the number of Bantu in white areas increased by only 16.8 per cent, from 6,827,000 in 1960 to 7,975,000 in 1970 In other words, the number of Bantu in the homelands increased much more rapidly than the increase in the total number of Bantu (68.7 per cent as against 36.3 per cent), whereas the increase in the white areas was less than half the increase in the total number of Bantu (16.8 per cent as against 36.3 per cent.)</p>

<p>A distinction is drawn among the various Bantu national units in the census On the <span class="col_5133-5134" refersTo="page_1124"/>basis of home language. On this basis, the census indicates the size of the various groups (to the nearest 1,000) as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>The figures which are now being released, relate mainly to population numbers in the various white areas and in the Bantu homelands. However, exceptional progress has been made in the processing of data by the Department, and the intention is to publish the other data in connection with, for example, ages, levels of education, trades and professions, home language etc., as soon as such data becomes available.</p>

<p>A population census is a major undertaking and consequently, costs are an important element in such a survey and for this reason the Department has made a calculation of the costs under the subheads as they appear in the Estimates. The figures which are now being furnished in the form of a summary, with minor deviations, relate to the period 1st January, 1968, to 31st May, 1970. It is the first time that such an analysis has been made but it will undoubtedly be of great value in future calculations.</p>

<p>They really rendered a great service to the country and accummulated a mass of basic information, information which is indispensable to the authorities as well as to the private sector in the formulation and planning of policy and in its implementation. The figures which I have made known here, are of great importance. This occasion may still come to be known in history as the day when proof was submitted that the policy of separate development is succeeding in regard to the Bantu peoples.

<p>I thank the hon. the Minister for his announcement. The figures he has given us are obviously going to constitute a talking point in the months that lie ahead. The hon. the Minister will understand that we shall want to have a good look at them. He will also understand that the conclusions we shall draw from them will differ from those drawn by himself and by his side of the House. In any event, we are thankful for having these figures; we shall go into them very carefully indeed.</p>

<p>There is another matter I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister in connection with the proclamation of group areas. The hon. member for Port Natal dealt with the Grey Street area and in this connection I welcome the Minister&#x2019;s statement that he intends seeing to it that this particular matter is brought to an early conclusion. He has all the facts in his possession now and I hope that he will take it upon himself personally to see to it that a decision in this matter is expedited, that the interests of the people involved are protected and that they are given an indication of the intention of the Government as early as possible. As the hon. member for Port Natal has pointed out, this matter has been hanging fire now for a considerable time, and for anyone who knows the Indian community and is aware of the scope and the size of their investments in the Grey Street area, this is a matter of considerable concern. An hon. member has just informed me that this matter has already been under discussion for 20 years.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the question of Pietermaritzburg and the declaration of a Coloured area there. Originally it was another department that made a decision in the matter &#x2014;the Department of Community Development, I believe. In any event, the original decision was a wrong decision. The hon. member for Moorreesburg spoke about expensive adjustments that had to be made.</p>

It is always a matter of great interest and of deep gratification to us to find hon. members who move from this side to that side of the House being taken up in the Cabinet so soon afterwards. That fact speaks volumes of the calibre of members we have on this side of the House. May I say that it will not escape the notice of the public that their own interests would be so much better served if all the members of the Cabinet could be drawn from this side of the House. But after having welcomed the hon. the Minister to this portfolio I want to say that it is a matter for regret that it is an established Government practice to appoint the most junior Minister to this important portfolio of Planning. We understand it is Government practice and we must, therefore, assume that it is also Government policy; the one derives from the other. Seeing that the Prime Minister is present here he could perhaps indicate to us whether in fact it is the Government&#x2019;s policy and practice to appoint the most junior member to the Cabinet in charge of this important portfolio. The Minister of Mines said this was the case when he said that the Department of Planning had never been administered by anyone but the most junior member to the Cabinet. We can only express our regret that that is so. We would deal with the matter quite differently.</p>

<p>In any event, the present hon. Minister has not got off to a very auspicious start. It was left to him to explode another bomb, a bomb which, like so many others we had during the Session, also turned out to be a damp squib and failed to explode. On Friday he came here with a great show of flag waving and announced certain census figures which, so he told us, illustrated that separate freedoms actually worked. But, Sir, we see it totally differently. We see those figures as a mask for absolute failure, for dismal failure on the part of the Government, failure to give effect to its stated plans. I think the Minister announced those figures on Friday in an attempt to give heart to his flagging supporters. But in that object he had also failed. Quite obviously we cannot discuss this issue at this stage in any sort of detail because all the essential features, notably the economic facts&#x2014;such as where these people work and from where they derive their livelihood&#x2014;are quite fortuitously not available at the present time. However, the Minister sought to derive a lot of mileage out of the figures he gave us and therefore it is appropriate that we on this side of the House should make some reference to them.</p>

<p>When you deal with statistics you can prove practically anything. I am reminded here of a writer of children&#x2019;s books in Scandinavia many years ago. He attempted to prove that babies were being brought by storks. He made a statistical analysis of the situation and, sure enough, he found a positive correlation to exist, a direct statistical relationship, between the number of babies born in Scandinavia and the number of storks in the area. Quite clearly there is no relationship between the two. The only common factor would be climatic conditions which happen to influence the behaviour of both of these groups. Here the Government is in exactly the same position, in our opinion. It is trying to prove that babies are brought in by storks. No wonder then that even its own Press was very lukewarm on this point. I was interested over the week-end to notice that <i>Die Beeld</i> had certain things to say, and I might just mention that <i>Die Beeld</i> from time to time shows a greater degree of insight than some of its stable-mates. <i>Die Beeld</i> could obviously muster no enthusiasm whatsoever. Indeed, its headline read &#x201C;Kenners wil meer weet&#x201D;. And that is the crux of the whole matter. It is only the uniniated who could be taken in by this form of statistical chicanery. Even Prof. Sadie, probably the foremost demographer in our country, has gone on record this morning as saying that these figures do not prove anything. To begin with, we all believe there was massive under-enumeration of Bantu in the 1960 Census, but until the Minister can tell us where these people permanently live and where they obtain their livelihood from, these facts are meaningless and make no interpretation that is at all worth while possible.</p>

<p><span class="col_5137-5138" refersTo="page_1126"/>Even so, what are the facts and the figures the hon. the Minister has put before us&#x003F; As far as the Whites in this country are concerned, we all understood that in 1960 the ratio of White to non-White was one to four. In this census which has just been completed this has now disadvantageously moved, as far as the Whites are concerned, to a ratio of less than one in five, and all projections indicate that by the turn of the century it will be about one in eight. But secondly the hon. the Minister tells us that in the so-called white areas of South Africa the proportion of Whites percentagewise has increased from 25.8 per cent to 26.2 per cent. This is an increase of .4 per cent over a period of 10 years, and this is notwithstanding a massive immigration programme. What does this mean&#x003F; It means that if all factors have held static&#x2014;and this of course is not the case, because the increase is bigger among the non-Whites&#x2014;it will take 500 years before there will be parity between the Whites and the non-Whites in the so-called white South Africa. Thirdly, the Whites are no longer the biggest community: they are no longer the most numerous nation in South Africa. They are now exceeded by the Zulus and by the Xhosas. No wonder that <i>Dagbreek</i> over the week-end, in reviewing this, said somewhat laconically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In die verlede kon ges&#x00EA; word dat die blankes die grootste nasie hier is. Die jongste syfers wys dat ons hierdie argument sal moet laat vaar.</block>

<p>This is another myth that has been exploded. But in the fourth instance, what these statistics indicate is that the Coloureds and the Asians now number about half of the total white population and we know that by virtue of their rate of increase, by the turn of this century they will exceed the white figures. The Minister hails these figures as a triumph for separate development. Now we ask, and quite legitimately so, where is the separate freedom for the Coloureds and for the Asians&#x003F; We must leave it now to the hon. the Prime Minister, who said earlier that we should leave this problem for our children to solve. In the fifth instance, what these statistics show quite clearly is that there are still 8 million Bantu living in so-called white South Africa, and over the last 10 years the Bantu have increased by 1.2 million, and the Whites by .7 million. But it will not remain at this. We know that the natural increase of the Bantu was 36 per cent over this period, and for the Whites it was only 22 per cent, so that the disparity which is already there is going to be greatly magnified as we continue. But we come to the sixth point, which is probably the most important one. We want some confirmation from the hon. the Minister that the boundaries which were used in this census coincide exactly with those that were used in 1960. Can he confirm that every single area which was included in this survey as a Bantu homeland or reserve was in fact also so included in 1960&#x003F;</p>

<p>We do not get that from him. The Minister told us that they were enumerated as being in the Bantu areas. Does that mean that they live there <i>de jacto</i> or is it again one of these <i>de jure</i> stratagems that we have had so often before&#x003F; But, Sir, far more important than this, what are these boundaries that were used as Bantu areas&#x003F; We cannot get the Government to indicate what they are for political purposes, but when it comes to census figures, then all of a sudden they are very clearly established. But the most important consideration is still this: If there are 6.9 million Bantu in the so-called reserves, where do they derive their livelihood from&#x003F; Twenty years ago Tomlinson said that the Bantu reserves were hopelessly over-populated. Let us take the example of the Transkei. We are told that there are now 4 million people who speak Xhosa and who are therefore Transkeians, yet what are the economic resources of the Transkei&#x003F; According to the Government&#x2019;s own evidence, they have 40,000 jobs for Bantu in positions other than agriculture, but according to the Government&#x2019;s own evidence too, more than half of those work for the Government and are in Government services. Does this mean then that only 20,000 workers out of a population of 4 million&#x2014;and percentagewise this would be .5 per cent&#x2014;is a base on which to establish a nation&#x003F;</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister, instead of crowing about these statistics, should, like Mao Tse-tung and his followers, go into seclusion for a while to cogitate this important problem, and then I am quite sure that he will come to the conclusion that the Government is on the wrong track. But, Sir, if you can manipulate statistics in this way, then you might as well include Soweto as a Bantu reserve. Think of the impact on the South African statistical pattern. It will immediately make Johannesburg a border area. It might even salvage the reputation of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. What the Government has given us here is a form of optical illusion. They have tried to create a political mirage. They are trying to suggest to us that what we see with our very eyes is in fact not so; these Bantu are just not here. This is a massive piece of statistical deception, in order to perpetuate and reinforce a political hoax; that is all that we have here.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not going to be distracted by this because I believe that there are far more important issues at stake such as the sins of omission and commission of the Department of Planning, and it is to this that I would like to return. The Department of Planning has fundamentally three functions&#x2014;scientific and economic and physical planning. Although I obviously cannot devote time to all of these, some brief reference to them, I think, is indicated. There can be no doubt that South Africa&#x2019;s future as an industrial nation is completely tied up with the progress that we can make in the field of science and research. There is every indication that to-day we are <span class="col_5139-5140" refersTo="page_1127"/>not getting the scientific information that was previously made available to us. This means that South Africa will be forced to work towards a greater degree of scientific independence than has been the case before, and this to my mind signifies two things immediately: To begin with we must devote more money to science and research. We think that the Government is niggardly in this regard. If you look at the budget of the C.S.I.R., which is one of the biggest research institutes administered by this Minister and if you allow for the erosion in money value, you find that the additional grants that they have received permit expansion only in a very marginal sense. We on this side of the House would certainly devote far more money to scientific research.</p>

<p>But I think in the second instance there is also a need for greater co-ordination. At the moment efforts in this field are fragmentary. Let me indicate how it works: The scientific adviser is responsible to the Prime Minister; the C.S.I.R. is administered by and is under the control of the Minister of Planning; the Human Sciences Research Council is with the Ministry of Education; Atomich research, for some inexplicable reason, is with the Ministry of Mines. Then you have a whole host of research institutes like Onderstepoort, medical research and others, which report directly to their own ministry. A case could certainly be made out for a greater degree of co-ordination in standardizing the conditions of service of scientists, in making departmental transfers possible, in allowing and permitting the degree of scientific cross-fertilization which is essential. All this could only really be effectively done if there is a greater degree of coordination. But, Sir, more important than this, the amount of money which is now received by these research institutes depends largely upon the plausibility of the particular Minister concerned and on the extent to which he can persuade the Minister of Finance to allocate funds to a particular organization. We believe, in view of the importance of science and research, that scientific research should be better co-ordinated. Although clearly there must remain a functional relationship between many of these institutes and the departments they serve, we believe the best man to coordinate this is the Prime Minister himself. If he is not in a position to do so, then there should be created a separate Ministry of Science and Research. I am authorized to say that we, on this side of the House would work in this direction.</p>

<p>Secondly, I would like to come to economic research. This division has probably had a greater degree of success than any other. Its five-year forecasts of development, its economic development programme serve a very useful purpose. The development atlas which is compiled by this department serves as a guide both to Government and to industry to ensure that industries are sited in areas where they would be most profitable. But I want to voice a note of caution in this regard. This department is primarily responsible for long-term research, for macro economic development. If it comes to concern itself as it does from time to time, with short-term issues, then we believe this is in direct conflict with its own charter. We believe that probably one of the most important aspects in economic planning is that of manpower planning because this is our most precious economic resource. We would like to suggest that this department should devote more time and effort to the long-term planning on our human resources. We know a measure of it is done by certain institutes.</p>

<p>If we come to physical planning, the third leg, then the situation becomes more interesting because here we are dealing with a more contentious issue. The way in which the Physical Planning Act is being administered at the moment points to the fact that there is already extensive disruption of our economy. It is now in retrospect quite clear that this was an ill considered measure, precipitately introduced against the advice of people like the Economic Advisory Council, all in an attempt to prove that the myth of apartheid is in fact a workable plan. What the Government is doing and the way in which this Act is being administered at the moment, is that they are forcing industry to site itself in areas where it does not enjoy maximum locational advantages. This is beginning to add to the cost structure of industry. It is having a profound impact upon our export pattern. It might well be one of the reasons why we face this massive deficit on Foreign Trade Account. But it is increasingly becoming a massive burden on our whole economic system.</p>

<p>The Government has sought to justify its Draconian actions by saying that decentralization of industry is necessary. I think this bears further analysis. Decentralization as such obviously serves a purpose. But we must see it in perspective. South Africa already has probably as great a degree of industrial decentralization as is the case in other countries, which are at a comparable stage of development. Decentralization is often justified on different grounds. In South Africa it certainly would be true to say that there are important social and political reasons why we should have a measure of decentralization. In the past much has also been made of the fact that decentralization is necessary on strategic grounds. I think this is a situation that might change. Already there are many people who are prepared to indicate that with the advent of the guided missile you are in a better position to defend your industries if in fact there is a considerable degree of centralization. But, Sir, this whole decentralization issue will stand or will fall on economic grounds as was indicated a while back by no other than Dr. Rautenbach. Dr. Rautenbach in reviewing this matter said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless tangible and purely economic advantages also flow from such a policy it cannot succeed in the long run.</block>

<p><span class="col_5141-5142" refersTo="page_1128"/>We must therefore look at the economic factors. If we can be sure that there is sub-optimal geographical distribution of industry and that this consistently favours the sitting of industries in metropolitan areas, then I think there is a case for Government intervention. We have no evidence for this, however, Dr. McCrystal who did a study in this regard recently found that only 10 per cent of the industries might be wrongly sited and that only one out of a sample of 76 was described by him as a large employer of labour. What we are getting here is decentralization not on economic grounds but in order to obtain certain racial ratios. What South Africa is heading for is a system of economic development on the triplicate form basis, industrialization on the permit system. Now the Government has sought to justify this by referring to a study which was done in Italy quite some time ago, where it was suggested that the cost of public services, the social fixed overheads, increased with each additional worker that is brought into a metropolitan area. Even this has hardly any relevance to the South African situation. To begin with it must be determined what the composition of this expenditure is and who pays for it, if it is the Central Government or the private individual. Studies done in Norway by Johansen and others indicate that the cost will rise, but they also show that the standard of administrative services increased dramatically. In any case, big cities serve as nuclei for areas around them. Johannesburg does not only serve its own population, but also a whole set of satellite cities. Nobody tells us about the invisible costs involved when industry is forced away from its essential services. If you have this kind of decentralization somebody somewhere will have to pay the price for it, and the price in this case will be found in a lower real national output. No wonder then that at this stage the Government appoints Prof. Reynders. Ten years after the Permanent Committee was established, an investigation is ordered which was obviously a prerequisite for arriving at a rational decision in the first instance. Nearly five years after the Physical Planning Act was introduced the Government now comes with the Rieckert Commission. Quite clearly this puts the cart before the horse, because if the system works so well why should we have a Rieckert Commission.</p>

<p>What is happening here and what the Physical Planning Act is doing to the South African economy is also quite clear. To begin with it is leading to excessive capitalization. Industry must spend more money in importing sophisticated equipment to take the place of the labour they cannot get. Our exports are beginning to suffer. Exports require long term planning and when investors are subjugated to administrative fiat how can one possibly do so. It is leading to wage increases. Because workers become scarce as a result of this policy non-Whites demand higher wages. Because Whites are kept in positions which could be profitably done by non-Whites they are also asking for wage increases. Consequently there is a wage escalation and this in turn is going to affect our propensity to save. This will in the long run have a dramatic impact on our growth rate. Already it is clear what is happening as far as our investment pattern is concerned. In 1968 investment in secondary industry declined by some 16 per cent. In 1969 it declined by 11 per cent. In the gross sense this is probably a decline of 50 per cent over two years. It is certainly true to say at the moment that this investment figure is at least 20 per cent lower than was forecast by our economic planners. We are setting our sights on a growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent and this presupposes a growth rate in manufacturing of at least 8 per cent. We also know that once the investment has been made it takes at least two years before it is reflected in the growth rate. So here we have a situation where our economic growth rate has been deliberately retarded and it will have a profound impact on South Africa. To begin with it means less lucrative posts for the Whites. Secondly it raises the spectre of unemployment in regard to non-Whites. Thirdly it means lower company profits and fourthly it means higher personal taxation for all of us. But probably more important than any of these affects, it means that our South African economy is being weakened at a stage when we can least afford it. That is why there is considerable resentment against this legislation. Not at any time has a legislative instrument been subjected to such universal condemnation as is the case with regard to this legislation. Organized industry and organized commerce is against it. The Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut is probably more vociferous in its criticism than anybody else. Even the Afrikaans Press, to which Mr. Dirk Richards refers from time to time as the &#x201C;slavish Press&#x201D; talks about it. <i>Dagbreek</i> a while ago wrote:</p>

<block name="quote">Drastiese stappe word nou dringend deur die Regering oorweeg om die stremmende uitwerking van die desentralisasiebeleid op die land se ekonomiese groei te stuit.</block>

<p>It talked furthermore about these &#x201C;ingrypende en onwortelende bepalings&#x201D;. Volkshandel recently put it this way:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Kwarteeu gelede het dr. M. S. Louw reeds met sy profetiese blik gewys op die gevaar dat die apartheidskip op die ekonomiese rotse mag beland.</block>

<p>I want to say right away that we on this side of the House are not opposed to decentralization, nor to border area. This hon. Minister whenever he has time, goes to his own constituency. He is always very anxious to spread the story that we are against border areas and decentralization. This is not so, Sir. But we must see it as part of a bigger pattern. If an area is economically depressed and if he tells the people in Queenstown that that is an <span class="col_5143-5144" refersTo="page_1129"/>economically depressed area, every effort should be made to uplift it in the economic sense. But if that applies to Queenstown, it also applies to Oudtshoorn, Kimberley, Ermelo and a host of other areas.</p>

<p>Much has also been said about the manner of achieving decentralization. In this House we talked about the selective employment tax. I do not want to enter into the merits of this measure, except to say that it would at least have had the advantage of putting decisionmaking where it belongs namely with the businessman, rather than with the bureaucrat. My guess is that this matter went to the Cabinet; because quite obviously, the hon. the Prime Minister would not have pronounced on it. My feeling also is that this Minister of Planning should have have supported it, as well as the ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs. But my guess is that they were outvoted by the raoists in the Cabinet; because if a tax of this kind, is accepted then it is the deathblow of apartheid. It means then that one does not only accept non-Whites as a permanent feature of one&#x2019;s economy, but more than this, one uses it as a source of revenue. I would like the hon. the Minister to deny that this matter in fact did go to the Cabinet and that it worked out in precisely the way I tried to sketch it to him.</p>

<p>But what we still want to know is after all this, what does the Government in fact achieve&#x003F; This Act centres essentially around Africans who work in industry. Industry takes in only about 20 per cent of those who are economically active. What about primary industries&#x003F; What about tertiary economic activity&#x003F; But here we are concerned with services, and the Government does not attempt to cut back the labour allowed in these fields, because they know it will affect the man in the street and it will be registered through the ballot box. But what the Minister does not say to us in any case, is that even after all this has been done, we still find that 80 per cent of the people employed in secondary industry and the manufacturing industry in this country are non-white. Probably 90 per cent of those in mining are non-white and also in agriculture. So we do not know what he is trying to achieve. All that he has succeeded in doing, is to retard our growth rate. This is something that we will suffer for greatly.</p>

<p>We do not want to be too harsh with this hon. Minister, because he is new and has only just taken over. Certainly if he does not change the position, next year we will be much harsher with him. But we feel so strongly about Government neglect in this regard that, had there been a suitable Parliamentary device, we would have recommended and formally proposed not only a diminution in salary of the Minister himself, but of all his colleagues in the whole Cabinet.</p>

<speech by="#van_vuuren">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the beginning of his speech the hon. member for Hillbrow scornfully pointed out that ex-members of the United Party who joined the National Party did not remain there for long before being appointed to the Cabinet. I think that it is specifically to their credit that such people come over to the National Party after their eyes have opened and they have seen what is taking place and has taken place to the eternal jeopardy of the continued existence of the Whites in South Africa. We are proud to see people of this calibre sitting in the National Party to-day and occupying such high positions. I want to congratulate the Minister on his appointment. We want to tell him that as far as the National Party is concerned we shall do everything in our power to support him in this very important portfolio that he has now gained. The hon. member also referred scornfully to a remark that was made by the hon. the Minister of Health. He said that the newest Cabinet appointment was always given the portfolio of Planning. Sir, this is merely a coincidence, but I nevertheless want to say that it in no way prejudices the fact that this portfolio has passed into the hands of an extremely competent and capable person. By these means the hon. member tried to place the Minister under suspicion, by referring scornfully to his competence and ability to hold this portfolio. This will not hold water in this House or outside. We know this Minister. He will fill this post with great distinction.</p>

<p>We also want to convey a word of thanks to the previous Minister of Planning. He held this portfolio with a great deal of competence during the years in which he was Minister of Planning. We know that with all the other responsibilities he carried, he had a big task on his hands in carrying this responsibility as well. However, he acquitted himself with great distinction and brilliance. Never for a moment was it necessary for us to say that he did not do so with great dignity. He carried out a noble task and made a great contribution to the extension of this portfolio.</p>

<p>In passing I just want to express a word of appreciation to Mr. Van Niekerk, who has retired as Secretary of the Department. He is now being followed up by Dr. Rautenbach. Mr. Van Niekerk entered this post as an administrative official, and he did great work. We are grateful for what he did. To-day, in the person of the new Secretary, Dr. Rautenbach, we have someone who has already reached great heights of achievement in this country&#x2019;s administration. He is a person with the necessary background for this kind of work. For many years he was the Prime Minister&#x2019;s adviser on Planning. We foresee that, under his guidance, this department will still be expanded to reach great heights.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow also referred to the decentralization of industries. He spoke scornfully about that. Sir, the decentralization of industries must particularly take place in a country such as South Africa. We have here a heterogenous combination of many peoples on the southern point of Africa. It is therefore <span class="col_5145-5146" refersTo="page_1130"/>necessary for us to decentralize. South Africa is not the only country that is doing so. This is being done throughout the world. Just look at the large decentralization effort taking place in Great Britain to-day. There they are engaged in unravelling their metropolitan areas and establishing their industries in other areas. This is being done to entice people away from those metropolitan areas. It is happening in Paris. The hon. member must have knowledge of that. It is also taking place in a country such as Israel. There I saw with my own eyes how decentralization is taking place. Industries are being established there in areas in Israel where Arabs are living, so that they cannot come into contact with the Israelis in their areas. That is precisely the same development one has here, i.e. border industry development. They are just doing it in a different way there. We thus have this movement throughout the world. In West Germany it is also being done on a large scale, but when South Africa does it, in order to provide for the development needs of our many peoples, it is anathema, and hon. members then see something evil in it.</p>

<speech by="#van_vuuren">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>It was said. The hon. member spoke of the statistics. I am quite prepared to accept the statement the hon. the Minister made here as the correct one. The hon. member said that we were trying to set up a smokescreen here. That is what they are doing. They see that the development in South Africa is going against integration, and that basically it is going in a direction in which the peoples of South Africa want to be on their own and want to go and live in their own homelands. The hon. member is free to ask me: What about the Asiatics and the Coloureds&#x003F; That is a problem we are still going to solve. We are not afraid of it. The National Party believes in and accepts the fact that South Africa is a multinational country. The only solution to the question of South Africa&#x2019;s multinationality, is not integration, as advocated by the United Party or by the hon. member for Houghton and her Progressive Party. The solution lies in the pattern that we had in Europe, and which we shall also have in South Africa, i.e. that the ethnic peoples will be settled in their own ethnic context and in their own homelands. We have made great strides along that road, and we are making a success of it.</p>

<p>I now want to advocate that here in the seventies we must take the additional dynamic step along that road. We know that the Government is already thinking along those lines, but I want to advocate that we should, as soon as possible, plan a national physical development programme for the whole Republic of South Africa with all its peoples. I want to advocate the emergence of such a plan. We believe that this is the only solution, and that we must have a finely wrought plan, whereby indications must be made in the finest detail, on a large map of the Republic of South Africa, of where these various peoples are settled and in which way that development must take place. On that map there must be broad guiding lines indicating the development that must take place. It must be a flexible plan. When looking at that map of the Republic of South Africa, we must at a single glance see where the various peoples are settled here on the southern point of Africa. We must see what the development possibilities and trends are. I do not have the time now to elaborate further on that. I leave that to the technicians. At one glance the map must give a full picture of the way in which this concrete development must take place in South Africa. This would give the people, the industrialist, the land-owner, the foreigner, the provincial authorities, the local authorities and all other planning institutions, a visual image of the broader objectives of the national physical plan.</p>

<p>I also want to advocate that the policy of three-tier planning, which we have always had in South Africa, should be retained. Firstly, we must have the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Planning Advisory Council, then the provincial and then the local administrative authorities, each with planning at its own individual level, because it has become vitally necessary for local authorities to play a role as well. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte&#x2014;the R60 million member&#x2014; pleaded for a plan&#x2014;at least that was the little sense I could make out of his speech. But it seems to me to be a little bit late now to plead with the hon. the Minister for a plan when this Government must have been acting on something during the past 22 years. The hon. member made a comparison between our country and Israel, a comparison which is ridiculous because where in Israel are they placing industries on their borders with the Arab states&#x003F; Is it an example of the logical thinking on the other side that where you have countries embroiled in a war you move your industries to the borders of the countries with whom you are at war&#x003F; Well, if that is the best planning that hon. member can do, I can only hope that he never succeeds the present Minister as Minister of Planning.</p>

<p>I should like to pursue a question I touched on on Friday, one of the errors of commission of this Government. The hon. member for Hillbrow referred to other errors of omission and commission. As I said on Friday, I think it is another department that had to do with the original planning of the Coloured area in Pietermaritzburg, when a decision was taken to allocate Woodlands to the Coloureds, a decision which to my mind was a major mistake. It was a mistake because it failed to take into account an important aspect of planning, i.e. the possibility of radial development. In other words, it should not be an area that is <span class="col_5147-5148" refersTo="page_1131"/>boxed in by other group areas. But this is exactly what has happened in regard to the Coloured area in Pietermaritzburg. The department then took a decision which was based on the then existing Coloured population in Pietermaritzburg. Accordingly they allocated an area which they believed would be sufficient for the population then existing and for its future increase. But since it has been decided to centralize in Pietermaritzburg the entire Coloured community from the Natal Midlands as well as a large proportion of the Coloured population of the Transkei. Already the city council of Pietermaritzburg is engaged on the construction of the last possible living unit for Coloureds in Pietermaritzburg. Two years ago I was present when the then Minister of Planning, Dr. De Wet, toured the area so as to acquaint himself with the problems there. But up to the present no decision has been taken. Two areas have been projected as being possible Coloured areas. Meanwhile feelings between the two communities there are getting bitter because it is obvious that when an area is projected to be a Coloured area some time in future, property values there will fall, development will be stultified&#x2014;as a matter of fact, it amounts to a complete ban on the sale of properties because who is going to buy properties there&#x003F; The area next to the Woodlands community to-day is land which is extremely expensive and in addition difficult to develop on account of its broken nature. On the other side of Pietermaritzburg the corporation owns land itself which it can develop. But the only hinterland there is from a white area into a Bantu reserve. The Minister&#x2019;s Department has lately advertised for the opinions of the two communities concerned&#x2014;the old game to ask for the opinions of the people concerned while you have already made up your mind long before that. Sir, what I should like to know from the Minister is when are we going to get a decision&#x003F; Is it the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention to centralize in Pietermaritzburg the Coloured population of the Midlands of Natal&#x2014;the people at Ixopo, at Marianhill and all the smaller areas in Natal&#x003F; Where is the new area going to be in Pietermaritzburg&#x003F; People are waiting on a decision: as a matter of fact, it has been hanging over their heads for two years now. On Friday I asked the hon. the Minister to give personal attention to the Grey Street area. Similarly I ask him now to give his personal attention also to this area in Pietermaritzburg. Some sort of a decision ought to be taken. The people themselves are unhappy. The Coloured community have already voiced their objection against being split. We know what happens when we have one community and we create another one. In Pietermaritzburg you have the Woodland area, then the Indian area, then the Main Road and the railway line and then another new area. The initiative is almost always taken over by the new area because the young people move there. This is the problem&#x2014;you will find the old area decaying whilst any new inflow of population goes to the new area which still has a chance to expand. It is urgently necessary that the Minister and his Department now look at this matter in an attempt to find some early solution.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte completely ignored the challenge thrown out by the hon. member for Hillbrow who used the words of Dr. Rautenbach himself when he said that decentralization of industries should have some immediate economic advantage. Let the next speaker on the Government side tell us what immediate economic advantage is flowing to this country from the decentralization of industry taking place to-day&#x003F; Hon. members may say there are political advantages attached to it. That may be part of their political policy, part of the way they see South Africa. But I should like to see the economic advantages thereof and here I want to come back to the point which we on this side of the House have been making again and again, i.e. that only the strength of the metropolitan areas can carry the future of South Africa. Is the hon. the Minister also responsible for planning in the Bantu areas&#x003F; Is his Department responsible for the economic planning of the Bantu areas&#x003F; Is he responsible for the siting of the growth points in the Bantu areas&#x003F; Let him give us some measure of insight into how he sees the future of these areas. The hon. member for Pietersburg on a previous occasion said in these homelands there was going to be an economy with its own growth rate and with its whole future planned out by the Department. Let the hon. member for Pietersburg then tell us at what rate growth is to take place in the Bantu areas&#x003F; Where is capital being generated in the Bantu areas&#x003F; There was some attempt at an answer by an hon. member opposite who said that the Bantu were selling stock, about a million rands worth of stock in the whole of Zululand. This is supposed to generate capital. But can that hon. member tell me how much of that money is invested in means of production&#x003F; Is it not true that the whole lot is swallowed up by the provision of the day to day needs of the Bantu&#x003F; If the hon. the Minister is going to decentralize industry and if he has a plan in that connection, I should like to know from him how he sees this country, how we are going to develop and in what areas. We have four of five growth points established inside the Bantu areas. How does he see these being developed&#x003F; How does he see the expansion going out from there&#x003F; The question of the mobility of labour is something which fits into this and it is something which the hon. the Minister will have to take into account. Surely one of the factors in development is the fact that unskilled labour is a mobile element. Capital can be moved from place to place. It can be invested to create the infrastructure on which industry is based, but skilled labour is one of the things which is immobile because people are not prepared to be shunted around and moved about to areas <span class="col_5149-5150" refersTo="page_1132"/>where living conditions are not conducive to their moving there and establishing their families there.

<p>I have listened very attentively to the progress of the debate up to this point, I could not help thinking that here we are up against an Opposition that has been very unsympathetic or negatively disposed towards a fine machine created by this Government. If they were not negatively disposed, they were at least very aloof. Everything we have done up to now in terms of planning, whether physical or economical, has been treated by that side to questions and lamentations such as we have been listening to even to-day. That is why I say that it actually makes one a little tired to listen to them and to give attention to what they are saying. They must, therefore, excuse me if I do not go into their arguments in very great detail. The hon. member for Mooi River spoke firstly about a local matter, and when he had finished it was difficult to know precisely what he wanted, whether he was for or against. He did not make his inclinations clear, which is characteristic of the United Party members. Then he came along with their old story and criticized the Physical Planning Act and its implementation. After all the mandates this Government has received from the people to continue with the separation of the various peoples, have they not yet learned that they will have to agree to it&#x003F; Do they, time and again, want additional Klip Rivers to tell them that the people want what we are doing&#x003F; I think I have now said enough about the United Party members. They do not justify the valuable time of this Parliament. I firstly want to associate myself with the hon. member for Langlaagte who thanked the Minister and the Secretary very warmly.</p>

<p>Yes, we say thank you because we at least have the decency. We know that it accords with the rules of decency to thank someone for having done something good. We now say thank you very much to them for what they did during that period to establish for us a fine machine in working condition, having put that machine into operation under fire from the Opposition, and having implemented an essential principle in the division and grouping of the various peoples in South Africa. I want to extend my very warm congratulations to the Minister and to the Secretary, who recently retired from the Department, on a fine piece of work they did over the past few years. I want to go further. To-day I want to speak about a specific subject, and I also want to thank them very much for the sympathetic way they treated those aspects and for the great job they did. I also want to congratulate the hon. new Minister, who incidentally had the earlier honour of being my bench fellow, very warmly on his promotion to a full Minister. We know that in him we have a particularly capable man, and we want to give him the assurance that we look with great confidence to the future and to the work he will do in that Department. We also want to give the new Secretary for Planning the assurance that we are glad about his appointment, and since he has now come to take the place of a man for whom we had the greatest respect, we want to give him the assurance that we have the same respect for him and that he may also count on the cooperation of the parliamentary group at all times.</p>

<p>This brings me immediately to the subject about which I should like to say a few words. I said that we have built up a fine machine here, a machine that is engaged in certain very important tasks, because first things must come first; no one can find fault with that. But, Sir, we have here a large area of our country that is urgently requesting attention. I am referring to that large area, the North West, that is asking for economic planning. In the few minutes at my disposal I want to dwell on that for a moment. Sir, we have here a large area, covering almost half the Cape; it includes the constituencies Kuruman, Prieska, Gordonia, Namaqualand and even a portion of the constituencies Ceres and Beaufort West. Since we are involved, in this large area, with a region that is suffering from a total absence of an infrastructure, one is a little concerned about the fact that that area&#x2019;s minerals and other riches or resources were, to a very large extent, withdrawn in the past and processed in other parts of the country. Sir, the United Party will, of course, not understand this at all; they believe in centralization; they believe in importing Bantu to come along and do work for us in the cities. That is why I am not addressing myself to them now; I am addressing myself to a Government that is aware of these conditions and believes in the things I am now going to speak about.</p>

<p>Sir, we want that area, with its great potential, to obtain the necessary infrastructure to process its mineral riches there. For as long as one transfers those riches and does not establish the necessary infrastructure, that area will never be able to contribute its rightful share in the interests of the South African economy. Sir, we are dealing here with a chain reaction that we are very concerned about. In the first place there is uncertainty about the future of this area. We know of certain developments that are coming; we are aware that certain things are being planned; that general planning for the whole of South Africa is taking place. I am referring, for example, to one thing the Natural Resources Development Council held out to us for the future, i.e. that there would eventually be a large circular power line around South Africa that will be charged with atomic power in Cape Town, perhaps with gas along the east coast, in the north with ordinary coal power and along the Orange River with hydro-electric power. The whole <span class="col_5151-5152" refersTo="page_1133"/>area will then be linked up to that power unit. Sir, to us in the North West it has become very important to know precisely what the configuration of those power lines will be. In a part of that area we are at present faced with the problem that our power supplies have become hopelessly inadequate. Electricity prices have increased to five cents a unit. We must now decide where to erect temporary power units so that we can fall into step with the general planning, because we do not want to build power lines in the opposite direction, i.e. one wants one&#x2019;s heavier power lines at the source of the power, making them lighter as one moves further away, and not vice versa. It is a matter of serious concern to the people in that area; they want to know what the eventual configuration of those power lines will be in terms of our power, water supply and other factors. I think that it is of the utmost importance for us to know these things so that we may concentrate on purposeful development in a certain direction.</p>

<p>But, Sir, as far as I am concerned, this fact entails a very serious problem: There is at present a serious form of wasteful exploitation in respect of certain of our very important resources in the North West, because we do not have the necessary infrastructure there. Let me just mention a single example. In the vicinity of O&#x2019;Kiep, Nababeep and Karoolsberg we still have the biggest reserves of copper in the whole Southern Hemisphere, and then there are still the new discoveries. With the present infrastructure we simply cannot develop there at a percentage lower than 1.75. We know the rate at which copper is developed in an area such as Phalaborwa, for example, with its cheaper power. This means that we are forced into wasteful exploitation, and I doubt whether one would eventually be able to develop only the 1.75 per cent when the necessary infrastructure is established. That is why it is, therefore, so necessary for these tasks to be tackled speedily and for this Department to place its valuable machinery in operation in our area for a few months in order to carry out planning and to orientate us in this connection. The argument was raised about it being a good thing to reserve certain sources for the future. That would be a very good thing. But unfortunately this does not happen. The present tendency is, unfortunately, to take out the yes, as the saying goes in the North West, to extract the high grade ore, leaving the low-grade ore unprocessed. That is why I want to advocate to the hon the Minister and his Department that this matter be regarded in a very serious light and that the highest priority be given to the establishment of a commission of economic inquiry which can investigate what is taking place in the North West. Such a commission could orientate, guide and assist us in obtaining the absolutely essential infrastructure, and will be able to ensure that it is planned properly. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe that very few people would disagree with the promotion of coordinated physical planning for the future development of South Africa. We all agree that the most efficient utilization of all our available natural resources should be carefully planned to meet the complex demands of the future. To do this, we should regularly survey scientifically and economically our known resources on which can be based the assessment of the future potential and the most efficient utilization and development of those resources. Economic considerations should be the most important criteria on which recommendations should be based and not socio-political ideologies. The zoning of the country into areas and regions for the different types of utilization will probably be necessary. Areas will have to be zoned into farming areas, residential areas and also mining and industrial areas, all of which could again be subdivided for the various specialized activities.</p>

<p>On. this side of the House we feel that it is most important that enough land should also be set aside for recreational use. We believe that the most suitable areas should be planned for future nature reserves and national parks. They should be situated in the more beautiful and unspoiled natural surroundings. The United Party believes in the decentralization of industries in a constructive and positive way to relieve the over-congestion of the big cities and to spread the benefits of economic and financial growth and prosperity to all four provinces, South-West Africa and all their peoples. The Government&#x2019;s policy is restrictive. Its application of the desire to decentralize is also restrictive. First of all the Nationalist Party Government limits the development of industry by private white enterprise to the so-called white areas although they have made concessions to United Party policy by allowing agencies to operate in the Bantu areas. Secondly, artificial restrictions by the Department of Planning restrict industrialists from going to the most economical places inside the white areas by frog-marching them to the border areas. Industrialists in the textile and plastic industries have informed me that the Department of Planning tried to frog-march them to places like Rustenburg, Pietersburg, Phalaborwa and Kimberley. Both the textile weaving and plastic industries regard themselves as being capital and machine intensive industries. The plastic factory obtained permission to establish itself on the Witwatersrand only after undertaking and promising that not more than five Bantu would be employed.</p>

<p>Most of the town councils and municipalities on the Witwatersrand complain that they have had to accept the position where they can forget about applying for additional industrial land to be zoned as such unless the most unrealistic undertaking is given, namely that no Bantu will be employed. No municipality is prepared to give the undertaking that no <span class="col_5153-5154" refersTo="page_1134"/>Bantu would be employed in the new industrial areas. The Benoni Town Council will be selling the last three industrial sites available at the end of November this year; two of them for light industries and one for heavy industry. It has little hope of attaining any additional industrial land for future development in that area. There is a proclaimed Indian industrial area outside Benoni where only Indians can be employed to the exclusion of all other groups. Needless to say, no industrial development has taken place in that area. Next to the Indian residential area in Actonville, a few sites are available to Indians for light industries, but only one has developed over the years, namely a welding firm making burglar proofing for the houses going up in the area. The reason is that all employment is restricted to Indians in that area only and that these Indians are not readily available at competitive salaries with Bantu labour in unskilled jobs.</p>

<p>Individual plans for the expansion of factories, either in terms of enlarged output or extensions to factories, were held back because of the uncertainty created by the Department of Planning as to the possibility of obtaining additional Bantu labour concessions to put these plans into operation. Small industries like sheet metal workers and engineering firms often have a fluctuating labour force, depending on the size of the contracts for the number of Bantu they can employ. They find it extremely difficult to get the necessary concessions in time. They are often compelled to employ illegally more Bantu labour than their quota allows. The illegal employment of Bantu can be as high as 23 per cent of the Bantu labour force and this makes dishonest men of basically honest people. It lends itself to all kinds of abuse like the submitting of incorrect returns of the number of Bantu employed and also to excessive applications for additional quotas. All this must certainly stifle the natural growth of industries in areas on the Witwatersrand in particular where they are so dependent on the development of secondary industries to replace the income from the dying mines.</p>

<p>The crowding of population groups into single confined group areas is probably the most nefarious activity of the Department of Planning. For example, I would like to mention the ruling whereby all the Indians of the East Rand will have to move to the confines of one single group area for Indians at Actonville. Already it is obvious that there will be insufficient room for the natural increase of Indians living in that area, not to mention the requirements of all the Indians of the whole East Rand. All they will be doing will be to create another slum area as a result of overcrowding if the Government follows its stated plans. It would be ridiculous to move a well settled Indian community from a place like Bakerton near Springs to Benoni. At Bakerton there is ample room for expansion well away from Springs. Now it is planned to send them to the overcrowded Actonville, hemmed in by industries on the one side and a Bantu area on the other and an undermined neighbouring municipal area. I would recommend that the Department of Planning read the socio-economic report published by the University of Natal in regard to the problems of Indians on the East Rand. The report regards it as essential that there should be more than one. Indian community on the East Rand at places like Bakerton and also at Nigel. If that is not possible, another area should be proclaimed.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Benoni confined himself chiefly to local matters in his vicinity, and he spoke of Indian group areas. He also asked what other hon. members on that side have already asked this afternoon, i.e. what economic benefits the Government sees in the decentralization programme that is now being tackled. I should like to ask hon. members on that side of the House how they really distinguish between economic decentralization and any other form of decentralization. I think the final test is most certainly to what extent peace and quiet can be created in the various communities in our fatherland. In this respect I also think that the country can only express its thanks for what the National Government has brought about. It was the United Party that allowed us to have miscegenation here in our residential areas in Cape Town and throughout the country. It was the National Party that had to create order and look to the establishment of separate residential areas for the Whites and also for the various non-white groups. Only by means of this single planning measure was peace and order created in virtually every community throughout the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to a very general statement that was made here earlier this Session by the Leader of the Opposition and those who echoed him on that side, among whom the hon. member for Hillbrow was probably the chief exponent. For example, it is being impressed on South Africa that we can accept as our target a growth rate of 10 or 11 per cent. I expected that hon. member to use the discussion of this Vote as an opportunity to clarify for us how it is possible to bring about a 10 or 11 per cent growth rate in South Africa. I expected him to use the example of Japan again and to prove to us, with chapter and verse, what mistake was made when this fourth economic development programme and the preceding programmes were drawn up. But I think that he specifically did not make use of this opportunity because he realized how hollow that claim is. To-day I just want to point out that this programme was drawn up as scientifically as possible. Only facts have been taken into consideration. I wonder if the Opposition wants to allege that agriculture can develop at a more rapid rate than 3.5 per cent per annum. I wonder whether the Opposition wants to allege that mining in South Africa can maintain a <span class="col_5155-5156" refersTo="page_1135"/>more rapid growth rate than about 2.7 per cent, which is used as a basis here. If comparisons are so easily made between a country such as Japan and the Republic of South Africa, and if we are presented with the abnormally high growth rate maintained in that country, why do hon. members not present us with the entire picture&#x003F; In the post-war years countries such as Germany and Japan, in particular, specifically did not spend proportionally the same amounts on defence. Why do they not tell us that America even had to make special appeals to Japan this year to make a larger contribution to the defence of its own surroundings and to the defence of the Pacific Ocean&#x003F; Why do they not tell us that Japan has almost exclusively concentrated on economic development in the past decade, and that it can apply its total manpower and all its sources to bring about a large-scale expansion of its economy. And it could do this only because, unlike other Western countries, it did not proportionally have to put aside a large part of its total income and manpower for defence purposes. Why do they not point out that Japan is a relatively small country and that it cannot be compared to South Africa in size&#x003F; South Africa must distribute its infrastructure over a tremendously large area, while Japan has to do it over a very small area. Why do they not point out that Japan is not actually a producer of primary products in the first place&#x003F; Virtually 10 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s gross domestic product comes from agriculture, and about the same percentage from mining, specifically the sectors where one cannot expect the same measure of growth. Why do they not point out to us that Japan already had a very large <i>per capita</i> income&#x003F; In 1968 it already had a <i>per capita</i> income of R815, while South Africa merely had a <i>per capita</i> income of about R513. It is therefore much easier to use industrial development as a basis, thereby obtaining a much larger growth rate than is possible in the case of South Africa. And why do they not point out to us that during the years 1962 to 1968 Japan had an increase in its consumer prices of 5.6 per cent at an average, as against a mere 2.7 per cent approximately in the case of South Africa&#x003F; That is the price being paid by Japan for that high growth rate. Why did they not come back to this programme that has been drawn up, and indicate to us that although three possible growth rates for South Africa were analysed, it was found that even at a growth rate of 6 per cent per annum, and even if we were to have a net immigration figure of 30,000 people a year, there would by 1973 already be a shortage of 40,000 workers in the white manpower structure alone&#x003F; We will have a greater demand for non-white labour, in excess of the supply of approximately 100,000 by 1973, if we were to accept a growth rate of 6 per cent. Why do they not acknowledge the fact that this entire target for South Africa is based on cold, hard facts. I think that the Opposition itself, and particularly that hon. aspiring leader, the hon. member for Hillbrow, realizes that this programme that has been drawn up for South Africa cannot really be attacked in this House in a scientific manner.</p>

<p>In the last few minutes at my disposal I should like to associate myself with the plea made by the hon. member for Langlaagte this afternoon. He pointed out that a tremendous number of studies have already been conducted by this Department, resulting in the collection, over a long period, of basic data for the entire country, and that this Department should perhaps now take a fresh look at South Africa as a whole, including the Bantu homelands. With such data the Department will then be able to draw up a development plan for our country as a whole. In our efforts to decentralize, the fact remains that every small town sees itself as a potential growth point. In the Cape Province along 20 regional studies have already been completed since 1960, and about 10 such studies will shortly be completed. I therefore think that we already have all the basic data according to which we can draw up a guide plan for the country as a whole. To-day I should like to leave the Department with this one thought: With a view to the fact that South Africa has always brought about growth in the past by concentrating industries in certain areas, should we not see to it that development in the Bantu homelands and in the developed white areas is also concentrated&#x003F; I want to advocate that as a basic point of departure we should accept that in an area such as the Transkei perhaps only one large growth point ought to be created. In certain regions in the Cape, for example, whether it be the South-Western districts or the Northern Cape, only one single large growth point ought to be created. When such a growth point has been determined, a simultaneous indication must be given of the extent to which such a place is expected to grow. Once we accept such a pattern, our industrialists will look with new eyes at such places that are indicated as future growth points. Such a pattern will also make it possible for the Government Departments concerned to concentrate in that area educational facilities such as universities, technical colleges and technical high schools. It will also make it possible for industrialists to determine what the local markets in that vicinity will be. If the Government, and particularly this Department, accepts this as its basic point of departure, it will be possible to establish aid committees for such regions. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. VAN Z. CILLI&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to take the hon. member for Vasco back to 1945 when the United Party established the principle of separate residential areas by introducing the first legislation in that regard. The Nationalists of course only built on the foundation laid by us. Secondly I should like to tell the hon. member that I think the Nationalist Party protests too much <span class="col_5157-5158" refersTo="page_1136"/>about the growth rate. If only they would do what the hon. member for Hillbrow suggested, namely to appoint all the Cabinet Ministers from the United Party, you will see that we have this growth rate which we are talking about.</p>

<p>It is essential to plan the economic development of South Africa so as to maintain an overall and balanced growth. Our planners should view South Africa as a whole and remove or change measures inhibiting growth in specific areas or stimulate new growth points. They should always ensure that the available manpower and capital be utilized with one object, namely the goal of maximum productivity. The hon. the Prime Minister speaking on his Vote said that he was afraid of two factors, 1. the uncontrolled development of the metropolitan areas and 2. unemployment. I should like to point out that Johannesburg, our largest metropolitan area, is only one-tenth the size of Tokyo. The Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage complex, which is the fourth biggest industrial producing area in South Africa is relatively speaking a small and developing region. I therefore think that this first fear of the hon. the Prime Minister is very far from realization.</p>

<p>The Orange River. The Government is committed to establish and develop new growth points such as Richard&#x2019;s Bay, Saldanha Bay and border areas. But in view of the critical white manpower shortage and the dearth of investment capital in our country, I think our planners should think very seriously about the question of whether existing developing areas should be sacrificed for new growth points. To me it makes eminent economic sense that existing developing regions which may for various reasons be lagging behind the national growth rate, receive priority in our planning, and thus I should like to come to the P.E.-Uitenhage complex.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister that that area to-day can be called the sick man of South Africa&#x2019;s economy. A very good case could be made out for this region to be granted the status of an Economic Development Area. It has an infrastructure of great width and depth, but the industrial development is in imbalance, being too dependent on the economically sensitive motor industry. It is rather significant that since 1968 this area has attracted only one major industry. The hon. the Minister will recall that previously Government planning designated the area west of the Humansdorp-Colesberg line as a Coloured labour area, while that east of the Fish-Kat River was a Bantu labour area. The region in-between was a dual labour area. But then the Government by a stroke of the pen changed this planning, designating this in between area, namely the area which encompasses the P.E.-Uitenhage complex, a Coloured preference area. This has caused uncertainty. Uncertainty is the one factor which is guaranteed to cause a slump in economic development. This region which is a Coloured preference region has a preponderance of Bantu to the extent of four to one. These Bantu were not imported into this area as the Bantu of the Western Cape were, but are indigenous to that area. There is practically no Coloured unemployment in the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage area. This places the Coloured in a too powerful bargaining position because when unemployables are employed they cause up to 100 per cent absenteeism per week. Amongst the Bantu there are at the moment about 6,000 unemployed.</p>

<p>Professor J. F. Potgieter, the director of the University of Port Elizabeth Institute for Planning and Research, has just completed an indepth study of the labour. potential of this area. At a recent conference held in Port Elizabeth he said that 1. the future industrial and general economic development in the Cape Midlands, particularly in the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage complex, would be severely hampered if the Government were to persist with its restrictive labour policy for the area and were strictly to apply the provisions of the Physical Planning Act. He said 2. that if the Government were to persevere with these policies and acute shortage of white and Coloured manpower could develop in 1980. He said 3. that if job opportunities were not provided for the Bantu still in that area by then, unemployment would grown alarmingly among them during the next decade.</p>

<p>The director of Bantu Affairs of the City Council of Port Elizabeth, Mr. Koch, said that according to his calculations there could be 1 million Bantu in this area by the year 2000. Even if the Government were to succeed in the well nigh impossible task of repatriating 50 per cent of the Bantu, it would still leave us with 500,000. The spectre of vast Bantu unemployment will stalk this area with all its concomitant dangers for our country unless the planning is altered and this area is designed once more as a dual labour area. On behalf of this complex I would therefore like to appeal to the Minister to change his planning and to designate the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage area as a dual labour area and not to apply section 3 of the Physical Planning Act to it. If the Minister were to do this, I am sure that this sick man of South Africa&#x2019;s economy would gain robust health within a very short time and become an asset not only to the Cape but to the whole Republic.</p>

<p>If the chief aim of the Department of Planning is to ensure a balanced growth and development of the country as a while, and if at the same time, through the application of the Physical Planning Act, we want to ensure that we do not create metropolitan areas that will become uncontrollable at a later stage, as far as the provision of services and the composition of the <span class="col_5159-5160" refersTo="page_1137"/>population are concerned, we shall, of course, at the same time have to look at those areas that have a large backlog, areas that are still in their periods of winter sleep, although they do contain the possibilities for development, provided they receive the necessary stimulus. In the light of this I want to focus attention to-day on the entire Southern Cape region, and Mossel Bay in particular, the natural and closely situated harbour gateway to that entire area. Strategically Mossel Bay is situated halfway between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, between the large industrial areas. On an approximately 500-mile-long coastline, Mossel Bay presents itself, as it were, as an area for the establishment of light industries. I could now be asked on what basis we are wanting to build this area up further.</p>

<p>Let us first look at Mossel Bay&#x2019;s historical background. It is the place where, more than 500 years ago, Whites for the first time landed on the shores of what is now South Africa. That is where our first church building was erected, where passing ships took on fresh water and meat&#x2014;just think, in this context, of the name Vleesbaai&#x2014;and the place where our first post office stood, and still stands today&#x2014;the well-known milkwood tree. Land and labour are two important prerequisites for development in any area. Land is easily obtainable and is cheap in the vicinity of Mossel Bay. This is so because there has not yet been over-population. But let me call upon a very well-known authority, the Minister of Transport. Fourteen days ago he opened the harbour works at Mossel Bay, and on that occasion he expressed himself as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Here land and labour are relatively cheap; the possibilities are, therefore, extensive. If labour cannot find a livelihood here, the exodus to other centres will continue.</block>

<p>You will agree with me that when the hon. the Minister of Transport speaks it is worth listening. He states here that if labour does not find a livelihood there, &#x201C;the exodus to other centres will continue&#x201D;. Can we not implement the Physical Planning Act in its essence by preferably keeping this migratory labour where there is still sufficient space available, labour that is being drawn away by industries in other areas&#x003F;</p>

<p>Let us look at the infra-structure at our disposal. In the first place there are the harbour extensions in progress at present. The second development phase of these extensions was opened by the Minister of Transport 14 days ago. When that has been completed, coasting vessels will be able to discharge cargo there and load up manufactured articles for transport to other centres. The fishing potential of the South Coast can then be properly exploited for the first time. And in Mossel Bay we also have the only oil discharge point at sea in the whole of South Africa. This is a very important factor in the development of any industries. In addition, a national airport is now being built there, and the necessary rail link exists, while Escom power would be available from 1972.</p>

<p>As far as water is concerned, a very important item in the infra-structure, we find that Mossel Bay is situated at the foot of the Langeberg mountains, and the rivers and mountain streams can therefore be utilized to good advantage. Since we are planning for a concentration of people, it is essential that we make provision for the necessary recreational facilities, and this Mossel Bay is particularly well suited to offer. We look at the extensive beach areas that are ample and uncluttered, where people have not yet flocked to such an extent that they trample one another underfoot, where we have separation between Whites and non-Whites, and where people can go for a rest after a day&#x2019;s work; if they want to fish, they may do so, and if they prefer deep-sea fishing they can also have it. Many areas in South Africa to-day would envy these lovely beach resorts that we can offer there, and that can be developed further.</p>

<p>The bay also offers an excellent opportunity for the sport of sailing. It is also an open spot at the foot of the Langeberg mountains, and those who do not choose to relax on the beach, may seek out the beauty of the flowers and everything the mountains offer, and there they may seek their relaxation. Our agricultural production there is such that with a larger population we could at any time push up the production of vegetables and fruit to a very high level. We are at present engaged in a search for oil at sea, and we have good expectations of significant results there, which would, of course, be of very great importance, not only to the Southern Cape, but also to the country as a whole.</p>

<p>If one looks at all these aspects, we have here a background that really offers us, if we regard it impartially, an opportunity to create a new growth point in South Africa, a growth point far removed from any other existing growth point. I should now like to ask the hon. the Minister and his Department this favour: That they draw up a plan of the area for us, and that they indicate to us what industries can be established there in the course of time, so that we, the local inhabitants, can meanwhile prepare ourselves to receive those industries at the appropriate time.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Mossel Bay made an excellent speech in which he pleaded for greater development, particularly with reference to the Southern Cape, and we on this side have no objections to the hon. member&#x2019;s plea. On the contrary, specifically with a view to the proper decentralization of industries, the hon. member for Mossel Bay will receive all the support he needs from this side of the House. But the hon. member for Vasco brought forward this point in particular. He asked us how we distinguished between economic decentralization <span class="col_5161-5162" refersTo="page_1138"/>and ordinary decentralization. I think that only a man who is not in his right mind can say that if an area is an under-developed region it will not receive special encouragement. Hence, if the hon. member for Mossel Bay makes such a plea we shall support him, particularly with respect to the Southern Cape, where industrial development is still in its infancy, and as the hon. member rightly pointed out, the water and the infra-structure are there. There must consequently, in the course of time, be the necessary encouragement in order to obtain industries there. But the United Party&#x2019;s big objection is this. When we speak of healthy, balanced economic development, of decentralized industrial development, we would like to see the development taking place throughout the Cape, but we are crossing swords with the hon. members on the other side when steps are taken on the part of the State to restrict the present industrial complexes. That is the difference between ourselves and those hon. members.</p>

<p>For them to point out that decentralization is taking place on a large scale in Europe and England is not really quite correct, because we do not yet have such large industrial complexes in South Africa. We do not want to say that things cannot develop along those lines. Things are most probably moving that way, but what is wrong with a policy of letting the present industrial areas develop, and then artificially stimulating other underdeveloped areas&#x003F; That is the whole attitude of this side of the House. We do not want to cut the throats of the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage or the Witwatersrand complexes, just for the sake of stimulating something else somewhere else again. That is why we think that the industrial development of the under-developed areas can go hand in hand, without it being necessary to jeopardize the existing industrial complexes.</p>

<p>I want to make two pleas to the hon. the Minister to-day. My first plea relates to our existing industrial complexes in the Cape. We know that the Cape does not draw as much industrial development as, for example, Natal and the Transvaal. It is therefore necessary for us to stimulate industrial development artificially in the Cape. I once more want to make a friendly request to the hon. the Minister, since we asked him three years ago, when the Physical Planning Act was under discussion here, not to apply that Act to an area such as Port Elizabeth. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) did an excellent job of showing the hon. the Minister why he should not make the Act applicable there. We previously supposed that all industrial development based on Bantu labour would be able to continue there undisturbed, except for the application of the necessary influx control, which is something that differs altogether from placing restrictions on the economic development of the area. But now it appears to us as if, in the course of time, there will not be sufficient Coloured labour in this triangle, formed more or less by the Humansdorp-Colesberg-Fish-Kat lines. It is calculated that there are approximately 168,000 Coloureds in that area, with approximately 23,000 of them in Port Elizabeth. There is just a small handful that are not in Port Elizabeth. There is no unemployment at all among the Coloureds, but the Bantu in the area, who are increasing at a normal rate and cannot be sent back to the Bantu areas, are going to create a serious problem for us there in the course of time, as a result of unemployment.</p>

<p>Sir, why must such a situation develop&#x003F; According to my information, industrialists in that area, who apply for a permit under section 3 of the Physical Planning Act, do not receive one covering the permanent employment of those people. The permit is issued on a temporary basis. The industrial heads of Port Elizabeth are grateful to the hon. the Minister for granting them this concession, but what it amounts to is that they cannot plan for the future, because what industrialist is going to expand his factory, what entrepreneur is going to create a new industry, if they can only make use of temporary Bantu labour&#x003F; These people have no security as far as their labour is concerned, and they consequently cannot plan for the future. In the course of time this uncertainty will also engender a lack of confidence in this area.</p>

<p>This afternoon I should like to repeat the plea I made to the hon. the Minister three years ago. I want to assure him that we in Port Elizabeth are not employing non-white labour on such a scale that the entire numerical ratio among the races will be disrupted by it. My plea is therefore that the hon. the Minister should not make the Physical Planning Act applicable to that area, because the application of this Act to that area is restricting industrial development and discouraging future industrial heads, whom we would like to entice to that area, from establishing their industries there. Our plea to the hon. the Minister concerns the fact that, while he may give all the encouragement he likes to the border industries, he must please not restrict our present industrial areas. Under a United Party policy the border industry areas would also develop, because many of them are underdeveloped areas and because the one important factor of labour is present.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the hon. the Minister with my second plea. This is not a new idea either, and I have mentioned it previously. I want to associate myself with hon. members such as the hon. member for Mossel Bay and the hon. member for Namaqualand. They ask for planning and for possible expansion in their areas. The one matter that worries me greatly is that here in the middle of the Cape horseshoe, over and above an ailing agricultural industry, we have absolutely nothing of note in the form of industrial activity. I immediately want to concede to the hon. the Minister that a person surely cannot start something where there are no raw materials and potentials available. [Time expired.]</p>

<from><span class="col_5163-5164" refersTo="page_1139"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to devote a moment or two to what the hon. member for Newton Park said, and I want to tell him that the National Party&#x2019;s policy of the decentralization of industries represents no obstacles to the development of existing industrial complexes. The policy of this side of the House is a threefold one. We saw this in the report of the Water Commission, and then the Minister of Water Affairs also stated this: No unrealistic restrictions will be placed on the growth of existing industrial areas. Attention is definitely being given to the so-called under-developed areas, but it is also necessary to develop the border areas at probably a more rapid rate in the future. In the fourth place, too, the development of industries in the Bantu homelands will be stimulated. If we think of the development of the metropolitan areas and what danger uncontrolled development in those areas could constitute for our country&#x2019;s economy, then there is only one figure we need look at to realize what the problem attached to that is. To establish an infra-structure in an area with more than 200,000 inhabitants, it costs R400 per worker to absorb that worker. In an area where there are 30,000 people and where the infra-structure is being adapted, it costs approximately R130 to cope with one worker. It is logical therefore that we will spend this capital where it will be the most favourable for us to apply. With that I want to leave what the hon. member for Newton Park said and go on to another topic.</p>

<p>I want to add my voice to those of the hon. members who conveyed good wishes to the Minister and the Secretary. I also want to thank the former Minister and Secretary. I should also like to convey my gratitude to the Department of Planning for the co-operation which exists between that Department and the regional development associations. Now I should like to spend a few moments this afternoon on the Western Transvaal region, and the problems of that area. Perhaps it is necessary for us to tell the hon. the Minister what area we are talking about. The area includes the magisterial districts of Lichtenburg, Delareyville, Schweizer-Reneke, Christiana, Bloemhof, Oberholzer, Wolmaransstad, Marico, Potchefstroom, Klerksdorp and Ventersdorp. This is an area which has certain interests in common. This area covers approximately 24,000 square miles. It includes the Bantu homelands of that area. Approximately 200,000 Whites are living in that area, and are also economically active in that area. But what is extremely important is the fact that in that area approximately 800,000 Bantu of the Tswana ethnic group have established themselves. Then, too, there are 15,000 inhabitants of other race groups such as Coloureds, Indians, and so on, in that area. While we want to convey our gratitude to the Minister for the fact that R55,000 has been appropriated in the present Budget of the Department of Planning for these areas in order to get the infra-structure up to date for the establishment of border industries which are in the interests of that area and particularly, too, in the interests of those 800,000 Tswana who must be provided with work, we also want to point out that the latest figure indicates that the Tswana ethnic group totals 1,700,000 and that for the rest who are not living in this area, R3 million is being appropriated for the establishment of border industries. We want to admit, straightaway, and accept that attention must first be given to certain priorities. Our problem becomes more serious when it is remembered that this area is initially dependent on its agriculture. This area is one of the most important agricultural areas in South Africa. It produces 30 per cent of the total agricultural production of the Transvaal. I shall subsequently say a few words as far as agricultural activities are concerned. In that area we also have the Klerksdorp-Orkney-Stilfontein mining complex, and together with the Carletonville complex, this area is producing 28 per cent of the total gold production of South Africa, or 19 per cent of the total gold production of the entire free Western world.</p>

<p>We in that area have not remained inactive, but have also instituted our own investigations. Thanks to a grant of R18,000 from the National Council for Social Research we have already instituted investigations in that area, and the first report in this connection was made available last year. According to that report the Klerksdorp-Orkney-Stilfontein mining complex, subject to two conditions, i.e. that the increase in the cost of gold exploitation, as well as its price remains the same, has a future of only approximately 15 years. Now one can ask how this affects the border industry areas and agriculture in this part of the world. It is essential that the investment made in this area should not quite simply fade away. In fact, the Department of Planning itself realizes this. It must be borne in mind, however, that approximately R9 million worth of agricultural products which is being produced in the Western Transvaal, is being absorbed by these mining complexes. If a decrease in population takes place, tremendous problems will be experienced. We should like to see, and it could happen, that further possible mineral wealth in this area should be investigated. The iron ore found from Wolmaransstad almost as far as Potchefstroom, which links up with that of Sishen, fluorspar, salt, as well as other minerals of this area, could also be exploited. It may become a necessity. We should also like to see co-operation between this complex and the border industry areas in those Western parts of the Transvaal. This can only be done if our infra-structure is adjusted at one single point, i.e. by providing a railway network from north to south as well in that area and not only by having one which runs from east to west. We have the problem that the railway network is either Johannesburg orientated, or Kimberley orientated.</p>

<p>I want to postulate very briefly that there is only one problem in this whole infra-structure, <span class="col_5165-5166" refersTo="page_1140"/>i.e. our water problem. I believe however that this area will have sufficient water available by making an adjustment in the White Paper in regard to the Bloemhof Dam, as well as the development of our dolomitic waters. Now the Department of Planning could probably with justification ask us what kind of industries can now be decentralized to that area. I have already mentioned what mineral resources there are which could be investigated, but it is also essential that we take note of the fact that 15 per cent of all tractor implements in South Africa are being used in this area. In this area as well 20 per cent of the total value of agricultural implements in South Africa is found. We think that, if decentralization has to take place, the type of industries dealing with agriculture and the manufacture of agricultural equipment would serve a far more practical purpose if they were transferred to the area in question. Other industries which could be transferred to that area are those which process foodstuffs. I do not have sufficient time at my disposal to mention all the possibilities in that connection, but it will also be necessary to take a look at this. As far as border areas and their proclamation in the Western Transvaal is concerned, we are not dealing with a consolidated Tswana homeland, but with a fragmented Tswana homeland. It will not be advisable for us to develop a border industry area at one place. We shall have to find more border industry areas. That is why I also want to make a specific plea for the proclamation of border industry areas on the southern side of the Tswana homelands, so that we can really utilize that Tswana labour economically; for border industry areas in the north cannot absorb the labour from the southern part of the Tswana homelands.

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree that the hon. member for Christiana has put up a very reasoned argument, indeed, for decentralization of industries. Like everybody else who sees the dangers of having a large concentration of African people who are unemployed, near the area where he happens to live, the hon. member has put up a good plea for the development of industry in the area that he represents. I do not think there is anyone in this House that would argue with him on that score. All of us are in favour of decentralization, provided it is done on an economic basis.</p>

<p>I stand up as a representative from the Witwatersrand. I ask that the Witwatersrand be not singled out for unfavourable treatment in this regard. The Witwatersrand has for years been the hub of industry in this country. For it now to suffer all the uncertainties of the Physical Planning Act for ideological reasons when the area has not yet developed beyond the &#x2018;uncontrolled metropolitan proportions&#x2019;, mentioned by the hon. member for Christiana, is ridiculous. We, too, are going to have to cope with a very serious unemployment problem as regards the existing African population and its natural increase, unless the hon. the Minister is reasonable in the demands to industrialists both to extend existing industries in that area and to develop new industries.</p>

<p>As has already been said, this is a new Minister in the Department. I join with other members in wishing him well in his new portfolio. I also wish very strongly that we are going to have a more reasonable attitude from this hon. Minister in regard to the administration of the Physical Planning Act. If I may at this stage, I also wish to take the opportunity of asking for a very reasonable attitude to be adopted as far as the deproclamation of existing group areas is concerned. This matter causes an enormous amount of difficulty for people who have been uprooted once, like the Coloured people. I give Ceres as an example. I know that has been satisfactorily resolved, but it took nearly a year so to do. Another example is the Indian people of Ladysmith who, having been uprooted once and having attempted to re-establish a proper community in the new area, suddenly found themselves faced with the prospect of deproclamation. I sincerely hope that this sort of thing is going to take place as little as possible in the future. It has a terrible effect on the non-White population, who have become very insecure. Therefore, I plead with the hon. the Minister to administer the Physical Planning Act very generously, because this, too, leads to enormous insecurity among industrialists and entrepreneurs who wish to develop existing industrial areas.</p>

<p>I want to return to the interesting question of the census. The figures were published over the week-end and given to this House during Friday&#x2019;s debate. I want to say at once, as someone who has done a little statistics in the past, that I have no doubt that the probable error in these census returns is pretty high. I should not like to have been one of the statisticians attempting to achieve some form of accurate results from the statistics. I have various reasons for saying this. I shall give one example only. We do not, of course, have the figure for the number of Africans in the urban areas. We only have the overall figure of the number of Africans in the white areas. That includes white rural areas as well as white urban areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, it is always &#x201C;so-called&#x201D;. The hon. member the other day mentioned a point I have often made, namely that there is no such thing as a magisterial area in which the Whites are not outnumbered by non-Whites in some or other proportion. Any way, we do not know how many Africans there are in the so-called white urban areas. Sir, I must put it to you that it is highly unlikely that the thousands upon thousands of Africans who are illegally in the towns are going to stand up to be counted on census night. <span class="col_5167-5168" refersTo="page_1141"/>Whatever figure finally emerges in regard to the number of Africans in the &#x201C;White&#x201D; towns, it is highly unlikely that it will be anything near the actual figure.</p>

<p>There are some other interesting factors which emerge from the figures that we have. The first is that South Africa is growing steadily less white. Indeed, according to the statistics, it has in 1970 reached an all-time low. If one examines the figures for 1951, one finds that the white population constituted 20.9 per cent of the total population. In 1961 it was 19.3 per cent and in 1970 it was 17.7 per cent, according to the latest figures. The African population, on the other hand, has reached an all-time high, as far as percentage of population is concerned. In 1951 it was 67.6 per cent. In 1960 it was 68.3 per cent and in 1970 it was 70 per cent of the total population. There is not very much of a change in Coloured population. It ranges from 8.7 per cent in 1951, to 9.4 per cent in 1960, to 9.3 per cent in 1970. The Asians are almost consistent. They numbered 2.9 per cent in 1951, 3 per cent in 1960 and 3 per cent in 1970. I think it is very interesting to find that the Whites have reached an all-time low, percentage wise, whereas the Africans have reached an all-time high. I should like to put it to the hon. the Minister that one of the reasons why the African population is now increasing at something like 3.63 per cent per annum, which is a higher rate than ever before, is very probably due to the Government&#x2019;s own policy. The interesting thing is that the migatory labour system practically guarantees a baby a year in the homelands. It is absolutely natural that when a man goes home for a couple of weeks a year to see his wife, a baby will result. I think hon. members will admit that fact.</p>

<p>I know the facts of life. The hon. the Minister ought to know them too. The fact that the men are in the urban areas without their wives, also guarantees that a high percentage of illegitimate children will be borne in those urban areas. Instead of having properly planned families in a stable rural peasantry and stable urban families, with even higher standards of living, which will bring about a rational population increase, we are experiencing what is known as a population explosion among the African people. This is due entirely to the Government&#x2019;s own policy.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, let us have a look at the number of Africans in the white areas. Here the Minister has taken some pleasure out of the fact that the total percentage increase in the homelands is 68.7 per cent. I want to know how that figure was arrived at. Does this include Africans outside the homelands living as contract and migratory workers in the urban areas&#x003F;</p>

<p>Yes, so it is a <i>de facto</i> population. I am very interested to hear that.</p>

<p>I want to look up the total white population increase. There was an increase of something 700,000. Sir, I put it to you that half of this increase was probably due to immigration over the ten year period. I can only work the exact figures out for six years, but about half the increase during that period is probably due to immigration. I am talking now from the Government&#x2019;s point of view, because I do not care about these overall ratio, but if this is so and if I am correct, it seems to me that it is going to be impossible to adjust the adverse balance by means of white immigration. We are going to need something like 95,000 immigrants per year, even to carry out what I call a holding operation, in order to maintain the existing percentage of Whites in the total population at 17.7 per cent.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say that we are probably all asking the wrong questions as a result of the census.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to leave the hon. member for Houghton in the competent hands of the hon. the Minister. I want to express my sincere appreciation to the hon. the Minister and the Department of Planning for the wonderful progress which has been made in the short period of time of approximately five to six years. If one considers what has been established in a field where there was little or nothing before, and the variety of planning instruments which have been created for the proper handling of development, and for the control over the utilization of our scarce resources and in regard to the implementation of Government policy, it not only inspired confidence, but also fine and great expectations for the future. Still it is ironic that it is in fact expectations, misplaced expectations, which are often aroused by the United Party in order to place the good work of this Department in a poor light and to try to belittle it. Since the origin of this Department it has always been found that certain people who do not fully understand the function of this Department, or rather do not want to understand it, are very fond of presenting it as a kind of wonder Department, with which nothing less than immediate utopia must be established. Surely that is not the case, and it is also understandable that it cannot be the case. It is understandable if we bear in mind that this Department does not have a development task, but is there to measure off the foundations on which development can take place and flourish. It is also understandable if we bear in mind that planning takes place for the sake of mankind with its fickle needs and preferences. Even if all aspects, including the human or social aspects, are taken into account in the planning process, and even if all disciplines are involved in this, one will nevertheless find that one is dealing with human beings and their preferences and the circumstances which they create for themselves, which are continually changing, the more so in this technological age which contributes to make human beings round and shapeless. It is no wonder therefore that this Department is often accorded no credit for the good work it is doing. Seen against this background, it is clear that the value of the work of the Department must not be measured only against concrete results, but quite often and far rather against the alternative. What will the result be, what will this country look like in ten, twenty years time without the direction-giving and co-ordinating work of a national planning body&#x003F; The Government is deserving of every praise for having taken the first step along this road, for the way in which it has tackled this task, and for the way in Which it is carrying it out. The Opposition can say what it likes&#x2014;the Department is and remains an instrument in the hands of the Government to implement its policy. In fact, there are few things which give a better indication of the advanced state of a nation than the way in which it is developing its natural resources, controlling the utilization thereof, and the way in which it is planning its activities.</p>

<p>I want to touch upon another aspect, however, namely regional planning. There is a tendency, not only among us, but in many countries of the world that people of the various regions of a country would like to be associated and identified with the development and increased prosperity of the country. They should like to share to a greater extent in the prosperity of the country, arising out of the development of its national assets. This desire &#x2014;and it is a quite natural desire&#x2014;results in pressure being exercised on Governments to effect, by means of Governmental measures, a more equal geographic distribution of the economic development of the country. What they usually have in mind here is the establishment of industries because it is this sector which has the greatest growth potential, and because industries need not necessarily be bound to one place. There is probably no one in this Council Chamber who would not like to see a growth point in every town. But from the nature of the case this is not possible. What regions desire cannot always be accomplished. It is for example impracticable to think at this stage already of the possibility of offering the economic development programme on a regional basis. Such a programme, drawn on a national basis, can be projected with reasonably accuracy, but in a country like South Africa the economic development of specific regions cannot at this stage be anticipated with sufficient certainty. Should this be done, we would be running the risk of an infra-structure, which has been made available at great expense, perhaps remaining unutilized.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the interests which exists to-day in the development of the country is to be welcomed&#x2014;it is very necessary and must be retained. Of course we cannot remain cold and indifferent to any development consciousness which may reveal itself. There are a number of regional development associations in the country, many of which are however, functioning on an unorganized basis and in an atmosphere of uncertainty. Nevertheless they are doing excellent work, particularly in so far as they are making our people think and are making them development-conscious. Unfortunately they are finding it difficult to remain in existence and to make positive contributions owing to a lack of leadership. We find nevertheless that these associations do good work as soon as they are supported by outside bodies&#x2014;for example by the research institutes of universities. We are committed to giving the various regions of the country the necessary guidance, and stimulating them to suitable development in accordance with their innate potential. I say &#x201C;suitable development&#x201D; because one must not lose sight of the fact that development does not necessarily comprise economic development only. There are <span class="col_5171-5172" refersTo="page_1143"/>many other spheres in which development can to good effect be stimulated.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the large number of regional studies which have already been launched with the aid of outside bodies, but I still wonder whether it is not time regional planning was incorporated on a sound scientific basis in the framework of our planning strategy, and greater clarity in regard to the nature and extent thereof were obtained.</p>

<p>I too should like to deal with the economic and physical aspects of planning, very much on the same lines, therefore, as the hon. member who just resumed his seat. With physical planning, I believe, we should also produce evidence of planning for co-ordination and not for chaos and confusion. Let me illustrate what I mean by referring to a small village situated between East London and King William&#x2019;s Town, i.e. Berlin. The inhabitants are served by a village management board. Only recently Dr. Raubenheimer came there to open the Berlin industrial complex, and what a very pleasant and happy occasion it was. It so happens that Berlin now falls within the municipality of East London. This is well and good but, on the other hand, Berlin still falls within the magisterial district of King William&#x2019;s Town. Thus, in so far as municipal rates and matters like these are concerned, Berlin has to work with East London whilst in so far as divisional council rates, road rates, etcetera, are concerned, it has to work with King William&#x2019;s Town. I feel that this is eventually going to cause confusion not only with the local inhabitants but also with the local authorities concerned. I mention this just to highlight the fact that we have this type of problem in our planning where we develop depressed areas into large industrial complexes.</p>

<p>There is another point I am worried about. It is being rumoured that that Iscor, in order to achieve the large ore traffic over the proposed Sishen/Saldanha Bay line has put forward a proposal that a fourth Iscor be erected not in the Eastern Cape, as we have all been anticipating, but in the Saldanha Bay area.</p>

<p>We know that the policy of this Government is based on the separation of the Bantu from the white areas, a policy which, so the recent census has proved, is not succeeding. Nevertheless it remains the policy of the Government. To achieve this, border industries and industries within the reserves must be developed. With this in view I cannot believe that Saldanha could be worse situated for a large industry such as a fourth Iscor. Therefore the obvious place to build the fourth Iscor is in the Eastern Cape. We have the largest natural concentration of Bantu in South Africa in that particular area. I know of no area where we have a larger concentration of Bantu and, what is more, the Bantu to-day have already proved to us their remarkable adaptability to industry, that they are adaptable to border industries and the development there of. Not only have we a large concentration of Bantu labour in the Eastern Cape, but we have also unlimited water supplies. We have coal resources there, too, and, what is more, we can produce all the power necessary.</p>

<p>Another important factor, too, in the Eastern Cape, particularly Port Elizabeth&#x2014;and East London is not lagging far behind&#x2014;is that we are producing more motor vehicles there than anywhere else in South Africa. This alone is a very important industry and in time we will export motor vehicles as well. This is going to be a very important industry when we export motor vehicles to the outside world. Our motor vehicle industry is not situated in the hinterland where high transport costs are involved, but it is very conveniently situated at the coast. We can therefore compete on the world market and we will compete on the world market in the very near future, particularly in regard to motor vehicle production. Therefore I believe that while we are planning for the future, we should bear this in mind. I know that the fourth Iscor is something we can possibly look forward to in five or ten years&#x2019; time, but because rumours are rife in the Eastern Cape that Iscor wants to establish the fourth Iscor in the Saldanha Bay area, I want to say that it is imperative that it should be established in the Eastern Cape and possibly in the Border area. I appreciate that the hon. the Minister, knowing that area well and representing a constituency of the Eastern Cape, will give this matter his serious and sympathetic consideration, but I want to ask him to go a little further and to give it his support as well. Let us think on these lines. It is something which is very important and very urgent and something which, if we can establish it in the right area, will save us a lot of unnecessary moving of labour around the country. The water, the labour and the power are there in the Eastern Cape and, as I say, we have a large motor industry too, which could benefit from the establishment of the fourth Iscor in that particular area.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>I was really very pleased to hear from the hon. member for East London (North) that we must stop moving labour around in this country. He said the labour is there; why do we not move the factories to the labour&#x003F; I want to congratulate him on that statement. It seems to me the hon. member supports this policy of ours and I hope the Minister will therefore help him to get what he wants there in his area.</p>

<p>In the first place I also want to convey my congratulations to the hon. the Minister on his appointment to this portfolio, as well as the new Secretary of the Department. While doing so, I want to address a major request to him in regard to a matter with which we have been struggling for a long time in Pietersburg, which is a border industry area. I know that what I am going to request is a difficult thing and he will perhaps have to call in the assistance of the hon. the Minister of Economic <span class="col_5173-5174" refersTo="page_1144"/>Affairs, and between the two of them they will have to storm or surround the Minister of Transport in order to solve this problem for us. The Department and the Permanent Committee is very aware of this matter, and I want to mention it again here. The position is that the local Road Transport Council grants exemption to industrialists to transport their own products within a radius of 30 miles. If the same concession were granted to a manufacturer in a place like Pretoria or Johannesburg with a high density of population, then there is within a radius of 30 miles many points where he can sell his wares. But take an area like Pietersburg, which is a border industry area. You have the town itself and then you have the tremendous expanse of the Northern Transvaal. The concession to sell their products within a radius of 30 miles means virtually nothing to these people. They can only sell their products in the towns, and that is about all. They are bound to this regulation; they are restricted to 30 miles, and if they apply to the Road Transport Council for wider exemption, they are informed that the first people who will be up in arms about this is the Railways because they will then be competing with the Railways. Sir, I am requesting that this matter be taken up by the Department of Planning, and that the Department of Economic Affairs be drawn into this matter as well, because our problem there is that the manufacturer, if he is limited to a radius of 30 miles, can sell virtually nothing. We are therefore asking that industrialists in that area be given a permit to transport their own products within a radius of at least 120 miles as the crow flies. This will enable them to transport their products to places like Phalaborwa, Louis Trichardt and Messina. They can also enter the Bantu areas where all the shops are situated to sell their wares there. Sir, there are certain other people who have exemption to bring their goods over the borders and to sell them. I have nothing against this, but I do think that this is absolutely unequal competition against us.</p>

<p>Sir, I just want to return to something which the hon. member for Mooi River said here. He referred to a speech which I made during the Budget debate, and at this stage I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Langlaagte who advocated economic development programmes for the Bantu homeland areas. With reference to that the hon. member for Mooi River then discussed development programmes for Bantustans, as he calls the homelands. In the first instance I want to say that I do not know why we should refer to the Bantu homelands as &#x201C;Bantustans&#x201D;. I do not know why the Pakistand connotation should be dragged in here; I regard it in a measure as an insult and a humiliation to the Bantu nations in those homelands. We ought to speak of Bantu homelands when we refer to Zululand, Xhosaland, Vendaland, etc. In the first instance I want to say to the hon. member for Mooi River that he got the wrong impression about what I said. All I said was that where one had a demarcated area, a people within that area, then the next best logical step, after that area has obtained political content, was to give it economic content. Owing to the political content the area has, one already has a budget which has been drawn up. Within that demarcated area there are a certain number of people with earnings. All that should be done is to make a survey of the area&#x2019;s primary product and of its earnings, wherever they may come from, and then the gross national product can be determined. After one has determined this, and after a full survey of its population has been made, then a growth rate can be worked out for it taking into account its population growth as well as its natural resources and potential. It is very clear that the growth rate will differ from one Bantu homeland to another, owing to circumstances. But this is a beginning. In this way the Bantu homeland is then set on the road to economic realization which it can only obtain after it has obtained political content. This ties in with what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said, i.e. that economic viability is not a pre-requisite for future political development. Economic development and realization content only come after that. That is all I said and I hope the hon. member will understand it.</p>

<p>Now I want to return to what the hon. member for Hillbrow said. He made a very strange speech this afternoon. He tried to explain his case with a great outpouring of words. In fact, he kiked up a dust cloud of words. I really could not discover what his criticism was aimed at. In the end it appeared as if he was in actual fact criticizing only the Physical Planning Act. Then he made the statement that industries were being established which are not economic. He made general statements, but did not mention one specific factory which had been established on an uneconomic basis. But I want to say that I am of the opinion that he is quite wrong. Can that hon. member show us where these uneconomic industrial development areas are&#x003F; It is, after all, an accepted fact that what has already been done, is that the factory has been moved to where the labour is. Ach. that hon. member who is shaking his head understands nothing about this. If the labour from the Lebowa homeland had to be moved to Benoni, it would after all cost a great deal of money to establish the labour there, but it costs the same to move the factory thence. Only labour intensive factories are being moved. This is all it comprises. It is cheaper to establish a factory in a place like Pietersburg for example. Land is cheaper. Many other things are cheaper, but the ultimate economic costs for the country are the same. Hon. members on that side of the House must show us precisely where factories have been established on an uneconomic basis in the border areas. After all. an industrialist will not establish himself in an <span class="col_5175-5176" refersTo="page_1145"/>area where he cannot sell his products.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow really did not say anything this afternoon, although he tried to state his case with a great outpouring of words. What happened to him is what happened to the United Party in this session. They came here with a great clamour. They came, to use his own words, with a massive optical illusion of progress. But what has happened now&#x003F; Everything has exploded in their face. They came forward here with a great attack on the manpower shortage. They said that we were going to experience a recession. They said that there had been a decrease in investment in the manufacturing industry. But what happened then&#x003F; When the quarterly report appeared, it became clear that there had been an upsurge in the economy and that there was no recession. [Interjections.] Of course it is true. The figures indicate it. The decrease in investment in the manufacturing industry was not attributable to the Physical Planning Act. They also quoted the opinion poll of the Bureau for Economic Affairs, which was not representative, as they themselves have admitted. The decrease in investments in the manufacturing industry is attributable to the shortage of capital and the high rates of interest. That is the only reason. This story also blew up in their faces. They then came forward with the manpower shortage and their labour policy attack, but this also exploded. The <i>Financial Mail</i> is a newspaper which is sympathetic to them, and not to us, and even in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of last week it was written: &#x201C;We want the answers&#x201D;. They are still asking that side of the House to say how the labour shortage will be solved according to their policy. The only party which has an alternative policy and which will be able to do this is the party of the hon. member for Houghton. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have as much right to believe that as I have to believe the hon. member&#x2019;s arguments.</p>

<p>I want to deal with something different, the planning of group areas on a more general basis than I did when I first spoke. The planning of group areas is the task of a Solomon and I wonder whether we in this House are able to carry it out. The world is growing smaller and populations are growing bigger and bigger. Cities are thrusting skywards and the population explosion is a problem we all have to face. Figures reveal that in the 17th century there were 500 million people on earth. In 1900 there were 906 million people on earth and in 1960 there were 3 billion more. Pressures are being brought to bear on us as never before. Housing will have to be undertaken and renewal schemes are necessary and in doing this it is inevitable that we will have to uproot certain communities. We are going to have to uproot communities and resettle them elsewhere and few of us are going to escape. Many can in fact benefit if we plan the future correctly.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House are not opposed to group areas, but what we are opposed to is the methods followed in carrying out this policy. This is a highly complicated human problem and we suggest that the methods used so far with the planning of group areas and the implementation thereof are not justified. I had the experience when a Coloured man told me that he lived in a very select area of Cape Town and that he is still living there. When I asked him whether he was really settled he said that he cannot really feel settled in that area because it is so nice that he is quite sure that the Department will take him away from there. The hon. members on my left may mutter, but because of the planning of our group areas this is the feeling these people have, namely that we are inclined to take the best for ourselves. If this is so, I suggest that we are not planning as we should. We are not taking the people affected along with us. If we plan properly we could earn the goodwill of the people that we are forced to move in many instances.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister how much investigation goes into the planning of group areas. How much investigation does the Group Areas Board do&#x003F; For instance, does it plan the replacement of businesses in a new group area properly&#x003F; We had the experience in certain towns in Natal that no fewer than 209 notices to vacatie existing businesses have been given, but that, at the same time, provision for only 174 alternative places of business had been made. I would suggest that this is bad planning. It is not only bad planning, but it is also unjust and inhuman. Another thing that causes concern is the delays by the Department of Planning in declaring group areas. The resultant delays with the freezing of certain areas bring about slum conditions in those areas, because the people affected cannot spend money on improving their properties. They dare not spend any money. As a result the value of the areas depreciates. Too often when a new area is planned people are moved into this area and nothing more is done than transplant existing slum conditions. The new areas planned in the last few years will show on examination that they are rapidly deteriorating into slums. This is happening because of the housing shortage. When an area is planned how much provision is made for housing in the new area&#x003F; The Minister may say that this is the function of another Department. I would suggest that it is, in fact <span class="col_5177-5178" refersTo="page_1146"/>the function of the Group Areas Board, when they are planning and drawing lines and circles round different areas for different population groups. In 1969 in Durban alone, the number of people on the waiting list for Indian and Coloured housing was estimated at 123,000. There is a shortage of housing which has existed almost since the middle thirties. There are all sorts of factors and people may be blamed for the shortage of housing. It is gradually getting worse, because the Department seems anxious to move people before it has even caught up on the existing backlog. I would say to the Government that, before people are moved under the Group Areas Act, at least let us catch up. Let the local authorities catch up on the existing backlog. Unless they slow down in this tempo they have created, we will always have a shortage of housing. It is increasing by steadily mounting figures. While the shortage of housing becomes a steadily mounting figure, slum conditions are becoming aggravated.</p>

<p>Crime in these new resettlement areas is becoming a problem, because we have destroyed the community centres and community life that have existed for many generations. We have uprooted people and put them in new areas. As I have said before, this is bound to happen with the population explosion. In not all instances can we claim to have moved people who should have been moved. I would suggest that we must consider the method by which we are moving them and the overcrowding that is taking place. One could say that there is overcrowding in District 6 or in certain parts of Durban. That is perfectly true. But the very areas to which they have been moved, are overcrowded within weeks after they have moved in. As a result, crime is on the rise in these communities to an extent which it has not reached before. Drug addiction is something that is increasing in these communities, as well as prostitution. These are problems which we are creating, I suggest, by the improper planning in these new areas.</p>

<p>What, for instance, happens with regard to the distances that people will have to travel to work from the new areas to which they have been sent&#x003F; In some instances, the distances are quite considerable. This, in turn, has an effect of increasing the amount of fares that people have to pay to go to work. It means that their budget is affected and that there is less food in that community. In fact, if one was to look at the figures for some of these areas, one would find that more people are living below the poverty datum line today in the new areas than they were in the previous area, in perhaps a worse house or in worse conditions. This is what we are doing by sending people a long way from their work points. We are not only doing this and taxing their capability, but we are sapping their energies just when we need them most in this country where we have a shortage of labour. We are sapping their energies, because they I have such long distances to travel to and from work.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>In many instances the distances are 20 miles. To the hon. member in his Cadillac or Mercedes 20 miles may mean nothing, but it means a lot to a person who has to catch a bus at 4 o&#x2019;clock in the morning and pay 20 cents in each direction. This is not uncommon; it does happen. If the man is only earning something like a maximum of R50 or R60 per month, 40 cents a day is quite an amount. I am not making a political issue of this matter. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that proper planning can avoid this situation. Proper planning can create goodwill. But if the hon. member would like to make a political issue of it, I will certainly do so as well. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that this lack of proper planning has created and increased poverty among the lower classes. How much planning, for instance, is done by the Group Areas Board in providing schools and churches&#x003F; Community life, instead of being resettled in these new areas, is becoming unsettled. This social disorganization is something that we are going to rue. As the crime rate increases, we are going to need more police to keep it under control. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not follow up on what the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, said in his speech. The hon. the Minister will probably reply to his arguments. Our Government has always thought big, but we could never have imagined that South Africa would develop to such an extent as it did. Great developments have taken place during the past decade in particular. In addition, the fact that we are a multi-national country is never kept in mind or noted. We have always regarded ourselves as a small country with a small population, and that we are subservient to other countries. It was never thought that South Africa would develop as it did in fact develop. However, this Government made provision for that development. For that reason a special Department for this purpose was established. This was necessary owing to the rapidly growing development of our country. An even more imperative reason for this was in fact the growth of our various population groups. According to Government policy there must be a Department to settle the various population groups and to undertake planning in that respect. As a result of the important work of this Department it is now possible to live in this country with confidence and satisfaction. Sir, if we take into account the particulars of the census survey which the Minister furnished this House with last week, we realize that he, with all his comprehensive activities, has performed a task of great magnitude for the future. Short-term planning costs this country <span class="col_5179-5180" refersTo="page_1147"/>dearly. It is not necessary to reproach any previous government, but if we were to neglect our duty, we would have to take the blame. For that reason we must thank the Prime Minister for this great step in the right direction which he has taken to ensure South Africa&#x2019;s progress. The Department of Planning has already made good progress under the Ministership of the hon. Dr. De Wet. We are grateful for the important work which he has already performed. I also want to express our gratitude towards the former Secretary, Mr. Van Niekerk, who retired recently. We know that he made a major contribution in this connection. I also want to convey our congratulations to Dr. Rautenbach, who succeeded him. There is a major task awaiting him, but we who know him, are convinced that he is equal to it. As a person who has known the hon. the Minister of Planning for many years, I am convinced that he will make a great success of this portfolio. As a result of his importance, many eyes are turning to this Department. It will be necessary for the hon. the Minister to replan what was incorrectly planned in the past. It is possible that such replanning can take place at the expense of some other person. This has already happened in one of the towns in my constituency. I believe that the hon. the Minister will allow any replanning to take place with the greatest circumspection so that already settled people will not be prejudiced by this and people will be resettled with the least inconvenience.</p>

<p>Great development is taking place in my constituency. The surface area which is being developed there is perhaps the largest in the Republic. There is, <i>inter alia,</i> the development of the Orange River project at the confluence of the Vaal and Orange Rivers, above Prieska. According to surveys a surface area of approximately 30,000 morgen is being developed there, and in the Lower Orange River, an even larger area. The entire Northern Cape, with its iron ore, manganese, asbestos, copper and diamond mines, and at least eight different related minerals, such as tiger&#x2019;s eye for example. are being mined. There are 16 varieties of tiger&#x2019;s eye stones. These minerals are being mined and exported, but next year raw material will no longer be exported. The processing of these variations must also take place in the vicinity. Then, I should like to see thorough attention in this direction being given to places such as Kuruman, Sishen, Postmasburg, Upington, Griekwastad, Nie-kerkhoop, Groblershoop, Marydale, Prieska, Carnarvon, Kenhardt and Namaqualand. These areas have a wonderful capacity and potential which has to be developed. Real attention is necessary here. Now is the time to do so, not later. At Postmasburg and Prieska a large number of industrial areas are being established. A new town which is situated in my area is under construction near the mines. There are also expansions at Prieska. Provision has to be made for water, power, railway communications and roads. Since this region will probably have to carry through traffic from Cape town to Johannesburg as well, which will bring great alleviation for the already overloaded and heavy traffic on the old existing Beaufort-West-Kimberley route, a major and specific task in this respect will have to be performed by the hon. the Minister of Planning. With the great development of that area a new era has dawned for the northern and western Cape areas. The Government, the State, must utilize these opportunities to the full, and the Department of Planning must do its very best to develop this area to the benefit of the community in those parts which I mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not going to follow up on what the hon. member for Prieska said in regard to his pleas for his particular area. The only remark I want to make in regard to the hon. member&#x2019;s pleas, is that I noticed that nine speakers have already, during the course of the afternoon, used the first four or five minutes of their turns to speak to thank the former Minister of Planning and his Secretary for what they have done and to congratulate this Minister on his appointment as such. If a calculation were to be made of what the debates in this House costs the country per hour, then a stupendous amount of money is being spent just on the time taken up in thanking and congratulating the Minister. I do not want to allege with this that a person should not congratulate a new Minister. What I am in fact alleging is that it is not necessary for every member to spend so much time on it. In passing I also to express our gratitude towards the former Secretary; and welcome and express our appreciation of the present Secretary. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>We have been hearing repeatedly this afternoon about our multi-national country and the decentralization of industries, to which the United Party is allegedly so opposed. I want to put a direct question to any of the members on the opposite side of the House. When has any person on this side of the House made a plea against the decentralization of industries&#x003F; In fact, what Government began with the decentralization of industries&#x003F; A start was made with the decentralization of industries before this Government came into office. It was done because it is a sound system to prevent industries from becoming too concentrated.</p>

<p>It is not only being done in the Transkei. Good Hope Textiles is there as a monument to the development under the previous Government, and not this Government. This is true for the simple reason, which has been repeatedly mentioned this afternoon, i.e. that where the labour, power and land is, is also the best place for the industry.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I was dealing with that. We have heard pleas to the effect that industries must be taken to where the labour is. But what is the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x003F; They move labour to the Bantu areas, and then follow up with the industries. This is the policy of this Government. They do not leave the labour where it is and establish the industries there. They move the labour away to the Bantu area and then follow up with the industries, and then they keep on talking about a multi-national country. They say that there are Bantu peoples, and that this is a multi-national country. There is a large Coloured population of 2 million, and if somebody wants to tell me that they are a nation on the basis of the fact they are all of the same origin and are orientated it would be a joke. A multi-national country without territory for the people, is nothing. A multi-national country with a white population and a Coloured population living together, while areas are being allocated to the Bantu, with the industries then having to be taken to one or the other, is nonsense. Nobody on this side of the House has ever objected to an industry being established in an area where decentralization is economic, and it is no use telling me, Sir, that we of the Eastern Cape are pleading for decentralization of industries as border area development. There is nowhere a more naturally geographic area where industries ought to be established than an area which lies like a strip, a corridor, between two Bantu reserves, which have always been there in our history, and where labour water and power is in abundant supply. Surely it speaks for itself that this is the best method of decentralization and we have never spoken against this. What we are talking about is to establish an industry in an area uneconomically because you move the labour thence and then you have to move the industries thence as well and you must take the Whites and move them to the borders of the Bantu area. That is what we are opposed to.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with another aspect and I hope I shall have the attention of the Minister in this regard. It relates to the establishment of more growth points for this great hinterland of ours, away from the cities and away from the areas where the industries are at present, a hinterland which is deteriorating owing to the fact that the towns are small, where the schools are declining because the childen are leaving, and the business firms are declining because the people are no longer buying there. Then I should like to make a plea to the Minister that he should with the greatest expedition give us an indication&#x2014;not a master plan because it is not possible in terms of what the hon. member for Langlaagte advocated here to have a blue print or master plan for the entire country if one does not even know where some of the borders of the areas which you are talking about are. But it behoves us in this country at this stage, since there is tremendous industrial development and large concentrations, to get a maximum of growth points there where there is an abundant supply of labour, regardless of what kind it is&#x2014;whether it is Coloured or Bantu labour&#x2014;in those areas which are isolated from the present growth rates and the present concentrations, so that a tremendous effort can be made to give those areas growth points so that the population can remain there and so that they can be supplied with work for the large non-white population in that area. The aim should be to divide the country into areas and then to provide each area with a growth point. It will not be possible for us to make each little town a growth point, but if we did this in terms of areas which include a few towns or districts, then the efforts to develop such a growthpoint will be rewarded and people will have confidence in such a growth point. We must make certain that what has been happening to so many of our small towns for several years now does not happen; and the same applies to every province, so much so that the smaller towns are remaining stagnant or are deteriorating because it does not seem as if there is going to be a growth point there and it does not seem to be worthwhile anymore, the business undertakings cannot make a living there, and the entire social structure is deteriorating. I want to make a special appeal to the Minister and to the Department of Planning, which in fact is the only Department in this country at this stage which is able to undertake this planning to give attention to this matter and then to work out a regional plan for the entire country, and announce this as soon as possible. The hon. member for East London (City) made a plea here as far as the next Iscor or the next state undertaking is concerned, which in terms of the properties which have already been purchased and the large area which has already been purchased in East London, could give an indication of what the State and the Department intends doing with that, so that this continual speculation in this connection can come to an end, and so that the developers will know precisely where, when and how. I realize it is not always easy to say when, but if a person knows that there is future planning over a period for a certain area or for certain industries or for a group of industries, and that there is planning to the effect that they will go to certain areas, it would eliminate a great deal of unnecessary speculation, and it would give purpose to the planning. I want to make a special appeal in this connection, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will give this matter his serious attention.</p>

<p>If the hon. member wants me to give him a lecture on the things the United Party has accepted. I shall do so after I have finished speaking. In the short while I have been here in this House, I saw that the United Party has experienced quite a number of shocks, but the two most important I experienced, was Klip River and secondly the statistics which the hon. the Minister disclosed. Sir, these were two lethal blows. Since then hon. members opposite have risen to their feet here and put forward irrelevant arguments to try to indicate that these statistics do not prove that the Government&#x2019;s policy is succeeding. But they did not succeed in that. We must go into these statistics which the hon. the Minister submitted a little further, and then we will as this stage already be able to make a few important conclusions with great certainty.</p>

<p>In any specific area any increase in the population there is attributable to two things only. The one is the natural increase of the population and the second is migration. The total Bantu population of South Africa increased from 10.9 million to 14.9 million, or 36 per cent. This is the natural increase in the Bantu population in South Africa. If we now look at the natural increase in the Bantu population in the homelands, it should also be 36 per cent, because scientists in South Africa accept that the increase of Bantu in the homelands and in the white areas is the same. If the natural increase in the number of Bantu in the homelands was 36 per cent, then the increase in the number of Bantu in the homelands between 1960 and 1970, of 4.1 million to 5.6 million, was as a result of natural increase, but the actual number of Bantu in the homelands in 1970 was 1.3 million more than the increase for which the natural increase was responsible. If we look at the white areas and apply the same principle there, if we look at what the natural increase there was, we see that in 1960 the Bantu population totalled 6.8 million. If the natural increase had also been 36 per cent, then the Bantu population in the white area in 1970 should have totalled 9.3 million, but it is not that figure; it is 8 million. In other words, it is 1.3 million less than the actual figure. That 1.3 million can only be attributed to one factor, and that is the removal which took place.</p>

<p>Sir, this was not always the case; prior to 1960 the picture was just the opposite. Then Bantu in the white areas were growing more rapidly than the Bantu in the homelands. Sir, I want to read out to you what was said by Dr. Smit, the chief research worker of the Africa institute in the magazine <i>Aardrykskunde.</i> He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If it is accepted that the increase in the number of Natives in the Bantu homelands is the same as that of the total Bantu population, then the abovementioned charts and further analysis of the statistics reflects a considerable net immigration from the homelands.</block>

<p>This was between 1951 and 1960&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Between 1951 and 1960 there was estimated net emigration from the homelands of approximately 180,000 persons or an average of 20,000 persons per year.</block>

<p>This is what took place before 1960, but after 1960, we had this phenomenon that the populations of the homelands increased by an additional 1.3 million more than what the natural increase was, and this was as a result of the removal of Bantu from the white areas to the homelands.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to draw two conclusions from that. The first is that it is irrefutable proof that the Government&#x2019;s policy of planning, of decentralizations and of separate development is succeeding. The second conclusion, for which these figures are irrefutable proof, is the following: At the beginning of this Session still, the United Party asked us: &#x201C;What about the date, 1978&#x201D; when the influx from the homelands is going to be less than the outflow from the white areas&#x003F; Sir, these figures indicate that we have already reached that stage. In the year 1970 we have already advanced beyond 1978; what was envisaged to have taken place in 1978 is taking place now already.</p>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>It is true. But I want to make another point which is that these statistics which the Minister gave us of Bantu in the homelands, refer to Bantu who are permanently settled in the homelands. But <span class="col_5185-5186" refersTo="page_1150"/>we all know that from time to time there are Bantu who are temporarily absent from the homelands to come and work in the white areas. In this same study from which I have quoted, Dr. Smit estimated that 6 per cent of the total Bantu population was temporarily absent from the homelands and working in the white areas. If this is the case, and we add this to the 46 per cent who are at present permanently in the homelands, then more than half of the Bantu population are already in the homelands. Sir, the United Party have always tried to imply that the Government&#x2019;s policy is a dream policy and that it would never succeed. I maintain that the statistics disclosed by this census indicate that the Government&#x2019;s policy, even though we are still in the initial stage, is a tremendous success.</p>

<p>Sir, these statistics which the hon. the Miniter submitted here indicate that the United Party were wrong when they told us that the policy of the Government was contrary to economic laws and that it would not succeed. The particulars indicate that the opposite is taking place, i.e. that the policy of the Government is succeeding.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Hillbrow asked where these people were working and where they were living. But we must take a look at what is happening in the homelands. That hon. member does not know that 112 towns have already been laid out or are in the process of being laid out in the homelands. He does not know that 66 of those towns are occupied, and that in 1968 already, 550,000 people had been accommodated in those towns. This was not previously the case. If the Government had not carried out its policy, those people would not have been established in the homelands; those people would still have been in the white areas. The hon. member does not know that some of these Bantu returned to their chiefs with whom they have ties and that they established their families in the area of the chief. Then they come out alone and work in the white area. That is where those people were established. That is where those people are working. Hon. members on that side of the House are not aware of the development which is taking place in the homelands. The sale of cattle in the homelands increased in a matter of 14 years from R66,000 to more than R3 million. The land which is being cultivated, which is under irrigation, fibre crops and forestry, not only doubled, but trebled and quadrupled. This created avenues of employment. This is where these people have been absorbed. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I now have to reply to this debate, I want to thank hon. members on both sides of this House most sincerely for the discussion we had here this afternoon. At times it was quite interesting to listen to what was being said. I believe that everyone who had something to say, whether or not I agree with what was said, raised that in this House because he had that on his heart and really believed in it. I accepted that in this spirit, and consequently I now want to thank everyone who participated in this debate. Furthermore, I should like to express my gratitude to everyone, on both sides of this House, who congratulated me on my appointment. To some extent I have to express my appreciation to the Opposition as well, because no particularly strong action was taken against me and because, so it would seem to me, they more or less tacitly adopted the attitude that in my first year they would not seek my blood so vehemently. I do not want to be unpleasant after the event, but even if they had done so, it would not really have made much difference to me.</p>

<p>Hon. members of this House will realize full well that I have been concerned with this Department only from July this year. For this reason there will be many questions and matters which can be raised and of which I shall have a vague idea but in which field I am not yet really an expert. Now I shall just say to hon. members as Mrs. Sannie van Niekerk said to me one evening at a meeting in Carnarvon. At that time she was the M.P. for Drakensberg and she was addressing a meeting at Carnarvon that evening. The people of Carnarvon had telephone me to invite me over to put questions to her. I want to add that at that time I had put questions to Messrs. Marais Steyn, Jack Connan, Dr. Louis Steenkamp and others, and that I had discovered at that time that if one had made a study with one&#x2019;s pen in one&#x2019;s hand of this Blue Book at home and knew it from back to front, one actually knew a little more than the average Member of Parliament who was addressing the meeting. I say this with respect to all hon. members. That evening I did not have much difficulty in putting questions to Mrs. Van Niekerk to which she could give no reply. When circumstances were at their most difficult for her, she asked me from the platform for my address. I replied that I could give her my address, but asked her why she wanted to have it. She said she would rather send me the replies to all the questions I had put to her. I should like to tell hon. members that if I do not reply fully to them this afternoon. I shall forward to them the replies to the questions they put to me.</p>

<p>I think I would prefer the hon. member&#x2019;s telephone number! Before <span class="col_5187-5188" refersTo="page_1151"/>attempting to reply to the questions of hon. members, I should like to address, for reasons about which I have perfect clarity in my own mind, a few words of thanks and gratitude to my predecessor, the present Minister of Mines. I want to tell him to-day, if it means anything to him, that just as he rendered outstanding services to South Africa as ambassador in Great Britain, so, as far as my experience of a few months in this Department goes, he also served and managed this Department extremely well. Since he has to experience a great deal of criticism, I want to tell him that I am not ashamed, nor afraid of anyone whosoever, to give him this fine testimonial here to-day and to thank him.</p>

<p>On this occasion I also want to refer to Mr. Van Niekerk who retired as Secretary for Planning at the end of August and whom we are privileged to have with us to-day. Mr. Van Niekerk joined the Public Service on 10th February, 1930, in the Department of Justice. Early in his career he was promoted to magistrate and in this capacity he served at various places throughout the Republic. He received various promotions and reached the position of senior magistrate, departmental inspector and assistant-secretary for Justice. On 1st October, 1958, he was promoted to Secretary for the Roads Division of the Provincial Administration of the Cape and was subsequently appointed Secretary for the Education Department of the Cape Province.</p>

<p>On 11th September, 1963, he was promoted to Deputy Provincial Secretary, and in this capacity he served on a whole number of committees and advisory councils of the province. With the establishment of the Department of Planning on 14th August, 1964, Mr. Van Niekerk was appointed Secretary for the new Department, and for something more than six years up to the time of his retirement on 1st September, 1970, he occupied this post, which gives him a total period of 40 years and eight months in the service of the State.</p>

<p>During his career Mr. Van Niekerk distinguished himself through his efficiency, his dedication and his reliability, his loyalty towards the authorities, towards the Departments he served and towards his colleagues. He redered outstanding service to his country and in the advancement of the vehicle of State he contributed his full share for more than 40 years. I thank him, as the man who laid the foundations of the Department of Planning, for his exceptional work in giving this Department content and direction. I also want to thank him for what he meant to me personally during our short period of cooperation. On behalf of this House and on behalf of the Government I want to thank Mr. Van Niekerk and tell him that we wish him and Mrs. Van Niekerk only the best in the new era in their lives which they have just entered. I want to trust that they will still enjoy many years of happiness and rest together and that he will still render useful service to his country and his area as well. I thank you, Mr. Van Niekerk.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I prefer to deal with the minor points first. The hon. member for Hillbrow said we should spend more on scientific research. I think we are doing our best to spend as much as possible. The amount appearing on the Estimates can probably be larger. When is one ever spending enough&#x003F; This, however, is not the only amount South Africa is spending on scientific research. I just want to mention that in passing. We are spending this amount from the side of the Government, and this spending is being co-ordinated in a very effective way by the C.S.I.R. The C.S.I.R. will not allow of more than one subsidized project being in progress on the same subject at the same time.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of co-ordination. I do think sufficient co-ordination exists amongst the C.S.I.R., the Medical Research Council and the Atomic Energy Board. I might have misunderstood the hon. member, but I imagine the hon. member asked what the reason was for the separate bodies and whether this was not a division of power.</p>

<p>The hon. member says he did not say that. However, the position is that the Opposition voted for the establishment of the Medical Research Council and the Atomic Energy Board as separate organizations for research. We all accept&#x2014;this probably is something we shall have to see to&#x2014; also in the Department of Planning as a whole, that one should always try to bring about the necessary co-ordination, not only amongst scientific research organizations, but also amongst the Government, the provinces and the local authorities, i.e. everyone concerned in research. In this regard I may say that I believe one should bring all interested bodies and organizations into this in order to achieve optimum planning. One should obtain their co-operation to such an extent that one shall be able, when overall planning has been completed, to entrust each planning organization that has a task within that broad plan with the execution of its specific function within that broad programme.</p>

<p>Other hon. members raised a few general matters. I think the member for Vasco was the one who dealt with economic matters. This hon. member made what was to me a very interesting contribution. It may be a pity that we cannot decide this question of what South Africa is capable of with its economic growth, to a larger extent and more clearly this afternoon. I shall perhaps come back to that at a later stage. I feel there is a great deal of loose talk in this regard. It is said that South Africa is capable of the same growth as Japan, that South Africa can grow much more rapidly and that we are deliberately retarding the rate of growth. In reality the Government has only one aspiration. It asks, &#x201C;What is South Africa&#x2019;s growth potential in terms of its manpower and <span class="col_5189-5190" refersTo="page_1152"/>its capital&#x003F; What should we strive after&#x003F; What is the course on which we should direct our endeavours&#x003F;&#x201D; On that course we shall experience the least problems. We shall have employment opportunities for all the people who enter the market. We shall have a constant and regular improvement in living standards. By following that course we shall avoid the disadvantages of a too high growth rate, such as, inflation balance of payments problems, shortages of capital, difficulties relating to the infra-structure, etc. The whole aim of defining the object of a growth rate is to grow within the limits of what one is capable of.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte made a contribution which probably links up with those of other hon. members&#x2014;I have in mind, for example, the hon. member for Musgrave &#x2014;with regard to national planning. I want to tell the hon. member that we are giving proper and very serious attention to that. We are looking at South Africa as a whole. During the next few months in particular we are going to look at South Africa on a regional basis so as to see who the people are who are living in those regions and who ought to live there in the year 2000. We are also going to determine the natural resources of such a region, where they are lacking, where we have to supplement and in what way we are to plan and develop so that that region will be able to carry its share of the population of South Afrca on the road ahead. I should like to give this House the assurance that we are giving very serious attention to this matter.</p>

<p>Other hon. members dealt with the problems of their areas. The hon. member for Namaqualand, for example, spoke specifically of the needs of Namaqualand. The hon. member for Christiana also dealt with his region. The hon. member for Prieska mentioned the region in his constituency which is being developed energetically at the moment. The hon. members for Mossel Bay and Winburg and other hon. members also dealt with aspects in their own constituencies. We shall peruse their Hansard reports with great care and give the necessary attention to planning in those growth points and points of development. The hon. member for Mossel Bay mentioned a matter to which I should like to refer in passing. It affects our entire idea of decentralization. In the South-Western Districts we have already designated special decentralization points in which we want to encourage certain development and particularly industrial development. For example, such a point of development has been designated at George. An industrialist can obtain border area benefits in George, provided he concentrates on Coloured labour there. At one stage such concessions were granted there also in respect of unemployed Whites.</p>

<p>I now want to come to specific aspects raised by hon. members. The hon. member for Pietersburg spoke of exemption in respect of the 30-mile region. I think this matter is already receiving attention. The hon. members for East London (North) and for East London (City) mentioned the question of a fourth Iscor. Hon. members will understand that it is a fact when I say that the Government has not yet given any attention at all to something like this. It is in fact true that land has been purchased at East London, but this has been done so as to ensure that we shall have land available if and when development is proceeded to in that area. Hon. members told me, and I accept that this is so, that there were rumours that such development would possibly take place at Saldanha Bay, because of the fact that an export harbour was going to be constructed there. I cannot inform them in this regard. I can just tell them that the Government has not yet given its attention to this at all. I want to hope and trust that any speculation in this connection will not be taken any further. The country cannot expect of the Government now to say what it is going to plan further ahead in 15 years&#x2019; time, or at whatever time.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Mooi River spoke about the Coloured group area, Woodlands, near Pietermaritzburg. The position is that the Group Areas Board has been conducting an investigation in regard to another area adjoining Woodlands. As far as I am aware, this new area is situated away from Woodlands. The fact of the matter is that the Group Areas Board has not yet reached any decision regarding this matter, nor has it made any recommendation to me. I may just point out to the hon. member that the Woodlands group area for Coloured people is already full. The need for additional group area facilities in that area, and for additional housing, is not at this stage so much for Coloured people from the rest of that area, as for the people of Woodlands themselves. These people are becoming congested and they must have a place where they can expand, with regard to housing. Another question the hon. member asked, was whether we consider Pietermaritzburg as a central town for the purposes of bringing together the Coloured people of that area. This is a matter which is under consideration and it will be handled in the same way as it was handled in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. A departmental committee has gone into the matter and I can tell the hon. member that I have received the report. It is just possible that this committee may recommend that in Natal we should select a few towns which can be regional towns for the Coloured people. I do not know what the position is. I have read through the report very qucikly, but I have not studied it. However, I have the same situation in my constituency and I think we can all appreciate that in a town where there are 10, 12 or 15 Coloured families, they may be essential there, as is the case in a town in my constituency, Indwe, where they are all tradesmen or artisans, but they can never form a community. Therefore we can never accommodate them there on a permanent basis, but perhaps only on a temporary basis, with regard to which I am sympathetic. To establish a real <span class="col_5191-5192" refersTo="page_1153"/>community and to provide all the facilities which the community requires, one must select a few regional towns, where one can provide these community complexes. That may be a decision with regard to Pietermaritzburg. I do not know. I do hope to consider this report and to take the matter to the Cabinet, perhaps during the recess. I sincerely hope so.</p>

The part of my reply, where I stated that it was on behalf of himself and another white person, was in a certain sense a false reading of the telex which we received from Pretoria. Another white person did appear before the Group Areas Board, but there were quite a number of other people who were not mentioned in my reply. For instance, there were 31 Indian owners who made representations and also about five Indian institutions. My reply did not cover everybody. But the person to whom I referred, was a certain Mr. Pienaar, who is the chairman of the Valuation Committee of Ladysmith. Actually, he appeared before the board as a witness.</p>

<p>No, he was summoned by the advocate, Mr. Pretorius. My reply referred to this Mr. Pienaar, who only appeared as a witness.</p>

<p>Then, the hon. member referred to the investigation by my two hon. colleagues with regard to the Forbes Street area in Ladysmith. The position is that, after an area has been proclaimed a group area, the Minister of Planning disappears from the scene and the Minister of Community Development takes over. That was what happened at Ladysmith. After it had been proclaimed, it became a matter for the Minister of Community Development. When a deproclamation was considered, surely the Minister of Community Development, who was then the Minister handling the case, had quite a big say in the matter. There is nothing extraordinary about this. It is certainly very usual and it is standing practice that in these matters, where a change takes place, the two Ministers of Planning and of Community Development, who both have a very keen interest in that matter, together conduct any investigations which the Cabinet may decide.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the Minister&#x2019;s reply he said that both the Ministers of Planning and of Community Development visited the area; the Minister of Community Development said he had nothing to do with deproclamation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, when the deproclamation is actually made and gazetted, it is done by the Minister of Planning. When an area is proclaimed and deproclaimed, then surely it is not a matter which one can go over lightly. The two Ministers are directly concerned with the matter. Of all the Ministers they are most concerned with the matter, and it is only natural that they should go there together to investigate and perhaps to make a report.</p>

<p>In this connection I might just as well refer to what the hon. member for Houghton asked me. She asked me whether I would consider trying to make these deproclamations as few as possible. Personally, I am prepared to tell her that I will do my best and only for very good reasons will I be prepared to do it. Of course the hon. member must realize that such cases will arise. It will be just too wonderful, if you have planned and your plans have gone through the machinery of the Group Areas Board, that there will nver be any situation where you will have to change them. But I will say that I will not readily do so. I have already told the Chairman of the Group Areas Board that if he wants to deproclaim and wants to put new proposals before me, it must be for very good reasons. That is the only way of giving people security. I want to say, however, that I do not want to be blamed if I have to do it in future because circumstances change and it might be necessary in some cases.</p>

<p>*I shall have to make haste. I just want to tell the hon. member for East London (City) this. He said the decentralization of industries should just not take place on an uneconomic basis but immediately afterwards he spoke of the decline of the rural areas. I cannot agree with him more about the rural areas. I myself come from a small town, and the rural areas are declining because the economic basis in those areas has changed and whatever we want to do, there is not much we can do about it. But I have sympathy with the rural areas. If one wants to decentralize, one cannot do so to all the towns. Suppose, however, one wanted to decentralize to Middelburg, the hometown of the hon. member, would that be for economic reasons&#x003F; Who could decentralize to Middelburg for economic reasons&#x003F; I am putting this question to the enire Opposition. Apart from other matters to which I shall come back, they, too, say that they are in favour of decentralization as long as it is not decentralization on ideological grounds. Now please! We are not that bad. We are in favour of decentralization on economic grounds.</p>

It is in fact situated near Pretoria, but those people are at least not sitting in the large Bantu townships of Johannesburg; they are in a new Bantu area.

<p>*Sir, during the past months people throughout South Africa have often asked when we would receive the population figures. South Africa was anxious to have these figures. Some people awaited the figures in bad faith because they said the figures would prove that the policy of this Government was irrevocably heading for failure. They eagerly awaited those figures. Others again awaited those figures with heavy hearts and people started writing and speculating about those figures. After we had been looking forward to those figures for such a long time I had the privilege last Friday afternoon to make the first announcement in this regard. Hon. members on my side of this House were very pleased to hear those figures, and I had thought that the United Party would at least also be pleased to hear the figures. I have been sitting here to-day listening to hon. members on the opposite side and not one of them said they were grateful to hear the <span class="col_5195-5196" refersTo="page_1155"/>figures and that the position could have been worse.

Sir, the Opposition must make no mistake; we are all in the same boat. If something were to happen to the boat of South Africa they must not think that only the Nats would suffer as a result. Sir, for the sake of the record I should like to ask the hon. member for East London (City) whether I heard him correctly; I should like him to tell me that he had not said it, but this is what we on this side heard.

The hon. member for Hillbrow wanted to cast a shadow on the counting, and he made a major point out of the word &#x201C;enumerate&#x201D;, but I want to tell him that the people were counted wherever they were. The contract workers who are here in the Western Cape, were all counted here in the Western Cape. All the foreign Bantu who are in the mines, in the compounds, in South Africa, were counted, and the total number of foreign Bantu who are here in South Africa, must be subtracted from this number of 14.8 million, or whatever the number may be.</p>

<p>How many&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we cannot say how many there are. At a later stage a very good calculation will be made which will be published, but it will merely remain a calculation. They may number 600,000; they may number 500,000; I do not think that there are more than 800,000, but they were also counted and included in this number.</p>

<p>Now I come to the areas. In this regard hon. members said that we were comparing areas which could not be compared with one another, i.e. the Bantu homelands of 1970 and the Bantu areas of 1960. Sir, the reason why the hon. the Prime Minister could not make this announcement himself, was that we wanted to make quite sure that the areas which we were comparing with one another, were comparable. We now have Bantu homelands for the first time, and hon. members are welcome to ask where the borders of these homelands are, but it is childish to do so. We had the clear boundary-lines of the present Bantu homelands as they are to-day, and we had the borders of the old Bantu areas, the Trust lands, the scheduled land, the church lands, etc. There are five different groups. We changed the borders of those areas in such a way that if it were possible to place them one on top of the other, they would fit exactly on top of one another. They have now been subdivided into electoral districts. In 1960 they were also subdivided into electoral districts in this way. The 1970 area was loaded with the electoral districts which were enumerated in 1960. Then we had two absolutely similar areas, with the figures of 1960 in the one and the figures of 1970 in the other. These are the figures which were furnished in this statement. Therefore, these are absolutely comparable figures. I cannot stress the quality of this census sufficiently. It is a wonderful census. It is a census of high quality. In its planning South Africa may as well take the fullest notice of this census and everything that is published subsequent to this census. Then I told the Secretary that we had to keep the areas as they were: the new homelands <span class="col_5197-5198" refersTo="page_1156"/>of 1970 with their borders and the old Bantu areas of 1960 with their borders. Then we took the 1970 figures and put them into the 1970 areas. In the same way we also put the 1970 figures into the 1960 areas. What was the difference between the two&#x003F;&#x2014;19,000. I want to repeat that these figures were comparable. Hon. members are now saying that Mdantsane and another township near another city accounted for the difference. I want to state most positively to-day that this is not the case. Whenever the chairman of the United Party&#x2019;s planning group, or any other member of the United Party, visits Johannesburg, he is free to arrange an appointment with the Secretary for Statistics in order to make sure of the absolute reliability of the comparison of these figures.</p>

All that hon. members are now trying to tell me, is that they do not accept that Bantu homelands are being established close to major cities. I want to repeat that we cannot get away from the fact that these are wonderful figures. A certain percentage may be allowed for errors. Hon. members on that side of the House may allow a certain percentage for all sorts of factors. But they cannot get away from the fact that these figures indicate that there was a movement of Bantu from the white areas to the Bantu homelands. If this process is continued, we shall reach a stage where there will be more Bantu in the Bantu homelands than there are in the white areas. This will already be an achievement. It will be something about which we will be very pleased, and I hope that the Opposition will be pleased along with us when that day arrives. Then we shall have reached 1978. It has been said that the curve reflecting the increase will rise, then level out, after which it will show a downward trend. I do not want to dwell on this matter, but we see to-day that these things are becoming practicable.</p>

<p>The hon. member did say so. He said that we were referring to major complexes and congestion, but that we were not nearly comparable with overseas complexes. The hon. member also said that at present we had not yet reached the stage where we could justify industrial decentralization. The impression was created here that we were indifferent to the economy of South Africa. I want to be brief, for the Leader of the House told me to be brief, but just for the sake of the record I want to say that the National Government has been looking after the economy of South Africa. In 1948 and in 1961 and at every other critical point we looked after the economy of South Africa and developed it. We, more so than any other group of people, knew how we were all alone in the world. We knew that we had to look after our defence. We knew that we had to make provision for money for our domestic problems. This is not a matter of our discovering it now, and it does not mean that we are still going to do it. We provided for our defence and we saw to it that there was money in the Treasury for carrying into effect South Africa&#x2019;s infra-structure and decentralization, and for solving the many other problems <span class="col_5199-5200" refersTo="page_1157"/>facing South Africa. We have a good record, and as the National Government looked after the economic growth and development of South Africa in the past, so we shall also look after these things in the future. Hon. members are so apt to create the impression in this House that this Government is indifferent to industrial development in South Africa, but, surely, this is not the case. Who is the father of the industrial concept in South Africa&#x003F; It is the National Party. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Other people may also have made their contributions, but the concept springs from the golden principle of &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;. This is the basis of our industrial concept. Where does the protection of our industries come from&#x003F; It comes from the National Government which said that we should protect our industries. I do not wish to be unfriendly now, but when other people said &#x201C;Buy British&#x201D; it was the National Government which said that we should protect our own industries. That was a phase in our development. Who established Iscor and Sasol&#x003F; I mention these matters in passing in order to say that the National Government can or will never be indifferent to the industrial growth and development of South Africa. To-day I repeat the assurance that we shall not do this.</p>

<p>I am coming to that. Furthermore, the impression is also being created that we want to strangle to death and strip the existing develped parts of South Africa. I want to repeat to-night that nothing is further removed from the truth. After all, it is South Africa as a whole, and especially its developed parts, which provided us with the tempo and the momentum for the growth and development which we have. These areas will have to go on making their contributions for a long time to come. If, for the sake of argument, we only want to attain a growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent, or whatever it may be, these developing areas will for a long time to come still be unable to contribute their full share on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, and we shall still be dependent on our existing developing areas for making that contribution. Surely, it would be foolish to cause these parts to come to a standstill. I shall not be agreeable to that. Any impression to this effect&#x2014;i.e. that this is our objective&#x2014;which is being created for the benefit of the country, is quite wrong. We shall not do it.</p>

<p>But what do we want to do then&#x003F; We say that South Africa has to grow. I am not going to talk about our growth achievements now; we can do so in a financial debate. But they are brilliant and good enough. Growth constitutes one of the legs of our policy and of our objectives. But now we say that we should have balanced growth. We are not the only people to say so. Before we adjourn, I just want to read something to hon. members. I want to refer to Mr. Steven Mulholland, who wrote in the Business Times of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Growth has become a cancer in America&#x2019;s greatest city, once the vigorous and dynamic symbol of this country&#x2019;s economic might.</block>

<p>He was writing from New York. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Today New York is a festering sore on the North American continent. The disasters, both economic and social, that afflict it, make one think that in the decentralization programme the Nationalists in South Africa might be doing the right thing in the long term, albeit for the wrong reasons.</block>

<p>And so I could continue. The last paragraph reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At our stage of development in South Africa, we still have time to avoid these pitfalls. We must learn our lesson from the tragedy of New York and apply it with all haste in our country.</block>

<p>That is what this man has to say. The South African Agricultural Union wrote a letter to us in which they said, &#x201C;Please, people, the policy of decentralization is now being attacked everywhere. We want to ask you as the Government not to give way. Proceed with the policy of decentralization.&#x201D; I said that one of the legs of our policy was that South Africa had to grow. Our metropolitan areas should also continue to grow; and so they will, for they have it in them to do so. There is no need for one to encourage them. But we want decentralized growth. Now, what is the basis on which we want to have decentralized growth&#x003F; It is in the industrial sphere. Now we come to the encouragement. This is how we selected these growth points throughout South Africa. We have achieved a great deal of success by these means. In our border areas alone &#x2014;I am not referring now to other points in the white areas&#x2014;we have, as hon. members know, created 100,000 new opportunities for employment since 1961.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, in ten years&#x2019; time. In casting one&#x2019;s mind back, one finds that during the first year not even half a yard of branchline was constructed. During that year nothing happened. During the second year, too, very little happened, and the same applies to the third year. But the development only gained momentum at a later stage. It was only towards the end that we started achieving success. It is a wonderful achievement. Do hon. members know that in the last year we approved 35,000 posts&#x003F; If this should continue, I do not know how astonished the hon. members opposite will eventually be at the success of our policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when we adjourned, I was discussing the encouragement aspect of our decentralization policy. I do not want to discuss this at any great length, and it is a pity that the hon. member for East London (City) is not here, but I just want to say that to me East London has always been a fine example of what we have achieved in this field. This is probably because I know the city. I often visit that area, and I can tell hon. members that there was a time when East London was dead. Sir, I can mention the names of the factories in question, and I can tell you that the two or three factories which were there, also wanted to move to Johannesburg. They wanted to go where the money, the people and the markets were. At that stage we started with this policy of ours. We were criticized, but we even built a township. I could tell hon. members the whole story of Cyril Lord, etc. It is without any fear of contradiction whatsoever that I can say that there is progress in East London to-day. The old West Bank part of the city has already been built up. The new industrial sites have already been taken up. Expansion is taking place in the direction of Berlin. By means of this aspect of our decentralization policy, namely the encouragement aspect, we have found that industrialists have been going to East London. We have succeeded in making them interested in East London, and to-day we see the economic activity which is taking place there. Let this be a white city. What does it matter&#x003F; The argument which hon. members are so fond of using, is that we have merely transferred the industrialists from one place to another. However, they should bear in mind that we have succeeded in distributing the industries all over the country in a balanced manner. From-their own homelands the labourers now come to work in the white cities and towns on a scattered basis. We select the growth points. We develop them. We lend money to the local authorities for dams, etc. We are, at least, doing something. After that, when it comes to the financial aspects, we implement our encouragement measures, and we are doing our best. So much for the encouragement aspect of the policy.</p>

<p>Now we come to the restrictive part of the policy. It is this very part of the policy to which the greatest objections are being raised. It is embodied in section 3 of the Physical Planning Act. It is true that this is a restrictive measure. It is the policy of this Government to implement it. Week before last we once again said, through the mouth of the Prime Minister, that we would stand by that policy. However, it is not quite the bogey and the bugbear which it is made out to be. I have the figures here which prove that we do not have such a strangle-hold on the people. There are certain guiding lines, with which I cannot deal now. We have regard to the strategic nature of industries, whether they are location-oriented, and whether there are extremely large investments. We even have regard to normal expansion. Regard is also being had to cases where industrialists have established factories on a planned long-term basis. Regard is also being had to the labour ratio, so as to see whether an industry is labour-intensive. Many other aspects are considered, such as the amount of water which is consumed. Here in the Cape, even in Port Elizabeth, regard is had to the availability of Coloured labour. I really want to say that this restrictive measure is very valuable. To be more specific, we are afforded the opportunity to speak to the industrialists. Hon. members cannot minimize this. To-night I want to give this testimonial in respect of the industrialists and say that they are much more amenable to the idea of industrial decentralization than the country is led to believe. It is in fact the Opposition which is trying to create that impression. The industrialists are much more amenable to this idea than the Opposition is. I want to tell the Opposition to-night&#x2014;and I am saying this with good intentions&#x2014;that they are even out of touch with the industrialists. I want to thank the industrialists to-night for the measure of co-operation which we have obtained from them so far. I want to tell the industrialists that, if this portfolio remains my responsibility, I am looking forward to achieving much greater co-operation and success with them along this course.</p>

<p>Quite correct. I am defending them all the way. I am pleased that the hon. member reminded me of them. It is true that industrial investment has shown a downward trend. This is not a matter to which we who are at the helm, can adopt an attitude of indifference. It showed a downward trend in 1968. It also showed a downward trend in 1969. I can give the hon. member more than adequate reasons for that. The hon. member knows or ought to know that in the three years prior to 1967 we had a 100 per cent increase in respect of industrial investment in South Africa. When one has such a massive industrial investment as we had in 1964, 1965 <span class="col_5203-5204" refersTo="page_1159"/>and 1966&#x2014;a 120 per cent increase in three years&#x2019; time&#x2014;then, surely, one must have surplus capacity. It is, therefore, the most natural thing in the world that there was a decrease of 16 per cent in 1968 and a further decrease of 11 per cent in 1969. In spite of that the physical production increased by more than 10 per cent. Let us take the opinion poll which the hon. member has with him and from which he is so fond of quoting. In that publication the people who took the opinion poll, said that they were astonished at there still being so much surplus capacity in industry in South Africa. Therefore, this does not astonish me. The fact of the matter is that it is true and that it is something to which we cannot adopt an attitude of indifference.</p>

<p>There are other reasons as well. All the blame is now being laid on the Physical Planning Act. This is not fair either. There is the other reason, namely skilled labour. In the opinion poll it was said that 97 per cent had said that skilled labour was a bottleneck. Ninety-seven per cent did not say that the Physical Planning Act was a bottleneck. Only 60 per cent said that the Physical Planning Act was a bottleneck. Almost 100 per cent said that skilled labour was a bottleneck. Now, however, all the blame is being laid on the Physical Planning Act. Surely, this is neither right, fair nor logical. Then there are, in addition, the bottlenecks of capital, high interest rates, financial climate, etc. I shall not go into those matters. I do not wish to detain the Committee much longer. The fact of the matter is that we do have this downward trend in industrial investment. However, the Government is not indifferent to it, and least of all the Minister of Finance. At the instance of the Minister of Finance the Rieckert Commission, amongst others, was appointed to see what bottlenecks there were amongst the industrialists in respect of our decentralization policy and also in respect of section 3. Please, do not make the mistake of stating in the newspapers that there is uncertainty in this regard. We said that we were going to use section 3 as an instrument for counteracting the process whereby our white cities are being swamped by Blacks. In doing this we have no intention of tripping up our economy. However, it is our unshakeable intention to achieve our objectives, which I set out to the Committee tonight before the supper adjournment.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, I just want to know where the United Party really stands at the moment. This is something which the United Party should tell us. I have here the booklet which was published by the United Party and in which it is stated that it will not tell the industrialist where he is to establish his factory. The industrialist must establish his factory where the business prospects are brightest. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said this year &#x201C;that the industrialists can have all the labour they want, where they want it and when they want it&#x201D;. Here we have the hon. member for Hillbrow who said that we were driving along with the brakes applied half-way; in other words, release the brakes. I could now, if I had the time, mention the brakes, one after the other, which he said we should release. Is that what the United Party stands for&#x003F; Should there be no brakes&#x003F; All they ask for, is that the developed parts should develop further, and they will see to it that they obtain the labour. We say no, this is not a policy which we can accept. At the moment I do not have the time to elaborate on this matter, but this is not a policy which South Africa can accept. It will possibly be a policy, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, which may ensure us the highest growth rate in the world, if we released all the brakes and removed all the restrictions, and I may as well mention them. There are the Bantu Building Workers Act and all the job reservation laws and all the traditional job reservation in South Africa. If one released all these brakes and if one, as I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, got an additional 100,000 immigrants a year, this would be possible. But the dilemma of the Opposition is that economically they want to do certain things, but politically they dare not do them. That is why they are blowing hot and cold; that is why they are talking through the mouth of the hon. member for Hillbrow on the one hand, and, on the other hand, through the mouth of the hon. member for Newton Park, the economic mouth and the political mouth. This is their dilemma, which was so beautifully illustrated by the hon. member for South Coast. I am not politicizing now, but this is true. For that reason it is my conclusion that as far as the Department of Planning is concerned, we are also making mistakes and will make more mistakes in future. But our objectives are clear, i.e. to develop South Africa and to allow it to grow in the economic sphere, but also to allow South Africa to have balanced development and growth for the benefit of the whole country and of all its people.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half-hour&#x003F; I want to say immediately that I do not intend using the full half-hour. The hon. the Minister, as I said on a previous occasion, has now accepted this portfolio and we are all prepared to accept that he has an extremly difficult task which will be resting on his shoulders in the next year or two. We told him on a previous occasion that this difficult matter would be put to the test in the course of time to see whether he has the necessary insight to <span class="col_5205-5206" refersTo="page_1160"/>deal with it. Therefore, Sir, you will find that we on this side of the House will not be expecting too much of the hon. the Minister this evening, because he rightly said on the previous Vote that this was the first time he was dealing with it, and this applies to Coloured Relations as well. Therefore the hon. the Minister will understand if we do not, as would normally have been the case, call the Minister to account fully on this occasion.</p>

<p>However, I nevertheless want to tell the hon. the Minister that we expect of him to handle this extremely delicate position which we have in South Africa of dealing with 2 million Coloureds, and to deal with those Coloured relations within the framework of certain principles. One of the first principles which we shall expect the hon. the Minister to implement is to place the relations between the Whites and the Coloured community on the firmest possible basis. I think it is also correct if one says that it is a cause of concern, not only to us on this side of the House, but I think to all right-minded South Africans, that there are so many Coloureds who are not at all prepared to accept the good intentions of the Whites in South Africa. I do not want to go into the history of this. The hon. the Minister knows the history as well as I do, i.e. why this situation has developed and why everything which is done in the name of the Whites to-day is held against the Whites by the Coloureds, and is held against them by so many Coloureds. Only recently I again read in the Press that when an important test match was played in Port Elizabeth a mirror was directed onto Ian McCallum from the nonwhite section of the crowd while he was taking a most important kick at the posts. It is not known whether this was done by a Coloured person or not, but this is not the only example. One can go to any important match between South Africa and any international team today and What will one find&#x003F; One will find an attitude among the Coloured people as well as many other non-Whites, which I think ought to cause great anxiety to any white person in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not want to suggest that the Whites alone are responsible for this situation. I believe that the Coloured people too should to a large extent reappraise their attitude to this type of thing. But the fact remains that this type of thing happens, and therefore I am telling the hon. the Minister that one of the principles according to which he will have to act is to ensure sound relations between us and the Coloured people, and that it is a source of anxiety to us that there are so many Coloureds who have no realization of the good intentions of the Whites in this country.</p>

<p>Secondly, we want to tell the hon. the Minister that he will have to try to restrict to a minimum certain pinpricks which exist between the Whites and the Coloureds. I want to refer the Minister not to what is being said by the Coloureds who are against the Government, but to what is being said by the leaders of the Federal Coloured People&#x2019;s Party. I want to refer him to a speech made by Mr. Tom Swartz, in which he said the following, accordin to <i>Die Burger</i> of 27th July this year. The heading reads as follows: &#x201C;Apartheid: Coloureds hate this word, says Swartz&#x201D;. Then he said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no word which the coloured community hates more than &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;. This word has hurt and humiliated the Coloureds.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Separate development must not be confused with &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;, which is a synonym for discrimination on the basis of colour. Apartheid is rejected unequivocally by the party.</block>

<p>He was referring to his own party. Sir, in the light of the historical background to this and in the light of what is still being done to-day. I say that the pinpricks between us and the Coloureds have to be removed if we expect to have sound race relations. In addition, I want to refer the hon. the Minister to a congress of the Federal Coloured People&#x2019;s Party which was held recently, as reported in <i>Die Burger</i> of Monday, 29th June. Here one reads the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Aspects of Government policy strongly condemned by Coloureds: The sharpest criticism which has ever been levelled at a congress of the Federal Coloured People&#x2019;s Party against the application of certain aspects of the Government&#x2019;s relationships policy was heard at the party&#x2019;s national congress in Athlone this week-end.</block>

<p>In the same report we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Party dissatisfied about teachers&#x2019; salaries. The Federal Coloured People&#x2019;s Party wants to express its strongest dissatisfaction with the remuneration received by Coloured teachers. While Coloured teachers previously received 80 per cent of the salaries of Whites for the same training, it is now 55 per cent. The party does not expect the teachers to be treated in this way.</block>

<p>Sir, I mention these as examples of pinpricks between the Whites and the coloured groups in South Africa. I think the other principle in terms of which the hon. the Minister will have to act is that discrimination between Whites and Coloureds must not be over-emphasized all the time. I also want to refer to a speech which the hon. member for Moorreesburg recently made at Dwarskersbos, as reported in <i>Die Burger</i> of 12th September this year. There the hon. member made it very clear that one of the motives of this Government was to get away from colour discrimination in South <span class="col_5207-5208" refersTo="page_1161"/>Africa. As far as the Coloured group in South Africa is concerned, Sir, I do not think this question should be emphasized too much. I think tht next principle which the hon. the Minister will have to bear in mind is that we must grant the Coloureds a place in the South African sun so that they may feel that they form part of the whole and, above all, that the role played by them is appreciated and that the necessary recognition will be given to it. Sir, we are inclined to have a sentimental approach towards the 2 million Coloured people in the country. We are so fond of saying that they speak our language and that they form part of Western society, and then we do extremely little to make them real friends of the Whites in this country.</p>

<p>I honestly believe that the Government to a large extent, and the hon. the Minister in particular, will make an unselfish attempt to get away from colour discrimination; therefore separate councils had to be established for all the various race groups in South Africa. Sir, this brings me to the next principle according to which the hon. the Minister will have to act. I think he will have to make it very clear to the people of South Africa as well as to the Coloureds whether it is his policy to establish a separate state for the Coloured people in this country. We know there was the infamous speech of the former member for Umhlatuzana. A year or so ago there was also the speech of the present Minister of Information at Empangeni in Natal, when he envisaged that it was the object of this Government to establish a separate state for the Coloureds.</p>

<p>All right, if that is not so, then we want to know this from the hon. the Minister who will deal with this matter. I think we are entitled to this. If we want to do away with colour discrimination, as hon. members on that side are saying, then we must realize that they cannot offer the Coloureds the same that they are offering, for example, the Bantu in South Africa. The Coloureds expect them to go a little further than their policy is today. The Coloureds expect that things should not stop at the statement that we shall leave it to our children to solve this problem, particularly as far as liaison between this Parliament and the Coloureds themselves is concerned. I want to refer hon. members to the Hansard of the Coloured Persons Representative Council. On this occasion Mr. Tom Swartz moved an amendment, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That all the words after &#x201C;that&#x201D; be deleted and substituted by the following: &#x201C;this Council expresses its appreciation of the further phase now being inaugurated on the road of separate development by the establishment of this Council and accepts the Government&#x2019;s promise that it is not the end of the political development of the Coloured people&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Our policy is not under discussion now. Hon. members have it there in the booklet. They quote it all day. We are dealing with the Government&#x2019;s policy here. The hon. the Minister must make very clear to us what they are envisaging, as those Coloureds who themselves accept the policy of separate development and of the right of self-determination, accept it. As the Coloureds said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and accepts the Government&#x2019;s promise that it is not the end of the political development of the Coloured people.</block>

<p>I want to tell the hon. members that there are certain basic standpoints which we on this side of the House have accepted. In the first instance, we accept that we cannot create a state within a state for the Coloured people. This is impossible. We accept that there are certain Coloured areas, which have throughout history been known as Coloured rural areas, which comprise more than 2 million morgen, mainly in the Cape, for these people. One cannot go further than the development of those areas. One can never speak in terms of a state, as can perhaps be done in the case of the Transkei. The farthest which hon. members on that side of the House can go, is a policy of parallelism in the local sphere, in other words, that these people can be offered residential segregation, which I think the vast majority of people in South Africa accept as the normal way of life. [Interjections.] But to think in terms of creating a state within a state is simply impossible. With these few words I want to tell the hon. the Minister that he must make it very clear to the people how he is going to do this.</p>

<p>I shall do so. I shall come to it later; I am not afraid of stating it. When the National Party came into power in 1948 the Coloured population was the most neglected and the most frustrated group of people in South Africa. There was literally hatred existing between Whites and Coloureds. The United Party was the cause of that. After the polling booths closed they never gave the Coloureds a thought again until five years later, when people had to vote again. The Coloureds were the political football of the United Party. There were many children at school, but apart from something in the educational field, no door was open to the Coloureds. The education which they received made them still more antagonistic, because all doors were closed to them. The United Party precipitated a constitutional struggle about the Coloured franchise. They were responsible for conducting a constitutional struggle for ten years. They say that the National Party has already been in power for 22 years, but the fact of the matter is that as a result of that struggle nothing could be done for the Coloureds during those first ten years of National Party Government.</p>

<p>It was a fruitless struggle. The United Party made a solemn promise that they would restore the Coloureds to the common voters&#x2019; roll if they were to come into power, but where are they to-day&#x003F; The United Party wasted ten years of the Coloureds&#x2019; time and then they still want to speak of breaking one&#x2019;s word! The United Party over there are the people who have broken their word. The United Party was the cause that the Nationalist Government could not obtain the co-operation of the Coloured population for separate development for more than ten years. It has only been since 1965 that the Government has been able to obtain the assistance of the Coloured population, because only since then have they realized that their salvation lies with the Nationalist Government and definitely not with the United Party. The Coloured population is accepting separate development. The recent election of Coloured representatives proved this. The apartheid parties received 158,218 votes as against the 136,896 of all the other parties. Then there are still three constituencies of the apartheid parties which were uncontested and whose votes were not added to this figure. The United Party regards the Coloured Persons Representative Council and the powers which it has as inferior. Usually they also have a great deal to say about the one-third of the membership of the Council which is appointed. The hon. member for Green Point remarked in a debate here the other day that we were running away from the fact that members were appointed and that we were trying to hide them. This is not true. The constitutional development of the Whites in South Africa was far slower than that of the Coloureds. Only in 1854 were persons appointed in a representative government by the British Government. That development extended over 18 years up to 1872 before responsible government was granted. The position to-day is that the Coloureds have received general franchise, even if one-third of that Coloured Council is appointed. The Whites in South Africa did not even have that under British rule in 1872. There was a limitation on the white vote in that only males could vote up to 1929, when the Nationalist Government under the late General Hertzog removed this limitation. Let me say this evening, that the Coloureds have very little political experience. Over all the years only a small group had the vote and did vote. It is only now that the masses are getting the vote. In the economic field the Coloureds are lagging far behind. That party sitting over there is the cause of this. The economic backlog of the Coloured population is something we inherited from the United Party. Socially the Coloured population has more problems than any other population group in South Africa. They are also the group which is increasing the most rapidly. They are in fact experiencing a population explosion. Now I say that the National Party has offered the entire Coloured population an important socio-economic programme. They have more than a million morgen of rural areas which are still underdeveloped. The United Party are also to blame for the fact that that million morgen of land was never developed. It was left to the <span class="col_5211-5212" refersTo="page_1163"/>National Party to develop it. Under National Party rule the Coloureds have received more schools and colleges. They have their own university. Facilities are being provided, and I want to express the hope this evening that the Coloured population will make proper use of these facilities.</p>

<p>There is enough work for the Coloureds. There is a programme which will keep them busy for a long time. We are not afraid of the future as far as the Coloured population is concerned. We are afraid as regards the liaison which exists. This liaison still has to be discussed by the Prime Minister and the Coloured Council, but it is there. It is at a high level at Cabinet level. I hope it will remain on that level. We cannot bring it down to another level, because then we would be dragging it into the mud among the United Party.</p>

<p>Admittedly the Coloureds have no say in defence matters or foreign affairs. There are other departments as well in regard to which they have no say. Gradually they will obtain a big say. It will come gradually. But I hope that the Coloured Council and the Coloured population will see it in this way, i.e. that the liaison must remain at Cabinet level, with the Prime Minister and other Ministers, because those people are all sitting here and it is a liaison with Parliament. We admit that there are still many problems. But there is one thing we are not prepared to do. We are not prepared to integrate. We shall not integrate in our day and in our time. We shall make it possible for posterity to keep it this way if they want it.</p>

<p>I wrote it myself. Do not be so impertinent. Mr. Chairman, these are people without a homeland; a large section of them are people with intelligence, with culture, with dignity, and with great restraint. Moreover, they speak our languages, they worship our Gods and they observe the same cultural and social patterns as we do. These are people whose dignity and restraint have been quite remarkable, let me say, in the face of continual insults meted out to them by this Government. One thing is becoming clearer by the day&#x2014;that the Coloured people, who are potentially our greatest and most reliable ally in the maintenance of Western civilization in Southern Africa, hold in their hands the balance of power here in the Republic. Ironically, the very isolation which has been forced upon them by this thoughtless, uncaring and unperceptive Government has brought many of their leaders to-day to a realization that, within a community such as ours, where all political activities are centred around the need to establish a balance of power between black and white, the answer to stability lies very largely with them. Most of them have accepted the limited legislative powers which have been granted to them by this Government within the limited machinery available to them. I predict that they will use that power, and use it legitimately, to convert their apparent political impotence into a position of very great strength indeed. They are the one group of people to whom we in this country will have to turn as a last resort, not only to help to restore the balance between white and black in terms of numbers in this country, but for outright loyalty and support. These are the people to whom we shall have to turn. These things cannot easily be obtained to-day, nor will they be easily obtained in the future except perhaps on terms acceptable to the Coloured people themselves.</p>

<p>Oh, forget your claptrap! There will be some of them who will want to hold us up to ransom&#x2014;of course there will be. There will be others for whom their sense of balance is greater than our own. I say this advisedly, having talked to a great many of their leaders. The tragedy is that this dichotomy, this potential conflict, need never have arisen in the first place. I want to say something now which may not sound very pleasant to the ears of the hon. the Minister. I want to say that there are already very obvious and discernible traces of bitterness and anger amongst the leaders of the Coloured <span class="col_5213-5214" refersTo="page_1164"/>people in South Africa to-day, signs which were not there before. I first came across it in the educational field, and it has now become most apparent also in the political field. The chairman of the Coloured Representative Council, Mr. Tom Swartz, in addressing the Council after Minister Marais Viljoen, the then Minister of Coloured Affairs, took leave of the Council and at the same ceremony introduced the present Minister and Deputy Minister, made a very significant statement. I quote from <i>Alpha,</i> which is the official journal of the Department&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have now been in office for six months and the Press and the public are demanding to know what we have achieved during that period. I concede it is hardly a fair demand in view of the short period and in view of the fact that the Council has not had a full session as yet. But I wish to advise the Government of the very deadly danger of frustration. This could happen if the Executive and the governing party feel that their being in office is in fact meaningless; that they are merely rubber stamps or put there for window dressing purposes. This must be guarded against at all costs if the Government intends to be sincere in the application of the policy of self-determination and the constitutional development of self-government by the Coloured people.</block>

<p>The important point there is to be aware of the danger of frustration. I think the Government should take this warning by the chairman of the Coloured Representative Council very seriously. There are a number of ways in which this balance could be redressed before it is too late. Education is one of them, and the elimination of job reservation for the Coloured people is another. It has become an obsession with this Government that the leaders, the &#x00E9;lite, amongst our Coloured community should not be separated from or refuse to identify themselves with the general mass of their own people, the majority of whom, for reasons upon which I cannot enlarge this evening, are poor, backward and uncouth, with no apparent meaning or definitive background to their lives.</p>

<p>The one group of enlightened Coloured people most closely dedicated to the upliftment of their own people are the teachers. But they and many others are sick and tired of being treated as second-class citizens in their own country. [Interjections.] Oh, yes, they are fed up with group areas also; they are being treated as second-class citizens every day.</p>

<p>That was said by one of the lecturers at the Stellenbosch University, Prof. S. P. Cilliers.</p>

<p>When the history of the past 23 years comes to be written, no one will know, nor be able within any certainty, to assess the extent of the cumulative sociological problems, particularly amongst our Coloured people, to which the Government&#x2019;s ideologies have given rise. The insistence, first of all, upon African labour in this area being migratory and housed in male hostels&#x2014;whether these men have wives and families in the reserves or not&#x2014; has led to a bastardization of the Coloured community here in the Cape on an appalling scale. More than 33 per cent of all Coloured children born within the municipal area of Cape Town as far back as 1967 was illegitimate. The fate of these children is going to be a nightmare for us in the future. The majority of them do not know their fathers and, with their mothers obliged to work, they have the minimum of care, security, training or discipline in their lives. No one advises them to go to school; they collect in gangs in the townships, where they pick up violent habits. They take to crime, alcohol and laziness before they are even adolescent. There are generations of these children in the Coloured townships to-day where real community life hardly exists. The houses they live in are impersonal and drab. I want to know how much the Government really cares about these things. In the meantime the Government is obsessed with the principle of establishing group areas irrespective of the living conditions or any sense of community amongst the people they uproot.</p>

<p>She still regards the Coloured community as an inferior section of or an appendix to the white community. Looking into the future, she foresaw that the white population would eventually <span class="col_5215-5216" refersTo="page_1165"/>have to turn towards the Coloureds to be able to maintain themselves; in other words, that we are actually dependent upon the Coloured population for our survival, and not only for our existence as a people but also for our cultural survival. This is typical of the viewpoint of the hon. member for Wynberg and her party. They have had vacillating approaches to the political rights of the Coloureds. In the past they fought in season and out of season to retain the Coloureds on the common Voters&#x2019; Roll. Under the pressure of public opinion they subsequently accepted that the Coloureds should remain on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll. In their latest election pamphlets they now declare that the Coloureds should elect their own six representatives&#x2014; who can be either Whites or Coloureds&#x2014;in this House, and that the Coloureds will have to be satisfied with that. The hon. member also mentioned&#x2014;as did Mr. Tom Swartz, the chairman of the Coloured Council&#x2014;the frustration among these people. But does she think for one moment that that sense of frustrations will disappear once they have those six representatives, who can be either Whites or non-Whites&#x003F; [Interjection.] On the contrary, the old dispensation was one of frustration and this figment of the imagination of the United Party will, if it is implemented, lead to a sense of frustration among the Coloured people once more. We are quite aware of the fact that the Coloured people in South Africa have reached a very difficult stage of development. They have for centuries been subservient to the white population group.</p>

The results were&#x2014;and this was the former British and subsequently the United Party&#x2019;s dispensation&#x2014;that the Coloured people, because of their position of subordination and dependence, had never developed a leadership of their own and had never learned to do anything for themselves or to undertake anything. Therefore, whereas this Government has put them on the road towards self-development and self-realization, we have to admit that the Coloureds are only in the initial stages in almost every sphere, and also as regards the managing of their own Coloured Representative Council. To those of us who attended the establishment and the inauguration of that Council it was interesting to observe in which way these people accepted this new institution with a sense of appreciation and keenness, but we also observed the lack of skill and unfamiliarity they displayed in the whole of that situation; and we can understand that there should be some measure of frustration, particularly in view of the fact that this Council has only very limited powers at this stage. I want to concede that to the hon. member for Wynberg and to Mr. Tom Swartz, who she quoted. But frustration is the order of the day. There are few among us who do not experience a sense of frustration at some time or other.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not have the time; the hon. the Minister will reply to that. But the hon. member would be well advised to go and read what the late Dr. Verwoerd and the present Prime Minister said in this regard. There is no need for me to go into this matter now. I just want to tell hon. members that as the Coloured leaders come to know their own capabilities, that frustration will diminish; they will realize themselves; their leadership will become stronger, it will develop and grow and they will realize that it is no longer a question of talking about political rights; that this is no longer a myth, but that it is their responsibility now to shoulder part of the task of governing the Coloured population and to put this into practice. It is very easy to clamour for political rights, but it is not so easy to practice those rights and to participate in the governing of a people. Those people have to accept responsibility now; they now appreciate the problems of governing and of administration. However, with the assistance of the officials of the Departments concerned these people are learning quickly and they are getting to know their capabilities. One is surprised how quickly they have come to know their capabilities even in this sphere. What experience would they have gained had they been subjected to the dispensation of hon. members on that side of the House, that is if six Whites or Coloureds would be sitting in this House to present them&#x003F; I can ask hon. members opposite a few very simple questions they will not be able to answer. Let me put only one question to them: In what way would those six representatives, if they were Coloureds, realize themselves and behave in this House, in this community&#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, I want to go further and mention a few other points. I want to refer to the work that <span class="col_5217-5218" refersTo="page_1166"/>is being done by the Coloured Development Corporation. I want to point out that we have found it interesting to take cognisance of the work that has been done by this corporation and the progress that has been made as regards stimulating and developing Coloured business undertakings which are controlled and managed by Coloured persons under the guidance of the Coloured Development Corporation. At the end of last year, when the latest report was published, this Corporation had more than R4 million at its disposal.</p>

<p>When visiting a Coloured area, one is impressed by the progress that has been made by the Coloured population, and that not all the Coloured business undertakings have been financed by the Coloured Development Corporation. One is impressed by the progress these people have made in regard to the development of their own business undertakings. The Coloured Development Corporation has approved 154 applications. A bank has been established for the Coloured population and these people are gaining experience in a sphere in which they have never been afforded the opportunity to gain experience before. We have Coloured directors of business firms to-day, directors of banks and managers of various other firms.</p>

<p>Sir, hon. members of the Opposition should take cognisance of the fact that the Coloured people are now being afforded the opportunity for the first time to come into own, to discover themselves and to prove that they are able to do their share and play their part in modern society. I want to say to hon. members that they should not be surprised if the Coloured people were to make an important contribution towards their own economic progress by virtue of the skill they possess to-day and which they are acquiring at the moment.

The hon. member for Malmesbury spoke and again made the old accusation about integration. I want to ask hon. members on the other side to give this Committee a definition once and for all of what the Government regards as integration. What is integration in the eyes of the Government&#x003F; As soon as we receive a definition of integration from that side, we on this side will say candidly whether we are in favour of it or not.

I can very easily stand here and accuse the Government of integration and I can mention one example after another, but what will this achieve&#x003F; [Interjection.] I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister, who has just made that interjection, to give us a definition of what the Government regards as integration; then we will know where we stand.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I draw a very clear distinction between integration and cooperation. The hon. member for Piketberg told us that we do not acknowledge the identity of the Coloured people. They have their own identity, whether you want to admit it or not; no one denies it; but co-operation with another population group in the interests of the country as a whole and in everybody&#x2019;s interest does not mean integration or loss of identity. Surely it would then mean that if the Afrikaans-speaking person co-operated with the English-speaking person, the Afrikaans-speaking person would lose his identity&#x003F; This is where we are talking at cross purposes. Hon. members use terms, and when one tests them, one finds that the words have no meaning. We on this side make no secret of the fact that we regard it to be in the interest of the future and security of the white people, just as much as in the interests of the Coloured people, that there should be co-operation between Whites and Coloureds in South Africa, which means recognition of identity.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to come to the hon. the Minister. An amount of R67,000 is provided on the Estimates this year for the Coloured Persons Representative Council. The hon. the Minister knows what the attitude of this side is in connection with the Coloured Persons Representative Council. In the same way as there are provincial councils and other councils with specific functions under the Parliament of South Africa, we admit that there is room for the Coloured Persons Representative Council in the period of adjustment and change which South Africa is experiencing in the field of human relations. At this stage there is room for a mouthpiece which can express the wishes of the Coloured community effectively. Obviously we prefer an elected body to one which is partly appointed. We are also keen that an effective link should be established between Parliament and the existing Coloured Persons Representative Council without delay.</p>

<p>I should very much like to know from the hon. the Minister whether the machinery for that has already been put in operation; what the Government is going to submit in this connection to the Coloured Persons Representative Council and Parliament for consideration, and when we can expect this link to be established. I really hope the Government will not delay. It was the Government which served the direct link which existed between the Coloured community and Parliament, limited and inadequate as it may have been. Now we have the situation where, for the first time, no direct voice can be heard in this House from anyone who represent the Coloured people. This Parliament, which must govern the whole of South Africa, must now rely on newspaper reports and external opinions on the Coloured community. This is <span class="col_5219-5220" refersTo="page_1167"/>not satisfactory. A few months ago, for example, a very ugly incident occurred at Ceres, where a large group of Coloured people resisted the Police for five hours. Subsequently there was a court case and the evidence which was produced in that case, and the bitter feelings of which evidence was given, are something which cannot leave the white community of South Africa cold, something of which cognizance should have been taken, and of which we would probably have taken cognizance if the Coloured people had had representatives in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park and other speakers quoted from speeches made by leaders of the Coloured community who are responsible, who are very close to the Government and who are prepared to co-operate with the Government, in which the most bitter feelings were expressed about the conditions to which they are submitted. This does not apply only to the Republic. A month or two ago there was a congress of the Coloured Organization of South-West Africa. This also falls under this hon. Minister. The Coloured Council there consists of members who were appointed as long ago as eight years, but to this day it is not yet an elected body. They also spoke with very great bitterness against the Government, the Administration and the Whites. For this reason we feel that it is of the utmost importance for this Government to establish a link between the Coloured community and Parliament as soon as possible. I hope the Government will take notice of the fact&#x2014;my hon. friend there referred to an &#x201C;apartheid party&#x201D; among the Coloured people &#x2014;I hope they will take notice of the fact that both Coloured parties in the Coloured Persons Representative Council unequivocally adopt the attitude that there can be only one effective link with Parliament, and this is direct representation of the Coloured people in this Parliament. If that agrees with what an apartheid party constitutes according to the hon. member for Malmesbury, the meaning of the term must be revised.</p>

<p>The Government is trying to hold up the Coloured Persons Representative Council as a sort of parliament which will in due course be able to fulfil almost all the functions in respect of the Coloured people which this Parliament fulfils in respect of them. We reject that argument. We also reject the argument that it is possible for the Coloured Persons Representative Council to develop into the position of a Parliament. If the Government can prove the contrary&#x2014;very well, then we shall obviously examine the matter. But it is mentioned with great satisfaction that the council now has &#x201C;control&#x201D; over more than R67 million. I should like to put a question to the hon. the Minister in this regard. I have compared the figures on the Estimates with those of the previous year. I found that certain provisions were made last year which are not being made this year. This applies, for example, to old-age pensions for Coloured persons, disability allowances, war veterans&#x2019; pensions, child care, grants-in-aid, school services, teachers&#x2019; salaries and primary, secondary and high schools. The provision made in the past in respect of these things almost amounts to the sum over which the Coloured Persons Representative Council now has &#x201C;control&#x201D;. I think the hon. the Minister will concede that pensions and teachers&#x2019; salaries are all fixed amounts which the Coloured Persons Representative Council surely cannot increase or decrease and over which, indeed, it therefore has no control.</p>

<p>In other words, in respect of the larger part of that amount of R67 million, the Coloured Persons Representative Council is, in my opinion, actually in the position of a payment office, and nothing more, which must pay out as the Government dictates. If this is not the case, I would be glad if the hon. the Minister could inform us. I would also be glad if the hon. the Minister could ell us how that amount of R67 million was estimated and over how much of that amount he can frankly say the Coloured Persons Representative Council really has full control as a Parliament would have&#x003F; I am therefore asking him exactly how that amount was estimated, and what portion of it the Coloured Persons Representative Council will be able to apply as it likes in the interests of the Coloured community&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

However, I am asking hon. members opposite whether the Coloureds are part of the white people of South Africa, or do hon. members opposite not admit that there is a white people in South Africa&#x003F; No, Sir, now they are sitting there trying to evade this simple question by making foolish remarks. They do not have the courage to say so. The hon. member for Houghton will tell us; she at least has the courage to put her point of view. All the other hon. members on that side of the House are trying to mislead the Coloureds with whom we have to live and whom we respect as being part of the population and as a separate people, but they do not even get as far as the first basic answer. Let the hon. member for Bezuidenhout reply &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; to that question.</p>

<p>The hon. member did not say anything; he tried to evade the issue but he did not have the courage to reply &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; to this simple question. Hon. members opposite want to know what integration is. I shall tell them. Integration means to allow the Coloureds to become part of the white people of South Africa. That is what integration means and that is something the Whites do not want. Strangely enough, as a people self-respecting the Coloureds do not want to have it either, and that is why I take off my hat to the Coloured people. I attended meetings at which Coloured leaders said so quite frankly to me and to the hon. the Minister. They told us: &#x201C;Gentlemen, we do not want to be Whites&#x201D;. I want to ask once more whether we will have to become one people and whether we should cease to be a white people&#x003F; Or should they become part of the white people&#x003F; What do hon. members opposite want&#x003F; Hon. members opposite know quite well that they are beating the air and, like Don Quixote, are toting at windmills and that they do not have the courage to reply to a simple question such as this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said there was nobody in this House who spoke on behalf of the Coloureds. If he is right, then I want to ask him something. This hon. the Minister and the Deputy Minister maintain close links with the Coloureds for the present&#x2014;and we know that we are going to have even further liaison. Surely, there is close liaison between the Department of Coloured Affairs and the Coloured people. These are people who are at least respected by the Coloured people because they are honest and because they tell these people where they stand as far as we are concerned. They are telling these people in all honesty where we are going and what it is that we want.</p>

<p>Yes, I am prepared to talk even louder, but that poor stupid member does not know what I am talking about. That is my problem. I can shout loud enough for him to hear, but I cannot give him the sense to understand. Our standpoint in this regard is that, because the Coloured people are a heterogeneous group, they are finding themselves on the difficult road of becoming a people. For that reason their leaders in the Coloured Representative Council have a difficult task to lead their people along the road of becoming a nation. I call this an offence and it is nothing else but scandalous every time to destroy and to ridicule the self-respect those people have in their own people and to promise them something they know they do not have the courage to give them. They hold out something for the Coloureds but every time I ask them a pertinent question, those wonderful bigwigs sit back in their chairs and do not even feel ashamed of themselves! If we on this side of the House should ever be reduced to that level &#x2026; I would rather not say anything more. You will call me to order, Sir. I just want to say that if this is political honesty, I should very much like to see what political dishonesty is. We told the Coloured people that we wanted to help them along the road to becoming a people, because we in South Africa believe that here are various peoples. I want to tell hon. members that the Coloureds have accepted that concept. One of their leaders said to the former Minister of Coloured Affairs in my presence one day: &#x201C;Sir, we do not want to be Whites.&#x201D; He used the term &#x201C;people&#x201D; (<i>volk</i>) and said: &#x201C;All we ask for our people, is that we should be protected against the intrusion of the Bantu.&#x201D; That concept has been brought home to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not even going to try to enter into this war between the hon. member for Namaqualand and the United Party. It is a private war and I am not keen to enter into it at all, apart from which there are many questions I want to put to the hon. the Minister. Before I do so, I want to make a few comments on one or two speeches other members have made. I want to say right away that I do not take up the same attitude as the United Party in this regard, namely to have the Coloureds as allies of the white people, presumably against that black people. I am not for this gangingup idea at all. I do not look upon the Coloureds as allies for future contests between the white people and the black people of South Africa. I look upon the two million Coloured people as simply another racial group in our multi-racial country of 21 million people, entitled to rights according to their individual merits. I shall not enlarge upon that, because it is the general policy of my party and is very well-known. I think it is all very well for white people to come along to this House and talk about how happy the Coloured people are with their lot. The hon. member for Malmesbury gave us the benefit of his opinion of how happy the Coloured people are. Things might be very different if we were listening to the Coloured people in this House telling us how satisfied or otherwise they were with their lot. I want to say exactly how happy I think the Coloured people are with their lot. The hon. members take no cognizance whatever of the significant attitude adopted by the Coloured people during the recent All Black international matches&#x003F; Do they not think that there is any significance whatsoever in the fact that the Coloured people, when they go to these rugby matches, cheer the team which is not the South African team&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That might well be because the hon. the Minister was playing. The point is that there is to-day marked antagonism. This is simply one of the manifestations. White people in South Africa are deluding themselves if they do not think that there is any significance in this fact. It is very significant indeed.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury told us that the Coloured people are accepting apartheid to-day. He mentioned that there were a considerable proportion of votes for apartheid in the elections for the Coloured council. What he did not tell us about was the number of abstentions in that election. He did not tell us that there was a percentage poll of less than 50 per cent and that very many Coloured people abstained altogether from voting. Had it not been for the fact that the Government packed the council with defeated candidates who had not been elected at the ordinary election, we would have had a very different Coloured council to-day. It would not have <span class="col_5225-5226" refersTo="page_1170"/>had a majority of members who are not clearly as anti-apartheid as for instance the Labour Party is.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Piketberg stated that a great deal had been done to assist the Coloured people to invest in their own businesses and to develop their own businesses in the Coloured areas. It is true that the Coloured Development Corporation has given assistance to the tune of something like R2&#x00BD; million by way of loans to about 118 undertakings, according to their report, but what upsets me is that by far the largest amounts have been given to liquor businesses in the Coloured areas. One of the real scourges of the Coloured population of South Africa is the degree of alcoholism. For the Coloured Development Corporation to give by far the largest amount, namely more than R700,000, to the development of liquor businesses, is, I think, showing very bad judgment in this regard.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to some of the questions I want to put to the hon. the Minister. What has happened to the liaison committee which was proposed by Mr. Tom Swartz&#x003F; Is it the intention of the hon. the Minister to set up such a committee&#x003F; What is he going to do about this committee if, for instance, the Opposition Labour Party refuses to co-operate&#x003F; What is the hon. the Minister going to do about the very strong resolution passed at the last meeting of the Coloured Representative Council, about equal pay for equal work&#x003F; Has anything come of this&#x003F; I know that he will tell us that salaries have been increased, but the resolution did not ask for an increase in salaries. It asked for equal pay for equal work in the Civil Service. It was a very strongly worded resolution indeed. Then, what is the hon. the Minister going to do about the question of compulsory education for the Coloured people&#x003F; This is a most pressing point. The Coloured people badly require compulsory education. I know that there is a desperate shortage of teachers, but let us at least set the aim and get moving. I cannot remember when last I heard of a new area for compulsory education for Coloured children being created. Is it not time that we started extending the areas for compulsory education for children&#x003F; Does the hon. the Minister know that there are to-day an additional number of 14,000 Coloured children in schools which are having double sessions&#x003F; What sort of education do children get by attending schools with double sessions&#x003F; I understand that the Coloured people who have been moved from District 6 to Hanover Park are going to an area where there is not going to be a school until 1972. I do not know whether this is absolutely correct but I should like to have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s answer. To move people from an area where there are schools to an area where there is not going to be a school for another two years seems to me to be quite mad.</p>

<p>What about housing&#x003F; During the discussion of the Community Development Vote I raised the issue of the desperate shortage of houses for Coloured people. I pointed out that in the greater Cape Town area alone there was an estimated shortage of, at the very least, 34,000 houses for Coloured people. What is the hon. the Minister going to do about this very serious position&#x003F; There has been a lot of talk about making industrialists responsible for providing houses for their workers. We had a good deal of this during discussions under the Community Development Vote. I want so say that I think this is a very bad idea indeed.</p>

<p>The idea of making industrialists responsible for providing houses for their workers. I will tell the hon. the Minister why I think it is a bad idea. This is tied employment. It is as simple as that. It means the workers are tied to their employment. It means that they are completely under the control of their employers. It means that if they want to change their jobs they have to take into consideration all sorts of things other than improvement in employment opportunities. They know that they are going to lose their houses.</p>

<p>Why&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because the white workers are skilled workers. The white workers know that there is a shortage of skilled workers. They have a far greater choice of jobs. They can command what salaries they want. Such is not the case with Coloured workers. The Coloured worker becomes tied to his employer if he has to rely on his employer to provide him with housing. It means that the employer very often can take advantage of the worker. He could charge him 15 per cent of his basic salary in rent and as the salary goes up so the rent goes up. If the worker does not like it, he loses his job and his house. Very often when the worker dies, his widow and family are put out of the house. The whole thing makes the worker a parasite as far as his employment is concerned. It is an idea which <span class="col_5227-5228" refersTo="page_1171"/>is discouraged in most modern industrial countries. I believe it is the State&#x2019;s responsibilty to supply housing.</p>

<p>The African domestic worker certainly is tied. He probably cannot get another job in an urban area and will be endorsed out. That is the whole position with non-White labour in this country. It does not have the choices and the options which white labour has. I think it is absolutely wrong for us to start a system with Coloured workers where they are going to be tied to their employers by this system of making them provide their houses.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall first of all just leave the hon. member for Houghton at that, because I have a more specific matter that I should like to deal with. In the Second Reading speech I expressed by concern about what I called the creation of an unbalanced Coloured metropolis here on the Cape Flats, and now, in the few minutes at my disposal, I want to take my argument further by once more emphasizing that here in the Western Cape where, as I see it, white and brown are destined to live alongside one another in our lifetime and in the lifetime of our children and their children, we shall have to look with newly-calculated haste at the process of the spatial organization of our Coloureds in the Western Cape. The question of white-brown relationships is, in the first place, a problem pertaining to our inhabitants of the Western Cape. In the long run it will have to be our disposition and our attitudes that will decide the course and the direction that we shall take. Against this background I now want to advocate that we should immediately give new growth momentum to our five old traditional Coloured townships here in the Boland. They are: Saron, Mamre, Pniel, Wittewater and Goedverwacht. We must take calculated action in respect of the creation of a new future pattern for these five old traditional Coloured townships, so that we may bring about a growth momentum that will fit in with the general development pattern of the Boland and will make these towns absolutely Bantu-free areas. I want to repeat: New calucated future patterns in respect of these old traditional Coloured townships that can develop them into absolutely Bantu-free areas.</p>

<p>For a period of 300 years the Coloured population of South Africa developed chiefly along the lines of social and economic dependence on the Whites in the Western Cape. You may go to-day to all our old Boland towns. There are, as we termed it in earlier years, a location, a Coloured township or a Coloured residential spot that have developed alongside the old Boland towns. How did this pattern develop through the years&#x003F; At present about 9.9 per cent of our country&#x2019;s white population lives in the Cape metropolitan area, as against 27.7 per cent of our country&#x2019;s brown population. Five per cent of our total white population lives in the rest of the Western Province, as against 20.2 per cent of the Republic&#x2019;s Coloured population. Let me state this figure in somewhat broader terms: 32.4 per cent of our white population lives in the Cape to-day, as against 88.1 per cent of our country&#x2019;s total Coloured population. If we now ignore the possibility of large numerical shifts among the Coloureds from the Western Cape to other economic growth points, it means that we shall have to give drastic attention to the process of the spatial organization of our brown people. Here in the Western Cape we shall have to create adequate economic development in order to meet this situation in the near future. I could now come along with complicated formulae as possible suggestions, but I think that there is one important starting point for us, and that is for us immediately to give colourful, I almost want to say dramatic, attention to ensure a new content and to bring new growth momentum to these five old traditional Coloured townships in the Boland.</p>

<p>The first is Mamre. In the Second Reading debate I delivered a plea for us to come forward here with what I called a prestige Coloured township. In the Boland&#x2019;s growth pattern to-day this area lends itself to such a process. Here is cheap agricultural land. Here is an area where we can obtain for the Coloureds a neat link-up with proper sea facilities. If we could create border area benefits in this area, or a sliding scale of taxation, I think that in our Boland pattern we could create a new area here for the Coloureds that we shall all be pround of. The same applies to the old traditional Coloured township Saron. This old township lies in the vicinity of our poorest Boland agricultural land. It lies in the vicinity of the Vo&#x00EB;lvlei Dam, where most of the water <span class="col_5229-5230" refersTo="page_1172"/>to-day is concentrated in the Boland pattern, and it lies on the main transport route to the north. I cannot imagine a geographic area within the Boland complex to-day where we could create more calculated new growth momentum on an economic basis that can bring about a growth point here that will bring more content to the spatial organization process for the brown people in the Boland.</p>

<p>There are the two other townships, Witte-water and Goedverwacht, two townships lying in the vicinity of our West coast. Annually we bring in literally thousands of Bantu from outside as migratory labourers in the various facets of the marine industry. It is an accepted fact that our brown people are more keenly attuned to the marine industry in all its various facets than the Bantu, but it is true that in recent years we have not trained the Coloured to make him serviceable for the great marine industry in all its various facets in the Western Cape. I want to make a plea here. Let us take these two Coloured townships, that fit into our Boland growth pattern, and let us create a new momentum here, new training in respect of the Coloured in all the various facets of our marine industry, in an area that fits into the growth pattern in the Boland, an area where we can work at a new Bantu-free complex. It is true that to-day all these coastal towns where we do training or preparation for the marine industry&#x2014;everywhere there are six or seven months of the year in which those Coloured townships and their environs are overrun by literally thousands of single Bantu men that are blackening this Coloured population for six or seven months of the year. I think the time has come for us to take a fresh look at this situation in our process of spatial organization. I want to advocate to the hon. the Minister that we obtain a new system of orientation and planning from the Department.</p>

<p>Lastly there is the very old, picturesque township Pniel, that one finds when one drives over the mountains at Stellenbosch. Where in the Boland to-day is there a Coloured township lying in a lovelier and more picturesque area than this old traditional township&#x003F; It fits into the Boland pattern in this respect that it is the area where we must carry out training for our Boland agricultural pattern on a very much larger scale than at any other point. The area lends itself to that. I am aware that at present we are doing important spade work, and we have been doing it for many years already, in respect of agricultural training for the Coloureds in the Boland, but it is actually only sporadic work that we have done. I ask myself whether, in this specific area, we should not create, on a much larger scale, a process of greater preparation, with much greater numbers, than we have done up to now in respect of preparing the Coloureds for agriculture.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park started here on a note of approach, but also with a clear request that the hon. the Minister should now ensure sound race relations, because there was great concern among them as a party about the growing antagonism the Coloured people felt towards the Whites. Now I want to ask a few questions with reference to what I had to listen to here this evening from various hon. members on the other side. [Interjections.] Since the hon. member has spoken about pin-pricks which must be removed, is it intended to remove pinpricks when the members of the Opposition in a responsible Parliament&#x2014;where everything is observed and subsequently read by these people for whom we must accept responsibility and who must be led by us, towards whom we must develop a good disposition and of whom we expect a good disposition&#x2014; speak here in this vein, point out the pinpricks and reproach this side of the House with a pinprick every time&#x003F; This side of the House has done much more for this population group than any previous Government, because it adopts the point of view that first things must come first, and these are the economic needs of the Coloured people as a group. For this reason the Government gave attention to the socio-economic aspect first, as far back as 10 years ago, and already at this stage we can produce splendid proof of the progress made in giving these people a place in the sun, something which certain hon. members on the other side try to suggest these people have not yet been given. Is it right to speak of and make reproaches about the inequality of salaries and not take into account the fact that with the recent increases, a ratio of approximately 60 per cent, Coloureds as against Whites, was improved to 75 per cent&#x003F; And this is not the end of the road, but what does equal pay for equal work mean&#x003F; Have you ever pondered on this, Sir&#x003F; What happened in the past when there was equal pay for equal work, and what would happen if job reservation were to be abolished as is so readily envisaged&#x003F; The Coloureds were pushed out and discriminated against, because in terms of this so-called equal pay for equal work, the white person is favoured. The Coloured person is also being protected in this process. Is it the object to try to avoid pinpricks or to eliminate pinpricks when hon. members talk about discrimination which allegedly is being over-emphasized by this side of the House&#x003F; The fundamental principle of our policy of multi-national and parallel development, which was clearly outlined by Dr. Verwoerd almost 10 years ago, is that we want to avoid discrimination between people, and we are eliminating it step by step and gradually. But do not think that I agree with the nonsense which is spoken about &#x201C;petty apartheid&#x201D;. No, do not begrudge the Coloured person a place in the sun and we acknowledge his contribution, but one first has to crawl before one can walk and one first has to walk before one can run. The reproach has been made that we <span class="col_5231-5232" refersTo="page_1173"/>do very little to make the Coloured person a friend of the white person. How can the Coloured person become a friend of the white person if he is continually being told, in the words of the hon. member for Houghton, what great injustices he is suffering&#x003F; Therefore, they are a people with a feeling of inferiority, which has developed over many years. If one continually feeds his grievances in this way in this type of debate in a responsible Parliament, where we are supposed to be responsible, what do you think the Coloured person&#x2019;s feeling will be eventually&#x003F;</p>

<p>If he knows everything himself, we should at least show him the respect of believing that he will think for himself and that he will discuss matters with us through the channels which are available to him at this stage. We should not continually prescribe to him in the white Parliament, because one of the reasons for the struggle we had here&#x2014;this was very clearly emphasized here by one of the hon. members &#x2014;was that the Coloured people eventually held the political balance in this country. They determined which of the two white parties would govern and eventually they themselves would have governed. Sir, is it advisable to refer to the executive of the Coloured Persons Representative Council as a &#x201C;rubber stamp&#x201D;&#x003F; Is it a good thing to harp on the question of compulsory education among people like the Coloureds to-day when the hon. member sitting over there hears year after year that we do not have the necessary teachers&#x003F; What point would it have to introduce compulsory education; what point would it have to build classrooms if one did not have teachers&#x003F; Where must they come from&#x003F; Has the hon. member noticed from the figures how, especially in the past two years, as a result of the attempts of this Government, and in recent times as a result of the efforts of their own Coloured Persons Representative Counoil, has the Coloured person to an increasing extent offered his services in the field of education&#x003F; The day will come when they will have compulsory education, but then one must be realistic. What point is there in building classrooms at a cost of millions of rand, which must be paid for from the pocket of the taxpayer at this stage, if there are not enough teachers to instruct those children&#x003F; There is no point in making promises all the time which you know full well you cannot keep and which merely go to create a feeling of frustration. Is it surprising, therefore, that these people remain full of grievances; is it surprising if they are continually being referred to as &#x201C;second-class citizens&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, I did not really intend referring to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. The hon. member is probably not stupid, but one thing is certain: In his own eyes he is clever as regards all these matters. He wants a definition of integration. I just want to tell him that the one kind of integration which is of importance in this Parliament, is integration of authority, and he wants to grant that integration of authority, to the Coloured person here, and after he has granted him that integration of authority, he wants to put a permanent damper on the future development of the Coloured people. He must not come forward with the ridiculous statement that the Whites will decide whether the Coloureds should receive more authority.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, he must not come forward with that story. What he said, merely amounts to this: He wants to grant integration of authority to the Coloured person, and then the Coloured person must be satisfied with six representatives for 700,000 voters. Sir, this is a policy of supremacy in, I almost want to say, its most despicable form. I think I have now dealt with that hon. member; I do not want to say anything more to him. In regard to the question of liaison, the hon. the Minister himself will reply to him later; we have progressed far also in that respect.</p>

<p>Sir, I just want to say to the hon. member for Houghton that it will be of no avail for us to reason with her about principles or about what we are envisaging for the Coloured people: I think we would just be wasting our time. But she put a few questions and I think we should reply to them to the best of our ability. She referred to the liaison committee in respect of which the Coloured Persons Representative Council took a decision last year. I can assure her&#x2014;in the meanwhile there have been minor misunderstandings, especially in the Labour Party about their leadership, with consequent delays&#x2014;that this matter is receiving attention. We hold out the prospect of finality being reached this year on the question of liaison. This is not a matter which one can precipitate; it is a matter which is in fact the subject of discussions between the Coloured Persons Representative Council and our highest authority, i.e. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of equal pay for equal work, I think we may leave the matter at that. We are moving in the direction of giving every person his due, but there are other aspects which must also be considered, such as the question of training, the question of the availability of funds, etc. We are at least moving forward, not backwards.

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister confined himself exclusively to the <span class="col_5233-5234" refersTo="page_1174"/>hon. member for Houghton and to replying to questions. But I just want to mention one matter which he mentioned in his speech a moment ago and which seems rather strange to me. He said that the Government wanted to bring about economic development among the Coloured people before political development. But when it comes to the Bantu, one finds precisely the opposite position, namely first political development and then economic development.</p>

<p>Sir, when the hon. member for Moorreesburg talks about Coloured Affairs, I listen to him with respect, because I have found in this House that he knows what he is talking about when he talks about the Coloured people. But during this session conflicting arguments have been advanced in this House in connections with the Coloured people. Firstly, I should like to come to the hon. member for Moorreesburg and to say to him that I think he is the most realistic member on his side of the House and that he adopts the most realistic approach in regard to the Coloured population of South Africa. I want to quote what he said in the Budget debate this year (Hansard, column 2120)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In our Boland situation to-day there are people who are beginning to think along completely different lines. We can no longer with a clear conscience continue to push the large Coloured population of the Boland with its Western way of life over to the side of the large majority of Bantu.</block>

<p>Furthermore, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is a new realization among our people to-day, that we will have to accommodate, particularly in the economic sphere, the Coloured population within the future pattern of the Boland, and allow them to enter into fuller and more effective partnership in our white Western civilization.</block>

<p>Sir, this statement made by the hon. member for Moorreesburg is very significant to me, especially where he spoke about a &#x201C;fuller and more effective partnership&#x201D; between the Whites and the Coloured community. I think hon. members opposite should re-read what the hon. member for Moorreesburg said. Perhaps words from their own ranks will bring them back to reality and realism. Sir, the point of departure of the hon. member is very clear to me, namely that he regards the Coloured community as part of Western civilization here on the southern tip of Africa and as a fuller and more effective partner of the Whites. Sir, in spite of this, only last week, in the debate on the Information Vote, we heard from the hon. the Minister of Information that total segregation of the Coloured people was the ideal, but he added that it was not practicable. The hon. the Minister does not talk of a more effective and fuller partnership with the Whites. No, on the one hand he clings tightly to the ideal of total segregation, but he does come back to earth when he says he accepts that it is not practicable. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs whether he accepts the Coloured community as a community which must have a fuller and more effective partnership with white South Africa. But Sir, then there is still the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. I am sorry that he is not present, because he referred to me as a &#x201C;little hon. member&#x201D;. I want to say to him at once that I realize I am a young member in this House, but I nevertheless want to make use of my right as an elected member in this House to ask him what his standpoint is in regard to the Coloured people. Sir, he said the following in the debate on the Bantu Administration and Development Vote. I want to quote what he said, because I do not want to put words into his mouth.</p>

<speech by="#fourie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it applies to the Coloured people. He said (Hansard, column 3510)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Whites do not want to share their own political authority with any other people in South Africa. When I talk about &#x201C;any other people in South Africa&#x201D;, I am referring only to the non-white peoples in South Africa.</block>

<p>By way of interjection I then asked him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What about the Coloureds&#x003F;</block>

<p>In reply to this, the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not want to share our independence with the Coloureds, in case that little hon. member does not know it yet.</block>

<p>Sir, to me this is completely in conflict with the standpoint adopted by the hon. member for Moorreesburg. A reasonable deduction which one can make from the Minister&#x2019;s statement is this: If we do not want to share our independence with the Coloured community, surely the Coloured people should share their own independence with themselves&#x003F; I should now like to know from the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs whether this is in the direction of a separate Colouredstan in South Africa&#x003F; Sir, here the hon. the Minister therefore aligns himself with the hon. the Minister of Information: &#x201C;Total segregation, also of the Coloureds&#x201D;, and this while the hon. member for Moorreesburg speaks about a &#x201C;new realization among our people&#x201D; and a &#x201C;fuller and more effective partnership&#x201D; with our Coloured people.</p>

<p>Sir, I now want to come to what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said. Hon. members <span class="col_5235-5236" refersTo="page_1175"/>on the other side must tell us what they mean by integration. I want to ask the hon. the Minister: Is there integration between Whites and Coloureds if they live together with us here in one country&#x003F; We are abused if we say that we accept also the Bantu as part of one great South Africa; then we are abused as being integrationists.</p>

<p>The Minister said it; I can quote it to the hon. member again.

Sir, I want to quote from an article which appeared in <i>Dagbreek</i> on 30th August this year (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then we can also see the dilemma of the Whites in their actions towards the Coloured people. In spite of much that is being said, it is clear that the Whites are constantly searching for an answer to the problem of the Coloureds. They are searching for the answer because they feel that it is not simply a clear-cut case. It is not merely a matter of apartheid and nothing more. In regard to the Bantu, the Whites say, &#x201C;Separate development: full stop&#x201D;; in regard to the Coloured people, they say &#x201C;Separate development: question mark&#x201D;.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I was replying to a few questions which hon. members had raised here. I was replying to a question by the hon. member for Houghton. [Interjections.] Sir, we are dealing with serious matters. I know that the hon. member does not regard the question of the Coloured people as a serious matter. He plays political football with the Coloured people. The hon. member for Houghton raised a question here which in my opinion is an important one. She said that housing projects are established and that there were subsequently no schools for the children. This is a matter which puts us in a dilemma in more than one respect. When housing projects are established, as she herself knows, it sometimes happens very soon that there is a demand for schools. After the housing project has been completed as planned by the architect, it takes a considerable time before a school can be erected. As <span class="col_5237-5238" refersTo="page_1176"/>regards this problem of Hanover Park, I can tell her that it was immediately realized that we had to take more rapid action here, and that a process was initiated there. As hon. members know, unavoidable delays do occur sometimes. But at this stage the Treasury is investigating the matter so that a considerable number of classrooms may be erected in Hanover Park according to the new pre-construction system. In this way attempts will be made to have the classrooms ready so that school accommodation will be available to most of these children early next year. I can give the hon. member the assurance that this matter is really receiving attention.</p>

<p>She also referred to housing. It is, after all, the Department of Community Development and the local authorities which are concerned here. The Department of Coloured Affairs can submit pleas in this connection. We can plead with them, but we ourselves do not have the executive authority to get this task done. I do not want to argue any further with the hon. member about the question of employees who are tied to employers and who are placed under an obligation, as it were, the moment they accept housing. But I think in this respect she has mounted a horse which will not take her very far. Nowadays it is the position all over the whole world that housing forms part of services to employees.</p>

<p>The hon. member should not get upset so quickly. She should rather listen to what is being said; then she will receive wisdom.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton also wanted to know why Mr. Tom Swartz never officiated at the opening of a school, etc. I think she actually intended to ask why the five leaders of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, the executive committee, did not officiate on such occasions. If the hon. member read the little publication entitled <i>Alpha,</i> she would see that some of these members often officiate on such occasions. It is simply not being given so much publicity. As the leader, Mr. Swartz does, of course, travel around more and officiate more often at political meetings. Admittedly, this is not so often the case on occasions of this nature, but I can give the hon. member the assurance that the services of these people are in fact being used, because we want to develop them among their own people, for they deserve to be developed.</p>

<p>I feel I should just say a few words about a request which the hon. member for Moorreesburg made to me. Incidentally, the hon. member for Moorreesburg received fine compliments from the hon. member for Turffontein. Now, I may as well tell the hon. member for Turffontein that if he is as sincere as he sounded, I think he should go on struggling with his ideas. At this stage he is still in a whirlpool of very troubled waters. If he lies awake many nights, he will also receive clarity, in the same way as many of us had to lie awake, too. [Interjections.] If hon. members have quite finished amusing themselves, I shall continue.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are certain persons who say that we should solve the Coloured problem now. The United Party wants the National Party to solve this problem now, in spite of the fact that they could not solve it after many years. There are others who say that our descendants must find the solution. I want to tell them that there is one thread which runs right through, even in the academic approach and among people who sometimes differ with us in regard to the matter. This thread is that the future pattern should already be determined by this generation and this Government. We are concerning ourselves with this and it is being implemented gradually. The finishing touches will be added by future generations. This is exactly what the hon. the Prime Minister said. If hon. members want to refer to what he said, they will see that this is what he said. Even the hon. member for Houghton agrees with this, because sometimes she thinks very clearly. Any person would be arrogant to think that he could outline as easily as this the final road of a growing and developing people with a pencil. We have paved the way and the parallel roads next to one another, and we shall continue along this course. However, it is for a future generation to add the finishing touches.</p>

<p>I want to start replying to the hon. member for Moorreesburg now, otherwise I shall not have enough time. This hon. member raised a very interesting matter here, namely that we should think of decentralizing the geographic planning in respect of the Coloured people to areas which have traditionally been inhabited by the Coloured people and in which there are old townships where the Coloured person feels at home. We know that the numbers of the Coloureds have increased very much in recent times, and that it may possibly create a dilemma for us here in the Western Cape and in the Peninsula. I want to tell him briefly that the matter in regard to Mamre was investigated several years ago. Arising from the report of an inter-departmental committee, which investigated the question of Mamre and its development almost three years ago, the Minister decided as long ago as 31st July, 1968, that in the light of circumstances and the obvious need for a second point of development for the Coloured people which would have to extend right down to the coast in order to meet all the needs of an independent urban complex as well as beach facilities for Coloureds from elsewhere, the Department of Planning had to pay immediate attention <span class="col_5239-5240" refersTo="page_1177"/>to defining the area of the proposed urban complex on the West Coast. I am talking about Mamre and its environs. The hon. member knows that area. It ought to be a continuous area from the sea on the west coast up to and including Mamre. The existing obvious beach area is located opposite this development area. While land in the vicinity could still be obtained reasonably easily and cheaply, the State should at least buy Cruywagenskraal and a few other farms between Mamre and the west coast. The land which was not required for immediate development, could be used for the farming community of Mamre. The said decision was then submitted to the Department of Planning. Areas were defined in accordance with what the hon. member advocated here in respect of Mamre. The standpoint is that the Mamre township will develop normally. I want clarity in regard to this matter, and I also want to make this clear: The Mamre township will develop normally, as largescale development there would change the character of the area as a result of an influx from elsewhere which will not only be foreign to the management board and the community, but which may also be regarded by them as a breach of promise, since land allocated as a rural area, would then be used for other purposes.</p>

<p>In view of the need for beach facilities along the west coast, it is therefore advisable that the farm opposite Silwerboom Strand should be acquired and developed as a township, also for the settlement of Coloureds from the Milnerton industrial area. The idea is that they would then leave from Milnerton, because they would be coming from two directions, namely from the Cape Flats and from Milnerton. The whole area between Mamre and the sea should therefore be reserved for Coloured development. For this reason the Department of Planning coloured in the advertisement for the proclamation of the group areas for Coloured persons at Mamre in such a way that the whole area would be included. This is indicated on a sketch. As I explained to the hon. member, this is the area which he had in mind.</p>

<p>To-day we need a considerable amount of land for existing institutions such as the Porter Reformatory and the Klaasjagersberg Children&#x2019;s Home. We need land for an old age home for Coloured persons run by the State. We already have a State old age home elsewhere, as well as a rehabilitation centre, etc. However, more and more land is needed. We are trying to move those complexes to the rural areas, because we believe it will serve to attract people to those areas. Therefore, if group areas are approved as advertised, the development of a township along Silwerboom Strand will not only be a home for the surplus of Coloured persons from the Cape Flats, but will also provide us with a growth point which will provide beach facilities for all the Coloured persons north of Cape Town and in the Boland. The other places which he mentioned, still have problems with their development. Pniel is the <i>de facto</i> property of the community. There is talk of expansion, but no expansion has taken place as yet. Saron has already been transferred to the management board of the community. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has been answering questions which have arisen during the course of the debate. I propose to put further questions to him or to the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs. I am mainly concerned, in the first instance, with the lack of adequate facilities for the Coloured people in the Wentworth area in Durban. The Wentworth area in Durban comprises the largest concentration of Coloured people. In the first place, I should like to deal with sporting and recreational facilities. At the beginning of this Session a problem arose which was reported in the newspapers, namely that action had been taken in respect of sporting functions which had taken place between Coloured and Indian people. I made attempts through the normal channels to seek an interview with the hon. the Minister, because I felt that this was a subject which we could discuss on other than a political plain. Unfortunately my efforts were not successful and for that reason I raise this matter under the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote. One has to consider what the position is in so far as the Coloured people of Natal are concerned. They represent a small minority group of the population. They do not have the numbers to develop a complete sport set-up of their own. We have, however, a large concentration of Indians. It is my belief that in the past there have been friendly competitions and mixed sport between Coloured and Indians in Natal. When we come to the Cape I think we will find that the exact opposite applies. Here we have a large concentration of Coloured people, but the numbers of Indians are insufficient for them really to stand alone when it comes to competitive sport. My suggestion to the hon. the Minister therefore is that he could play his part in seeing that in these cases there is no obstacle raised in so far as participation in sport between these two groups is concerned. I am aware that recent edicts have announced that the question of permits has been eased. I believe, however, the problem is mainly one of delay. I know of a recent case in Port Shepstone on the South Coast in Natal, where both race groups are in small numbers. Before they could participate in a mixed sporting fixture it was necessary for them to make application for a permit. I do not believe that the average individual in South Africa realizes what is best to do, namely, whether application should be made to the Department of Coloured Affairs or the Department of Community Development.</p>

<p>My appeal to the hon. the Minister is whether it is not possible to make some arrangement whereby, when applications are made on a local level, they are dealt with on a local level and that they do not have to go first to the Department of Coloured <span class="col_5241-5242" refersTo="page_1178"/>Affairs, then to the Department of Community Development and then possibly either to Cape Town or Pretoria. If the hon. the Minister is prepared to give sympathetic consideration to this suggestion and to use his influence with his colleague the Minister of Community Development, many of these difficulties could be done away with and many of the cliff-hanging decisions which crop up, at the last minute and which mean frustration, disappointment and delay to the people who are awaiting a decision, would be altogether overcome.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to deal specifically with the question of sport facilities in the Wentworth complex. I speak as a member of the Council for Culture and Recreation for the past three years. I am fully aware of the valuable spade-work and ground-work that has been done by this body. But, Sir, there are many delays which are cuasing a great deal of frustration amongst the Coloured people themselves. The Coloured people claim that in the past five years there has been no evidence of progress being made in the provision of sports facilities in the area of Wentworth. They have reached the stage where they say quite openly that they are very dubious of seeing any tangible development there in the near future. I realize why the progress is slow. It is a matter which embraces the activities of many Government Departments. It concerns the Department of Coloured Administration. It concerns the Department of Community Development and in this instance it also concerns the Department of Police. I believe too that in the final stages the Department of Public Works will be involved. Then there is a further problem in that local authority is also involved.</p>

<p>Finally, overriding all these difficulties, comes a very trite question, the question of finance. Finance may become available as a result of the generosity of the Minister of Finance, or it may not, as a result of problems which affect the finances of local authorities. I believe that in this instance, if the hon. the Deputy Minister were able to cut down some of the departmental red tape, he would be doing the people he represents in this House a very great service.</p>

<p>There is another matter which is causing disappointment and further frustration to the Coloured people. That is in regard to the provision of halls and community centres, primarily in areas for the Coloured people. I know that there have been applications by well-meaning bodies, who would assist the Coloured people in the provision of such community halls. I know that there have been discussions, but unfortunately there has been no finality to date. I know that there again other departments are involved. I am satisfied in my own mind, from my brief background knowledge of the situation, that the modification and use of school halls will not be an answer to the problem. There will have to be rethinking on this particular aspect. I know too that other departments have given this matter a great deal of thought, but I believe that up to the present there has been no satisfactory conclusion to this matter. The frustration is growing. I believe it is not a good sign that people should be so frustrated for so long.</p>

<p>I want to come to another vexed question in this particular community of Wentworth. That is the question of housing. I am glad the hon. the Minister of Defence is here, because he will probably remember that five years ago, when he was the Minister of this portfolio, we discussed this very question. I want to say to this Committee that the progress has been disappointing in the extreme. I realize that there are problems, but the fact is that the houses are not being provided at a rate commensurate with the demand. I believe that the Coloureds in the Durban area are worse off than any other racial group in that area. I know that the demand exceeds the supply. I know too that the provision of houses is in the main the concern of the Department of Community Development, but I feel that the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs should know that the reaction from the Coloured people, when his hon. colleague said that he had not received applications for houses, was that this statement was not only misleading, but virtually untrue. I say to the hon. the Minister that the position in the Durban area is serious. Whatever influence he can use in this regard will be appreciated by people whose patience is running out.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to deal with the question of schools. When one studies the Loan Vote, one sees that the proportionate expenditure on the Loan Vote as far as Natal schools are concerned, is low, in relation to the number of students. What one has to bear in mind is that in the Wentworth area there are students who are attending schools outside the Wentworth area because they are unable to find accommodation in the area itself. I am aware that two new schools have been planned, but I believe that the situation requires attention, because we in Natal have compulsory education, in terms of the regulations, for the Coloured people, up to Std. 8 or the age of 16.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Acting Leader of the House will forgive me if I start my speech to-night by referring to him. As I sat looking at him, I noticed in what a relaxed and calm manner he, as the Minister who previously handled this portfolio, was listening to-night to the Opposition&#x2019;s ideas and argumentation. He is a person who, for a long time, struggled with this problem and devoted his attention to it, and I think that it must have made him a very happy person to-night to see that the criticism expressed on the Opposition side, is actually devoid of any substance. I am not saying this in order to detract in any way from <span class="col_5243-5244" refersTo="page_1179"/>quite a number of fine speeches that came from the United Party. I am thinking in particular of the hon. member for Turffontein. He tried to-night to play-off the hon. member for Moorreesburg against other hon. members. I want to tell the hon. member that this reminds me of a certain occasion, approximately 10 years ago, when I attended a meeting one night. On that occasion there was, amongst others, a youngish student who was putting questions to the present Minister of Defence. I think I can refer to the hon. member as being &#x201C;youngish&#x201D;. I do not know whether he is a student. That young man advanced arguments of the same type, and I still remember the neat way in which, as long ago as that, the National Party disposed of the arguments which the hon. member mentioned here tonight. I may just add that to-night the hon. member for Moorreesburg once again, as he also did on the previous occasion, presented us with a very calm and positive contribution in respect of the development of the Coloured population, or the &#x201C;brown people&#x201D;, as he calls them.</p>

<p>Of course I agree with him in everything he said. I do not think that it is fair of the hon. member to say that I am not honest in saying that I agree with the hon. member for Moorreesburg. His views on the development and growth points which are to be created at the traditional places inhabited by the Coloured population, are a splendid idea. I want to tell the hon. member for Moorreesburg that if I get the opportunity, I should very much like to discuss those matters with him.</p>

<p>However, I want to come to the hon. Opposition. They suggested that the National Party actually had no solution to this so-called problem in respect of the Coloured population. Then they profess to be the people who have the final solution. They are trying to suggest that their solution complies with all the requirements as far as the critics of South Africa are concerned. I want to refer the hon. members for Turffontein, Bezuidenhout and Newton Park to a book written by K. L. Roskam. The title of the book is <i>Apartheid and Discrimination.</i> This book was written by a young university graduate who came out to South Africa a few years ago in order to make a specific study of the so-called population and race problems in South Africa. He laid down certain very definite conditions with which a country had to comply so as not to be guilty of discrimination.</p>
