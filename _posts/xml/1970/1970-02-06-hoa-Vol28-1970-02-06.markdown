<p>Ever since private schools came into being in South Africa, the right of admission thereto has vested in the governing bodies of such schools.

<li>(1) No&#x2014;only in connection with the establishment of a by-product depot at Skukuza for the processing of game carcasses into biltong, blood-and bone meal. The enterprise was undertaken for the following reasons:

<li>(i) From the viewpoint of nature conservation viz. to reduce the numbers of certain species of game which became too abundant in certain parts, thus threatening the continued existence of the park.</li>

<li>(ii) The laws regulating Veterinary Services prohibit the export from the Park of live or unprocessed game, with the exception of Quagga which are sold to farmers.</li>

<li>(6) whether any precautions have been taken to prevent the hijacking of aircraft of South African Airways on both domestic and international flights; if not. why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#webber">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) There was no &#x201C;Amsterdam Conference on hijacking of Aircraft&#x201D;. South African Airways were, however, represented by two officials at the Annual General Meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) which took place in Amsterdam during 1969. At this meeting the question of hijacking formed an agenda item and a resolution was adopted which IATA communicated to my Department and which called upon States to take all measures necessary to end any further unlawful interference with aircraft in public air transport service and to support any action already taken or which may be taken by the United Nations or the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).</li>

<li>(2) No. Although consideration has and is being given to the Republic of South Africa becoming a party to the Tokyo Convention, no decision has been reached. It is generally accepted that the present provisions of the Tokyo Convention has certain shortcomings, especially as regards hijacking of aircraft. In 1969 the council of ICAO established a &#x201C;special committee on unlawful interference with civil aviation and its facilities&#x201D;. During December, 1969, ICAO announced that a special draft treaty dealing solely with unlawful seizure of aircraft had been developed. After this draft had been considered by the ICAO Legal Committee in March, 1970, the draft treaty would be presented for adoption by a diplomatic conference later during 1970. Further consideration will be given to the question when the results of the March, 1970, meeting of the ICAO Legal Committee is known.</li>

<li>(3) No. I am not aware of any other agreements except the Tokyo Convention. The question, however, is confusing and if the honourable member is referring to extradition agreements, then it is not a matter to be dealt with by my Department.</li>

<li>(4)

<ol>

<li>(a) The Republic has bilateral agreements with the following States: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Botswana. Denmark. Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Malawi. Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden. Switzerland, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America.</li>

<li>(b) It is assumed that in this context the term &#x201C;multilateral air agreement&#x201D; means a convention dealing with aviation. If so, the Republic is a party to&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) Convention for the unification of certain rules relating to international carriage by Air (Warschau, 1929) as amended by the Hague Protocol (1955).</li>

<li><span class="col_377-378" refersTo="page_0201"/>(ii) Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago, 1944).</li>

<li>(iii) International Air Services Transit Agreement (Chicago, 1944).</li>

</ol></li>

</ol></li>

<li>(5) No. The bilateral agreements deal with traffic rights and matters pertaining thereto and as far as I know, such agreements between other countries do not contain provisions concerning hijacking.</li>

<li>(6) I am of the opinion that it is not in the public interest to disclose the information called for.</li>

<answer by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) and (b) Such steps were not taken from South Africa&#x2019;s side. In the case of telecommunications traffic between the Republic and certain countries in South America, use is made of circuits in the Trans-Atlantic cable between South Africa and Spain, from where transit facilities in the form of satellite circuits via the Spanish ground station and the South Atlantic satellite are provided to and from the countries of destination by the private company in charge of Spain&#x2019;s telecommunications affairs. The satellite circuits in question are the sole responsibility of that company. At this stage the possibility exists that a similar service may be introduced between the Republic and the United States of America only.</li>

<li>(2) The establishment of a ground station in South Africa and the use of direct satellite communications are not contemplated at present for the reasons set out in my statement of 13th May, 1969.</li>

<p>asked the Minister of Health:</p>

<p>Whether, in the light of the tests under taken by the South African Bureau of <span class="col_413-414" refersTo="page_0219"/>Standards in connection with pesticide residue hazards, mentioned in the 24th Annual Report of the Bureau, he will make a statement indicating (a) the extent of the contamination of crops, produce and water supplies, (b) whether such contamination is in a concentration sufficient to endanger the health of human and animal life and (c) the steps to be taken to prevent or minimize such effects.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_health" to="#wood">

<from>The MINISTER OF HEALTH:</from>

<ol>

<li>(a) and (b) No routine tests for pesticidal residues in crops, produce or water supplies are undertaken by the South African Bureau of Standards. The pesticidal tests to which the hon. member refers were undertaken by the Bureau for registration purposes at the request of applicant manufacturers and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Suitability, effectiveness and poison tolerance are amongst others, prerequisites for the registration of any agricultural remedy and it was for this purpose that the tests concerned were carried out by the Bureau of Standards and not directly in connection with general consumers food or water. It can be expected, however, that agricultural products which were treated with pesticides would for a prescribed safety period have undesirable residues, but if the products are not marketed before the expiry of this period, no hazards will arise therefrom. The sampling of foodstuffs and domestic water supplies is the responsibility of local authorities. No instance of excessive pesticidal residues in food or domestic water has been brought to the notice of the Department. Moreover no dangerous quantities of pesticidal residues were found in any of the samples sent to departmental laboratories for analysis.</li>

<li>(b) Only recently I have approved of the withdrawal of a Government Notice which, as early as 1951, declared insecticidal poisoning as a notifiable disease, and the substitution thereof by a new notice which will shortly be published and whereby poisoning in any form by insecticides and pesticides will be declared a notifiable disease in the whole of the Republic.</li>

</ol>

<p>Information thus obtained will enable the Department of Health to take the steps which may be required to combat the danger.</p>

<from>Mrs. H. SUZMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Transport:</p>

<p>Whether steps have been taken to prevent a repetition of the conditions which led to the loss of livestock through thirst, starvation and overcrowding at Johannesburg railway sidings during January, 1970; if so, what steps, if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<p>Presumably the hon. member refers to the circumstances which resulted from the congestion at the Newtown Abattoir during January, 1970.</p>

<p>The difficulties experienced were brought about by the inadequate kraal facilities provided by the Johannesburg Municipality and the consequent inability of consignees to take delivery of all livestock. The Railways Administration cannot, therefore, accept responsibility for the conditions which existed at the time.</p>

<p>The re-introduction of the quota system by the Livestock and Meat Industry Control Board should prevent a recurrence of similar conditions in the future.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the start I wish to move, as a further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House reaffirms its full confidence in the National Party and the manner in which it governs South Africa and in which it deals with the internal and external problems of the country&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Yesterday evening I had the opportunity to refer briefly to certain urgent matters. Of course, I was asked by my hon. friend the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to reply to the charge sheet which he brought in against me, my Government and the National Party when he moved this motion of no confidence. Among other things, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled the customary reproach at me that I am a weak leader. Let me tell the hon. the Leader that if he glances at Hansard, he will see that he levelled the same reproach at my predecessors. They were better men than I; how much the more, then, would he not level this reproach at me? The question of whether I am a weak leader or whether the hon. member is a good leader is not really something the hon. member and I can settle between ourselves. It is a matter which only the electorate of South Africa can decide. As for me, I want to say that it is with great confidence that I leave this matter entirely in the hands of the electorate. In the meantime, I do not have the impression that the voters outside like the hon. member more than they like me, since he has now placed this matter on a personal level. I do not know how things are going with the hon. member&#x2019;s meetings, but I am quite satisfied with the way in which the public are attending my meetings to hear my standpoint and that of my party. I was particularly struck by this when I went to Durban to address a public meeting in the city hall there. I drove from the Louis Botha Airport to the city hall. On a number of poles there were two placards, one above the other&#x2014;the one announcing the hon. member&#x2019;s meeting at the top, and the other announcing my meeting below it. It amused me so much that I asked a friend to take a photograph of them for me. The placard announcing my meeting read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Stadsaal: Openbare vergadering.</block>

<block name="quote">City Hall: Public Meeting.</block>

<block name="quote">22 September/September 22nd, 8 nm./p.m.</block>

<p>In addition there was the customary photograph fitting to the occasion. That was all. The hon. member&#x2019;s placard was extremely interesting. The customary photograph was on a television screen. All that Stood underneath it was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Div</block>

<block name="quote">Montclair Hall/Saal</block>

<block name="quote">Band, Bar, Braai</block>

<p>[Laughter.] I shall gladly send it to my hon. friend for perusal. I just want to say, Sir, seeing that the hon. member has now made a personal attack on me, that it has never been necessary for me to try to ensure a full attendance at my meetings by getting a-&#x201C;band&#x201D;. It has never been necessary for me to have a &#x201C;bar&#x201D;, and it has never been necessary for me to be &#x201C;braai-ed&#x201D;. I just want to say in passing, since the hon. member has now thrown matters onto the basis of our respective personalities, that I find this surprisingly interesting.</p>

<p>But then the hon. member went further and stated that I had called this election because I was afraid. It was a panic reaction on my part. But, Sir, there is nothing new in this. The hon. member is not only accusing me now; he accused my worthy predecessor, the late Dr. Verwoerd, in precisely the same words. I shall quote to the hon. member from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 1st October, 1961. He then reacted to the then election announcement by Dr. Verwoerd as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir De Villiers described the election on 18th October as &#x201C;the frightened election&#x201D;, because of the Government&#x2019;s fear that it would not be returned to power if it held the election on the normal date in 1963. Dr. Verwoerd knew that he could not sustain the bluff of apartheid much longer.</block>

<p>Then we punished him more severely in that election than Graeme Pollock punishes a cricket ball, and then we punished him again in 1966. But after all those things the hon. member is now making precisely the same accusation. It might interest the hon. member for Yeoville to know that in that same speech in 1961 the hon. the Leader of the Opposition put precisely the same two questions to Dr. Verwoerd which he has now put to me, i.e. in regard to the &#x201C;contributory pension scheme&#x201D; and the &#x201C;sound family health scheme&#x201D;, as well as in regard to &#x201C;better education and increased security&#x201D;. I shall deal with this later, as may be opportune.</p>

<p>The hon. member will of course understand now that I cannot devote all my time to him, for a new leader has appeared in this House. I must devote my time to him as well. Indeed, Sir, I must take notice of the new leader, the hon. member for Ermelo, for this is not an everyday leader. This is a leader with a distinction. This is a leader with two testimonials, a requested testimonial from an unnamed minister of religion, and another testimonial from a well-known Judge. Consequently, I must also devote attention to this hon. member. But I shall deal first with the less important accusations the hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled at me.</p>

<p>The hon. member accused me of changing the terms of reference of the Judge who was entrusted with the inquiry into the security position. I would be pleased if the hon. member for Yeoville would allow the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to give me his attention. <span class="col_435-436" refersTo="page_0230"/>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition accused me of having wrongly changed the terms of reference. On what grounds does the hon. member base his charge? There are no legal grounds for it, nor did the hon. member advance any grounds for his charge. But what did we have here now? I would be pleased if the hon. member would furnish me with a reply to that question. Here we had a commission which had to institute an inquiry into the security set-up, the composition and everything related to that, because, and I also stated this in public, I was concerned that South Africa should have only the best security set-up. We who are intimately concerned with this matter, cannot form an objective opinion as to whether there are not better methods to ensure the security of South Africa. It is not only South Africa that has taken such a step. Many countries, Australia, for example, have taken the step of appointing a Judge to perform precisely the same task. While this Judge was engaged on his task, the hon. member for Ermelo made accusations to the effect that the amount which had been made available was not the R4 million for which provision had been made on the Estimates, but that it was closer to R50 million. What other deduction could anyone have made from that, but that the hon. member for Ermelo was blazing it abroad that large-scale deception was being practised here; not only deception of the public, but also deception of Parliament. It means that the Prime Minister and Parliament were giving out that only R4 million was being appropriated, but that the amount in fact came to R50 million. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition expect me to have left it at that? Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition expect me, taking into consideration our security position, and taking into consideration how delicate these matter are. to have simply dismissed it with a shrug of the shoulders? Here a responsible &#x2026;, no, I may not use the word, here an hon. member comes along, who previously served in the Cabinet for many years, and makes this allegation. I had every right to refer it to a Judge. I want to state here now that if the same circumstances were to repeat themselves, I would again refer allegations of this nature to a Judge. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, in the same way as I and any other member, is concerned that there should be no corruption or any trace of corruption. If such charges are levelled, they must therefore be investigated. I am astonished that the hon. Leader of the Opposition is levelling a reproach at me because of this. For what did I do? By advising the State President, I had that charge investigated in public by a Judge, and the witnesses were called. It is part of history now that the brave member for Ermelo was not prepared to substantiate under oath his statement in which he had uttered an untruth in public. In passing, I just want to draw attention to the Judge&#x2019;s remark, i.e. that there is not an atom of truth in the allegations. That was the language of the court. The ordinary person would say that the hon. member for Ermelo had told a lie.</p>

<p>I should also like to point out in passing that the court stated that in so far as the hon. member for Ermelo had said that he had heard it from others, it was very clear, even from the finding of the court, that the court doubted very much whether he could have heard it from another person. I do not know of any one outside an asylum from whom he could have heard it. I think, and I charge the hon. member for Ermelo with having done this, that he either sucked it out of his thumb or sucked it out of his deputy leader&#x2019;s thumb. I therefore reject the accusation made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition because I had had that matter investigated. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware of the fact that various complaints have been made against the Bureau for State Security. If the hon. the Leader is not satisfied with that aspect in regard to which the hon. member for Durban (North) has just informed him, he can put questions to me. I shall place myself at his disposal. The hon. the Leader is aware of the kind of gossip about this Bureau which is being bruited abroad. I want to refer to two of these stories, because I should like to have this placed on record. The staff of this Bureau, from its head all the way down, have no powers of arrest. Nor do they have any powers of detention whatsoever. Its task is the collection of information. In that regard section 29 was inserted. It would be as well and fitting that I should say a few words about section 29 on this occasion. In terms of our common law any head of a State Department, even a subordinate head, had the right to issue a certificate which provided that evidence in regard to a certain matter could not be given, and to present this certificate to the court. During my period of Office as Minister of Justice I myself once issued such a certificate. I want to illustrate the case to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The facts of the case were that a person had written a letter to the Department in which he had made certain charges against a messenger of the court. The messenger of the court came to hear about this. He demanded that the letter be produced. In fact, my private secretary was summonsed to come and produce that letter in court, for this man wanted to bring a libel action against that member of the public as a result of what he had heard. I issued a certificate to the effect that it was not in the interests of the public that the contents of that letter be disclosed. I did so for the simple reason that it is the elementary right of members of the public to complain about officials. If letters in which members of the public complain about officials can be produced, then you are depriving the public of the feeling of liberty or the right to complain about officials. This is also as I stated it to the court. The hon. member for Durban (North) is aware of that Transvaal case. The Transvaal court acknowledged that I was right. However, as time went by, different court decisions were given. What it <span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0231"/>boiled down to eventually was that one set of court decisions stated that the Minister and the head of a department had the power to withhold evidence, while the other set of decisions stated that it was the courts that could decide on the matter, and not the Minister or the head of a department. Then that clash arose in an Appeal Court case. Normally it went to the Department of Justice and normally the Department of Justice settled the case by means of section 29. But section 29 has nothing whatsoever to do with the Bureau for State Security as such. It was not introduced as a result of the establishment of that Bureau and it has nothing to do with it. It was a question of lack of clarity which arose as a result of decisions by Supreme Courts in regard to what the common law position in this connection should be.</p>

<p>No. Unfortunately the Calitz case which came before the Appeal Court gave a decisive ruling in regard to that particular case only. The cardinal principle remained undecided.

<p>He dare not look one in the eyes. He made another attack at Witbank, which in essence amounted to this, that I could now take that R4 million for myself and nobody would even know about it. It is such a dirty insinuation that no decent person would take any notice of it. I want to go further and say that no decent person would make such an allegation on a public platform.</p>

<p>As I have said, that commission was appointed because I was desirous of giving South Africa only the best in that sphere.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, the second charge the hon. member made against me was that I had allegedly stated in 1969 that all the members of my party at the time subscribed to the policy of my party. Now the facts have shown that I was wrong. I want to make the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a gift of this argument. I was wrong and he is right in this connection. I was wrong for the simple reason that I believed at the time that I could rely on the honesty and integrity of certain people. That is why I gave that assurance. To-day I am painfully aware of the fact that I cannot rely on honesty and integrity as far as some gentlemen in this House are concerned. I gave my country and my people that assurance at the time because all the matters in regard to which disputes subsequently arose had continually been discussed in party bodies and because votes had often been taken on these matters at congresses and other party occasions. At the 1966 congress the hon. member for Ermelo declared that I would never have to look behind me to see where he stood. On that occasion he thanked me and said that he would always be behind me.</p>

<p>All the hon. member for Ermelo had omitted to say was what he would have in his hand when he was behind me. At the 1967 congress those matters were discussed and resolutions were taken in regard to them. At the 1968 congress votes were also taken on these matters, and I now come to the 1969 congress. I relied upon the honesty and integrity of people who had voted for all these things on various occasions. I relied on the integrity of the hon. member for Ermelo. After I had spoken for an hour and a half in stating the National Party&#x2019;s policy in regard to the English and Afrikaans speaking people, he rose from his bench and stated that no man inside or outside this House could state it better than I had stated it that day. This stands recorded in Hansard.</p>

<p>But surely we are not playing children&#x2019;s games now; we are <span class="col_439-440" refersTo="page_0232"/>dealing with very serious matters. That speech dealt with co-operation between Afrikaans and English speaking people and I do not want to reiterate it here to-day. It is recorded in Hansard. What did the hon. member do then? He issued a pamphlet and attacked the hon. member for Umlazi, Mr. Lewis, by name and Professor Horwood here in this House. What kind of manliness is this if the hon. member for Ermelo had the opportunity of saying that Mr. Lewis should not be admitted to the party? I gave him the opportunity of voting on this matter, of voting &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;No&#x201D; on this matter. Why did he not have the courage to vote &#x201C;No&#x201D;? Why did he not have the courage to say, &#x201C;No&#x201D;? Why does he now bicker in the House of Assembly and outside about this matter, while he had had a full say and while he knew that if one single man had voted against Mr. Lewis&#x2019;s admission in the caucus, as I put it, he would not have been admitted to the National Party? Why did he not have the courage to get to his feet on that occasion? Nor did he have the courage to say a word to indicate that he did not agree with this at any party occasion where policy was discussed. I am asking the hon. member what conclusion I must arrive at from his actions. Was there nothing wrong, or did he know that it was wrong but did not have the courage to say a word against it? In plain Afrikaans we have a word for a man who does not have the courage to do something. I am not going to use it here, because it is unparliamentary, but the word has four letters and begins with an &#x201C;m&#x201D;. I want to make the statement here, and we shall still face each other across the floor of this House, to the hon. member for Ermelo that on no party occasion, either in private or in public, did he utter a single word to me as Leader of the party to the effect that there was any item of policy of the party or application of the policy with which he was not in agreement. What he did in fact say was directed against the Press. On that score he had a great deal to say and covered a wide field, but since he established his party he no longer has anything to say about it, for then he would have to offend his mouthpiece, the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Since that date the hon. member has had nothing to say, but that was the smokescreen he threw up at the time. But the hon. member did not say a single word on any occasion about policy or the application of policy. And if the hon. member now disputes this, then this is his opportunity to put a question to me in this regard, and I am readily available to reply to that question.</p>

<p>But let us examine the question of co-operation on account of which the hon. member found it necessary to establish a party. It was under discussion at the Transvaal congress and the hon. member voted for it, together with everybody else. The question of diplomats was discussed there and the hon. member was in agreement on that, together with the hon. members for Wonderboom and Innesdal. Since they now disagree with the Government, I am asking the hon. member for Ermelo: When did you disagree, at the Transvaal congress or only subsequently? When did you discover that you disagreed with the National Party? Surely that is a fair question. I will not place you under oath. I am simply asking the question, and I will not place you under oath. You can simply tell me whether you knew at the Transvaal congress already or whether it was only afterwards that you knew, for if the hon. member already knew this at the Transvaal congress, why did he not speak up when this matter was being discussed and he had been specifically invited by the Leader in the Transvaal to do so?</p>

<p>The same applies to immigration. Is it possible for one to be so ridiculous as the hon. member for Wonderboom? The motion on immigration was before the Transvaal congress, and the hon. member for Wonderboom stated: If you accept the amendment I have moved, I shall vote for this. And we accepted the amendment, and the hon. member became angry about the amendment and went and established a party because of it. Can one be so ridiculous?</p>

<p>Then there was the question of sport, and this we have debated here. I want to make this accusation again, and in order to set the mind of the hon. member for Ermelo at ease I want to repeat that I will not place him under oath and ask him to take an oath, because the hon. member is allergic to that. I just want to ask him why, since it is apparently one of the main planks in the platform of his new party, did he not raise this matter with me or with other leaders of the party on one single party occasion? When did the hon. member find out about Maoris, before or after he established his party?</p>

<p>I want to go further. Our party leaders discussed this matter fully in all its full consequences where the hon. member for Ermelo was present. He sat there when the party leaders&#x2014;because the Cabinet does not discuss State matters only; the Cabinet also meets as party leaders&#x2014;formulated this policy. The hon. member helped to formulate it, and he agreed that it should be raised by me here in parliament, even after it had been discussed for days in the caucus. But the hon. member never once opened his mouth to utter one single objection against it. This was the case from 1967 till to-day. But now the hon. member comes along and establishes a party and states that he has established that party because he wants to follow the course adopted by the late Dr. Verwoerd. Mr. Strydom and Dr. Malan. I want to tell the hon. member that this is the kind of member he is: If I should die tomorrow or the day after, he would stand by me. There is no doubt at all about that. But, Sir, let us consider for a moment this member&#x2019;s party and let us consider some of his candidates and the statements made by them. They telephone me and tell me for the sake of interest that his mouthpiece on the East Rand, the <i>Brakpan Herald</i>, has announced that a certain Mr. Joos du Plessis has been put up as <span class="col_441-442" refersTo="page_0233"/>my opposing candidate by the member for Ermelo. The four previous candidates put up by him have disappeared, and now he has come forward with Mr. Joos du Plessis. This is the man who took a beating at the referendum in 1960 because he wanted Bantu and Coloured persons to vote in the referendum as well. In 1966 he was to have been the candidate of the Van der Merwes against me, but he only reached the door of the nomination room and then he did not know how one nominated someone and turned away. He has now been nominated by the member. These are the kind of people they are now bringing forward to be their candidate.</p>

<p>No. we do not even mention Paul Marais. Let us just see now &#x2014;for the public outside is concerned with this &#x2014;whether there is any substance in the assertion that the National Party, as it is sitting on this side of the House, has deviated from the policy of former National Party leaders. Sir, the candidate of the Hertzog Party in Boks-burg is a Mr. Pretorius. In regard to this Mr. Pretorius the publication of the member for Ermelo. i.e. <i>Die Afrikaner,</i> to-day writes the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Public Service officials like Mr. Pik Botha, the Vorster candidate in Wonderboom, and Mr. Nothnagel, the provincial candidate, are being granted special leave to participate openly in politics. H.N.P. supporters like Mr. S. G. Pretorius, a candidate of the H.N.P. in Boksburg, are being kicked out.</block>

<p>The statement is made in this H.N.P. publication, which has now appeared upon the scene to tell the truth&#x2014;and the hon. member for Ermelo is the great man of truth&#x2014;that this Mr. Pretorius, who is a member of the Public Service, has been kicked out: Why does the hon. member for Ermelo allow Mr. Willie Lubbe to tell such a public lie? Surely it is not Calvinistic; it is not even honourable to allow such a lie to be told, because Pretorius has in fact not been kicked out. In the same way as Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Nothnagel gave notice that they were resigning from the Public Ser vice, so Mr. Pretorius gave notice of his resignation, and he resigned with effect from 1st February. And now the great man of truth comes along and states, through the medium of his newspaper, that this Mr. Pretorius was kicked out. But let us see who this Mr. Pretorius is. Sir, I am not going to tell you what I say Mr. Pretorius is; I shall let Mr. Pretorius speak for himself, and I am quoting verbatim what he said at the meeting held in Brakpan by the member for Ermelo and the member for Innesdal. There this Mr. Pretorius appeared on the platform. This is what he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I resigned from the National Party in 1963 because I realized then already that the National Party was betraying us.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal, according to what I have been told, applauded loudly. [Interjections.] Yes, and in the transcript of this it is stated: &#x201C;Booing and cheering.&#x201D;</p>

Why are you making him a candidate in Boksburg? But Mr. Pretorius went on.

<p>This candidate of the Herstigte Nasionale Party, Mr. Beetge, held a meeting. I was not aware of it, nor did I see any statement in regard to the meeting until I received a report on it from the general secretary of the South African Iron and Steel and Related Industries Union. It is not necessary to relate what Mr. Beetge said, but it is necessary to read what the Steelworkers and Related Industries Union wrote in regard to this matter, under a covering letter from Mr. L. J. van den Bergh, the general secretary. This is what Mr. Van den Bergh wrote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir, In consequence of a report in the <i>Pretoria News</i> of 28th January, 1970, in which an account is given of a speech made in Hercules the previous evening by Mr. G. A. Beetge, my committee has instructed me to inform you that Mr. Beetge was speaking on his own behalf and not on behalf of the right-wing trade union movement. My committee does not agree with him that work reservation is political deceit.</block>

<p>That is apparently what Mr. Beetge had said. The letter continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the contrary, my committee is satisfied that work reservation determinations have in fact prevented certain industries from becoming completely Black.</block>

<p>He then goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My committee is also extremely unhappy about Mr. Beetge&#x2019;s interpretation of the events concerning Republic Day. Mr. Fouch&#x00E9; and Mr. Ferreira, who were also members of the deputation who came to see you, do not agree that he has presented the factual position, and my committee feels extremely unhappy that a matter which can be regarded as having been closed, is now being dragged into party politics. The assertion that you replied to the letter of the Co-ordinating Council because the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union threatened to strike, is also rejected by my committee with contempt. My head committee has instructed me to convey to you its sincere thanks for the assurance you have already given the Coordinating Council deputation, i.e. that the Cabinet will during 1971 give favourable consideration to declaring Republic Day to be a paid holiday with effect from 1972.</block>

<p>Let us just see how loyal these people are who take truth as their foundation-stone. I have here an extract from a letter written on 16th September, 1969, to the general secretary of the National Party, Mr. Steyl, by the candidate in Vereeniging, a certain Mr. Mills. On 16th September he wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to make it clear here that I have absolute confidence in the leadership of Adv. Vorster. I know that as long as he is Prime Minister there will be no complications and that he will solve all problems effectively in the interests of South Africa,</block>

<p>Now he is establishing a party to protest against me, while on 16th September he was oozing loyalty. Let us now consider for a moment the origin of the Herstigte Nasionale Party. I think the story must now be told. It had its origin in the establishment of certain conservative study groups in Pretoria which were established around the hon. member for Ermelo and the hon. member for Innesdal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we shall find out in a moment whether I am talking nonsense. Hon: members established that conservative study group and out of it this party was born. I shall present him with proof of this across the floor of this House in a moment. According to Mr. Robert van Tonder, in his booklet <i>Die stryd duur voort,</i> that conservative study group decided to put up one candidate in 1966. That was the candidate in Prinshof, a certain Mr. Botha, whom they went to fetch in Waterberg. The conservative study group adopted the attitude that they were the Strydom men and that one must return to Strydom. That is also the reason why they published the booklet entitled <i>Die stryd duur voort.</i> Robert van Tonder states that they chose that constituency deliberately. This is interesting if one looks at the 1966 election. All the constituencies in Pretoria, all of which the National Party opposed, were opposed by either the United Party or the Van der Merwe party. In the case of Prinshof it was the Conservative National Party candidate, and there was only one unopposed constituency in the whole of Pretoria, and that was Innesdal.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us now go further and take a look at this Mr. Van Ton-der. He played a particularly important part in the Herstigte Nasionale Party, for at their congress he gave them R1,000 and he was led on to the stage. He is a prominent member of the H.N.P. I want to charge the Leader with their standpoint in regard to immigration having been prescribed by Robert van Tonder, because Robert van Tonder had already written the following against Dr. Verwoerd on page 90 of his booklet which was written in 1966 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the commencement of his regime Mr. Vorster had the sympathy of all Afrikaners. It was realized that he was not responsible for the immigration dilemma and that he had inherited it from Dr. Verwoerd.</block>

<p>This is a man who is a prominent member and who eventually will probably become a candidate of theirs as well. But listen further. The reproach is now being levelled at me that I have suddenly become like General Botha, according to those members. This is not the first time that this reproach has been levelled at me. This reproach was levelled at me on page 139 of Robert Van Tonder&#x2019;s book. Just listen to this. He wrote, with the approval of the hon. member for Innesdal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The truth of the matter is, however, that our leaders are no longer on the road followed by President Steyn, President Kruger, Dr. Malan and Adv. Strydom.</block>

<p>Soon he will probably be adding Albert Hertzog and Jaap Marais as well.</p>

<p>They are on the road followed by Thomas Francois Burger, Piet Joubert, Louis Botha, Jan Smuts, the Hertzog of the Coalition years and the post-1961 Dr. Verword.</p>

<p>But now we come to the language question, and then I will have finished dealing with these hon. members. It is worthy of note, and we are all aware of this, that they had before their congress a constitution which was not written in one language only; at that stage they still adhered to the National Party&#x2019;s standpoint of having two official languages. The man who rose to his feet there and suggested that they should reconsider this matter, was none other than this Robert van Tonder. He moved the motion. It was stated at that congress&#x2014;I think by the hon. member for Innesdal or by Jan Jooste&#x2014;that their head committee would consider this matter. They did consider the matter. Then they adopted the attitude that there should be only one official language. Mr. Van Tonder was able to exercise that influence because this booklet of his was financed and published by the Conservative Study Group since they were in collusion in regard to this matter and because, it is not unfair to deduce, the hon. member for Ermelo could afford the printing cost of this booklet, for Robert van Tonder did not have the money. This is what he wrote on page 146&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The preservation of the Afrikaner people can only be guaranteed by forceful political action. South Africa will have one language, and possibly much sooner than we think. But it will be a hard struggle, and provided the National Party bethinks itself in time, a titanic struggle between Afrikaner and Afrikaner.</block>

<p>This Robert van Tonder wrote as far back as 1966. That is why he was able to exercise this influence of which there is evidence here. Since I am now discussing how these gentlemen made their about-face in respect of immigration, how they made their about-face in respect of all the policies of the National Party, I just want to say the following in passing to the hon. member for Ermelo. In the months which lie ahead he is going to discover one thing: It is one thing to intrigue in the dark, but it is a different matter to fight out in the open.</p>

<p>But since we have now mentioned immigration, I should like to reply to the accusation made by the hon. member for Yeoville in that connection and to the questions he put to me. This is of course an old story of the United Party and their allies. They support each other very staunchly now as far as this story is concerned. We have allegedly taken over the United Party&#x2019;s policy. Again it is an accusation which the hon. member does not level at me alone. That accusation was levelled at my predecessors, as the hon. member will recall. Could he perhaps inform me how many times he has done so already?</p>

<p>Very well then, we are coming to that. But the hon. member put certain questions to me in regard to immigration. I should just like to read to the hon. member what was said in this Parliament on 5th February, 1965 (Hansard, column 622) by <span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0236"/>the late Dr. Verwoerd when the same point was raised. Dr. Verwoerd then said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I said that at a time when there was no economic growth it would be foolish to have large-scale immigration because the available housing, food production and opportunities for employment did not allow of it.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Still absolute nonsense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us go back to 1948. Then there was no food and no houses either. Does the hon. member for Yeoville not recall how he and I had to sift will through silk stockings <b>in</b> order to make white bread? After all, the hon. member knows this. Dr. Verwoerd also said at the time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I said that, but I said it at the correct time when it had to be said. But I also said something further. I emphasized that it would be wrong for a country to allow immigrants to enter whilst there were sharp political clashes in the country between those who wanted to maintain imperialism and those, on the other hand, who wanted to bring about a republic. The immigrants would then have joined the one group or the other and would have played their part in the struggle of the country to become independent. That would have been harmful to the country as well as to themselves. I therefore said at the time that the time for extensive immigration would come only when South Africa was a republic, because then the immigrants could be absorbed into one nation with one allegiance and one fatherland only. I said that, and I was correct in saying so. When we became a republic, and when we left the Commonwealth, so that the idea of being swamped could not be realized any longer, and when the wave of prosperity was approaching, so that we knew there would no longer be unemployment but a need for workers, and when our food production in the meantime had caught up with the shortages because of our agricultural development, we said: Now is the time to accelerate the pace; now is the time when immigrants will be able to make a living and can be absorbed and become part of the nation.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo would do well to listen to this sentence, i.e. that immigrants should become part of the nation. After all, it is this hon. member who makes unjust and unfair attacks on immigrants who cannot speak for themselves. These are people who are coming to South Africa in the hour of its need to stand by the Whites here. I shall read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was a consistent immigration policy which kept pace with changing circumstances. I am not ashamed of having said all this previously. It was at all times the correct application of this same policy of bringing skilled people into the country to contribute towards the increasing prosperity. No other test in regard to immigration is wise or sound in any country. I can therefore tell hon. members opposite that that is the yardstick by which we should be tested, viz. whether the Government at every stage knew what was the right thing to do then in regard to that aspect of our population problem.</block>

<p>To-day that is still my reply to the hon. member for Yeoville. Yesterday evening I also gave my reply to the hon. member in regard to the pension scheme. I then told the hon. member that his side of the House did not see their way clear to accepting it. In addition I want to tell the hon. member that when I was Deputy Minister of Social Welfare an official who was particularly sympathetic towards this idea was sent abroad by us to institute a thorough investigation. This person, who was sympathetic towards this idea when he left here, returned and told us, after he had examined the systems overseas, that that system would not be suitable for South Africa. I still believe that to-day.</p>

<p>I now want to discuss a related matter. We must not make reckless promises. I realize that if one does not have a policy one has to make promises. I am human enough to understand that. However, we must not make reckless promises which we cannot keep. We must not undermine the spirit and morale of our people. We must not set foot on the road to a welfare state, something which has already been introduced in Britain and other countries. Let us please at all times refrain from damaging the self-respect of our people. Let us rather encourage it. Reference was also made here to a medical scheme. The Minister charged with that matter explained the circumstances very clearly to that hon. member the other day. Either he was not present in the House, or he did not listen. The hon. the Minister told him that the number of beneficiaries at present totalled 2,156,000. After all, those are the lines along which we have developed, which we should encourage. Those are the lines along which we should develop. However, the United Party have never on any occasion even made a study or a test of what the costs would be in respect of those matters if the State were to undertake them. They have never gone into the question of whether the necessary manpower will be available. But what is more, they have never yet given one iota of attention to what this will do to the spirit of our people. These are aspects one should take into consideration before making reckless promises in this connection.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the next charge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled at the Government and which he has given as a reason why there should not be any confidence in us. The hon. the Leader stated accusingly <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0237"/>that it was no longer possible to go along with this Government because it had become high-handed, because it had become arrogant. I should like to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Surely he was acquainted with his former Government, not so? Can his tell me whether he knows of any government which is more accessible to all sectors of the public and to all people than this Government and its Ministers. I can speak from experience. I have been in this position for many years. A man who has a case is never too unimportant or his position too humble to request an interview with one of us and to consult us on the matter; but what is more, we mingle with our people, we live together with our people. In that lies the strength of the National Party. That is why we are sitting here. I now want to link up the attack by the hon. member for Newton Park on the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs with this. Because I am mindful of these matters and must take note of them, I now want to address a specific question across the floor of this House to the hon. member for Newton Park and ask him whether he wants to allege, directly or by insinuation, that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has done anything immoral or irregular, or that he was guilty of improper conduct</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that I have received a reply now, because now I can state my own case. We need not argue about whether it was wise or whether it was unwise to do so. That is not the point at issue. However, I want to make it very clear that there was nothing irregular and nothing unworthy in the conduct of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. The Land Bank is a business institution to which all farmers can turn for long-term mortgage financing and longterm loan financing. Many farmers avail themselves of its services. In all fairness and for the sake of the record I must say that Ministers of previous governments made use of those facilities just as Mr. Haak made use of them in this case. And all those Ministers who made use of those facilities were honourable men. I am not making any insinuations against them; there was nothing wrong in what they did. Sitting in this House, probably on both sides, are members who have Land Bank mortgages. I know of members on the opposite side of the House who have obtained such mortgages. There is nothing dishonourable in connection with that. I do not want to bandy those hon. member&#x2019;s names across the floor of the House. It is not in my nature to do so. I am simply mentioning the fact and saying in addition that there is nothing dishonourable in connection with that. What is the position now? The position is that Minister Haak purchased a farm. He did not purchase it for himself, but for his minor son, who is at present an agricultural student and who intends to farm on it. That farm would have been registered in his name, because it is not possible to have it registered in a minor&#x2019;s name. But one cannot have a mortgage registered in a minor&#x2019;s name. And if it had not been for that fact the farm would have been registered in the name of Minister Haak&#x2019;s son, an agricultural student. He obtained the loan as the hon. member stated here, in the same way as members of the House of Assembly sitting on that side of the House have obtained loans from the Land Bank and in the same way as any farmer is free to apply to the Land Bank with a view to subsidies on dams, etc. There is nothing dishonourable whatsoever in connection with that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether he cannot recall that my point was that a loan of R118,000 had been granted here on the purchase price of R149,000. while the Land Bank Act stipulates very clearly that it should be the fair value of that land. How is it possible in this case that the fair value corresponds with the purchase price of R149,000?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can answer that question very easily for the hon. member. The <span class="col_451-452" refersTo="page_0238"/>valuation which the Land Bank made of that property, gave the value as R150,000. On that R150,000 they were entitled to grant the Minister a bond of R120,000. However, they gave him less, i.e. R118,000. Those are the facts of the case. Surely the hon. member knows that the amount is determined according to the value of the property as determined by the Land Bank. I have been informed by the Land Bank that, with due observance of their stated policy and principles, no bond has been refused during recent years owing to a lack of money, not in cases where the conditions of the Land Bank and its policy were complied with. The hon. member knows this, and he is in agreement with it. The reason why the hon. member raised this matter here was in order to start a gossip campaign against the Minister.</p>

<p>There we get the insinuation from the hon. member, in spite of the explanation I have furnished here. That is typical of him. He will still go and exploit this matter. I want to make it very clear now that, as far as the Minister of Economic Affairs is concerned, I have every confidence in him, not only as an able Minister, as far as handling his portfolio is concerned, but also in his integrity. I have every confidence that he was not a party to anything unworthy, and I have confidence that he was not a party to anything improper. If he had been a party to anything of this nature, I would not have hesitated for a moment to terminate his membership of this Cabinet. Let us understand one another very clearly in regard to this matter. I find it reprehensible that such a matter was dealt with in this manner. I have discussed the matter with the Minister. Regardless of how difficult it may now be for him, in view of the fact that hon. members on that side of the House will exploit this matter recklessly for their own miserable political gain in order to catch a few votes in this way, he now feels that he must endeavour in the coming months to make other arrangements in this connection and to redeem the bond so that this gossiping can come to an end. He is doing this because he, in the same way as I am, is concerned at the level to which our public life is descending. I now want to say to some members of the Opposition, not all&#x2014;I want to say this at once&#x2014; and also to all four members of the Hertzog Party that as far as I am concerned, if there is one matter on which we are fighting this election, we are fighting it on political decency in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. member hurled eggs and tomatoes in the days when it still suited him to do so. As far as this aspect is concerned, I want to conclude by informing the hon. members that I find nothing dishonourable and nothing irregular in connection with the conduct of the hon. the Minister. I appreciate the fact that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has taken that decision which I have conveyed to you.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with this point. I just want to furnish hon. members with some information in regard to the Land Bank. At the end of last year the Land Bank had mortgages on farm properties to the value of R228 million. Long-term loans to farmers to the value of R8.4 million were outstanding. Long-term loans to co-operative societies for the purpose of helping farmers, amounted to R55.5 million. The total, therefore, is R292 million. These are funds which the Land Bank found and which the government made available to it for the purpose of helping the farmers of South Africa. But I want to tell hon. members that the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of finance&#x2014;these two in particular&#x2014;other Cabinet members and I are mindful of the fact that we are entering a phase where more has to be done in this regard than this amount of R292 million which we have already made available, and that is why I want to make this announcement to-day. Deeply conscious of the growing dimensions of the need of the agricultural industry for adapted financing owing to oppressive drought conditions on the one hand and, on the other hand, fluctuating economic factors, the government is giving consideration to the appropriation of sufficient loan funds to the Land Bank from the Treasury in the course of the next few years so as to enable the bank to expand its financing programme to such an extent that all the reasonable needs of the farmer in respect of long-term mortgages on farms at a reasonable rate of interest may be met according to the merits of the circumstances of each case. This is the policy for the future. This is an aspect of policy which I discussed <span class="col_453-454" refersTo="page_0239"/>the year before last and especially last year with agricultural leaders and, in particular, with the Ministers of Agriculture and Finance.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member has asked me the customary questions in regard to the Bantu policy. I want to tell the hon. member at once that the questions he asked me on the economic development of the Bantu areas and related matters, are questions to which I furnished full replies last year, just as my predecessors had furnished full replies. My colleague the Minister of Bantu Administration furnished full replies this year. But if this is not enough for the hon. member, I want to tell him that recently two excellent papers by highly capable officials, i.e. Dr. Rieckert and Dr. Rautenbach, were read on this matter, and I shall furnish the hon. the Leader of the Opposition with copies of those papers.</p>

But I say that in so far as it is pertinent he has in this debate received his full reply from the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. The hon. the Leader only made one mistake, i.e. he proceeded on the false premise that in the year 2000 the number of Bantu would be between 36 and 40 million.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to tell you that the highest responsible estimate which was made in that regard and which I have been able to find, was that there would be 7 million Whites, 5 million Coloureds, 1 million Asiatics and 27 million Bantu. [Interjections.] I am not involved in the argument between you and the Deputy Minister. I am merely furnishing the facts of the matter as I have been able to ascertain them.</p>

<p>I now want to debate with the hon. member for the umpteenth time. I now want to argue the question of political representation with the hon. member for the umpteenth time. We have discussed it in this House before. For the purposes of my argument I now want to accept that the United Party&#x2019;s policy is to introduce white representation for the Bantu and for the Indians. I want to accept that <i>in toto,</i> and then I first just want to point out in passing that in that regard the hon. member immediately dragged in the matter of Lesotho to warn against our development of independent Bantu states which will eventually come into being. He tried to scare the electorate with the development that has occurred in Lesotho. He has already received the answer, but I am merely touching on it here. In the first place, it is after all a fact that we are preparing our black people much better than the British prepared theirs for becoming independent. In the second place, we did not throw away the old and introduce something new. We retained the good features in the old and incorporated them in the constitution, i.e. the system of chiefs. In the third place&#x2014;and this is very important in view of what has happened in Lesotho&#x2014;we stamped out communism, not only in our territory, but also in theirs. We shall to an increasing extent be prepared for it and stamp it out, wherever it may rear its head, and this is something the Britons did not do in Lesotho or in any of their other territories. Now this question has arisen, i.e. what is our relationship with Lesotho? I want to tell you, Sir, that our relationship with Lesotho is exactly the same as it is with Rhodesia. We are simply carrying on as though nothing has happened. Lesotho is a neighbouring state of ours. We do not interfere with them. We do not dictate to them. We have no hand in their decisions. But it is a neighbouring state with which we have to negotiate, and as far as we are concerned, Chief Jonathan is in effective control of that neighbouring state and we shall continue our negotiations with him as if in fact nothing has happened in Lesotho.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>That is official recognition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Official recognition or not. official recognition simply plays no part, just as little as it did in regard to Rhodesia. It is merely a question of our continuing as if nothing has happened. We have our specific relations with them and we are continuing with those specific relations. And as far as his state of emergency is concerned, he has furnished his reasons for that, i.e. that it was on account of communist subversion that he had to take this step. And that is his business. What I know about the B.C.P., compels me to agree with Chief Jonathan that it is a communist, subversive influence, for the Leader of the Opposition was a Peking communist, and this has been proved time and again in the past.</p>

<p>I say we are now coming to the cardinal point, the difference between the United Party&#x2019;s policy on the one hand and our policy on the other, its policy of introducing into this Parliament the friction factor of colour representation, <span class="col_455-456" refersTo="page_0240"/>and my policy of eliminating that level of friction. Was it not specifically on that very point that the hon. member for Umlazi felt called upon to join the National Party? And to-day, on the eve of the election, I want to put this to the hon. member once again&#x2014; and I also want to argue this matter with the hon. member for Yeoville. Their standpoint and their policy of introducing that colour factor into this Parliament will lead to friction for which we shall pay very dearly in South Africa. But I also want to tell him this. I want to argue that it is dangerous to introduce into this Parliament the representation of Bantu by Bantu. I take it that the hon. member agrees with me that it is dangerous to introduce them here. [Interjections.] I do not want to ask the hon. member a catch question; I merely want to argue this point. Is it dangerous to introduce them, yes or no?</p>

<p>The hon. member says it is undesirable; that is good enough for me. Sir, if it is undesirable, it can only be undesirable because it is dangerous. But, in any case, let us not play with words. Let us accept that we have at last succeeded in making him say that it is undesirable. But if it is undesirable, then, surely, it is folly to act in such a way that it may become possible; surely, then it would be extreme folly to create machinery which is going to make for precisely that undesirable state of affairs. Why then create the machinery which would make it possible for that undesirable state of affairs to occur? This is not a question of what I say. I am now going to quote hon. members on that side in order to prove that they themselves are saying that this undesirable state of affairs is in fact going to occur. I am not going to argue about it with the hon. member, but I am merely quoting for the sake of the record what he said on the B.B.C.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our Leader, Sir De Villiers Graaff, stated very clearly that whereas on our election we will give the black people of this country representation in Parliament by white people, he accepts and we all accept that that is not a permanent situation, that it will change and that future Parliaments will allow black people to come into Parliament.</block>

<p>In principle they are bringing about that undesirable state of affairs which they do not want, for they are saying to the Bantu: &#x201C;You are entitled to being represented here in principle; you can come here.&#x201D; Surely, then the next step would be that he would tell you. &#x201C;I want to be represented by my own people,&#x201D; and by implication you are conceding that this is exactly what will happen. On a subsequent occasion&#x2014;and I want to place this on record as well&#x2014;this matter was argued with you once again. At that time you joined issue with the Deputy Minister and you said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He alleged that I had said that if we should come into power, the Bantu would be represented in Parliament by Whites, and subsequent to that I said in reply to a specific question that I accepted that in the course of time Parliament would allow Bantu to be represented in Parliament by Bantu. This is the gist of it. Sir, I said that and I believe that it will happen.</block>

<p>This is what you are holding up to us for the future; you believe that this will happen, but you are not merely resigning yourself to the belief that it will happen; you are opening the door so that it may in fact happen. This is what you are doing to South Africa. You now admit that it is undesirable to do this. I shall go further than that; I say that it is dangerous to do so, but you are opening the door to what you admit is undesirable. But, surely, you yourselves know&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also said this&#x2014;that Bantu will be represented here by Bantu, and he says he said it because he was under pressure at the time. After all, we had that argument here across the floor of the House. The greater the pressure, the blacker the representation becomes; we have had that admission from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition. But, Sir, we need not stop at them only.</p>

He has not yet issued a statement to the effect that I have the right to do so, but I am going to appropriate that right to myself.

<p>This is the finding he arrived at after making a scientific study of the matter. But let us now look at the kind of Bantu policy pursued by the hon. member for Hillbrow, who is the candidates committee in the Transvaal at present. This is the committee which ousted the hon. member for Kensington in order to bring the political correspondent of the Progressives into this House. I find it interesting that it should in fact be George Oliver who has been made a candidate by the hon. member for Hillbrow, because the member for Hillbrow is searching for allies who share his views. I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the hon. member for Hillbrow does not endorse his policy. This is an interesting book.

<block name="quote">What we therefore envisage is a third chamber in the system of government in South Africa, a chamber in which the Natives will have direct representation by their own representatives.

<p>I shall now skip two paragraphs, and then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is the way it can work: a third legislative chamber, a second House or Bunga for the Bantu, or whatever it may be called, ought to be created.

Botha was the Minister, and they have continued to improve after Mr. Marais Viljoen took over from him. I am very grateful for that. We established the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. We provided the Coloureds with business enterprises in their own areas and made it possible for them to develop.

<p>Yes, I know that. In this connection, discussions were held between the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and myself. We went into this matter. In this connection, discussions were also held by me with the Leader of the Cape Province and with the Executive Committee of the Cape Province. I think it would be much better if I submitted the letters I received in this connection, arising from those discussions, to hon. members so that they may deduce precisely from that what the standpoint is and what is going to happen in the future. I want to say immediately that it has a negative aspect on the one hand, but on the other hand&#x2014;and this is the side which carries the most weight&#x2014;it has an exceptionally positive aspect which holds great benefit for the Coloured population, not only of the Cape Province, but of the other provinces as well. After the interviews in his connection, the Administrator wrote to me as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am writing with reference to the discussion which four members of the Executive Committee had with you on 30th January, but which I unfortunately could not attend, and the previous discussions about the question of mixed local authorities which Mr. F. J. Conradie, M.E.C., held with the Cabinet members concerned. The Executive Committee has now thoroughly considered the matter of accelerating the progress in the Coloured people in the field of local government and together with this the switch-over to the parliamentary voters&#x2019; roll for the election of councillors of all white local authorities, and has decided to accord its full support to the Government&#x2019;s approach concerning such accelerated progress, as well as to the proposed investigation in connection with it. The Executive Committee accepts the principle of switching over to the parliamentary voters&#x2019; roll for the election of white local authorities, with suitable adjustments in the light of the Cape Province&#x2019;s special circumstances as discussed by you with the members of the Executive Committee. I have now also requested the Director of Local Government to submit my proposals in this connection to the Executive Committee as soon as possible for their consideration. As the switch-over to the parliamentary voters&#x2019; roll will, <i>inter alia,</i> result in the disfranchisement of the non-White voters, its implementation will have to be coupled with the introduction of a positive role for the non-Whites, and the Coloureds in particular, in the field of local government. Because it is not regarded as desirable that a general election should again take place on the basis of a mixed voters&#x2019; roll, the Executive Committee has furthermore decided that immediate steps be taken for legislation in terms of which the general election due to be held in September, 1970, under the existing ordinance will be postponed to September, 1970, to be introduced in the Provincial Council at the earliest opportunity.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is no bomb, but a consistent application of our policy. I want to read the letter which I received from the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council to the House (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council Act, Act No. 49 of 1964, makes provision in section 17 for, <i>inter alia,</i> the administration of local government matters in respect of the Coloured areas by the <span class="col_463-464" refersTo="page_0244"/>Executive Committee. As you know, local government powers are at present in the hands of white local authorities, who perform their functions in terms of various provincial ordinances under the control of the Provincial Administration. In 1963 legislation was in fact passed by all four provincial councils to make provision for the establishment of consulting and management committees for Coloured group areas as a preparatory step and at a later stage, for full-fledged local authorities. A number of such committees have already been established throughout the Republic, but owing to a variety of reasons autonomous local authorities have not yet been established for Coloured group areas. The control and administration of Coloured areas is therefore still in the hands of white local authorities, while the Coloured people&#x2019;s share therein is insignificant. The fact that Coloured persons in the Cape Province do have limited voting powers in municipal and divisional council elections is an impediment rather than an advantage in our endeavour to lead Coloured areas to independence. As a matter of fact, this causes so much friction and enmity on the part of both the white and the Coloured groups that it is in the common interest to terminate this doubtful privilege with the least delay. In view of the policy of the Government to create all possible opportunities for the parallel development of the Coloured population group into independent communities, <i>inter alia,</i> in the field of local government, and particularly in view of the objectives which the former Prime Minister, the late Dr. Verwoerd, announced in his speech to the Union Coloured Council in 1959, i.e. that within 10 years the Coloured people would have full control over their towns and cities, I wish to appeal to you humbly and yet in all seriousness to apply this policy consistently on the local government level as well. This would of course mean that the control of local government would be directly integrated with the functions and activities of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and its executive committee. I am convinced that the existing dual control is obsolete and that it is in the interest of all sections of the community that the creation of the necessary machinery for these powers to be taken over by the Coloured Council and the implementation of this plan should take place with the least delay.</block>

<block name="quote">Your kind attention to this request will be highly appreciated.</block>

<p>This letter comes from the chairman. Mr. Tom Swartz. Discussions have been held by me. I have informed myself in this connection. The hon. member sitting over there knows that in Kimberley and other places that friction is building up. It is building up and it is leading to unpleasantness. It is leading to disturbances in race relations which should not be there. I am very grateful that all parties concerned in this matter &#x2026;</p>

<p>If the hon. member is not aware of it, it is time he sensed it or that he asked the hon. member for Kimberley, who is well informed in this regard, about it. This friction must be eliminated. The Coloured people themselves admit that there is friction. The Whites know that it is there. I am doing this not only, and I want to repeat it now, to eliminate an additional level of friction, but I want to do it because it is consistent policy to do it in this way. I want to do it because in terms of the policy of separate development it will create chances and opportunities for the Coloured people which they have not had before. From this it becomes clear what the future planning in this connection will be. I said on a previous occasion that I was busy laying foundations. I want to repeat: I do not know what the final solution will be and where the road will end, but I am constantly indicating the road, that the Coloured people should proceed along their own course and the Whites along their own course and that they can confer to and fro with one another on a friendly basis on their respective courses.</p>

<p>The National Party, and I shall conclude with this, has governed South Africa for 21 years. The Leader of the Opposition adopts the attitude that he has no confidence in this party. I wish to make the assertion that this party, after 21 years, after problems of boycotts and undermining, after it has had to deal with enmity and misunderstanding such as no other party has ever had to deal with, has led South Africa to great heights. South Africa to-day stands as a healthy state for everyone to see. We are envied by many other countries in the world because we can display South Africa like this, as it really is. Just look how it has grown. If one looks at the growth rate over the decades, one will see that there was an average growth of 4 per cent from 1917 to 1937. As a result of the circumstances which arose later, it dropped to below 4 per cent during the decade from 1937 to 1947. But from 1950 it started rising. In that decade the growth rate was 5 per cent, and in the decade of the sixties it was 6 per cent. Look at the growth rate of other countries. One need not even look at comparable countries. One may look at countries which in other respects were in a better position than South Africa. Sir, we have built up a strong South Africa under difficult circumstances in the years which have passed. We have built up a South Africa in which there is peace in the field of labour. To-day we have a Republic in which racial peace prevails. We have a Republic with a standard of living which ranks among the highest in the world. We have a Republic which is growing as no other country is growing. But what is more, in the midst of all <span class="col_465-466" refersTo="page_0245"/>the enmity existing in the world we have a Republic which, thanks to the course of action we have followed, is safe. The time of spectacular events in the political life of South Africa is past. All that lies ahead for us is hard work. The matter of race relations is one of the most delicate which South Africa will ever have to deal with, on account of the numerical ratios which I mentioned here to-day. I appeal to the old guard Who established the Republic and I appeal to the young people who ask &#x201C;What must we live for?&#x2019; and I say that there is nothing more challenging, more beautiful and liner than working for the preservation of the Republic of South Africa. I call upon the young people of this nation, and also the people who established this Republic; to support and protect it. I want to conclude by saying that the Republic of South Africa and its interests are safe only in the hands of the National Party.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the whole course of this debate, I think, he, made it perfectly clear that there is only one real reason for this election, namely because of the difficulties that have arisen between the hon. the Prime Minister and certain of his former colleagues. It has shown quite clearly that this election has been called to settle those differences and it has shown quite clearly that the machinery of State is in fact to be used to wash and iron the dirty linen of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>It is difficult to sum up this debate, because so much of it has been devoted to action between the hon. the Prime Minister and his former followers. I can only say that if I had been the referee in the fight I think I would have disqualified them both. I think I would have recommended that the Nationalist Party, because of its former record of resorting to tomatoes and eggs at public meetings, should be suspended for the future. It is no aid to an intelligent solution to the problems of South Africa. In so far as one has been able to follow this dispute it has been an unsavoury and unpleasant fight, which I do not believe has advanced the prestige of Parliament or the interests of the people of South Africa. Having listened to it all in the course of these five days, all I can say is: A plague on both the houses of the two parties concerned. The arguments on both sides seem to me to be singularly unimpressive and notable for their ferocity and invective rather than for their logic. In some respects the Herstigte Nasionale Party seemed to be left behind in the thinking of the Nationalist Party. In others they seem to show a very much keener appreciation of the dangers with which South Africa is faced under the policies of this Government. They certainly have a very real appreciation of the dangers of the application of what is known as the B O.S.S. clauses and also a very much keener appreciation of the dangers involved in the dictatorial ideas of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>We have had the usual sanctimonious protestations on national unity from the Nationalist Party and we have had them thrown in the face of the Herstigte Nasionale Party. We have had the Leader of the Herstigte Nasionale Party reminded of his own difficulties with his own father. The one thing that was never mentioned during the course of this debate was the manner in which this Nationalist Party treated the late General Hertzog himself on this very subject of national unity. There are some of us who remember why this hon. gentleman left the Free State Congress of the Nationalist Party during the war years. We remember with what contempt the late Dr. Verwoerd wrote in the <i>Transvaler</i> that he had left the congress over the rights of the English, and saying he could hardly understand it. One remembers how it was over the dispute as to whether they should guarantee the political rights or also the language rights of the English-speaking people in South Africa. I am not surprised to find there are people in the Herstigte Nasionale Party who still have the ideas the Nationalist Party had in those days. They cannot deny it. That was their policy. They have come a long way since then. I am very glad to see it. However, they have still not come far enough to be able to say that they are achieving anything like real national unity in South Africa. I have said before and I say again what they stand for is co-operation on terms, not real national unity. I have said before too it does not surprise me that their terms tend to prove more and more unacceptable to English-speaking people who have had any experience inside the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>It seems to me there are similar contradictions and obscurities in their setting out of the story in respect of their sports policy. This directive which was given to Mr. Orchard, our representative in New Zealand when he was here on leave before the All Black rugby team was due to come to South Africa, is something that we are hearing about since this dispute started for the first time. One wonders whether that mandate to Mr. Orchard embraced a full-blooded Maori or only people with Maori blood. One wonders that if it did embrace a full-blooded Maori, why it was that the tour was cancelled?</p>

<p>Oh yes. If there is this confusion of which the hon. the Prime Minister talks why was there no clear statement at the time setting out the position? It seems to me without any doubt that the Government would be better advised to admit that they were wrong in their policy and that they have changed this policy. What possible harm could it do to South Africa for that admission to be made? It would certainly create a better impression inside South Africa and especially outside South Africa. It could make this policy of real value for South Africa. It would make the position so much easier, for members like the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) who spoke so strongly against Maoris being allowed to come to South Africa in a touring team. Now that he finds his seat is in danger, he is finding himself in support of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>From this discussion two points emerge which I think are of national importance. These are points which I want to put pertinently to the Prime Minister. The first is that in the course of this debate this dispute between the Prime Minister and his former colleagues, the hon. member for Innesdal produced either an original document or a copy of an original document which appeared to have been top secret. The authenticity of that document has in no way been denied.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. Minister does not make it difficult for me to argue because there is hardly a civilized country in the world where it is not taking place in some form or other under some control or other. The hon. the Prime Minister knows it.</p>

<p>When I introduced this motion I raised six main issues. The first of these was the failure of the Bantu policy of the present Government. I want to say that when I dealt with that matter, I placed certain figures before this House, figures as to what I expected the number of Bantu to be which will have to be moved from year to year if the policy were to achieve any sort of success. The first contradiction has come in respect of those figures. It has come from the hon. the Prime Minister. I may say that I find it difficult to accept that he does not know of other figures published in newspapers of which Ministers in his Cabinet are directors. I find it difficult to accept that he does not know of the forecasts which were apparently made by the hon. the Deputy Minister in which he accepts very much higher figures. Accepting the hon. Prime Minister is right, there still is to be such a movement of Bantu from the white areas to the homelands if anything like the success they hope to achieve, is to be achieved that the whole policy is entirely impracticable. I want to say to the hon. gentleman and all members on that side of the House that if you have a policy of which the central element is to reduce and not to limit the number of Bantu in the white areas and it is manifest for everybody to see that you are failing despite all the possible and impossible steps which were outlined by the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the time has come not to find an excuse for the failure of your implementation of the policy, but to look into the practicability of the policy itself. When that is done, when one tests the claims in the direction of success by Ministers on the Government side, then the figures given by the hon. Deputy Minister are too pathetic even to worry about. These claims are pathetic in the light of estimates by trained economists of what will have to be done by way of job opportunities in the reserves. They come here and say that they are making real progress. They base this on the hope that in the next five years they will provide jobs in the reserves for 5,000 Bantu. In the light of the vast numbers involved, this is so laughable that it is not even worthwhile having regard to it. Nothing, absolutely nothing the hon. Minister has said has shown that this policy is practicable or can ever be made practicable. I want to say to the hon. gentlemen opposite that it is reprehensible enough to mislead the public as they have done with this policy, but when they mislead themselves as they are doing at the moment with their belief of possible success for this policy, then they are heading for a crash, a crisis which can be disastrous to South Africa. When you have a policy which has failed, you have to start looking for a practicable alternative. The Minister suggests that the only practicable alternative is complete integration. He says that he knows of no middle course. It is most significant: While they say when you deal with the Bantu there is no middle course at all, there can only be complete segregation or complete integration, they suddenly find there is a middle course, namely parallel development, when it comes to the Coloured people. They know they put the Coloureds on the first step of the ladder in that direction, but they do not know where it is going or where it is going to end, but they concede it is a different policy. I want to suggest to the hon. the Prime Minister that it is high time he came down off his ivory tower and that he got down to the realities of the situation and tried to find a practical solution. I want to say that if he cannot find a practical solution, the sooner he makes way for people who have a practical solution the better for South Africa. After all, what is his policy doing? His policy is slowing up development all over South Africa; it is slowing down the rate of growth. It is acting as a clog on efficiency and it is endangering the whole <span class="col_471-472" refersTo="page_0248"/>future of Western civilization and the future of the white race in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration has issued a challenge to us as to how we shall limit the number of Bantu in the White areas. Sir, why should he challenge me to carry out his policy? It is his policy, with the impracticable ideal of limiting the number of Bantu in the white areas. He is the man who is going to carry it out; he is going to reduce the number. I have told him categorically that we would retain influx control and that there would be development inside the reserves with private white capital and white initiative and skills. I told him I believed that development would be faster than under his Government, and I believe it will be cheaper for the people of South Africa. Not only will it be cheaper and faster, but I believe it will be economically more advantageous to South Africa that we should develop those areas as part of one economic whole, the economy of the whole of South Africa, and not as seven or eight independent little economies which will probably be vying with each other before long.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister still says numbers are not decisive; they do not really matter, but what matters is the basis on which the Bantu are in the white areas. Well, if they are right, then numbers do not matter as far as our policy is concerned, as long as political control is in the hands of the Whites, in civilized hands. Then why should not we withstand the pressure of numbers, if they can withstand the pressure of numbers? The argument cuts both ways.</p>

<p>But there is a dangerous development we have seen in this debate, and that is that the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration is already suggesting that they have gone so far with homeland development that they can never turn back. Nobody can ever turn them back, and sovereign independence is now inevitable.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister seems to be getting a little excited. May I say to him quite categorically that the position then must be worse than I thought it was, and the people of South Africa must be warned that this is the position envisaged by the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Now the hon. gentleman has made great play of the differences between our policy and his policy, and he has made great play of the differences between the British colonial policy and the policy of South Africa in respect of sovereign independent Bantu states. I want to say to him to-day that if he believes that in that way he can avoid the dangers of those sovereign i independent Bantu states, then he is living under a delusion. Then he is not aware of what is happening in the rest of Africa. I listened in the other night to &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; on Radio South Africa, something which to my knowledge is never favourable to my party, but seems to come out with quite a lot that is favourable to the Government. What did I hear? Of something like 30 African states which have gained independence since 1959, in not one has power changed hands peacefully. That was not British colonial policy alone. That was the colonial policy of the metropolitan powers which have been in Africa over the years. Does the hon. gentleman think he is going to avoid that state of affairs? Sir, he is <span class="col_473-474" refersTo="page_0249"/>deluding himself and misleading the people of South Africa. Then he believes that his policy offers greater security for South Africa than the policy of this side of the House, because there is to be representation of non-Whites in this House. But he knows very well that there has been representation of non-Whites in this House before, and the clock did not stop and we did not have a revolution. He also knows that there is no reason whatever why the extent of that representation should not be controlled. The hon. gentleman is trying to suggest that the inevitable result of the policy of this side of the House will not only be Bantu representing Bantu, but greater numbers of Bantu in this House. I want to get it quite clear with the hon. gentleman. It has never been the policy of this side of the House that Bantu be represented by Bantu in this House. It has never been the policy of this side of the House and it is not the policy of this side of the House, and it cannot ever become policy unless a majority of the white voters in South Africa seek it. and I do not believe that they will seek it. The position is perfectly clear. We are giving representation to the Bantu by white people in this House and there will be no change in that policy without a referendum or an election in which that is the issue and it gets the support of the majority of the white voters of South Africa. But the suggestion is continually made by the hon. gentleman that we would change in the light of pressure. That comes ill from that hon. gentleman when his predecessor stated here in Parliament that the policy he is following to-day is not a policy that they would like to follow, that it is not a policy that they wanted to follow but a policy that was inevitably being forced upon them by outside pressure.</p>

Sir, the hon. gentleman tried to cause further confusion by quoting something that had been written in a book by the hon. member for Hillbrow. I want to ask him whether he is going to take the responsibility for everything that has been said and written by Senator Horwood?</p>

<p>Let me now deal, Sir, with the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister in regard to the Cape Coloured people. He said that the position between Furopean and Coloured was improving and that he disagreed with the hon. member for Peninsula in respect of the relations between Coloured and European. I want to say with tagret that I believe the hon. the Prime Minister is wrong. My own experience is a different one. It seems to me inconceivable that the hon. gentleman can be unaware of the bitterness that has been built up as a result of the actions of his Government, particularly the action of his Minister in the appointments he made to the Coloured Representative Council. But, Sir, the hon. gentleman has gone <span class="col_475-476" refersTo="page_0250"/>further. He has now taken another step which I fear may lead to further friction and further bitterness and that is the decision that in future parliamentary franchise will be applied for municipal and local body elections in South Africa. I am in difficulty at the moment because I do not have clearly from the hon. gentleman what the alternative is that has been placed before these people, and I would like to study those letters before I comment on this any further. But it does seem to me that this holds in it the seeds of further friction and further bitterness between the Coloureds and Europeans of South Africa. It is also quite clear from what the hon. gentleman says that he still has no idea of the end of the road in so far as the Coloured people are concerned.</p>

<p>Sir, the second issue I raised was the question of this Government&#x2019;s failure to deal with the manpower shortage in South Africa. What reply have we had? We had a reply from the Minister of Labour suggesting that the entire manpower shortage was exaggerated and need not really be taken seriously. Sir, I believe he was given authorities by the hon. member for Hillbrow which, to say the least of it, should make him think again. I would say that if the hon. gentleman says there is no manpower shortage in South Africa, he is whistling in the dark and running away from the realities of the situation.</p>

Sir, what did we have from the hon. gentleman? All we had from him was an attempt to find out what the position was in respect of job reservation. I think the hon. member for Hillbrow has exposed that as a snare and a delusion and a colossal bluff; so the cry came whether we would abolish job reservation.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. gentleman will because he knows very well that job reservation has two aspects. One aspect is what is known as the conventional colour bar in South Africa. This in practice amounts to a tacit agreement and some-tines an express agreement between employers and employees that certain spheres of work will be reserved for white workers. That is the South African convention and that is one which we do not propose to abolish and, as I shall show, we will take measures to protect any group of workers against any transgression against the spirit of that convention. The other use of the term &#x201C;work reservation&#x201D; is in respect of the rigid statutory colour bar contained in clause 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act as it has been used by this Government.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 77 is the clause that gives the Minister the power to reserve occupations either completely or on a percentage basis for Whites or any other race group. It has been operative for about 15 years and it has been proved a farce. Nobody knows that better than the Minister. There have been a few orders reserving various occupations. They affect about 2 per cent of the total labour force in South Africa. Some of these orders, Sir, are quite ridiculous. I do not believe lam wrong when I say that there is one that lays down that only white men can drive the vehicles that remove the night soil of certain races in Durban. Most of these orders have been rendered more or less useless by masses of exemptions granted by the Minister. In practice they have no relation to-day to the reservations originally granted. This clause is seldom used, and when used, it is vitiated by <span class="col_477-478" refersTo="page_0251"/>exemptions until only the shell of prejudice remains. Yet it remains on the Statute Book. It remains a disgrace to South Africa because of the impression it creates in the world outside, namely that we are selfish, intolerant and oppressive. As far as we are concerned, the provisions of clause 77 can and should be repealed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, do not run away. The hon. gentleman knows that I accepted the trade unions as they were before this legislation was introduced. I have never accepted black trade unions for Bantu. The hon. gentleman knows that. The matter is so important that I want to mention a few more thoughts in this regard. The first is that I think we have to face the basic fact that our prosperity, that is our comfort and our way of life, depends on White and non-White working and working together in the interests of South Africa But we have to accept as another basic fact that the Whites are outnumbered by the other racial groups, who are often prepared to accept lower wages in competition with Whites. The danger is there, although one has every sympathy with employers who cannot get Black labour. Their problem is in fact our problem, since our prosperity depends on the success of their business enterprises. We on this side of the House believe that steps must be taken to prevent the abuse of labour, whether it be White or non-White. I am completely confident that businessmen can be assured of all the labour they need, while at the same time the white workers can be properly protected in South Africa. I believe that, with the growth of South Africa, white labour, and particularly trained white labour, can become a very scarce commodity and that we should make the best possible use of the labour force available to us. I believe that that is going to come to pass, provided that this Government accepts our proposals for equipping every white child for the responsibilities of leadership, and for giving every white worker the opportunity to educate and re-educate himself for better jobs. I do not believe that white workers are going to get better jobs or income security by keeping non-Whites out of industry. If he does, he is going to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Black workers get jobs because there are not enough Whites to do the work. When they get those jobs, it very often means that there are better jobs available for the white men, and usually a better type of job as well.</p>

<p>Already the Handelsinstituut is saying that our educational system is 25 years behind the times. Already it is being said that this Government will have to double the amount of money that is being spent on education. Already it is becoming obvious that this Government will have to lend its assistance so that all able white children can be educated to the maximum of their ability, even at universities and institutions of higher learning, whether their parents can afford it or not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask you a question in that regard? Are you aware of the fact that, whereas in 1947 only 17 per cent of Std. VI pupils reach Matric, it is as high as 51 per cent to-day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister is making the suggestion that he has improved the educational system. Yet the Handelsinstituut says that we are still 25 years behind the time. Those may be the facts, but they still reveal the highly unsatisfactory position in South Africa. They still reveal the fact that 49 per cent of those who have passed Std. 6 do not get Matric, and I wonder what percentage gets Std. 6? These are figures that can be put before the public, and be very misleading. I believe that our White population in South Africa is not getting an adequate education. I believe that that is supported by almost every educationist of any knowledge in this country. I believe that it is supported by the Federated Chamber of Industries, by the trade unions and by all the experts. I feel that the time has come for something to be done about it, as proposed by us on this side of the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Tragically, despite compulsory education, we do not have 100 per cent of pupils really passing Std. 6 at the moment. I know that they are supposed to. The hon. gentleman has been a schoolmaster. He has told us how he taught history. I would not be surprised if his class did not pass. [Interjections.] Not only do we want to see provision for the re-education of those workers to take better jobs, but we want to see provision for them for temporary housing if they have to move into different areas. We want to see the encouragement of industrial business expansion in every way by proper protection for economically sound business enterprises, by means of tax policies applied by the government.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, how would we protect the white worker? We believe that, first of all, what should be done by the White man and what should be done by the non-White are things that should be agreed upon between the trade union and the employers&#x2019; organizations. We believe that if there are difficulties, there should be an appeal to an industrial tribunal. We believe that where there is competition between White and non-White, the rate for the job must apply. We believe for those Whites who are less well educated and cannot compete, there must be a guaranteed minimum wage at real wages, which have regard to the value of money, and that it should be guaranteed them for a period of years while they are being reeducated. May I say that it is a part of our policy that increases in the cost of living should be taken into consideration and that there should be an adjustment of wages in accordance with the ordinary determinations so that the worker can share in the prosperity of South Africa. I believe not only that that would give a great deal of protection to these people, but also that it would enable us to have a far better type of job available for the Eruopean worker in South Africa, with complete security. Now I know that I am going to be asked how I can reconcile a minimum wage with the rate for the job. The answer is tint the rate for the job applies above the minimum wage. If Whites cannot get jobs at the minimum wage, they will have to be cared for by way of sheltered employment and special employment provided by the government. That is something we believe should be looked at. We are faced with a series of figures that were given us by the hon. the Minister of Labour indie-ting the extent to which the number of Bantu workers in the white industrial areas had grown. I may say that the figures he gave us are challenged to-day by one of the leading trade union officials in South Africa. From those figures it appears that whereas the hon. the Minister gave us the figure of 644,000 Bantu employed in industry in the white areas in 1968, the figure given by this gentleman is 722,800. These figures apparently come from the Bureau of Statistics. It appears that the number of African industrial workers as a proportion of all workers in industry in white areas rose from 55.5 per cent in 1965 to 55.6 per cent in 1968 while the percentage of Whites decreased. That is the opposite of what the hon. the Minister has told us. The suggestion is that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s figures do not conform with the official figures put out by the Bureau of Statistics. I fear that this is one of the troubles with which we are faced. The hon. gentleman is not facing this problem. He is not coping with it and he is slowing up the development of South Africa. He is limiting the prosperity of every section of the population because he does not have the courage to come out and tackle this problem in a way that will give better opportunities to Whites and raise the standard of living of all sections of the population.</p>

<p>I raised a third issue, namely the neglect of the ordinary man in the street by this Government. I referred particularly to the lot of the civil servant. The reply I got from the Minister of Economic Affairs was that there had been rises in wages in 1968 and that that had not been before an election. On 15th August last year, Dr. Enslin, chairman of their association, complained that a crisis was developing in the Civil Service because of a shortage of manpower and he ascribed it to the wage conditions in the Service. This matter has been drawn to the attention of hon. Ministers before but we have not had one satisfactory reply from the Government in this regard. I say without hesitation that my case is made as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>Then there was raised the question of old age pensions and a national contributory pension scheme. We were told by the hon. the Prime Minister that the matter had been investigated when he was a Deputy Minister and that as far as he was concerned, those who had started out in favour of it ended up against it. He was not prepared to support it because after all we should have some national self-respect and engender self-respect in the individuals concerned.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Just like the situation at present; at least we will have had a big improvement.</p>

<p>Then I pointed out that the Government had overtaxed the people of South Africa over the last 20 years and that that overtaxation had become even more serious with the imposition of a purchase tax last year. I pointed out our objections to that purchase tax. I also pointed out how we had foretold that far more would be collected than was forecast by the Government. We have been proved to be completely correct as far as this is concerned. The Minister has now taken action which has shown that we were completely correct. I am still sure that when the Budget is presented we will see once more to what extent the ordinary man in the street has been overtaxed once more. This is my reply to the hon. the Prime Minister about the cost of social services. I believe that the money is there; that it is available. We have been overtaxed to the extent of nearly R1,250 million since 1948 and in addition to that the Government has salted away approximately R341 million which it has sterilized to take it out of circulation. That could be used for the needs of the ordinary people. I want to suggest that the replies of the hon. Prime Minister both in respect of a national contributory pension scheme and a State assisted medical aid scheme are utterly unsatisfactory and do not deserve the support of the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>I also raised the question of housing and we got a reply from the hon. Minister of Community Development. I want to say that I believe that that hon. Minister was really quite wise to confine himself in his reply largely to housing as it relates to Indians and Coloured persons who required housing in many cases as a result of removals under the Group Areas Act. The charge we make and the charge which remains unanswered is that he has not applied himself to the housing needs of our expanding white population. He has not applied himself to the increased prices of land, to the increased building costs and the problems they create for young couples and he has not applied himself to the increasing incidence of high density living conditions for young couples with young children. I want to say that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we charge this Minister with complete ineptitude.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Why then is there no overall planning for housing requirements? Why is the Government unable to tell us accurately what the position is or to assess the housing requirements and shortages? Why has the Government not stepped in to reduce the delays in respect of the approval of townships? Why has transfer duty not been reduced in respect of small houses? Why has there been no system of tax relief granted to employers providing housing for their own employees? There is only one answer and that is that this Government is indifferent to the lot of the ordinary man in the street in South Africa. That is another reason why they should be ignored by the electorate in this election.</p>

<p>The fourth matter raised was the question of agriculture and the failure of the Government to play its proper part in combating the problems of the agricultural community. Under the present drought conditions there are farmers who feel very bitterly throughout South Africa, particularly here in the South Western and North Western Cape at the present time. The trouble with the price policy of this Government is that the Ministers of Agriculture cannot defend themselves of their price policy. They talk of what they have done in terms of a long-term policy. Why was the Marais Commission appointed to work out a long-term policy for agriculture in South Africa? Hon. gentlemen will remember the dispute in this House when I raised the question of the lot of the agriculturalist in South Africa under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s vote when I was told by members on that side of the House that I should raise it under the vote of the Ministers of Agriculture and that only matters of national importance should be raised under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. What could be of greater national importance than the lot of the agriculturalist in South Africa? That hon. gentleman will remember the plans put before this House and the motion which came from the hon. member for Gardens for a commission to investigate the long-term planning of South African agriculture. That was voted down by that side of the House. What happened then?</p>

<p>When the then Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, went to his own congresses he ran into so much trouble from his own people that he was forced to appoint the Marais Commission. What have we had since then? We have only had a few interim reports recommending very largely United Party policy. Now at last we had the hon. the Prime Minister announcing to-day that vast sums are going to be made available to meet the capital needs of farmers in difficult conditions to assist them a little further. How long have we not asked for more money to be made available? For how long have we not asked for the subsidization of rates of interest? For how long have we not asked for another price policy from this Government? Now members on the other side of the House turn round and ask us how we work out the costs of production. For how long have control boards not been working out the costs of production in South Africa? Why must they suddenly find that they can no longer do this because we propose that they should do it? Is it not one of the principles underlying the Marketing Act that the farmer should receive his production costs as well as a reasonable profit?</p>

<p>When that Act was established, it was de <span class="col_483-484" refersTo="page_0254"/>signed not only for orderly marketing of the farmers&#x2019; products, but also that price stability be ensured and to provide the farmer with a reasonable profit. It is this Minister of Agriculture who has departed from the principles of the Marketing Act. He is the Minister who has talked about supply and demand. At times when production costs had risen, he has nevertheless reduced the price of the commodity to the farmer concerned, as he did with white mealies a year or two ago, despite the recommendations of the Maize Control Board. If he is not prepared to follow a policy which will ensure production costs, a reasonable profit to the farmer and the recognition of the risk factor, what then is he in favour of in fixing prices for the farmers? The hon. gentleman will find the farmers will not be prepared to produce under those circumstances. That is one of the reasons why he is losing large numbers of farmers in South Africa. He quotes from a synopsis of our policy statement. He knows very well that our policy has been debated in this House on many occasions. He knows that we put proposals before this House to suggest that the instability of farming income should as far as possible be eliminated. How is the risk factor to be eliminated?</p>

<p>We have suggested that there should be the implementation of a general State-aided crop and stock insurance scheme, which will ensure that the farmer would at least get his production costs during unfavourable times, like drought, hail, frost and circumstances of that sort. He put the question of how he would work out production costs. I have said that the Marketing Board has been doing that for years. I know that those products which are normally exported provide problems, but if they are an important part of the industry which has been built up over the years, with big capital investment that is worthwhile saving, then I believe that the Government has to be prepared to subsidize where necessary in order to assist those people to remain on their feet. In cases of temporary surpluses and the possibility of the difficulty of disposing of these surpluses, I believe it is right that the Government should spend money to increase local demand, that it should be something borne by the whole community and not just the farming community. I want to say that these election promises by the Government are going to do very little to restore the confidence of the farming community in the Government after the way they have been treated over the years. This is merely an attempt to distract their attention from their difficulties because of the coming of the election. Why was this not done years ago, over the five, six years of drought we have had in various parts of this country? How many good farmers have not gone under because of the lack of help of the kind that the Prime Minister is suggesting he is going to offer to-day with an election around the corner?</p>

<p>Then there is a sixth issue which I believe should be placed before the public of South</p>

<p>Africa, namely the alarming development of authoritarian tendencies in this Government. It was very interesting to note that there was no attempt at defence so far as that was concerned from the other side of the House. Not a single Minister stood up and dealt with the subject.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has tried to justify his action against the hon. member for Ermelo in altering the terms of reference of the commission he appointed and having the matter immediately investigated.

<p>The hon. gentleman contends that the common law empowers the head of State to issue a certificate which was final in respect of matters affecting the security of the State. He says that he himself gave such a certificate, backed by a Transvaal court, and that there were conflicting decisions that caused the Department of Justice to come forward with section 29 to clarify the position. I raised with the hon. gentleman the question whether the case of Van der Linde and Calitz did not clarify the position and state it finally, since it was an Appeal Court decision. The hon. gentleman said that Calitz&#x2019; case dealt only with particular circumstances, a particular case, and had no general application. Now, Sir, the headnote of Calitz&#x2019; case is so general that it is difficult for me to accept that interpretation.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says he will argue it with me in the next debate, but I want to point something else out. Not only is that headnote of general application, but the interpretation which we on this side of the House have given to this section, has apparently been accepted by the Bar Councils of every Bar in South Africa. It has apparently also been accepted by every Law Society. There have come protests from teachers of law at a large number of our big universities, universities like the Rand Afrikaans University, Potchefstroom University, the University of South Africa and many other of our great teaching universities. I have that headnote here. I have their judgment here. I should like to place it before the hon. the Prime Minister, because it seems to me that the hon. gentleman either does not understand what is the implication of this section, or he has been misled by the people who should have advised him. There is no doubt whatever that the vast mass of legal opinion in South Africa is to the effect that that clause goes far too far and that the explanations so far given by the hon. the Prime Minister and by his Deputy Minister in this House did not meet the situation. The hon. the Deputy Minister apparently did not know that this case has gone on appeal. He did not realize that the case he quoted in respect of English law has been overruled by the House of Lords. The hon. the Prime Minister has made statements in this regard before his own congresses which, to put it mildly, leaves one with the impression that he has not had an opportunity of studying them and doing his homework on the subject.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister put it to me and I must reply. It looks as if I am getting it all my own way too. It looks to me as if the hon. gentleman is not briefed even now. But what has this to do with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s action in respect of the hon. member for Ermelo? It has nothing to do with it whatsoever and I want to say that I stand by my criticism in that respect.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has told us in lighter vein that he never needed advertisements about bars to get the public to his public meetings. I wonder if he remembers the meeting at Malmesbury on the 21st March and I wonder if he paid any attention to the advertisement advertising the meeting, namely &#x201C;a big braai and a substantial bar&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In saying that we have no confidence in this Government and asking the public to show their confidence in us, I cannot but recall how often we have been right and the Government has been wrong. There was the question of the purchase tax, the question of immigration and that of the Orange River scheme. There has also been the difficulty in regard to national unity which has now been revealed by the split between the Prime Minister and his friends in his own party. There have been questions in connection with the farmers&#x2019; income tax, the bulge in taxation, the taxation of married women and also a large number of <span class="col_487-488" refersTo="page_0256"/>other matters. One of the difficulties with this Government at the present time is that they make promises and statements and one is beginning to have difficulty in knowing exactly what one can accept. I have one example in respect of the hon. the Minister of Transport. He attacked the hon. member for Ermelo and his group at a meeting in Potchefstroom which was reported in <i>Die Burger</i> of the 18th October, 1969. He was reported as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Minister Schoeman het ges&#x00EA; as dit dan in sonde is om af te wyk van in beleidsverklaring van &#x2019;n vorige Eerste Minister, wil hy vra waarom hierdie mense nie ook vir mnr. Vorster beskuldig het van afwyking van dr. Verwoerd se beleid toe die Regering besluit het dat die blanke Kleurlingverteenwoordigers in hierdie Parlement verwyder moes word nie. Minister Schoeman het dr. Verwoerd se woorde op 23 Januarie 1962 in die Volksraad aangehaal waar hy ges&#x00EA; het dat hy geen plan hoegenaamd het om die Kleurlingverteenwoordigers te verwyder, seifs nie nadat die Kleurlinge hulle eie Parlement het nie.</block>

<p>My point is quite simple. The hon. the Minister said why did these people not accuse the Government of departing from Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy. The hon. the Minister knows very well that the present Minister of Defence told us in this House that when that policy statement was made in this House Dr. Verwoerd and he had already decided that they were going to remove the Coloureds&#x2019; representatives.</p>

<p>They deny everything, but the public will decide in due course who was right.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I have here the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s exact words which I would like to read out to him. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we were to succeed in solving the problem of marketing gold and if we could obtain the foreign exchange and by doing so relax our exchange rate control and send more money to countries abroad I am convinced that share prices on the Exchange will show a downward trend. Once share prices on the Exchange show a downward trend people will be more inclined to invest money in fixed interest-bearing securities which include building societies.</block>

<p>Later on the same day he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If I can foresee the possibility of a solution to our gold marketing problem being found, a solution that will make it possible for us to sell our gold more freely and in that way to earn more foreign exchange, and to export more money out of the country which would inevitably lead to the Exchange showing a downward trend as well, it would be my duty to sound a note of warning. I did not say that I was sure that it would come. What I did in fact say was that I expected, hoped and trusted that we should find a solution to the problem shortly perhaps before the end of this year. What I did in fact deny was when I was asked whether I expected this to happen shortly, to-morrow, the day after or next week.</block>

<p>Yes, mainly luxury and durable goods. But what happened? Lip service to the promise, lip service to the statements and every kind of goods were taxed. We are faced with an election. I believe that the replies of this Government to our criticisms have been wholly unsatisfactory. I believe that we have spent a large part of these five days in washing the dirty linen of the Nationalist Party in this House. It seems that the hon. the Prime Minister and many members on his side of the House attach more importance to that fight than to the future problems of South Africa. I want to say that so far as we are concerned, this is merely another reason for having no confidence in the present Government. I want to say that what we offer to the people of South Africa is the maintenance of white leadership in South Africa over the whole of South Africa; and that we will live in peace and harmony with all races in South Africa, in one State with one central Government, but with the various races governing themselves in matters of more intimate concern to themselves. We will give them a measure of self-government in their own communities. We will recognize the special position of the reserves. We believe that we can ensure that peace and harmony through a federation of communities with defined representation for each community in the central Parliament on separate rolls. We will guarantee no change will come in the parliamentary representation of any of the non-White groups without the approval of the white electorate in a special election or referendum for that purpose. We believe that we can deal with the day-to-day problems of living and making a living in South Africa by maintaining separate social and residential amenities. We will provide sufficient properly-trained labour to meet the demands of an increasingly prosperous economy with the proviso that white workers will be protected against unfair competition. There will be protected employment at minimum rates of pay for those Whites who through no fault of their own are in need of such protection. There will be better facilities for the training and re-training of workers so that no white worker will fall by the wayside because he is not properly trained to take a better job.</p>

<p>That hon. gentleman says platitudes and promises. I challenge that hon. gentleman to make those same promises to the people of South Africa. He cannot do it; he is kicking over the traces by breaking the Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of his own non-Whites on the Railways every day of the week. He knows it, but he is not prepared to have the private industrialist given the same relaxation. I want to say something else to that hon. gentleman. I want to say that we will uphold the rule of law in South Africa. We will secure South Africa against both internal and external attacks. We will guarantee every man&#x2019;s right of access to independent courts of law in South Africa. We believe we can build up better living standards for all race groups. We will guarantee those social services which the hon. the Prime Minister is refusing to guarantee. We will guarantee to provide more houses especially for young couples anxious to start their own families. I believe we can, as I have said before, ensure that we will provide television as well. I believe that the people of South Africa are tired of this Government. I believe there has been so many failures, so many broken promises, so many statements which have not been accurate that the people no longer believe in them or have any right to believe in them.
