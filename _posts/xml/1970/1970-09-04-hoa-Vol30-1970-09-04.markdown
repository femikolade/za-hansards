<answer by="#minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#thompson">

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) The negotiations are still proceeding. The second part of this question, therefore, falls away.</li>

<li>(2) In a Press statement I made on 16th July, 1970, I pointed out clearly that the Government&#x2019;s decision in connection with the large-scale export of iron ore through Saldanha permitted Iscor at that stage to proceed with negotiations in order to determine the magnitude of possible export contracts and the extent to which the required capital for the financing of the scheme could be raised from external sources. Depending on the results of these negotiations the Government would be able to afford the scheme definitive consideration.

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_health" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF HEALTH:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) Research overseas has brought to light that in the course of the manufacturing process, the inhalation of the enzymes can cause acute pulmonary infection. This undesirable situation can, however, be avoided by exercising proper control over dust in the manufacturing process In so far as the housewife is concerned, allergy is the only undesirable occurrence which can be proved with certainty but it does not occur more frequently than allergy from ordinary brands of soap. As far as is known, enzyme detergents manufactured in South Africa do not contain soap or soap powder. In terms of the provisions of the Food, Drugs and Disinfectants Act (Act No. 13 of 1929), the Department of Health only exercises control over soap containing detergents, but consideration is at present being given to an amendment of that Act which would also provide for the inclusion of detergents which do not contain soap.</li>

<from>The MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS:</from>

<p>The rates for assessing the pension and gratuity vary from case to case but in general the scales for assessing the benefits on retirement after completion of at least ten years&#x2019; pensionable service, are as follows:</p>

<p>Pension</p>

<p>Annual average salary for the last three years&#x2019; pensionable service, multiplied by a factor which varies from 3/220 to 3/180 according to the age on retirement, multiplied by the period of pensionable service.</p>

<p>Gratuity</p>

<p>Annual average salary for the last three years&#x2019; pensionable service, multiplied by 5&#x00BE; per cent in respect of male members or 6&#x00BC; per cent in respect of female members, multiplied by the period of pensionable service.</p>

<p>The pension benefits are enhanced by an additional benefit which is calculated on the same factors, percentages and average salary as indicated above, for the period equal to, either one-fifth of actual service rendered as a member of the Police or Prisons Service, in excess of 13 years, or 5 years, whichever is the lesser period.</p>

<li>(6) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a)

<ol>

<li>(i) Arising from the recommendations contained in the following paragraphs of the first interim report the steps, as indicated, have been taken:

<ul>

<li>Paragraph 65: Steps have been taken to ensure that rock lobster packing factories only produce quantities of rock lobster products which will not exceed a global marketing quota, including exports as well as local marketing.</li>

<li>Paragraph 66: A marketing quota of 5,600,000 lb. tail weight for export as well as local marketing was already instituted last year. New quotas for the 1970/71-quota year are now being considered in the light of research results and statistics presently being compiled in respect of packing and distribution during the past twelve months. The Fisheries Development Advisory Council will be asked to make a recommendation before the quotas for the Republic for 1970/71 are. finally determined.</li>

<li>Paragraph 67: In the determination of quotas average performances in the past are taken into consideration.</li>

<li>Paragraph 68: These recommendations have already been put into effect.</li>

<li>Paragraph 69: The marketing of rock lobster is at present still being handled by two different associations. One of them handles all rock lobster tails and frozen whole cooked rock lobster, while the other association handles live and frozen uncooked rock lobster. Negotiations have already taken place with the associations with a view to the establishment of one combined organization, but thus far without avail. However, the co-operation between the two existing organizations is satisfactory.</li>

<li>Paragraph 70: All rock lobster products are already subject to the quality control of the South African Bureau of Standards.</li>

<li>Paragraphs 71 and 72: These recommendations have already been implemented.</li>

<li>Paragraph 73: The number of rock lobster landing points has already been limited to nineteen in the area stretching from Cape Agulhas to the Orange River Mouth.</li>

<li>Paragraph 74: Pending the completion of further tests to determine what the ideal mesh size for rock lobster nets and traps should be from a conservation point of view, this recommendation has not yet been accepted.</li>

<li>Paragraph 75: The measures referred to in paragraphs 27 to 55 of this interim report are still in force.</li>

<li>Paragraph 76: Research into rock lobster resources was intensified since 1963 and it is expected that the results thereof will be available in the near future.</li></ul></li>

<li>(ii) As regards the second interim report it may be mentioned that a full-scale Public Service inspection of the Division of Sea Fisheries and of Government Gwano Islands was already arranged at the time of the receipt of this report.

<heading>STATEMENT ON REPORT OF COMMISSION ON INQUIRY INTO THE SUGAR INDUSTRY</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p> Mr. Speaker, I tabled the English text of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sugar Industry to-day. As hon. members will notice, it is a voluminous document, comprising 381 typed folios and it has, therefore, unfortunately not been possible to complete the Afrikaans translation thereof. When the translation is ready, Afrikaans copies will also be made available.</p>

<p>Although I have already conveyed my thanks to the Commission through its Chairman, I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express publicly my appreciation of the expeditious and workmanlike way in which the Commission has executed its task. In my opinion the report submitted is a valuable one.</p>

<p>Officials of my Department had full discussions last week with representatives of the various sectors of the sugar industry and in regard to the vast majority of the recommendations agreement has been reached. Although I have not yet presented the matter to the Cabinet, I have reason to think that these recommendations will also be acceptable to the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Some of the Commission&#x2019;s recommendations will most likely be implemented in a somewhat modified form. A few other recommendations, which may be regarded as more contentious in nature, form the subject of further studies in regard to their practicability by working groups nominated from the ranks of the sugar industry.</p>

<p>I think, however, that in regard to all the recommendations it will be possible for the Government to arrive at final decisions before the end of the year.</p>

<heading>INCOME TAX BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 14:</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to raise again the question I mentioned to the hon. the Minister with regard to the deductibility of moneys paid to private medical aid schemes. We discussed yesterday the question of the allowance of R150 and the hon. the Minister said that according to the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s survey it was found that the sum of R150 was above the average amount which the average citizen expended on his medical requirements like medical and dental attention, etc. The question I put to the Minister was whether the subscriptions to medical aid schemes were deductible. He gave an answer to the effect that he believed it would be deductible if it were a compulsory payment. It is that particular aspect I would like some more clarity upon. I may say that what might have been an average probably three or four years ago when the Franzsen Commission did the survey&#x2014;it reported in 1968&#x2014;has changed considerably since; by way of example, the Department of Health has provided new tariffs for the medical profession, tariffs which it sought for some time. In addition it is common cause, I think, and I need not stress this particular issue, that the cost of drugs and medicines has gone up considerably, especially recently. Further, we know that the hon. the Minister has always held the view that membership of medical aid schemes should be encouraged, particularly in view of the fact that we do not have a national health scheme in the country. Over a period of time the whole issue may evolve itself into a national health scheme when we find that the majority of citizens in the country in some form or another belong to a medical aid scheme. The subscription to the medical aid scheme is as essential as it is to pay a doctor&#x2019;s bill or to seek dental assistance. It is as essential as any allowances which may be required in the interest of the citizen and it certainly should form part and parcel of the deductible amount in addition to the R150 which has been provided to cover what was regarded as well above the average and which would save the Department a considerable amount of administrative work. That particular move, I think, was a very sound one. It was helpful to the taxpayer and also to the Department. But I do make a plea that the subscription to the medical aid scheme should be a deductible allowance.</p>

<p>I may say that in most schemes, as I mentioned yesterday, there are rules and regulations which call for membership of a scheme in the particular employment in which the taxpayer finds himself. Usually when a person joins a firm or company, or even a State undertaking, he will find that there is a medical aid scheme among the facilities offered.</p>

<p><span class="col_3377-3378" refersTo="page_0243"/>These medical aid schemes usually require the particular organization to ensure that all its employees become members of that scheme, and in many cases it also makes a contribution towards the subscription. It is very easy under the I.R.P.5, I think it is, for the employer to certify what the taxpayer has paid himself in connection with the subscription. In many cases the employee pays the whole of this subscription. Another interesting aspect of this matter is that if an employee leaves that particular firm or group which forms the affinity group to which the taxpayer belongs, the taxpayer very seldom takes away any advantage with him. He does not carry it on as in some pension schemes which are applicable to-day to large authorities like municipalities, where in recent days they have agreed that the pension can transfer itself. In medical aid schemes that does not necessarily apply, except in certain big organizations, and therefore the advantage is completely lost. If it is placed, as it is at the moment, with the premiums for which a certain formula is laid down, one must bear in mind that premiums which are payable in connection with insurance do guarantee an advantage to the taxpayer.</p>

<p>It is a premium in respect of some insurance which is payable either on death or on the attainment of a certain age, or some payments in the case of an accident or sickness or anything of that nature. But it is a guaranteed and underwritten form of benefit which flows out of the payment of the premium. In respect of a medical aid subscription, there is no guarantee at all. The taxpayer may fortunately never need the assistance for which the subscription provides, and secondly, as I have said, the taxpayer does not gain a benefit from it if he should leave the group through whose affinity he was able to become a member of the medical aid scheme.</p>

<p>So taking the whole perspective of medical aid subscriptions by and large, I feel that that is an advantage which was lost when the amount was reduced from R250 to R150, because the average medical aid subscription for a man with a wife and a child or two is in the region of R17 a month, which itself already is approximately R200 per annum. Now if any advantage is given at all then the advantage would be the figure which originally pertained, namely R250. I do not know that I would like to ask for more, but I think at least consideration should be given to restoring that figure with the same advantage of not supplying receipts. It could be made a condition. If the taxpayer was a member of a medical aid scheme, the allowable amount would be R250. On the other hand, it may perhaps not even be wise to limit it to that extent, because very often the taxpayer who is not a member of a medical aid scheme is under the serious disadvantage that he has no protection at all. If his bill runs to a very high amount there is no return from a society, which through its group effort is able to give him the benefits which a medical aid scheme gives.</p>

<p>Therefore my plea to the hop. the Minister is that it should be increased to R250, but I should also like clarity on this question of the decuctible amount. Where a person, is a member of a medical aid scheme and the rules provide that the group to which he belongs must ensure that he becomes a member of that scheme, is it deductible&#x003F; We should have much more clarity on this problem as to whether it is deductible together with the R150, or whether it falls under section 11, which deals only with premiums.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p> I listened attentively to what the hon. member has said. I can only tell him that contributions to medical aid schemes are deductible in the same way as insurance premiums. In addition to the R75 which is deductible for medical expenses in the case of unmarried persons and the R150 in the case of married persons, all subscriptions to medical aid schemes are deductible as a rebate in the same way as insurance premiums are deductible up to a certain maximum, which I think is R375 per annum which is the equivalent of a rebate of R30. Let me put the position again: A married couple may deduct R150 per annum for medical expenses. On top of that insurance premiums up to a maximum of R375 per annum which represents a rebate of R50 are deductible, but the medical aid contribution is deductible as a portion of this R375.</p>

<p>In regard to the whole question of medical aid, the survey to which I referred yesterday afternoon was not undertaken by the Franzsen Commission but by my Department. That survey, I admit, is a few years old already but I had discussions with my Department this morning and we will again go into the whole question of medical expenses. We do not want to make the position more difficult for the contributor and we do not want to make the position administratively impossible or difficult for the Department. The hon. member will understand that, But we shall go into the whole matter again in view of rising medical fees and the rising cost of medicines. We cannot make any promise at this stage, but we shall go into the matter to see whether for example a higher deduction should be allowed or not in the case of aged persons. I can assure the hon. member that we are going to go into the whole matter again in the light of present-day circumstances.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Schedule 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>This new schedule 2 brings about the consolidation of the various matters pertaining to the loan portion of normal tax and will become the fifth schedule of the principal Act. Sir, we have an opportunity here to study the provisions of this <span class="col_3379-3380" refersTo="page_0244"/>schedule which is now before the Committee and to ascertain its effect on various taxpayers who have to pay the loan levy; and to look into the rate of interest that the taxpayer receives, namely 5 per cent, and also the repayment period, which at the discretion of the Minister shall not exceed seven years. I want to point out that the period of repayment now becomes seven years as against five years under the previous legislation during the 1950&#x2019;s. We know that large numbers of people who paid the loan levy during the 1950&#x2019;s did not claim repayment of their loan levy, perhaps through negligence. According to figures recently disclosed by the hon. the Minister an amount of something like R2&#x00BD; million is still owing to taxpayers in respect of loan levies paid by them during the 1950&#x2019;s. The repayment period can be determined by the Minister, subject to a maximum of seven years, as provided for in paragraph 6 of the schedule which consolidates the various loan levies imposed from 1965. Sir, I believe that the period laid down for the repayment of the loan levy is extremely important because it affects large numbers of taxpayers who may not be able to claim repayment of the levy. Although the Minister may argue that the loan levy is subject to a minimum amount of R10, the application of the new schedules for this coming tax year ending on the 28th February, 1971, means that a married person resident in Natal, with a taxable income of R2,600 per annum, would be liable to a tax of R166 normal tax and a minimum loan levy of R10 as provided for in the schedule.</p>

<p>Sir, the older taxpayer views this period of seven years with a good deal of trepidation because he himself may not be able to claim repayment of the loan levy. Paragraph 2 of this schedule provides that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) the liability for the payment of any unpaid amount of any loan portion due by any person shall cease&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) upon the death, insolvency or liquidation (in the case of a company) of that person.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>This means that in many cases the older taxpayer, who has to wait for a period of seven years for the repayment of the loan levy, will not be able to receive repayment together with interest at 5 per cent in terms of this schedule. I would therefore like to urge the hon. the Minister to take into account the older taxpayers and to see whether it is not possible ro reduce this period progressively. Sir, I understand that it is not possible for me to move an amendment to exclude a certain group on the ground of age, but I believe that a person over the age of 65 should be exempted from the payment of this loan levy. A person of 65 will be 72 years of age before he will be able to claim repayment of this loan levy, and I would therefore like the hon. the Minister to give his consideration to this particular aspect. There are many people who prefer to make provision themselves l'or times of emergency in the future rather than be forced to save by way of a loan levy which they will not be able to claim for a period of up to seven years. Sir, I again urge the hon. the Minister to consider the question of reducing this period of repayment in the case of persons over 60 years of age. Under previous clauses passed by this Committee the person who is over 60 years of age has been given a concession but those married persons who receive a taxable income of over R1,500 per annum and unmarried persons with a taxable income of R1,000 are liable to tax and they are also liable to pay the loan levy where their income reaches the level which I mentioned in the example which I quoted of a married person in Natal. I believe that it would have been more beneficial to have left the period of repayment at five years. If the hon. the Minister could give consideration to the age of the taxpayer over the age of 60, for instance, if the person between the ages of 60 and 65 could have that loan portion repaid during a period of five years, it would mean that all those persons would receive the repayment of that loan levy before attaining the age of 70 years. Further, if the hon. the Minister would give consideration to providing for the exclusion of those over 65 years of age from paying a loan levy, it would mean that these people would be able to have this money that is put aside for them, the money described by the hon. the Minister previously as an attractive investment. However, I can assure the hon. the Minister that there are many who believe that there are far more attractive investments available to them than the compulsory loan levy. Whilst dealing with the question of the attractiveness of this investment, to use the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words, it would appear that in view of the increase in interest rates, it is a pity that the hon. the Minister, in consolidating the previous legislation that was passed in 1965, has in terms of paragraph 7 of the schedule, pegged that simple interest to a rate of 5 per cent. I believe that it would be making the investment more attractive&#x2014;if the hon. the Minister wishes to make it an attractive investment&#x2014;if he were to pay a higher rate of interest than that of 5 per cent, as provided for in this schedule.</p>

<p>The difficulties involved in the repayment of these loan levies are certainly great. We know, for example, that there are many paople who do not keep a record of the certificates received. Indeed, in terms of the schedule that is now before us, it is not necessary for the hon. the Minister to issue a certificate if the period should be reached when the person is to be repaid that particular loan portion of the tax. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to give an indication that the question of the issue of these certificates is being expedited, as provided for in terms of the schedule, in order to <span class="col_3381-3382" refersTo="page_0245"/>ensure that persons have an accurate record of the amount owing to them by the Government. We have heard figures quoted showing that, since the increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, the amount of indebtedness of the State to the taxpayers, regarding this loan portion of the tax, will be in the region of R275 million. Therefore it is important for the taxpayer to be fully aware as to what amount is owing to him over the years of assessment where a loan portion is included. With regard to the practice and the policy of the hon. the Minister, it appears that loan levies and the loan portion of the income tax have become a permanent portion of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s taxation proposals. This schedule before us sets out the full details of how this loan levy is to be administered. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to give an indication to the Committee that, in the administration of the loan portion of the taxation that is collected in this manner, the tax-payer is fully protected, so that he has confidence in the medium of taxation which the hon. the Minister is imposing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p> Mr. Chairman, the matter of the loan levy has been discussed quite often by this Committee and the House. I do not want to repeat what I have already said concerning it. Firstly, as regards the period of seven or five years, nothing can be done about it to-day. If there should be any more loan levies in the future, which I cannot tell at the present moment, we can then consider whether the duration of the loan should be five or seven years. The period of seven years has been accepted, I think, in order to give the hon. the Minister of Finance more scope. This introduction of loan levies is also a measure in the fight against inflation. It is a withdrawal of money from circulation and the repayment of these loan levies is a matter which has to be considered very carefully, because one does not want to repay these loan levies and put more money into circulation at a time of inflation, if possible. So a period of seven years gives one more scope to select the time of repayment. The right time for us to repay the loan levies will be when there is a recession or a depression &#x2014;although we hope these will never come to South Africa again. I think the hon. member will fully understand that.</p>

<p>Now the matter which has often been broached in this Committee is whether levies should no longer be levied on people over 65 or 70 years of age. In this regard, I want to repeat that loan levies have been introduced partly as a measure in the fight against inflation. Inflation has its effects on all people in the country, whether young or old. I think that the elderly people too have a duty to play a part in this fight gainst inflation, through the loan levy. People who request that the loan levy should not be imposed on people over the age of 65 or 70, mainly base their arguments on the premise that people will not live long enough to receive repayment of the loan levy and the accumulated interest. I think that this is a very negative approach to the whole matter. Old people also save; in fact they often save more than young people. If the old people are prepared to save by investing in the private sector, why should we say that they are no longer entitled or able to, and should not be given the opportunity of investing in any gilt-edged securities such as those provided by the State&#x003F; I do not think the matter of hardship arises in this case.</p>

<p>The hon. member has mentioned a particular salary which is taxable in Natal. In general, a couple will only pay a loan levy when they have an income of about R2&#x00BD; thousand, which I think is quite sufficient, because the loan levy only starts now when a couple pays R100 a year in income tax. I really do not think there is a very strong argument in favour of abolishing this loan levy and in regard to the present one, nothing can be done at the moment. Maybe we shall not have to resort to loan levies in the future, but if we do, all these remarks will be taken into account.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. the Minister for his reply to the points raised, but I feel that the age of the taxpayer and the means of making this levy an attractive investment are important. It is true, as the hon. the Minister has said, that there are many people who save. Their reason for saving is that they invariably, particularly in a later stage of life, require money for health or other urgent reasons which may arise. They invest their money in such a way that they can obtain a loan against it, or withdraw a certain amount of it to meet a situation which may arise. With this loan levy which is now before us, a person will be compelled to make a payment of a portion of his normal tax and it will not be possible for him to utilize any of the money which is paid in this way to raise a loan. He will not be able to pledge it in any way. I believe that the older taxpayer, who may require this money, should have the opportunity of being able to obtain it. I have recently studied the taxation position in Great Britain. There it appears, from the progression of tax scales, that the older person is more leniently dealt with. From the age of 50 years onwards, the rate of tax can be adjusted according to the age of the taxpayer. The principle that is involved here therefore relates to the age of the tax-payer and I do not believe that it is an un-important aspect of this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has also raised the question of the rate of income before a person becomes liable to pay this loan levy. When I spoke earlier, I mentioned the position of the married person in Natal. I pointed out at what level he would become liable to pay this loan levy. One must also bear in mind the position of the older taxpayer. The Minister says that <span class="col_3383-3384" refersTo="page_0246"/>they are receiving a higher income, but one must remember that death duties must be paid in many cases where the deceased has been a high taxpayer. Invariably the estate of a person who has been a high taxpayer and who had substantial investments is called upon to pay estate duties. Although the primary deduction of R25,000 is taken into account for a surviving spouse, it does mean that in many instances the estate of a person who has had a considerable income, is called upon to pay death duties in any case. As far as that is concerned, the person will therefore still be liable, if he was a high taxpayer, to pay death duties. We on this side of the House believe that an important principle is involved here. The older taxpayer is now being called upon to pay a loan levy for a period of up to seven years. I should therefore like to move an amendment in terms of which these people will receive special consideration. Paragraph 2 deals with the liability for the payment of any unpaid amount of the loan portion due by any person and then details conditions upon which that liability shall cease. I should now like to add a further condition and move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following subsection at the end of section 2:</block>

<ol>

<li>(4) No person who attains the age of sixty-five years before the end of February 1971 shall be liable for any loan portion in respect of the tax year ending 28th February, 1971.</li>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the amendment of the hon. member for Umbilo. It is a matter we have taken up with the hon. the Minister on a number of occasions. I do not think we can accept the reasons why these elder citizens, as the hon. the Minister calls them, should have this tax inflicted upon them. The hon. the Minister says that he is engaged in a fight with inflation. We accept this entirely. But I do not really believe that the amount of money involved in the amendment, that is to say, in removing from the loan levy the incomes of those people who are over 65, would be a disaster from the point of view of inflation. However, there is another aspect. When I dealt with this matter on the Votes I said to the hon. the Minister that we are not so concerned with these people who have large incomes, in other words, if Mr. X is paying R100,000 per year in tax, we do not have the slightest objection to his paying a loan levy of R10,000. The hon. the Minister can have a limit. What we are concerned with is the middle income group. I think the most potent point that has been made in this issue is the point made by the hon. member for Umbilo. Elderly people do save, but they have a reason for saving. They save in order to give them a sense of security for problems which may arise at a moment&#x2019;s notice. We all know that this does happen, that elderly people suddenly find that they require a certain amount of money to really keep them out of financial trouble. If they invest in a building society or an organization, where they can go and collect their money at a day&#x2019;s, seven days&#x2019; or a month&#x2019;s notice, they know that they have the security of being able to lay their hands on X amount of cash. However, in terms of the loan levy, they cannot. They have to wait until the period of repayment expires. I hope the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment but I have reasonable doubts that he will do so. We want to establish the principle that in so far as elder citizens are concerned, at least in the lower income groups, they should not face the imposition of this loan levy. Therefore I support this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I already discussed this matter, where age is taken as the criterion for taxation, during another debate yesterday. I think what I said then applies to a very large extent in this case as well. Being older does not mean being less able to pay tax. The younger man of 30 may be less able to pay an extra tax than the older man of 65 or 70.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>But this is not a tax.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Indeed, he may be even less able to pay a loan levy, but this applies to tax as well. The person of 30 years is less able to pay tax or a loan levy than the older person who has amassed money in the course of his life. I therefore think it is wrong to take age as a basis. If the hon. member should take ability as a basis and not age, it would be something we could think and argue about, and something for which provision could perhaps be made in future. However, I do not think that age alone should be used as a basis. Elderly people do not save for emergencies only. Elderly people save for other purposes as well, for example to leave something to their children in the form of an inheritance. It is not only elderly people who save for emergencies. Young people also save for emergencies. I see no basic difference between the motives for saving of elderly people and of young people. Elderly people and young people both save for the same reasons, which are, <i>inter alia,</i> to have something in case of an emergency. If I should accept this amendment, we would have a further consequence. In actual fact I would then have to repay all the persons who had paid a loan levy, when they become 65 years of age. To those who had to pay loan levies in the 1960s, I would have to repay everything when they become 65 or 70 years of age. This would result from this amendment. It would immediately plunge my Department into an endless amount of unproductive work. For these reasons and for the reasons which I have already mentioned, I unfortunately cannot accept this well-intentioned amendment <span class="col_3385-3386" refersTo="page_0247"/>Amendment put and the Committee divided:</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>We enter the last stage of a debate to which South Africa has looked forward with interest, particularly since the statement by the hon. the Minister of Finance in the Budget debate in which he promised a dialogue on this vital issue which faces South Africa. That dialogue has been referred to by other hon. members on this side of the House and we have found the strange situation that the hon. the Minister of Labour has flatly and specifically repudiated the hon. the Minister of Finance. He has flatly and unequivocally repudiated the hon. the Minister of Finance. I want to place on record again the words of the hon. the Minister of Finance in his speech, where he stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not impossible that methods may be found whereby the establishment of industries in these areas can be encouraged and at the same time more non-white labour can be made available for those industries which remain in the white areas.</block>

<p>It is a clear undertaking, and he seeks a dialogue which will include the possibility of more non-white labour for those industries which remain in the white area. The hon. the Minister of Finance stated it clearly and specifically and there is no argument about it. But last night the hon. the Minister of Labour stated equally specifically that there was to be no change in Government policy and that the objective of the Government, the target of the Government, was not more non-white labour but less non-white labour in the white areas. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration supported him. So now we have two senior Ministers of the Government at complete odds on an issue of fundamental policy. The hon. the Minister of Finance recognizes the economic consequences to our country if we do not have a change, but the hon. the Minister of Labour and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration say clearly and equally specifically that they are not prepared under any circumstances to depart one inch from their policy of having not more but having less Bantu labour in the white areas.</p>

<p>Now these Ministers have to sort out this dilemma, because South Africa is entitled to know where she stands. South Africa&#x2019;s industrialists are entitled to know whether the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s undertaking was a genuine one, or whether he was dangling bait for the provincial election; of course the hon. the Minister of Labour&#x2019;s bait comes from another source. His is an admission that the verkrampte element in the Nationalist Party has taken control over policy. There is no <span class="col_3387-3388" refersTo="page_0248"/>question about it that sitting on the shoulder of every Government member who has spoken in this debate has been the shadow of Dr. Albert Hertzog. [Interjections.] I hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will come into this debate and that he will explain this repudiation of his clear statement. What have we had from the Minister&#x003F; The mixture as before; no answer whatsoever to the challenge which we have put to him. The United Party has stated the cold, hard facts, the reality of the situation which faces our country, and the failure of the Government to deal with it. We had another example this morning. We are told that what we say comes from United Party stooges. Is this another United Party stooge&#x003F; In this morning&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> the newly appointed Postmaster-General in his first statement as Postmaster-General says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die grootste probleem waarmee hy sal moet worstel is die gevoelige tekort aan opgeleide mense, vakkundiges en tegniese personeel.</block>

<p>So as lately as this very morning we had support, not from a United Party supporter but from the Government itself, for the factual situation which members on this side of the House have put before the House. From the Government, speaker after speaker, there has not been one single indication that there is even a glimmering of realization of the depth of this problem, and much less is there any sign of a solution which they have to offer. We have had the hon. members for Brakpan, Vanderbijlpark, Springs, Mayfair, Germiston, Westdene and Stilfontein one after the other standing up in this House and speaking in the words of the Herstigte Nasionale Party, closing their eyes to any attempt to face up to the issue.</p>

<p>And then we had late last night the first happening after this series of non-happenings from all those other hon. members, the happening when again for the second time in this debate we have had a fundamental repudiation of basic Nationalist Party policy. We had the hon. the Minister of Labour, who last night repudiated the policy of his own party that the Bantu in their own areas could rise to the maximum of their ability. The hon. member for Stilfontein, who spoke last night, said: &#x201C;Daar sal geen plafon wees nie&#x201D;; there will be no ceiling. They can rise to the maximum of their ability. And the hon. the Minister of Labour, by a clear interjection, repudiated the policy of his own party and said that there would be no relaxation in this regard within the Bantu areas. Secondly, he made this significant statement that the Bantu homelands are not yet independent; in other words, that the whole policy of the Nationalist Party is a policy in Never Never Land, a policy which will not be applied until they become independent. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration should also come into this debate and we will challenge him on this repudiation of basic Nationalist Party policy when his turn comes. The hon. the Minister of Mines this morning again evaded the issue. This is the test of the sincerity of the Government, a policy on which they must stand or fall. The fact that they are falling on it is evidenced by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s repudiation of the basic policy of his party, his statement that there will be no relaxation within the Bantu areas, no lifting of the ceiling above which Bantu mineworkers can rise in their own homelands.</p>

<p>Sir, this is a fundamental issue. This is basic to the philosophy of the Nationalist Party. We have evidence recently given, by a person who again cannot be classified as a United Party stooge. At the recent Sabra Congress, Professor Reynders estimated that during the period 1970 to 1980 88,000 new Bantu would be seeking work, 40,700 in the Bantu homelands and 47,300 in the white areas annually. The hon. the Minister has set as his targer the reduction of the number of Bantu in the white areas. He repeated in his debate that that was his policy. Here are 88,000 people for whom work must be found. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Before dealing with the United Party&#x2019;s escape from replying to the cardinal questions which were put to them here&#x2014;and before the end of this debate they will be afforded the opportunity of replying to those cardinal questions if they wish to do so&#x2014;I just want to reply first to a few requests addressed to me by hon. members in regard to other matters of a divergent nature. I want to start with the hon. member for Johannesburg (North), who referred here to the training and retraining of workers. I can tell the hon. member that in terms of the measure which, during the previous session, was piloted through here in regard to training schemes, provision has already been made in industrial council agreements for training schemes in quite a number of trades. In the clothing trade here in the Cape such a scheme for the training and also the retraining of workers is already in existence; such a scheme also exists in the clothing trade in the Transvaal, in the motor trade in the whole Republic, in the chemical trade in the Republic, in the building trade in the Transvaal as well as in the engineering industry in the whole Republic.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brentwood asked for an improvement of the benefits payable out of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund. I can inform him that at the moment my Department and I are considering the possibility of effecting an improvement in workmen&#x2019;s compensation <span class="col_3389-3390" refersTo="page_0249"/> benefits in the course of the next session of the House of Assembly. The hon. member also made a plea in regard to the introduction of a chair of industrial relations at one of the universities. This is a matter to which I am very sympathetic, and I really trust that one of our universities will in due course dare to undertake this task.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mayfair took up the cudgels for apprentices who sometimes had to wait a long time before they could sit for tests. It is true that there is an increasing number of apprentices who want to take these tests, and sometimes this causes delays, but we are now in the process of effecting a rearrangement which amounts to our wanting to establish separate test centres for Coloureds and for Whites, which would then expedite the taking of tests.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Westdene raised the question of greater use being made of female labour. This is a matter with which we and our Department are occupying ourselves all the time, and I may just tell him that we have the power to grant exemption from wage measures so that women who, for instance, only work in the mornings, may receive a wage lower than the proposed wage. In this way the utilization of women for morning work is being encouraged, and I trust that we shall be able to make even more progress on those lines.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stilfontein raised the question of the five-day working week in the mining industry. As hon. members know, this question of a five-day working week is a matter for negotiation between the workers, by means of their trade unions, and the employers. This is not a matter which is being enforced by the authorities. So far it has not been forced upon any organization and, what is more, this is quite in conflict with our labour legislation. In terms of the provisions of our labour legislation at present, workers may either work the five days or the five and a half days which have been prescribed, but this forms the subject of negotiation between the organizations which I have already mentioned. In the mining industry a start has already been made with these negotiations; finality has not yet been reached, but in this case it is for the organizations in question, i.e. the Mine Workers&#x2019; Union and the Chamber of Mines, to decide whether to proceed with these negotiations. I trust that they will resume these negotiations before long so that a satisfactory arrangement may be arrived at in this regard.</p>

<p>As regards the industrial tribunal&#x2019;s inquiry into the surveying, ventilation and samplers&#x2019; work. I want to say that this is a complicated matter. The inspections in loco have now been completed, and the sessions at which interested parties may give evidence, started on 24th August. I trust that as soon as those sessions&#x2014;at which interested parties who want to give evidence, are being given a hearing&#x2014;have been completed, the industrial tribunal will be in a position to finalize rapidly its recommendations to me.</p>

<p>Sir, now I come to a labour matter in regard to which a considerable number of questions still remain unanswered. If we on this side thought that by means of extending the debate on this Vote by an hour, instead the half hour, we would gain clarity in regard to the attitude adopted by the United Party, then I think we would be deceiving ourselves. Sir, even if the discussion on this Vote were to last another three days, I want to tell you that as I sum up the United Party, we would still not obtain any clarity from them. No, what we shall obtain, will be a continuation of their ambiguity. What we shall obtain, will be a continuation of their desire to have the best of both worlds; that is the continuation which we get.</p>

<p>Sir, alas, this ambiguity there holds a danger to the white worker, but also implied in this is the downfall of the United Party. When, in the course of the main Budget debate, I mentioned here a number of shortages in the various industries in the country, and pointedly asked the United Party whether they would want those shortages to be met through black labour&#x2014;as this would be in line with their entire agitation and the agitation carried on for months by their Press for the increased utilization of black labour&#x2014;what happend in this House&#x003F; When I had pointedly tabulated the shortages for them, not a sound was to be heard from them. None of them had the courage to reply to that.

<p>Before saying any more about the attitude adopted by the trade unions, I should like to put this question to the Opposition. Last night I stated what the attitude of the trade unions was in the motor trade and in the engineering industry. I could tabulate, from beginning to end, which trade unions are adopting a very strong, conservative attitude in this regard. Now I should like to hear the Opposition&#x2019;s reply. In a moment hon. members will be afforded an opportunity of replying to this question of mine. Last night I mentioned the substantive examples of the motor trade and the engineering industry. These examples are not unfounded. If the trade unions refused to accept their proposal, what would the United Party do with the millions of Blacks trained in terms of their crash training scheme&#x003F; Would hon. members reply to that question now&#x003F; The hour by which this debate has been extended, has not yet passed. I hope that in the time that is left hon. members opposite are going to tell us what they are going to do in that case. The House and the country want to know what they are going to do with those millions of non-Whites whom they will have trained. It will be of no use to the hon. member to shake his head. In the course of that meeting the Leader of the Opposition referred to the 20 million from the ranks of whom the labour might be drawn. Do hon. members remember the &#x201C;crash training programme&#x201D; announced by the Leader of the Opposition for training 20 million people&#x003F; Hon. members must give the reply to my question now. The House wants to know what they are going to do in the event of the trade unions refusing to accept their proposal. As the hon. member said, there is one world which they want, i.e. the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Just tell us, after you will have had the best of that world and after the trade unions will have refused, what you are going to do. [Interjections.] No, the hon. member may reply in a moment. In a motivated, serious and convincing speech he should tell us what they are going to do. After all, they are the alternative government. At present the Opposition is seeing dreams and visions of itself as an alternative government. They must come &#x201C;to grips&#x201D; with realities now. These are the words you are using, not so&#x003F; The reproach was levelled at me that I was unable to come to grips with realities. Those hon. members must come to grips with realities now, must tell me now what they are going to do with this mass of non-Whites whom they will have trained through their crash training scheme. What are hon. members going to do in the event of the trade unions refusing to employ them&#x003F; Sir, do you know what is going to happen&#x003F; We see right through the tactics employed by the United Party, which wants to have the best of both worlds. Last night, when the hon. member for Rosettenville took up the matter of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union with me, he used these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to ask him whether he is going to say to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union: &#x201C;Allow these people to advance.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This is the attitude adopted by the United Party. According to them we should dictate to the trade unions. We should not take them into consideration, but simply tell them: Admit these people. Incidentally, a moment ago the hon. member for Durban (Point) wrongly accused me of having said last night that there were no opportunities for promotion for the Bantu in the homelands. Let me just read out what I said last night, in order to refresh the memories of hon. members. I thought at least that hon. members would remember what happened as recently as last night. The hon. member for Rosettenville said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to know whether the hon. the Minister is prepared, in view of the fact that he will not encourage Bantu to become skilled where they are needed, to encourage them to become skilled in the homelands.</block>

<p>This is the question which was put by the hon. member. He continued as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Will he give them every chance of advancement&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, do you know what my reply to that was&#x003F; I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Certainly in the homelands; that is our policy.</block>

<p>Now the hon. member for Durban (Point) is saying that we are not affording the Blacks that opportunity in their own areas. Is that the way the hon. member wants to grapple with the truth&#x003F; It is this attitude of the United Party which has resulted in their whole political credibility being reduced to shreds. With this double-talk on the part of the United Party they are saying on the one hand that they will do nothing without the concurrance of the trade unions, and, on the other hand, that strong action should be taken against the trade unions in the future. Sir, if the United Party were ever to govern South <span class="col_3393-3394" refersTo="page_0251"/>Africa and wanted to carry out this &#x201C;crash training programme&#x201D; of theirs, they would not be able to train the non-Whites and then to employ them. They would not be able to do this, for in this country this would simply give rise to the greatest measure of racial tension which one could have.</p>

<p>In order to get away from replying to the cardinal question which I put to them, the United Party has fallen back on Dr. Diederichs. Dr. Diederichs must be dragged in as well. Now they want to hide behind him because they do not have the courage or the will to reply to these cardinal questions. I should now like to read out passages taken from two speeches made by Dr. Diederichs. Then we shall be able to see to what extent there is a difference of opinion. In the first place, I want to read out a passage taken from a speech which has not been printed as yet. However, I have here the typed copy of Dr. Diederichs&#x2019; reply in this regard. I should now like to read out what is of importance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am coming to the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech. This is the only speech which those hon. members have considered worth quoting. I shall come to it in a moment. Hon. members will hear parts of that as well. In this reply, to which I am referring now, the Minister of Finance said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following, which has a direct bearing on this matter (Hansard, 24/8)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To be more concrete, this Government is determined to bring about under its policy &#x2026;</block>

<p>I emphasize &#x201C;under its policy&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the greatest possible development of the Bantu homelands inside and around those homelands. The Government is also determined to afford the non-Whites, through that development of the Bantu homelands, inside and on its borders, every possible opportunity to develop to the highest level possible.</block>

<p>This is the first quotation which purely represents Government policy. The same applies to the next quotation. Having referred to the necessity of border area development, Dr. Diederichs said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; if our industrialists want to co-operate with us to develop this part of our country as we should like to develop it, they will experience every willingness on the part of the Government to help them to bring about the greatest possible development in the white part of our country.</block>

<p>Now, my hon. friends in the Opposition only find it necessary to quote from the Budget speech made by the Minister of Finance, from which I am also going to quote now. On 12th August the Minister said the following (column 1534)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government is also investigating anew the encouragement of industrial growth in border areas and in the Bantu homelands. It is not impossible that methods may be found whereby the establishment of industries in these areas can be encouraged and, at the same time, more non-white labour &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is &#x201C;non-white labour&#x201D; and not &#x201C;black labour&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; can be made available for those industries which remain in the white areas. The results of this investigation will be made known later.</block>

<p>What one actually finds so deplorable, is the attitude adopted by the United Party, i.e. that, with this black employment agitation of theirs, they are interpreting that statement made by Dr. Diederichs as being a reference to &#x201C;black labour&#x201D;. The Government is not against the employment of non-Whites in white areas. As the Minister of Labour I am engaged in affording, in our white areas, opportunities to the Coloureds and the Indians. There is, for instance, the recent case where, in the O.K. Bazaars in Sea Point, I gave permission for a whole floor to be staffed by Coloureds. Let me also say in this regard that it is the policy of the Government to grant more opportunities for employment to Coloureds and Indians in the white area, i.e. in terms of our system of controlled employment. In pursuance of this system I have just decided that Barclays Bank will be granted the right to employ 31 Coloured women in their reception department. In the first place this was done because Whites were not available.</p>

<p>There is unemployment amongst them&#x2014;not a particularly great deal, but there is some unemployment. The point I want to make, is that in this respect the Government is also granting Barclays Bank the right to employ Coloureds. The principles on which they may do so, are that it has to be done in accordance with Government policy; in other words, that there shall be no instances of Whites and non-Whites working side by side.</p>

<p>No. I am pleased that the hon. member has put this question at this stage. From the other conditions which we are placing upon the employment of Coloureds and Indians, we shall now be able <span class="col_3395-3396" refersTo="page_0252"/>to infer what the difference is between the National Party policy of controlled employment and the U.P. policy of integration. The hon. member, who is a new member, should listen carefully now; he will still be afforded ample opportunity in this House to refer to it. As regards the Coloured women who are going to be employed by Barclays Bank, we are making the following conditions: Firstly, that there shall be no mixed working conditions&#x2014;for instance, Whites and Coloureds may not work at the same desks; in the same employment situation there may not be instances of Whites and non-Whites working side by side; secondly, no white person shall work under the guidance or supervision of a non-white person. Here lies the basic difference between the policy of the National Party and that of the United Party. We say that this is our explicit policy &#x2026;</p>

<p>In the legislation there is nothing to prevent this. However, it is possible for us to rectify such matters by way of administrative action. For instance, the arrangement with Barclays Bank and O.K. Bazaars was effected administratively. It was not effected in terms of statutory powers.</p>

<p>But in those cases the employers are Whites.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should listen first to the whole argument and get his next question ready in the meantime. Barclays Bank and O.K. Bazaars can refuse to do so. They need not even come to us; that is true, but if this came to our notice&#x2014;that was why I asked you last night to bring cases of this nature to our notice&#x2014;I would tell them that this is in conflict with our labour pattern, with our labour policy. If at that stage they are still not prepared to rectify this position by way of consultation, I have the power to refer the matter to the Industrial Tribunal and to obtain a recommendation from them.</p>

<p>If it is stated in this recommendation that there must be job reservation, I have the power to make it retrospective to any date which I deem necessary. Therefore, the statutory power will always provide us with the necessary leverage for causing administrative measures like these to function properly.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the misrepresentation of the speech made by Dr. Diederichs, to the way the United Party is now wresting his speech from its context and to the way they now want at hide behind it so that they need not enlighten this House and the country as to their own lack of policy in this regard. Amongst other things, the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If our industrialists are prepared to do their share as well, we as the Government will be only too glad to do our share in conjunction with them.</block>

<p>But let me state now on what condition this will have to be done, a condition made by the Minister himself. He went on and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, it is possible that we shall do everything in our power to develop our own white country to the highest level possible.</block>

<p>Do hon. members want to know what the condition is&#x003F; It will interest them. Referring to the industrialists, the Minister said the following in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They should understand that the Government was elected with specific instructions and political tasks, which it has to carry out; otherwise it would be disloyal to those by whom it was elected.</block>

<p>Therefore, if hon. members are of the opinion that they can play off the Minister of Finance either against me or against the Government, they are making a mistake. Dr. Diederichs is standing by the standpoint of the National Party as firmly as any of us can hope to stand. This escapism on the part of the United Party will not get them anywhere. This cunning will not get them anywhere. If they think that they will get away with these dust-raising tactics of theirs, they are mistaken. For if these tactics of theirs, this policy of a crash programme for 20 million, were to succeed, the inevitable result would be that Whites would be ousted from their employment and that white cities would become blacker instead of whiter. As these matters are of so much importance to South Africa, to the white worker and to the public in general, there is no occasion for me nor for hon. members opposite to leave any doubt about our standpoints in regard to these matters. Therefore, I hope that in what is left of this debate the United Party will display the courage and the will to tell us in very clear terms exactly how and where they want to employ those Blacks whom they want to <span class="col_3397-3398" refersTo="page_0253"/>train through this crash training programme of theirs; they must tell us exactly what they are going to do with those Blacks if the trade unions are not going to co-operate. They owe it to the white trade unions and to the workers to state this. If they do not do this, they will be perpetrating a calculated deception of the public.</p>

I hope that he will give us decisive replies to the questions which were put by the hon. the Minister of Labour. We have now seen once again examples of their typical tactics of running away and distortion.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to quote from the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Finance. Amongst other things he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One cannot simply break down an established labour pattern which has brought great prosperity and happiness to one&#x2019;s country, for on the one hand it creates dissatisfaction with certain people who feel that their existence is being threatened, and, on the other hand, it creates with others expectations which cannot be satisfied.</block>

<p>Is there a more explicit guarantee to be stated, i.e. that those people should not derive from this expectations which they would like to have seen in this&#x003F; On the other hand, we are given the guarantee for our normal labour pattern in our country.</p>

<p>Here we have that typical howling of the wolves, the wolves who are howling for the blood of the white worker. Those wolves are merely the capitalists and certain employers who only care for their own gain. We heard them here. The hand of Esau and the voice of Oppenheimer. They are here. It is those people who, for the sake of bigger profits and enriching themselves, want to disturb our traditional labour pattern and racial harmony here in South Africa. As the hon. the Minister put it, they are prepared to exchange for the golden calf the continued existence and the industrial peace which we have here. Our birthright is now to be exchanged for a mess of pottage. But, on the other hand, they also have the wolves, the liberalistic English Press. Some of their former columnists are sitting on that side of the House. But now we do not hear him saying anything about labour. I wish he would take part in this labour debate so that we may hear what he now has to say about the integration which he always advocated in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Sunday Times.</i> It is they who are stirring up these United Party supporters by means of a manpower agitation campaign, which has no other purpose than that of destroying our existing social and political pattern in South Africa.

<p>Mr. Chairman, they realize that, if they were to pit policy against policy, they would never be able to destroy this National Party at the polls. However, now they are coming forward with different attacking tactics. By bringing up economic factors they now want to force us to our knees. It is in these attempts that they are being backed by the agitation of the English Press and the capitalists in order that the policy of separate development may be destroyed and room may be made for that policy of integration.</p>

<p>Recently the hon. the Leader of the Opposition very unambiguously stated in the Budget debate once again that they would repeal section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act if they came into power. They should tell us now whether this means that there will be mixed working conditions on an unprecedented scale, conditions where non-Whites will be senior to Whites in certain posts&#x003F; Lat night the hon. the Minister extended an invitation to them to bring such cases to his notice. But they will not do that, for look at the dilemma in which they will land themselves if they were to come across such a case and were to bring it to the notice of the hon. the Minister. They dare not do it. But that is not all. They also know that through that policy of theirs they will force down the standard of living of the white worker, so that he will not be able to compete in the same sphere of employment and on the same standard of <span class="col_3399-3400" refersTo="page_0254"/>living as will be the case with the non-white person. They know he cannot compete with the non-Whites in that respect.</p>

<p>All day we have to hear from the United Party agitators and Press that the National Party&#x2019;s labour policy is imposing restraints on the growth rate of the country. But let us make it very clear that the National Party also appreciates the importance of a sound growth rate. But we say inexorably that the growth rate is not priority number one with us. If we had to choose between the growth rate and the position of the white worker here in South Africa, we would immediately and unambiguously tell them that we are giving preference to the position of the white worker. That is our policy. Nor are we afraid of saying this to them. What is more, I think the white worker is entitled to know this. Now we are asking them that they, too, should tell the white worker what their replies are to the questions which are being put to them by the hon. the Minister. But they will not do so. Just as they did during the past elections, they will not tell us the truth as regards their policy. Who will ever trust the United Party&#x003F; Who will ever believe them&#x003F; Is this not the same party which, if pressure is brought to bear upon it, is prepared to make concessions&#x003F; Hon. members will recall that a year or two ago the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself admitted here, when pressure was brought to bear upon him, that he was prepared to admit Bantu to this Parliament. That is how far they will go if pressure is brought to bear upon them. I can predict here to-day that if those capitalists and the English Press brought pressure to bear upon them, they would yield once again, as they have already done in order to destroy the colour bar here in South Africa. But I want to ask them whether they are prepared to be consistent in carrying through, in every aspect of society, that rate-for-the-job policy of theirs. Are they prepared to do so&#x003F;</p>

<p>But, surely, in that case the United Party are not being honest in their policy if they are only going to apply it when it suits them. All of a sudden that side of the House is concerned about the economic growth of the country. But when they had the opportunity to develop South Africa economically, they were merely concerned about the economy of Britain. At that stage they were prepared to allow our own people to work with picks and shovels. What was their attitude in respect of Iscor and Sasol&#x003F; At that stage they were concerned about the steel of Britain; they did not think of possibilities for our South African white workers.</p>

<p>But I should like to state a problem to the hon. the Minister. I am referring here to the mentally retarded pupils in our special schools. On the East Rand we have approximately 1,000 of these pupils. These children have to attend school until they are 16 years of age. At the request of their parents, those children may remain in those schools up to the age of 18. However, the problem is that 90 per cent of those children are not suitable for any work other than sheltered employment. This problem is in fact created by these boys for whom there are no opportunities for work, for they must become the eventual breadwinners. It is in fact because of the highest standard which they passed at school, that they do not qualify for being enrolled as apprentices. Hon. members will be astonished to see at these special schools what work can in fact be done by those boys. But all of this is in vain if the labour market is closed to those boys. I should like to see a continuation of the good work done at those schools. Let us utilize the services of those boys more effectively. They have the ability. We should merely grant them the opportunity to develop further.</p>

<p>Now I just want to ask the hon. the Minister whether they cannot be given training in certain institutions, even if it takes as long as 10 years. By doing this we can make it possible for them to become economicaly independent as well. Is it not possible to establish special training centres for them&#x003F; But I may as well ask the question now which I actually wanted to ask. Is it not possible for us on the East Rand, too, to be granted a sheltered employment institution for those boys&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg made an interesting attempt at making political capital out of this debate for his side. The only point which needs a reply, is his question as to whether we shall apply the principle of the rate for the job in every respect. The United Party&#x2019;s standpoint is that the rate for the job is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end. [Interjections.] Oh yes, this is how it is all over the world. That is why it originated, i.e. to prevent workers who have reached a high standard of living, from being undermined by other workers who can take away their employment from them because thty maintain a lower standard of living. I just want to assure the hon. member that wherever that danger may exist in South Africa, the United Party will implement the principle of the rate for the job. There will not be any exceptions in respect of which it will be necessary to uphold that principle.</p>

<p>But I should like to come back to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister has now made his second contribution to this debate, and with his second contribution he disappointed the people even more deeply than he did with his first. I want to deal at once with the mighty catch question which he put to us, this catch quesion which he feels convinced in his heart will crush the United Party, because we cannot possibly answer it.

<p>He wants to know what we are going to do with the thousands upon thousands of workers, [Interjection.] Sir, I am pleased to see how nervous my friends opposite are. He wants to know what we are going to do with the thousands upon thousands of non-Whites whom we are going to train, i.e. what we shall do in the event of the trade unions refusing to employ them. what we shall do with them, after we shall have trained them, in the event of the trade unions refusing at that stage to employ them. But, surely, he cannot put such a question if he knows what the point of the discussion is. The attitude adopted by the United Party has consistently and all along been that a change will have to take place in the labour pattern in South Africa, and that that change can only be brought about in consultation with the trade unions through the process of industrial conciliation and collective bargaining. And if a crash training programme has to be introduced, then that training of manpower will have to take place in consultation with, and with the assistance of, the trade unions. [Interjections.] Sir, can you believe that a Minister of Labour can ask such a question while he knows or ought to know that skill can only be transmitted from one skilled person to another&#x003F; This is the process of the training of skilled workers. If the trade unions do not co-operate, and if the skilled people are not willing to transmit their skill in the apprenticeship of the unskilled ones, then such a plan cannot work. In other words, the Minister's question is based on ignorance and a wilful refusal to see the policy of the United Party as it is clear to see, a recreation of the labour pattern through making use of the existing means for collective bargaining between organized labour and organized employers. Nobody can be trained under our policy if it is not effected on that basis. I have now replied to the question put by the Minister, and I can only say that never in my experience has a sillier question been put with more bravado in this Parliament than has been the case with this one. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Because, as I shall show in the minute I have left, the Minister did not contribute anything to this important discussion, because he is frustrating the people and because he refuses us an opportunity of obtaining the means for finding a truly satisfactory and just solution to our problems, we have no alternative but to express our dissatisfaction with the Minister as a member of the Cabinet&#x2014;not as an individual&#x2014;by moving the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To reduce the amount of Revenue Vote No. 23 by R5,000 from the item &#x201C;Minister, R13,000&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Sir, you will know that this is a step which we do not often take, but in these circumstances we have no option. With his explanation to-day and with his repudiation of the Minister of Finance, the hon. the Minister has rendered meaningless that apparently significant statement which was made by the Minister in his Budget speech. The Minister must now tell me this: Whereas he mentioned that according to his own survey there was at the moment a shortage of far more than 40,000 white workers&#x2014;and I still think he left out the women; he should check his figures a little&#x2014;and whereas there are predictions made by people with similar convictions to his, good and learned people, to the effect that this shortage will increase to 75,000 within a year or two, does he honestly want to tell me now that the Coloureds and the Indians of South Africa can meet that shortage&#x003F; Surely, he knows that is not true. What can in fact happen and what we do welcome, is that these Coloureds and Indians will now be allowed to do more skilled and skilful work. A change has occurred in much of the pettiness in the attitude of the Government, which we have come to know so well. Even the hon. member for Houghton remembered this along with me &#x2014;how, during the discussion of the Industrial Conciliation Act and especially clause 77 in 1955, we were informed that that legislation was necessary to prevent what the Minister is now doing for the O.K. Bazaars and for Barclays Bank. But we are glad. Every advance being made in the direction of United Party policy, is in the interests of South Africa and we welcome it. But here we have no permanent solution, and for that reason we must express our dissatisfaction. As a result of the Minister&#x2019;s actions, what is left of the policy of the Government&#x003F; It is the policy of the Government that it should be possible for the Bantu in the reserves to make as much progress as they can, but the Minister gave us <span class="col_3403-3404" refersTo="page_0256"/>no reply to the question of the mineworkers in those four mines, no reply whatsoever. We say it is our policy that these changes should take place in consultation and in conjunction with the trade unions. The Government says its policy is &#x201C;the sky is the limit&#x201D; in the reserves. What has become of their policy now&#x003F; There is no reply. Hopeless, helpless, clumsy and incompetent at stating or implementing their own policy. But this is not all.</p>

<p>The time has arrived&#x2014;and the Minister appreciates this, for he has now done this in the case of the Coloureds and the Indians&#x2014;for us to cause the pattern in South Africa to change in other spheres as well, on the understanding which I mentioned, i.e. that this is to be effected in consultation and in conjunction with the trade unions. And one of the matters which they will take into account, is the availability of labour in every trade, whether or not it is White, Coloured or Indian. Those factors will be taken into account. They will have to take into account the mores of our people, the spiritual and the ethical values and the views of our people, whether they are right or wrong. For that reason there will have to be separate facilities. Over the years these have been in existence in the old Shops and Offices Act and the old Factories Act, legislation which was placed on the Statute Book by the United Party. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville has once more given a fine demonstration here of the ambiguity of the United Party. While he spoke he put me in mind of the Jacobs egg. You know that on 19th August the hon. member for Hillbrow stood up here and said that the Government was separating the yolk and the white, thus making the egg sterile. But then he also said that the hon. member for Houghton was mixing the two, and that when the yolk and the white were mixed one had a rotten egg. I want to agree with him there, because such a rotten egg usually explodes. But he neglected to say what they were doing with the egg. I shall tell you what they are doing. They are mixing the shell, the membrane, the yolk and the white, and then sitting on it to see if something does not want to hatch. That is what they are doing, because they do not actually know what they want. I am struggling here to make out, from what the hon. member for Yeoville said, whether he now wants to train the Bantu, and with which trade unions he now wants to reach an agreement. He says they want to reach an agreement with the trade unions, but with which trade unions do they want to do so&#x003F; With Tucsa&#x003F;</p>

<p>I can assure him that with the white trade unions he will not get anywhere.</p>

<p>Sir, the policy of the National Party is, after all, so obvious. We realize the tremendous industrial development that there is and we have also never denied that there is a labour shortage. We say that there will have to be many adjustments from time to time, and we also know that there are big challenges being brought to bear, not only on the Government, but on all management levels in South Africa, because one does not only find productivity in a worker. There are raw materials and capital, etc., and all those factors affect productivity. Then there is the workers corps, as the third leg, who must also do their share in accepting the challenges. And then there is, in addition, the Opposition as well, which must be more responsible and not make all kinds of strange remarks just for the sake of politicking. But they are disappointed because separate development succeeded. That is their problem, and that is why they carry on like this.</p>

<p>Labour peace is one of the greatest assets of any country. Apart from the good relationships that must exist between employer and employee, one must also guard against racial friction and industrial unrest, because it is important to have those things. We have also experienced such good relationships in South Africa under National Party Government during the past 22 years. In addition everyone must receive his fair share and feel happy and satisfied. From time to time the Government brings about amendments in its Acts, to adapt to the times we live in, and those shortages are supplemented, not in an uncontrolled but in a controlled way. The United Party wants it to continue unchecked with their <i>laissezfaire</i> policy. There must be a balance between labour needs and growth rate. That is why the balanced, healthy and realistic approach held by the National Party has resulted in a growth rate objective of 5.5 per cent being set, which will cause the fewest bottlenecks. The needs of the economy dare not jeopardize the Government&#x2019;s relationships policy, because then we have industrial unrest which is unhealthy for any country. The obverse is also true. No one is more specifically aware of this than this extremely responsible Government. Political economists are obsessed by the materialistic side of the national economy, while the Government says that we must establish a balanced economy there, along the guidelines the Minister mentioned, i.e. that the Whites should not be ousted from the labour field; that the position of the Whites should be protected; that there should be no integration, no working together in the same job, and that non-Whites should not be placed in controlling positions. Sir, the National Party is the only force between the blackening of the industries and the preservation of the position of the white man in the industrial world. The National Party&#x2019;s policy is a long-term policy. It is not a short-term policy of just solving this small problem now and then having many problems to-morrow or the next day. The <span class="col_3405-3406" refersTo="page_0257"/>National Party is the party of yesterday, today and to-morrow.</p>

<p>Sir, there has hardly been an economist, removed from the political field, who does not warn against the dangers of a too rapid growth rate. A growth rate of 5.5 per cent, is, therefore, the present ideal, while the United Party wants to let the reins go. In the <i>Vaderland</i> of 21st November, 1969, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria said the following, and I shall quote it, since the hon. member for Yeoville is so fond of quoting (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Integration of the skilled Bantu in the white sector of the economy carries the germ of South Africa&#x2019;s downfall. It is a short-term solution, calculated on maximum profit, but it discounts the future.</block>

<p>The National Party&#x2019;s policy is aimed at this from the outset. The National Party&#x2019;s policy is a practical policy that takes cognisance of the development rate in the metropolitan areas. &#x003F;s well as the availability of labour. No matter how important growth rate may be, it will not receive precedence over the white worker&#x2019;s position in the industrial world. The Government has no intention of reliquishing the policy on which it has worked for the protection of the Whites.</p>

<p>Sir, in addition I want to quote something in connection with the building industry, the industry that is being exploited to the largest extent in recent times. In the <i>Daily Mail</i> of 5 th February, 1970, it is alleged, in large thick letters, that &#x201C;Builders&#x2019; Workers&#x2019; shortage worsens&#x201D;. In the December 1969 issue of the monthly magazine of the Building Industries Federation, <i>The South African Builder,</i> these interesting particulars appear&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Output in the Building Industry rose by approximately 125 per cent from the doldrums of the depressed early sixties to the record figure for 1969.</block>

<p>It continues by stating&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The skilled labour force was more than doubled during the period.</block>

<p>That is in the building industry. It continues by stating&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This spectacular achievement was reinforced by the rationalization of work and the introduction of a wide range of operatives to conserve skilled labour and to permit of the more productive utilization of the labour force as a whole.</block>

<p>The article concludes with the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is possible that for the hypercritical these changes are not taking place fast enough, but the Building Industry is satisfied that it is doing more than any other comparable industry to solve its own problems and to equip itself for the challenges of the future.</block>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to say very briefly that I shall support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. I too feel that the hon. the Minister of Labour has given a most disappointing performance in this debate. He has answered none of the really relevant questions which have been put to him on the basic economic issue that is worrying the country. To one&#x2019;s deep disappointment one heard a reiteration of National Party policy irrespective of the harm which it is quite obviously causing the economy of South Africa. We heard a lot of talk in this House last night and to-day, I may say, about materialism and derogatory remarks about capitalists. Sir, I wonder how the entrepreneurs who support the Nationalist Party are beginning to feel about the sort of remarks that hon. members in this House are passing about the r&#x00F4;le played by the capitalists and the &#x201C;materialists&#x201D; in South Africa. Perhaps it is as well to remind hon. members that those people have developed this country; that they are the ones who pay the lion&#x2019;s share into the coffers of the State and the taxes that keep this country ticking over and that they provide the employment that keeps the workers relatively comfortable-&#x2014;certainly the white ones. [Interjection.] I would like to remind that hon. member that this is a capitalistic country; this is not a socialistic country; this is a free enterprise country, and the profit motive as far as I know is perfectly acceptable. Very high taxes are paid by the capitalists of this country&#x2014;very high taxes indeed.</p>

<p>I am also very disappointed in the fact that the hon. the Minister gave no answer whatsoever to the very important basic question of principle about the employment of Africans in skilled jobs in mines in the homelands. Not very long ago <i>Bantu</i> published an article in which it said that encouragement of the State was to be given to African workers in the homelands in the mining industry to reach any height which they are capable of reaching. As I understand the position, the tribunal is making an investigation into this whole position. We got a completely non-informative answer from the hon. the Minister of Mines to-day that this matter will be pursued at a later date. But the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s tribunal is now apparently making an investigation. As far as I know the tribunal generally acts under the Industrial Conciliation Act, and as far as I know the Industrial Conciliation Act has been suspended in the homelands. I think it is a relevant question to put to the hon. the Minister as to what <i>locus standi</i> the tribunal has in the homelands and why the hon. the Minister did not simply take his courage in his hands and, in terms of Government policy, allow Africans to do skilled work in the mines <span class="col_3407-3408" refersTo="page_0258"/>inside the homelands by suspending the relevant section of the Mines and Works Act and its regulations. This is a question that I think one is entitled to ask.</p>

<p>Not one word has been said in this debate about the position of the majority, of our workers in this country, the economic position of the African workers and the wages which they are earning in this economy. There has been a lot of talk about industrial peace, of course. It does not apparently occur to anybody that the African has no collective bargaining right, and that he has not got the legitimate right to strike. Indeed on the two occasions in the last two years where there have been strikes&#x2014;the one of the dockworkers in Durban and the one of the coal hauliers recently in Johannesburg&#x2014;summary action was taken; either the workers were dismissed or simply hauled off to court, charged with striking illegally and fined.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, Sir, we have industrial peace under such conditions. I want to know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s work committees are doing to see that the legitimate grievances of workers whose salaries and wages are well below the poverty datum line are properly investigated. As far as I can understand, there are only some 49 of these work committees set up under the Settlement of Disputes Act operating at all in all the thousands of establishments that we have in this country. So what happens, Sir&#x003F; Every time there is a new wage agreement; every time certain jobs are reclassified and Africans are allowed to take over those jobs, as happened recently in the iron and steel industry, the Africans are cut down to nothing; they get a miserable 2&#x00BD; cent rise while a very much higher rise, of course, is given to the white workers who have all the advantages of collective bargaining. How long does the hon. the Minister think this undesirable state of affairs can continue, when the starting wage in manufacturing is still roughly R40 a month; when the poverty datum line figure in Soweto for a family of five has risen to R59.70, according to a Johannesburg City Council calculation&#x003F; What is the hon. the Minister doing about this enormous labour force which falls under him&#x003F; It does not fall under the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. What is he doing to see that there is going to be some reasonable increment in the wages of these people&#x003F; He can tell me, of course, that wages have gone up by 16 per cent over the last couple of years. What one has to look at is the ever-rising cost of living. Even though real wages have gone up slightly, the Minister must look at the basic figure on which that increased percentage has been calculated. If that basic figure is far too low, Sir, then this 16 per cent increase does not mean a thing.</p>

<p>I am therefore not as enamoured with this expression of &#x201C;industrial peace&#x201D; as everybody else is because I know that conditions are not ideal in this country and that the Africans who are denied all these opportunities of collective bargaining are getting a very poor deal indeed. It is the responsibility of the hon. the Minister of Labour to see that something is done about it. Some of the trade unions themselves are complaining about this. Only a month or two ago the Garmet Workers Union said that it had become increasingly perturbed about the increasing spread between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers in this country. It is a dangerous phenomenon. This is the only industrial country in the world where the spread between the wage rates for skilled and unskilled workers is not narrowing. In South Africa the spread is widening all the time, and that is so for one simple reason; it is because the African workers do not have collective bargaining rights. The intelligent, experienced, veteran white trade unionists in this country are themselves worried about this because they feel that this is leading to a very dangerous position in South Africa. Mr. Tom Murray of the Boilermakers&#x2019; Society has also pointed out that 190,000 African labourers in the steel and engineering industry will not benefit from the recent improvements which have been brought about in the conditions of the white workers in that industry.</p>

<p>Nobody really takes up the case of the African workers. The so-called Government representatives may do their best, Sir, but it is not good enough and it is not good enough because the employers in this case know full well that the Africans do not have a union behind them which can take action, if necessary, if no improvements are effected. Mr. Grobbelaar, the General Secretary of Tucsa, has also stated that it is essential that this whole question of trade union rights for Africans should be reconsidered. He says that to say that Africans are not ripe for trade unionism is ridiculous because nothing has been done to make them ripe, and that is absolutely correct. Trade unionism and collective bargaining are part and parcel of a modern industrial society. It is absurd in this day and age that we are not even considering the question of granting any of these rights to Africans who are not only unskilled workers to-day but who, despite all Government legislation, despite all the pressure against them, are steadily making their way into the semi-skilled occupations. I predict that it will not be very long before they will be in the skilled occupations as well. The sheer force of economic circumstances is going to bring this about and whatever big talk comes from hon. members on that side about materialism being of secondary importance and South Africa&#x2019;s traditional way of life being the main thing, let them wait until there is unemployment in this country among the white people and then they will see that the choice is going to be very different indeed <span class="col_3409-3410" refersTo="page_0259"/>I want to conclude by saying that something must also be done about this whole question of the customary colour bar. It is all very well to talk about wanting revolutionary changes in the labour pattern in South Africa, but unless the Government and the official Opposition are prepared to do something about the traditional customary, colour bar, we are not going to get those changes.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Houghton surely does not expect me to follow up on what she had to say, because the white worker in South Africa is not prepared to commit <i>hara-kiri</i> by accepting the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s policy, though she is at least honest in connection with her labour policy. Sir, permit me to begin on a more restful note, because I want to deal with the position of a very small group of artisans. I want to take up the cudgels for them with the Minister. I am now speaking of the monumental workers in the &#x201C;stone masons&#x201D; trade. These are the people responsible for making gravestones and for doing ornamental stone work on certain buildings. They also have a minimum apprenticeship period of five years, after which they can be appointed at a minimum wage of R1.15 per hour. That is the position in the Cape Province, at any rate. It is a trade reserved for Whites, though Coloureds are not actually interested in this field. To-day in the entire Cape Peninsula there are only 11 such artisans and two apprentices. Because the whole industry is actually in the hands of a few bodies, these people&#x2019;s hands are actually tied in the sense that essentially they have no bargaining power. This is one of the loveliest and most creative of trades, and it is dying out as a result of its wage structure. In the Peninsula to-day there are only two such artisans who earn more than the minimum wage. I mention this just to indicate what their bargaining power is. Then there is yet another difference in wage determination between the Cape Province and the Transvaal. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he cannot urge the Wage Board to investigate this industry, with a view to determining wages for these people. Particularly because they make gravestones we must not let these people leave the industry. They must still be around for a while so that we can at least still be of service to the United Party in this respect!</p>

<p>Throughout this debate a great deal was said about a labour shortage. The Opposition was also nagging continually because it was the preconceived pattern with which they came along to this sitting, i.e. to greatly exaggerate this labour shortage. Throughout this entire process the impression is being created that they have woven an instant solution for this problem into their policy. They are trying to pretend that this shortage can be ascribed <i>in toto</i> to the National Party&#x2019;s ideology of job reservation. I want to ask the United Party on what they base the extent of that shortage, which they are now exaggerating to such an extent. Is it based on particulars they obtained from surveys of the labour needs conducted by the Chamber of Industries&#x003F; If not, from where do they obtain their particulars which are now being so greatly exaggerated&#x003F; Are they not perhaps unfounded&#x003F;</p>

<p>Yes, they could have obtained them from the Minister, but where does he obtain his information when he makes inquiries about the labour needs of industrialists. At this stage it has probably become necessary for us to take a much more critical look at the needs in the field of labour. I do not want to allege that in these replies to surveys there is a very strong political undertone to be detected, but if I were to have said it, I am very sure that I would not have been very far wrong. I shall leave the matter at that for the moment. I want to claim that these surveys definitely do not give us, at all times, a correct representation of the real needs in the labour sphere.</p>

<speech by="#van_breda">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, in ten minutes time the hon. member for Maitland may ask his questions. I have only ten minutes. The replies to these inquiries, which are sent to industrialists, in the majority of cases indicate their needs to be much greater than they really are. I want to make the claim to-day that if the Department of Labour were to be in a position to supply every industrialist with the labour he wanted, in accordance with his reply to the inquiry, that industrialist would not be prepared to employ all those people. That is so because the industrialist is not bound by the reply he gives to such a survey. There simply cannot be any enforcement. If one were to return to such an industrialist he would say: I indicated my needs as such because I expected to obtain a certain contract, which I subsequently did not obtain. That is why I do not really need the people. I therefore do not think that we have, at this stage, an absolute picture of what our real labour needs are.</p>

<p>Let us take an example. A trade which the hon. member for Yeoville mentioned yesterday as an example of a field in which an artificial shortage developed as a result of this Government&#x2019;s ideology of job reservation. It is an industry which has already been mentioned several times. I am speaking of motor mechanics, and in particular of those in the Cape Peninsula. The present position is that there are few if any Coloured artisans in this field. There are a few of them, but they are the exceptions. It is the members of the Motor Mechanics Trade Union who do not <span class="col_3411-3412" refersTo="page_0260"/>train Coloured apprentices. It has nothing to do with this Government&#x2019;s policy of job reservation. It is that trade union&#x2019;s right to lay down its policy. I want to repeat the question to which the Minister has not yet received a reply, although he asked the question repeatedly. If the Opposition had been in a position to implement its policy, what would its actions have been in respect of this Motor Mechanics Trade Union&#x003F; Would hon. members negotiate with them&#x003F; As the Minister has indicated, there have already been negotiations, and they are simply not prepared to train Coloured apprentices. Are those hon. members going to compel them to train Coloured apprentices if they are not prepared to do so&#x003F; The argument of the United Party, and in particular of the hon. member for Yeoville, that the United Party is specifically better equipped to negotiate with trade unions, is simply another of the quasi-solutions they are presenting. The overall majority of workers in South Africa, who are organized into trade unions, do not trust the United Party to handle their affairs for them. I do not want to give a final answer on that, but if they are not prepared, in this field, to negotiate with a National Government, a Government which, as they know, will at all times protect the white workers as a result of its policy of job reservation, what guarantee has the hon. member for Yeoville that the trade unions would specifically be prepared to negotiate with him&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member said recently that the labour pattern in South Africa must be change. If we now inquire a little more closely into this &#x201C;crash programme&#x201D;, then the hon. member says that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s question is ridiculous, because he proceeds from the assumption that the trade unions will not be prepared to employ non-Whites after they have been trained. He says that we should obtain the co-operation of the trade unions in connection with this &#x201C;crash programme&#x201D;. Sir. I am now asking, with tears in my eyes: If these people are not prepared, under normal circumstances, to train Coloureds in the Motor Mechanics Trade Union, for example, is it not hypothetical to accept that they will be prepared to co-operate in connection with the &#x201C;crash programme&#x201D;, which will actually endanger their own position.

<p>Mr. Chairman, on 12th August this year the hon. the Minister of Finance stood up in this House and took an extremely important step. He extended an invitation to the industrialists of South Africa and told them that he would like their co-operation in the development of the border areas and the Bantu homelands. As a <i>quid pro quo,</i> he would try to give them more non-white labour. The hon. the Minister could promise that <i>quid pro quo</i> only because he knows that there is a tremendous shortage of white labour in South Africa. Because the industrialists are aware of the tremendous shortage, because they know how serious the matter is, they regarded that invitation as being of such importance that they, as it were before the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words were cold, accepted the invitation to negotiate with him in an attempt to help themselves by means of obtaining more non-white labour. I may just mention in passing that everybody gained the impression that non-white labour was meant to include Bantu labour. But what did the hon. the Minister of Labour say in this House this morning&#x003F; He said that it was never meant to be Bantu labour. By non-white labour, they had meant Coloured and Indian labour only. When I asked the hon. the Minister whether there was any unemployment among the Coloureds and the Indians, he replied that there was in fact unemployment, but not much. Does the hon. the Minister of Labour really want to tell this House that the offer which the hon. the Minister of Finance made to the industrialists, related only to Coloureds and Indians and not to Bantu&#x003F; The hon. the Minister talks about foxy moves (<i>jakkalsstreke</i>), but this was the foxiest move I have ever heard an hon. Minister make in this House in an attempt to prove that he had not deviated from the policy as stated by the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Now the hon. the Minister puts questions to us. He must first obtain clarity for himself. After that he must obtain clarity for South Africa. Who is right, the Minister of Labour or the Minister of Finance&#x003F; Both cannot be right. But if the hon. the Minister of Finance was wrong and if the statement which he made related to Coloureds and Indians and not to Bantu, I maintain that this invitation to the industrialists not only meant nothing, but meant more than just that. Then the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement of this morning was a tremendous slap in the face to the industrialist who had shown himself to be prepared to help the Minister to implement his policy. It amounted to nothing else. Now the hon. the Minister must tell us which of them is right. Both cannot be right. There is not enough Coloured and Indian labour available to make up the existing shortage. We want to know what other form of labour the hon. the Minister of Finance had in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before the lunch hour I pointed out that unless the hon. the Minister can say that there is a considerable amount of unemployment among the Coloureds and the Indians in South Africa, the explanation which he has now given and the statement by the hon. the Minister of Labour have made the matter completely valueless. In fact, he put a damper on the statement which the hon. the Minister of Finance made in this House on 12th August.</p>

<p>I want to make another point. The hon. the Minister continues to fling specific questions at our side. The hon. the Minister said that we referred to a crash training programme. He wanted to know from us how we would train the 20 million people under our crash programme. My hon. Leader said that South Africa had a total population of 20 million people. Now the hon. the Minister asks how we want to train the 20 million. The hon. the Minister is the Minister of Labour. I would have thought him to be a practical man who adopts an essentially realistic attitude. Does he expect us to train the total population of South Africa&#x003F; Does he expect us to train the 20 million from the cradle to the grave&#x003F; Surely the hon. the Minister must know that if you are thirsty and you have a full dam of water on a farm, you will not drink all the water in that dam at the same time. Surely one drinks as much as one needs&#x003F; If the hon. the Minister continues as he is now doing and wants to drink all the water in the dam at the same time, he will drown. He will drown, just as the Minister of Labour is drowning in this debate. But the hon. the Minister continues with his questions.</p>

<p>Let me say that labour is not an end in itself. Labour is a means to an end. The end is production. South Africa wants greater production, in other words, growth. The basic idea is that if we want substantial growth in South Africa, we must face the fact that we have a white manpower shortage of 45,000 at the moment. I think the figure is too low, but I shall accept it. The question which the hon. the Minister must reply to, is whether he is satisfied to continue with the manpower shortage of 45,000, which will continue growing. Is he satisfied to let the economic machine operate with this and to face its consequences&#x003F; Or what is the hon. the Minister going to do to eliminate the white labour shortage&#x003F; That is the question. He must reply to this question even before he comes to the issue of trade unions. Trade unions enter into the matter only later. Before the hon. the Minister asks a question about trade unions and whether they will agree or not, he must tell us what he intends doing about the manpower shortage of 45,000. This is the question to which he owes South Africa a reply. Long before he issues a challenge to this side of the House, there is the heavy responsibility resting on his shoulders, to give a reply in regard to the white manpower shortage. Unless he can give it, he has failed in his obligation to this House.</p>

<p>My second point is that if the hon. the Minister were to come to this House and to say that he had no more plans, and that he could do nothing about the shortage of 45,000, he must tell us what other methods he is now going to apply. Where is he going to get the labour now&#x003F;</p>

<p>He might succeed with a few. It depends which party they support. This is where we make the point that South Africa has a built-in body of manpower. It so happens that they are not all white. But we have a built-in body of manpower and I cannot think that a Minister who is in cahrge of this important Vote cannot devise methods by which we can use this manpower without endangering the white worker. I cannot accept that. The hon. the Minister must tell this House whether he has held discussions with the various trade unions and how far he has progressed in his attempt to eliminate the manpower shortage. If he has not done so, I say that he has neglected his duty in this respect as well. As far as I know, the hon. the Minister has not yet gone far enough in his discussions with the labour powers in South Africa in an attempt to persuade these people to allow non-white labour on a controlled scale. In passing I may say that this question of opening the flood gates is absolute nonsense, and the hon. members know this. It is political propaganda of the worst type. No person will open the flood gates in South Africa and no labour machine can function in that way. The fact that the United Party says that it is prepared to negotiate, is in itself proof that we are prepared to exercise control over the employment of both Whites and non-Whites in South Africa. This has always been the position. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down had a great deal to say here about a dam he was drinking dry, and I think he is the man who is going to drown. The policy which he and his party are advocating, is one which has the potential of drowning the South Africa we love so dearly when one sits in this House day after day listening to the speeches coming from that side of this House, I am afraid one gets a very sombre picture of what is happening in South Africa. A very sombre picture is being painted here of what the position in South Africa is to-day. It is a picture of despondency, a picture of intimidation, a picture of tragedy and a picture of a country which is poised on the edge of a precipice. One would say that it is a country which is on the brink of collapse if one were to believe the sad tales of the members on that side <span class="col_3415-3416" refersTo="page_0262"/>of this House. However, one is grateful when one leaves the confines of this House and comes into contact with the true Republic of South Africa. Outside there is a country which is full of confidence, full of happy faces, and there is a satisfied population. Outside there are still cheering and to-morrow we shall again hear the people cheer in the Northern Transvaal. Outside there is employment for everybody, there is vital growth and progress. There is economic prosperity and life is bubbling and pulsating in all its reality. Outside where the kettles are boiling and the fireplaces are burning, is the true South Africa of happy and satisfied people.</p>

<p>I am grateful that there is another South Africa than the one painted for us in these debates. I can understand why that is being done; it is because they realize that they are not governing and will never have the opportunity of governing either. For that reason they are so despondent, so frustrated, so embittered and in many respects, so reckless as well. This side of the House has not at any time whatsoever denied the fact that there is a labour shortage in the country. We admit that fact, but we should in the first place ask ourselves what the causes of that labour shortage are. The labour shortage in fact arises from the economic prosperity, the rate of development and the growth which our country has been maintaining for more than two decades. During this short time our country has developed from an agricultural community into one of the most highly industrialized communities in the world. Our own small white population not only has to develop our own country, but we also have to utilize of our powers to give the best to those who look to us for the best. If we were to have a depression to-day, the problem of that labour shortage would be solved immediately. If one had to queue for work again, as one had to do when they were in power, that labour shortage would definitely no longer exist. Therefore the National Party has to maintain the country&#x2019;s economy at a high level, but at the same time it also has to implement the policy of separate development and make it succeed.</p>

<p>What role is the United Party playing in this regard&#x003F; This United Party in fact wants that policy of ours to fail. Indeed, it wants to use this labour shortage for political gain. It is high time for the United Party to be unmasked completely. When one asks them to state their policy, they are dumb. When are they going to tell us clearly whether they will allow Whites to work under non-Whites&#x003F; Will they state their policy in respect of job reservation very cleary to us.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening we heard here what is contained in that booklet which was issued just before the election. The United Party should remember, however, that an election is approaching and that we shall unmask them then. Will they then throw those trades open&#x003F;</p>

<p>The National Party refuses to throw the existing labour peace and quiet overboard. It would be more detrimental to the economy of our country than the labour shortage if such a thing were to happen. The labour peace in the Republic of South Africa is very closely linked to our race relations. It has been maintained for many years. In this respect we probably hold a world record. It is also the best proof that the worker in South Africa trusts the National Party and this Government. It is also proof that the National Government can be trusted with the interests of the white worker. The judicious way in which non-whites are being used for supplementing the labour shortage, fills the white worker in South Africa with confidence. Surely it is clear that the Government of South Africa can use non-white labour only on a very limited scale. It is not enough to eliminate the shortage, but it is also not enough to provide employment for the large number of Bantu in our midst. Therefore the rapid development of our border industries and our homeland areas is essential. I do not want to elaborate further on that aspect, because it has been sufficiently debated in this House.</p>

<p>I just want to refer briefly to labour conditions as the manifest themselves in my constituency. In the first place, I have in mind the building industry. In my constituency phenomenal building projects are in the course of execution. Massive shopping complexes, roads, bridges as well as factories are being built. Large housing schemes are being constructed on an unprecendented scale. These construction undertakings which are building large townships, are draining the labour market in this field. We are very grateful for the fact that the private sector is providing those homes for us. These private building contractors not only render a valuable service to the community, but we must also remember that the building industry has developed into a very flourishing business to-day. The building industry is a very profitable one and therefore so many people are needed in this industry. Building contractors compete with one another for labour and this creates major problems for them. We know that even immigrants who have been here for a short time only, do not do the plastering work for a very long time after their arrival, hut become the contractors and start building houses on their own. In this way we have set off a chain reaction.</p>

<p>No, it is done by non-Whites. Where the shortage of non-white labour exists, many of the problems can be solved. Along the right administrative channels these people have the opportunity to negotiate with the authority concerned in order to eliminate those non-white labour shortages.</p>

<p><span class="col_3417-3418" refersTo="page_0263"/>There is also another aspect for which I want to plead. Reference has been made to this matter and the hon. the Minister has already replied to it, but I just want to Point out that the partial solution of our problems is to be formed in the shortening of the training periods of apprentices. That will allow of people being used where they are needed in the shortest possible time. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p> Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Boksburg made a plea for the employment of retarded children. I just want to say to the hon. member that both my Department and I adopt a very sympathetic attitude to these children to such an extent that we go out of our way even to have the children who have received training at those special schools enrolled as apprentices We are in fact having a fair amount of success in this regard. What is more, they are of course employed in industry as operators, as semi-skilled Persons, with a reasonably good income Over and above this, the sheltered labour factories are there to provide them with housing, and an livelihood and an income. I may just mention that our sheltered labour factories are not fully occupied, which indicates that there is definitely room for them.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Tygervallei made a plea in connection with the wages of stone-masons. These stone-mason also fall within the scope of the industrial council agreement. They fall under the Industrial Council for the Building industry here in the Western Cape. That industrial council agreement makes provision for their wages together with those of other groups. I assume that these stone-masons also belong to that trade union. There is no reason why they should not belong to it. In such a case, that trade union usually negotiates with i s minority group as well. Their wages are then prescribed in that same agreement. I am afraid I cannot comply with the hon. member's request to refer this matter to the Wage Board, because the legal position is such that where workers are covered by an industrial council agreement, the provisions of any wage determination are automatically suspended. They fall under it, and I hope they will find a solution along that channel. Now I just want to address a final, word to hon. members in concluding this debate I want to refer very briefly to the Opposition&#x2019;s motion that my salary be reduced. I cannot remember by how many thousands it is.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>You do not deserve any salary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to refer to it in a single word. I regard this motion of the Opposition s to reduce my salary as a very great compliment. I would have been upset today if I had heard songs of praise from the Opposition to-day and yesterday about my standpoint in regard to labour matters If I were to have made the so-called &#x201C;major policy statement&#x201D; to which they referred that policy statement which should have dealt with only one matter according to their approach, namely uncontrolled employment of Blacks in White areas, I would certainly have been able to receive all the songs of praise which one can hope to receive from the United Party and the English Press. But, Sir, do you know what I would have done had I received that praise&#x003F; Apart from violating my own conviction and my own conscience, I would have exchanged the policy of the National Party the white worker and the position of our white areas for a mess of pottage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland again asked what we were doing about the matter. I have stated this on innumerable occasions. Let me summarize it in a few words. The manpower shortage is something which we do not deny. How many times have I not furnished figures to hon. members in this House in order to indicate its extent&#x003F; There is not one single member on this side who denies its existence It is typical of any developing country But apparently the United Party wants more unemployment rather than full employment. But let us leave that there. In regard to the question of our manpower shortage, the position is that we as a Government are applying various measures in order to deal with this situation. In the first place, we insure that the training facilities for our future workers are continually being expanded, whether it be in the field of technical education or whatever held. It is not necessary for me to elaborate on that. We are engaged in our selective immigration programme, of which hon. members are aware. We are continually helping to increase the productivity of our workers. Now hon. members ask what can be done to eliminate these shortages. There is a very important method by which they can be eliminated It has been calculated that if every worker performs only 3 per cent more work a day the entire existing shortage will be eliminated. It is my task, your task and the task of every responsible person in this country to make an appeal to <i>our</i> people, and to themselves as well, to do their best for South Africa. If that is done, it will be possible to eliminate that shortage.</p>

<p>There is another very important method by which we control this labour position, and that is to maintain sound labour relations. We cannot have labour productivity in this country, and we can by no means increase it if we do not keep the workers, in this country, and specifically the white workers, happy and satisfied If. this is not done, we can forget about labour productivity. Thanks to this Government's policy of affording the white worker, with, his higher standard of living the necessary statutory protection against his wage level being undermined by people with a lower standard of living, we have brought about a feeling of security among our workers.</p>

<p><span class="col_3419-3420" refersTo="page_0264"/>That security, which is so often scorned by the Opposition, is one of the most important elements in the maintenance of our economic development and of productivity in this country.</p>

<p>The United Party, however, is not satisfied with that. They have a different solution. We had hoped to penetrate to the core of that solution in this debate, but unfortunately they said nothing in this regard. The whole debate, from the first to the last United Party speaker, clearly showed that the United Party has one strong desire, and that is to have more and more Bantu pushed into work spheres in white areas. That is the one overwhelming impression left by this debate. In this prolonged debate we received no satisfactory reply from the United Party in respect of the way in which they want to use these trained blacks. What we did receive, were smokescreen replies, such as the hon. member for Yeoville gave us. He suddenly wanted to hide behind the trade unions. Let me once again quote to the hon. member who mentioned the example of the dam the words of his Leader. In his speech to the Cape Chamber of Commerce he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The next step is a crash training programme to fit the work force drawn from 20 million people for the jobs that a waiting for them.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must listen. I said that there are 13 million, and I assume that one will be able to train about a million of them. Did the hon. member not hear&#x003F; Sir, if hon. members who are sitting directly opposite one cannot hear that, one can understand how difficult it is to make them understand something which they do not want to believe. Let me tell the United Party that it will not help them to hide behind the trade unions in order to defend this crash programme of theirs. If this matter of the trade unions has suddenly become so serious to them, I want to ask, in the first place, why Sir de Villiers Graaff, in this speech which we have the report of, did not make one single reference to the trade unions having to be consulted in this connection. He did not refer to them when he made his &#x201C;Chamber speech, in which he announced the crash course&#x201D;. Shortly after that, when the United Party realized they were in a corner, they thought up this trade union story with their characteristic ambiguous attitude. The hon. member for Yeoville, who is no novice in this connection, then came to light with this matter. Let me ask the United Party why, if they in earnest as regards the trade unions as a pre-requisite, they consulted neither the Tucsa trade unions nor the conservative trade unions of Lucas van der Bergh in advance in order to hear how they would feel about such a crash programme. The reason is that it was never the intention to do this.</p>

<p>Therefore, in conclusion, I want to say to the United Party that it is very clear that they are not prepared to take the white workers and the electorate of South Africa into their confidence about their true aims and the methods by which they want to achieve them. Under these circumstances this debate will be characterized by the fact that, instead of having used this opportunity to restore its political credibility, the United Party, by its continued disregard of the facts and its avoidance of the cardinal issues and of stating its attitude, proved conclusively that it is not to be trusted. Therefore this side will regard it as its task and duty to unmask the United Party in this House and outside. We owe it to the white worker and to South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half-hour&#x003F; Unfortunately the very able chairman of our Interior Group, the hon. member for Green Point, is indisposed and I was asked to deputize for him this afternoon. Sir, one glance at the Estimates is enough to show that we are dealing here with an important and comprehensive portfolio. This portfolio covers the Publications Control Board, elections, the implementation of the Electoral Act, the Population Register, passport control and various other services. The hon. the Minister, although he is a senior member of the Cabinet, was placed in control of this Department only a matter of months ago, and, as he knows it is customary for Parliament to give a new broom a chance to show that it can sweep clean and tor that reason we propose to offer most of our criticism this time in the form of advice.</p>

<p>There is the question of elections. In April of this year we had a general election for Parliament which was preceded by a long period of campaigning and of registration of voters, and now, only a few months away from the parliamentary election, we are to have a repetition of the whole procedure in order to elect members for the provincial councils. This kind of thing has happened before. I remember one case where the provincial elections were held a mere three months after the parliamentary elections. I must say that to me this looks wasteful and unnecessary. Looking at the Estimates, I notice that allowances to returning officers, presiding officers, polling and counting officers, just one item which is but a fraction of the total expenditure in connection with an election, cost the State an amount of R364,000. I feel that the time is long overdue for us to consider holding the two elections on the same day. It happens to suit our party at the present time to have the forthcoming provincial elections separately, but I want to look at it from the broader point of view.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. the Minister can do his country a good turn by looking into this matter and considering the advisability of having the two elections on the same day. Actually, Sir, I cannot bind my party&#x2014;and I am not doing so&#x2014;to any final point of view, and I do not suppose that the hon. the Minister can bind his party to any final point of view on this matter. But I see no reason why Parliament should not go into this matter while there is time now before the next round of elections in our country. I want to call upon the Minister to consider the appointment of a parliamentary Select Committee of both Houses of Parliament to consider this matter, to consult with the provinces and to report to the House. South-West Africa was wise enough on 22nd April, to have their elections for Parliament and their Legislative Assembly on the same day. With a small adjustment to the delimitation system in the Free State and in Natal the same could be done quite easily in the Republic. Personally I believe that the arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of joint elections for Parliament and the provincial council. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to have the matter investigated by a joint committee of Parliament.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is not the only matter that needs the serious consideration and, in this case, the reconsideration of Parliament. I am referring to the postal vote system. This is as wide open to fraud and abuse as ever if not more. I truly think that it is in the interests of the country, the voters and our parliamentary system that the present state of affairs be corrected. I do not want to report to this Committee what my own experience was in this connection. I do not intend doing so for a simple reason. I think the hon. the Minister and members will agree that it would lead to a fruitless debate if one side were to accuse the other of malpractices. There would be no point in our side accusing that side of the House and <i>vice versa.</i> I want to look at it from an objective point of view. I should like to avoid any direct accusations. I am however quite convinced that every fair-minded <span class="col_3423-3424" refersTo="page_0266"/>Member of Parliament in this House will agree with this point of view which I wish to make.</p>

<p>Our election system is based on two very important principles. The one is secrecy and the other impartiality. But this very foundation of our electoral system is completely destroyed by the postal vote system as we have it to-day. This system allows ballot papers and the whole process of voting to pass into the hands of party organizers and party agents. To us the answer is quite clear. That is that the system of special voting which is entirely under official control should be extended and that the system of postal voting which allows for party political manipulation should be completely abolished. Shortly after the April election the returning officer of Queenstown publicly expressed his disgust with the system of postal voting and openly called for its abolition. I want to impress upon the non. the Minister that this too is a matter which he could profitably refer to a Select Committee and also consider himself.</p>

<p>Then there is one more request in respect of elections. We believe that it is the duty of the Government, of any government, to run elections smoothly and efficiently. We found again that one of the major problems which faced returning officers and which they had to contend with in this last election, was the serious lack of officials who were at all knowledgable about the technicalities of conducting an election. In the case at Randburg where we had recently had a recount the presiding Judge commented specially on the slovenly way in which the election was conducted. I personally witnessed hours of disruption and long delay and inconvenience to voters due to a lack of proper briefing of officials at the election polls. Admittedly the Electoral Act and the regulations are a very complicated piece of work. As I have said, it is the duty of the Government of the day to ensure that elections are conducted efficiently and smoothly. Therefore I wish to suggest something to the hon. the Minister, but before I do so, I would like him to tell me across the floor of the House approximately what number of officials are involved in the conducting of a general election. I am referring to returning, presiding, polling and counting officers. My estimate is that it must be in the vicinity of 5,000. Is that correct&#x003F;</p>

<p> I shall reply to that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>As I have said, that was a rough estimate. When as many as 4,000 to 5,000 officials are involved in assisting with the technicalities of a general election and also with the by-elections as well as the Coloured Representative Council elections, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it has not become necessary for the Government to offer to civil servants, perhaps through the University of South Africa, a special course in electoral practices and the conduct of elections. Then a diploma can be provided and on that basis an incentive bonus or an addition to the salary can be offered to those who pass the diploma and who manage to achieve knowledge in this field. I believe this is a suggestion which is worth considering.</p>

<p>Then there is a final point I want to raise with regard to elections. I want to raise a voice of protest at the growing practice of the Government and also of the provincial authorities who, when it comes to elections, must consult with the Central Government, to leave seats vacant to suit their own convenience rather than the Republic&#x2019;s interest. According to Press reports a seat, such as Maitland, when we have the provincial election, would have been vacant for more than a year. Other seats have been vacant for ten months, and eight months and I must say this type of thing makes a mockery of the whole concept of public representation on a constituency basis. We feel that if the Government cannot control itself in this respect, there should be some constitutional control over the Government in matters of this kind. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to set a code of conduct for his Government in respect of electoral vacancies or we shall have to seek an opportunity in another debate, because we cannot do so now, to propose correcting legislation.</p>

<p>I wish to come to the question of passports and passport control and the very serious responsibility that rests on the hon. the Minister in this respect. The hon. the Minister must be aware of the fact that one wrong or ill-considered decision in respect of a passport denial, can cost our country more in terms of condemnation and bad propaganda and hostility than money and the Ministry of Information&#x2019;s propaganda can ever repair. There was the unbelievable case of Mr. Athol Fugard who is now seen as a sort of South African Boris Pasternak. Reports from the United States indicate that whoever was responsible for not letting him get a passport to attend the opening of his very famous play in New York must have had no conception whatsoever of the harm that this was going to cause to our country. This matter has caused wave after wave of anti-South African propaganda in the United States of America. It is quite fair to assume, if we take this as an example, that there are one of three possibilities why he was not given a passport.</p>

<p>The first possibility is that Fugard has done something wrong for which he needs to be punished. But as far as we know he is not under any internal restrictions in South Africa. He has not faced a charge for a misdemeanour in a court of law in our country. I must therefore rule out this possibility. The second possibility is that his appearance abroad, the appearance of one man abroad, would constitute a threat to the peace, security and stability of our country. Surely, this is so laughable to contemplate that, in deference <span class="col_3425-3426" refersTo="page_0267"/> to the Government itself, I must dismiss this immediately as a possibility. The only remaining possibility is that the Government does not approve of his artistic tastes and his ideas and is using their political power to penalize him. In all fairness I would leave it to the Government to explain which of the three considerations apply in the case of Mr. Fugard.</p>

<p>I admit that I do not know of any country where there is not some form of passport control, but we believe it is quite wrong for a Minister, a political figure, to use these wide powers in regard to the question of passports in the manner in which it is done by the present Government. As it is, the decision of the Minister, and I am not talking to him personally, but to any Minister in charge of that portfolio, whatever decision he takes about a man s passport, his decision is based on secret and one-sided evidence. There is no way in which a victim can determine what there is that the Government has against him and whether what they have against him is true or has the meaning the Government places upon it. He is simply not to know and has no right of defence or explanation at all. There is also nobody above the position of the Minister, a party politician, to whom such a man can appeal. To deny a man a passport is a hardship in every case, but can in some cases be an extremely severe punishment for an individual citizen. That punishment is meted out by a politician on one-sided evidence without any kind of trial whatsoever. I think it is the worst possible system you can have in any country. I am not suggesting that the hon. the Minister is an unreasonable man. This is not my point at all.</p>

<p>Recently, however, we have had an interesting case regarding a visa, namely the appalling case of the Japanese jockey. This champion was refused a visa to visit South Africa. After the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor refused the visa, he reversed his decision. When he reversed it he pleaded as an excuse and as justification for reversing it, that he had had &#x201C;insufficient evidence&#x201D; when he first refused that man a visa. This is precisely the danger. Here is an admission by a Cabinet member that he did have insufficient evidence, and made a wrong decision on that basis. Now here we have the danger of a person being refused a passport under this system. I am sure the hon. the Minister will not claim that he or his Department is infallible. What we are interested in is what safeguard the hon. the Minister, who is responsible, provides to make sure that an injustice is not done. We believe that a man to whom a passport is denied should have the right to defend himself It can be done <i>in camera</i> Provision should also be made for him to be able to appeal to somebody outside the political field, say to a specially appointed Judge, or maybe two Judges. The Government&#x2019;s case can also be heard <i>in camera.</i> It is also not necessary to hear the case of such a person and that of the Government together. It can be done separately. One thing is certain, however, namely that the existing system is completely unfair and indefensible and that it has caused untold damage to the image of our country.</p>

<p>As far as the Fugard affair is concerned, I want to support <i>Die Beeld,</i> a Government paper. In an article on the 14th June Athol Fugard is described as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; een van Suid-Afrika se belangrikste toneelskrywers en &#x2019;n man met internasionale aansien &#x2026; Die intrekking van mnr. Fugard se paspoort kan gerus met die grootste dringendheid heroorweeg word om mens-like en om politieke redes. Die menslike oorweging is dat &#x2019;n skeppende kunstenaar van aansien sy kuns nie op die bre&#x00EB; w&#x00EA;reld-toneel mag beoefen nie.</block>

<p>That is the position in which Mr. Fugard has been placed. I read further:</p>

<block name="quote">Hy word deur die Staat verbied om in die buiteland die erkenning te kry wat hom toekom, en oor die politieke nadele van so &#x2019;n arbitr&#x00EA;re verbod op so &#x2019;n man hoef ons werklik nie uit te wei nie.</block>

<p>I want to say that this expresses the point of view of this side of the House in the best possible terms. I do not think it will be of any help if I appeal to the hon. the Minister and his colleagues in future to try and make some personal contact with artists like this and perhaps even try to get on a more friendly footing. Maybe, if this is done, they will have a better understanding of these people. But one thing is certain: There is nothing that our people would appreciate more in South Africa than a few less victories for verkrampte thinking in Government quarters and a greater degree of normality in the business of governing South Africa. What I sincerely hope the Minister will appreciate, is that we cannot continue with the present state of affairs where, in fact, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Foreign Affairs are constantly pulling in opposite directions. The Department of Foreign Affairs is pleading that we are being misunderstood abroad. It is challenging everybody to come and have a look and see for themselves how things are in South Africa. Then the Department of the Interior comes along, in direct conflict with this attitude of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and they perpetrate one fiasco after another, refusing passports to South African artists to go abroad and telling important men, like American congressmen, members of parliament in America, as happened in the Diggs case, that they cannot get a visa and that they should stay out of South Africa and keep away. So I do not think that the money we spend in order to clear up, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, what is done by the Department of the Interior, is justified. I think it is unfair that the Department of the <span class="col_3427-3428" refersTo="page_0268"/>Interior is not more aware of the effects on our position abroad of the type of decisions they make.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, there is one more point about passports which I should like to raise. I have once before in this Committee, complained about the fact that our South African passport is boldly stamped in front with a list of countries &#x201C;that thou shalt not enter&#x201D;. I know that the hon. the Minister, when he travels, does so with an official document. His problem is not the problem of the ordinary South African. When I put a question to him on the Order Paper on the 28th July, he gave me a list of 13 countries which South Africans are not allowed to visit and which are stamped prominently on a front page of the passport. The countries listed, he said, were all communist states. Well, Sir, I looked at my own. On my passport there are 14 countries stamped. I notice that Ghana, stamped on my passport, is not included in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s list. But neither are all the communist states. Yugoslavia is not listed in the countries that may not be visited. In other words, there is no consistency on the part of the Government, even in respect of communist countries. The point is, why must there be this negative approach&#x003F; Why must South Africans always be the odd man out, the queer one in the company of other people&#x003F; I remember when last I travelled on the passport I now have, my wife and myself found ourselves with other travellers in this position that time and again&#x2014;we were the only South Africans in the group&#x2014;when they came to the South African passports, there was a special delay while they were studying the list in front of our passports. Why must this be done&#x003F; To take another example, foreigners who visit Berlin to-day are allowed to visit East Berlin in a strictly organized fashion. It is a most interesting experience for everybody, South Africans included, to go to East Berlin to see the contrast between East and West. As I have said, it is done on a strictly organized basis. Here again South Africans are at a disadvantage because of the nuisance of having East Germany listed as one of the &#x201C;thou shalt nots&#x201D; on their passports. Surely there are better and more positive ways of dealing with the matter and of bringing it to the attention of South African passport holders that there are certain countries for which the passport does not apply and where our Government cannot provide them with protection. All we are asking the hon. the Minister is to make it possible for South Africans to feel that there is not something abnormal about them when they travel abroad. I think we are entitled to that. I do hope the hon. the Minister will be able to give us satisfactory replies to the questions I have put to him.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to raise the question of the Publications Board. There are members who will discuss this matter more fully, but in the few minutes left to me I must say that the feeling we have is that the board does not have the leadership it should have. Case after case illustrates this fact. Recently there was the case of &#x201C;Jannie Totsiens&#x201D;. There was an outcry over the age restrictions which were applied to this film. The Minister stepped in and changed the decision. There are so many cases of this nature that I merely want to pick one or two. There is the case of the film &#x201C;Helga&#x201D;. It is an educational film on the question of human sex. Not even married people, husband and wife together, could see the film. I happened, as a matter of chance, to see the film in Heidelberg, Germany. The film was open to male and female students. I must say that it did not even draw a large audience because it was considered so ordinary. It is unbelievable that a husband and wife should not be able to see such a film together. In this case again the Minister stepped in and reversed the decision as the result of an appeal. This sort of thing has been going on to such an extent that one of the Government&#x2019;s newspapers recently said, in respect of another film &#x201C;Die sensors wil ons nie laat groot word nie&#x201D;. That is the general feeling. This sort of thing recurs time and again, also in regard to the banning of books. I have studied the lists of books that have been banned and have found the same state of affairs there too. I am not talking about pornography now. because in that regard the Committee is absolutely at one. However, when it comes to matters of a political nature, the censors go far too far. I do not think that South Africans should be considered as immature as the Publications Board would like to have it. Seeing that this sort of thing has become a pattern, it seems to be necessary for the hon. the Minister to do some reviewing both of the personnel and of the work and the attitude of the board.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that hon. member received a reply to his arguments on passports last year, for he made the same speech in this debate last year he made a moment ago. If the hon. the Minister were to look up <i>Hansard,</i> he would see it there and in that case he would not reply to the arguments advanced by the hon. member either.</p>

<p>However, I want to respond to one argument advanced by the hon. member, and that is his argument as regards postal votes. I admit that this matter is always a very delicate one. However, I take it amiss of a responsible front bencher who makes such an irresponsible statement to the effect that the postal vote system is wide open to fraudulent practices.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>That is absolutely true.</p>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>That is absolutely untrue. When a person makes a statement of that nature. I say that that person judges others by himself. The Electoral Act has been amended on innumerable occasions.</p>

<p><span class="col_3429-3430" refersTo="page_0269"/>It has always been the practice to appoint a select committee to go into the matter thoroughly before the Eelectoral Act is amended, while at the same time an attempt has been made to obtain as much unanimity as possible in this House on such amendments. The United Party saw the system of special votes as a solution to the postal vote system. But, as usual, they do not practice what they preach. They are ambiguous and dissembling. During the short session prior to the general election an argument was advanced in this House in regard to special votes and postal votes. Both in this House and in the Select Committee the United Party wanted the system of postal votes to be abolished completely. However, we said that it was not possible. But they, the great champions of the special vote, do not practice what they preach. In my own constituency my experience was totally different. We had more special votes than postal votes there. On the other hand, the United Party handled far more postal votes than special votes. And then they are the people who come to this House with high-priestly sanctimoniousness. From the nature of the case, our problem is somewhat different from that of the United Party. I shall refer again to the system of special votes later on, because it is working well. However, we cannot have the one system without having the other; the one is supplementing the other. As I have said, our problem differs somewhat from that of the United Party. The United Party no longer represents the rural areas. In the rural areas we have to cope with vast distances. The system of special votes does not always work very well there, because we cannot always provide all the facilities there. When advancing a plea for the system of postal votes, we do not advance a plea for something we want to retain so as to indulge in fraudulent practices. But as I have said, the United Party does not practice what it preaches. There is always a difference between what they say and what they do.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>We want it abolished.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>But we do not want it abolished, because our circumstances are different. We represent the vast rural areas. The United Party does not remember what it is like to represent a large constituency any more, because it has not represented the rural areas for the past 20 years. The deficiencies in the electoral law were remedied by the previous select committee. It is no longer possible to tamper with postal votes on a large scale, as has been alleged by the hon. member. The present position is that a postal vote, which has been tampered with, is not considered when the votes are counted. Now, it may happen that the United Party gets one of the voters in my constituency to fill in an application form for a postal vote. In that case I tell my people: Bring that voter in and have him cast a special vote. [Interjections.] Any party who thinks that I will allow my votes to be tampered with &#x2026; I want nothing to do with a supporter of the United Party, because I do not want to do the United Party&#x2019;s work. The United Party must do its own work. In my constituency my organization arranges postal votes for my supporters, and when I find out that the United Party has arranged for a postal vote for a voter, I have that voter brought in and I take him to the magistrate&#x2019;s court and have him cast a special vote.</p>

<p>Sir, a few deficiencies still remain in the special votes system. This system works quite well at magistrates&#x2019; courts, but in cases where this system is handled by the Police, it does not work very well and for one reason and one reason only. The offices of the Police are open only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. They have not made arrangements for a special vote to be cast after 5 p.m.</p>

<p>The system could be extended.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>But we do not what I am doing now, is to lay my problem before the hon. the Minister and not before that hon. member who has so much to say about fraudulent practices. I say again, the Police offices are working well, but the majority of people cast their votes only after 5 p.m. The magistrates&#x2019; courts have rendered a service from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., and I say it has worked excellently. In my constituency 60 per cent of the votes were special votes and only 50 per cent were postal votes. As regards the out-lying constituencies, we allowed all the voters to cast a special vote. We did so quickly and with all despatch, because we could start a week before the time, and in this coming election one will have even more time because, for the purposes of this coming election, it will be possible for special votes to be cast as early as 23rd September, while, I think, it will only be possible for postal votes to be cast on 7th October. One will then have this long period in which to do the work of the out-lying constituencies. But I want to ask the hon. the Minister to make more facilities available. I am aware of the problems the Police have. They have their work to do. What I am asking, is that if it is done by the Police stations, they should preferably be allowed to do the work from 5 o&#x2019;clock to 9 o&#x2019;clock. This will be more convenient. The majority of the people are not available during the day. During that time when they have been doing this work, that is from 9 o&#x2019;clock to 5 o&#x2019;clock, we had all their services at our disposal, but this was not a convenient time.</p>

<p>I now want to make another suggestion. The hon. member has also put forward suggestions. These relate to the registration of voters. To my mind the registration is one of the major problems of the Department. Not one of the voters&#x2019; lists I have seen in my time was any good. All of them were unsatisfactory. I <span class="col_3431-3432" refersTo="page_0270"/>have had a lot to do with elections and byelections, but all of them were unsatisfactory. Not one of the voters&#x2019; lists were up to date, and to my mind there is only one solution. A general registration is not the solution, because after a general registration the voters&#x2019; lists are most unsatisfactory of all. This is not done by the Department and by full-time officials, but by part-time and retired workers who do not visit all the voters. A general registration is therefore not the solution, but I see only one solution. A voter is compelled by law to register and he may be prosecuted and fined if his name is not included in the voters&#x2019; list. In this respect we, the Government and the Opposition can reach an agreement, as we have done as regards the Electoral Act. Let us agree that these people should be prosecuted. Sir, one need only prosecute a few of them, only three or four, and one will find that the same applies to people who have to register for military training at the age of 16 years. One has to register one&#x2019;s motor-car, one has to register one&#x2019;s fire-arm and one has to register one&#x2019;s radio and one does not get many prosecutions because people can be prosecuted if they do not register these things. How many prosecutions of national servicemen are there as regards the Defence Force; how many people are prosecuted because they do not have radio licences or fire-arms licences; how many people are prosecuted because they do not register births&#x003F; Very few, Sir. I think it is time&#x2014;and to my mind this is the solution &#x2014;people who do not register as voters are prosecuted, and then our problem as far as the voters&#x2019; list are concerned will be solved.</p>

<p>I want to follow up what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has said about the question of passports and speak more particularly of the case of Athol Fugard. I have been fairly closely associated with this matter since 1968 when Mr. Fugard personally approached me to try to get his passport returned. It had been originally confiscated in, I think, 1967, the day after the BBC televised his play &#x201C;The Blood Knot&#x201D;. A year later Mr. Fugard wished to go to America in order to discuss with an American playwright the adaptation of his play for the stage and at that time he approached me to see whether I could do anything about getting his passport back. I approached the then Minister without any success whatsoever.</p>

<p>Yes, probably he did. I should have sent him to the hon. member for Prinshof who, of course, is well known for his willingness to take up such cases. In future I will refer people to him; he might have more influence with the Government than I have. Recently, after I returned from overseas, I read that Mr. Fugard was trying once again to get his passport returned so that he could be in New York for the premiere of his play &#x201C;Boesman and Lena&#x201D; and that this had been refused again. The new Minister was unfortunately away but I approached the Department but nothing was forthcoming. Sir, I cannot emphasize too strongly the harm that this is doing South Africa, this absurd business of denying a well-known playwright the opportunity of going overseas to see that his own material is produced there. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout mentioned three possibilities as to why the Government has refused Mr. Fugard his passport. I mention a fourth possibility and that is that the Government does not approve of Mr. Fugard&#x2019;s political views.</p>

</speech>

<p>Nonsense.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>If that hon. member knows, I hope that he will give this House the benefit of his knowledge. [Interjection.] Mr. Fugard says himself that he does not agree with the Government. He has stated himself that he can only assume that the reason is that his political views, which are opposed to those of the Government, have earned him the displeasure of the Government, and it may be that he associates with certain people of whom the Government does not approve either&#x2014;a sort of association by guilt, with which we are getting very familiar in South Africa. Whatever it is, Mr. Fugard himself, of course, has not been told why he has not been allowed to get his passport back, and if the hon. member for Prinshof does know the reason I will be very glad to hear it and so will Mr. Fugard. Considerable publicity has been given to this matter in America and it has not yet ended because I know that a well-known publication is going to publish a further story about Mr. Fugard and his difficulties. Sir, I want to know why it is that in cases like this the Government remains so completely intransigent. It is not prepared to give the person concerned any hint whatsoever as to the reason for the punishment that is being handed out to him. I say it is pure vindictiveness, and, of course, this is not the only case that we know of. Students are victimized because of their association with protest movements of which the Government disapproves. Students always know that if they in any way appear in the fore-front of student movements which are against Government policy, they are likely to be victimized by having their passports withdrawn. I do not think that this sort of behaviour behoves a country which prides itself, for reasons beyond my understanding, on being democratic.</p>

<p>Having said that about Mr. Fugard, I would like to ask the Minister if it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to change its policy about the granting of exit permits. Up till now it has been customary, although I know that apparently the law gives the hon. the Minister the right to refuse, to grant exit permits where these have been applied for. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister if it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to continue with this policy <span class="col_3433-3434" refersTo="page_0271"/>or whether it intends changing its policy in this regard&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not consider using his influence with the Censorship Board, with regard to the censorship which is applied to films to be shown Africans. Now, we know that it is customary in South Africa in notices and elsewhere to classify Africans with goods. We have had an incident of this quite recently. But now also as far as censorship is concerned, Africans are classified with children under 12 belonging to other racial groups. There is a long list of films which African adults are forbidden to see, like children under the age of 12 of the other racial groups. Adult Whites, adult Coloured people and adult Indians are allowed to see these films. But adult Africans are prohibited from seeing a long list of films, just like the children of the other racial groups I think this is a gratuitous insult to the African people. And what is more, they think so too.</p>

<p>No, I do not. I mean the African people. I mean the 13 million African people. I am not interested in changing definitions like the hon. member for Waterkloof. He thinks when he changes a definition he solves the problem. He does not. There are still 13 million black people, African people to deal with in this country. Whether he like to break them up into eight ethnic groups is quite beside the point which I happen to be raising at the moment.</p>

<p>The Urban Bantu Council of Soweto has protested strongly against this gratuitous insult. They point out quite rightly that Africans are no more prone to bad behaviour than members of other races. They pointed out at there are Africans who are educated and cultured people and intimated that Africans who have grown up should be considered as adult people. I do think that for us in 1970 to have film notices which prohibits Africans from seeing these films whereas every other racial group over the age of 12 is allowed to see them, is utterly disgraceful.</p>

<p>There is a third matter which I wish to raise although I doubt whether I am going to have time to cover it. This concerns the question of disparity and discrimination in salaries This, of course, I raise under the Public Service Commission Vote. In particular I want to raise with the hon. the Minister the question of the increase in salaries which recently have been granted to white civil servants I want to compare this with the increase in the salaries of non-white civil servants. In August, 1969, the hon. the Minister announced that salary increases which had been announced the year before, would take effect immediately m respect of white employees. Then there was a hiatus of about 15 months before the non-white civil servants got any increase in their salary. During this time there was natur ally considerable ill feeling because of the discrimination. When the salaries ultimately were announced, it did not come as much of a surprise to people to learn that they were getting a very small increase compared to the increase that had been granted to the Whites. Roughly there are about 200,000 white persons in the employment of the Public Service. Their salaries were increased from a total of roughly R550 million to roughly R620 million. That amounts to an increase of approximately R60 million to R70 million. I am not sure of the exact number of non-white people in the Civil Service. But the approximate 275,000 to 300,000 non-white people in the Civil Service receive a total annual pay of R160 million. They have recently been granted an increase which roughly amounts to something like R34 per year per head. This was the increase in salary of non-Whites as against the increase to the Whites which now, with the additional amount granted, amounts to approximately R320 per head per year. That goes for the Public Service generally. There are of course special cases which should be raised separately. Those are the cases of the non-white nurses and non-white teachers. The new salary scales for white nurses range from between 20 per cent to 60 per cent and were announced on the 7th October, 1969, to take effect from the 1st October, 1969. In other words, they were backdated. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members know the well-known enigma that the flower to which the bee comes to get the nectar from which to make the sweetest honey, is the same which gives the spider the nectar from the deadliest poison is made. I wonder to what extent this applies to the hon. member who has just resumed her seat. I wonder how it is possible for her to make the kind of speeches she usually makes about South Africa and be a member of the supreme council of that very country at the same time. And then she says in the same speech that there is no democracy in South Africa. I have often wondered whether this is not taking democracy too far. To think that the kind of allegations the hon. member has made, can be made against one&#x2019;s fatherland! However, I want to leave the hon. member at that.</p>

<p>I want to come back to a point which was raised in the Budget debate recently and I think this point deserves our attention because the hon. member for Green Point has presented such a distorted misconception to the outside world on this matter, namely the Public Service. That hon. member made a very serious accusation and other hon. members associated themselves with it. They said that the state of affairs in the Public Service had reached the point of a crisis or chaos, and all kinds of other expressions were used to present the Public Service in a bad light, and particularly the actions of the Government as far as the problems of the Public Service were concerned. During the course of his speech <span class="col_3435-3436" refersTo="page_0272"/>the hon. member for Green Point, as is his wont every time serious matters are being discussed, followed the well-known pattern of the United Party and the Opposition, and that is to mention the easy and instant solution the Opposition offers for all problems. They have an easy formula of doing it. They say that when you want to solve the problems of South Africa, you have to give greater economic benefits to everyone and take less money from everyone and in that way you will bring about a solution. If it were possible to do so and if anybody were so foolish to think that it could be done, it would be a fine solution for the problems. It would also be a fine solution for the problems of the public servants.</p>

<p>I think that if there ever was a sector of the community which deserves our gratitude, it is the public servants because they have rendered excellent services under difficult circumstances and they are still doing so.</p>

<p>The solution the United Party offers for the staff shortage there is in the Public Service, is a simple one. The United Party says we should increase the pay of all the public servants and compete with the private sector and everything will then be in order. Unfortunately, they do not tell us at the same time that if they want to find that extra money, they will have to take proporionately even more money from the public servants. These promises are not made only as far as the public servants are concerned; when the Vote Social Welfare and Pensions was under discussion, hon. members on the Opposition side agitated that more money be given to the elderly people. When young people are discussed it is said that more money should be given to young married couples. I agree that this is a deserving case. So the whole list goes on and election promises are made to everybody. They are told directly or indirectly that the United Party is of the opinion that they should get more because they deserve more.</p>

<p>Everytime another aspect of the debate is discussed, the United Party gets up and says that the elderly people are paying too much tax, that the young people are paying too much tax and that we should remove the &#x201C;bulge&#x201D; in the middle income group; in other words, we should simply ask everybody for less money. This is a fine solution, but it is so na&#x00EF;ve that it borders on their doing so deliberately or their simply being stupid. If the Opposition thinks that the voters of the country will swallow that, it is making a big mistake.</p>

<p>Serious criticism has been expressed against the Public Service. Let me say immediately that I am aware of the fact that the Public Service is facing problems, In the Public Service, and not only among the top officials but also among the middle group, we have the most competent people there are in the service of the public in South Africa. Those people who are employed by the State and Provincial Administrations and by the Central Government. and by semi-Government establishments, such as local authorities, cannot be trained in a day to do the work they are expected to do.</p>

<p>An hon. member opposite says it has taken 22 years. I just want to tell the hon. member that when we had to take over 22 years ago, people who had just come back from the war were taken on in the Public Service. They rendered an essential service which they thought was in the interests of South Africa and for which we respect them. However, they subsequently had to be appointed to posts where they had to do responsible work. All those problems had to be solved at that time. However, this is not all either. What did the public servants together with this Government, inherit from this Opposition&#x003F; What was the work that had to be done&#x003F; The hon. member for Green Point and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout complained that there were too many people in the Public Service and that the Public Service had been overexpanded. However, they did not mention to what extent the work of the Public Service had expanded as a result of the maladministration and lack of planning which there was when they, who are now sitting in the Opposition benches, were in power. What had been done in those years for water conservation, or for the other sectors of our economy&#x003F; Naturally there was a war that had to be fought, and I appreciate this. However, an Opposition should also be responsible enough to realize that this Government and its public servants had to cope with the after-effects of those war years. Surely, public servants do not deserve to be accused by anybody of being insufficient, as hon. members of the Opposition did.</p>

<p>The accusations are, by implication, regularly made to the effect that the Public Service Commission is unable to do its work and that the Advisory Council which exists in terms of section 25 of the Act, is also unable to do its work. It is regularly being implied that the Public Service Association is unable to manage its affairs. Let me now tell the hon. the Opposition, with part reference to the speech made by the hon. member for Green Point, that the Government is giving this matter of the Public Service its constant and serious attention. This is borne out by facts nobody can deny. What is constantly being strived at, is an effective Public Service. What has also been strived at through the years, is a contented Public Service. Salary increases were granted in 1953, 1958, 1963, 1966, 1969 and will be granted again at the beginning of 1971. All these are attempts that have been made to compensate people at least in part for what they deserve. However, it will be a tragic day for South Africa when an Opposition starts to attract votes by making wild promises which cannot be fulfilled. Without suggesting that this <span class="col_3437-3438" refersTo="page_0273"/>is the attitude of the Government. I want to say that it is my specific opinion that if there is one danger in South Africa apart from the other dangers threatening us from the outside world, it is the danger that we will become rotten inside and that all we will be aspiring to, is higher salaries to provide our needs from month to month without having the responsibility to say that a service should be rendered for those salaries. This is what the hon. the Opposition wants to promise people.</p>

<p>The Government has acted on the premise that the labourer is worthy of his hire. The Public Service Commission and the Advisory Council have assisted the Government in this respect to see to it that the public servants are being given their remuneration regularly and in such a way that it can at least be compared with that of the private sector. Apart from expressing my gratitude towards the public servants and towards those who are managing the affairs of the Public Service for the way in which this has been done and particularly towards our heads of departments and others in responsible positions, I want to ask them that the inheritence they leave behind to the Public Service should be to teach the young public servant that to give is better than to receive, and that in a country such as South Africa it is not money that counts from day to day, but also the long-term benefits, the ideals we aspiring to and the service we are able to render to our people and to our fatherland.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House certainly endorse any praise that is given to that fine body of dedicated and overworked men in our Public Service. I am sure that many of them will be surprised to have heard this afternoon that we, the Official Opposition, are being criticized because we have asked for better pay and working conditions for the Public Service. We have been called &#x201C;irresponsible&#x201D; by the hon. member for Witbank. We make no apology for asking for those better conditions, and we shall continue to do so, despite the veiled attack made by the hon. member for Witbank in this respect. The hon. member said that all we were asking for. was for greater expenditure and nay equal to the private sector for the public servants, and that it was an irresponsible request, since money was not overflowing in this country But if less money were to be spent by this Minister, for instance on the Publication Board, if he did not act in the way he did in the case of Athol Fugard, where hundreds of thousands of rand of the Department of Information had to be spent to rectify that mistake of his, if he were not going to spend millions on this new population register, if there were not these unnecessary ideological laws over the years, there would certainly have been more funds for bettering the position of the Public Service in South Africa. However, Sir, that is not what I want to discuss at this moment. We shall return to the Public Service later.</p>

<p>I want to take this opportunity of appealing for a relaxation of the rigid censorship in our country to-day, censorship of publications, films and plays, as exercised as by the Publications Board. The present Act contains no less than 97 different prohibitions. The list of banned publications is approaching the number of 13,000 in this country. The rate at which books and publications are banned, is increasing. In 1967, approximately 34 publications per month were banned. To-day, 54 publications per month are being banned, more than 340 during the first six months of this year. Over the years books by famous authors have been banned, for example James Baldwin, William Faulkner, John Updike, Leroy James, John Steinbeck, people whose works have literary merit, people whose works should never have been considered for banning. Academy award films have been banned. Plays such as &#x201C;Virginia Woolf&#x201D; have been cut by the censors. I believe that with the broadening of man&#x2019;s knowledge there should also be a broadening of his mind. Those days when Copernicus and Galileo and people of that calibre were ostracized and their work banned, when people were burned at the stake, were days when people had narrow minds and narrow views. Civilization has progressed. The outlook of the mind of mankind has broadened. Why cannot we also be more broadminded in our censorship&#x003F; Let me make it clear that I am not pleading for licence; I am pleading for liberty. Certain forms of censorship can be justified, for example against hardcore pornography, against the prejudgment of trials in newspapers, for the protection of minors in court cases and for the security of the State. But I do appeal that in our approach to censorship we should be more modern and tolerant and show a more educated attitude. The world is going ahead. Why should we be left behind again&#x003F; I believe that the time has come to throw off more of the shackles of superstition, guilt and fear of past ages of religious and political persecutions. The modern view of man is that man is good, that he can be trusted. Why does this Government not trust the citizen of South Africa&#x003F; Why does it impose this rigid form of censorship, even more rigid than it has been in the past&#x003F;</p>

<p>We have heard that this Government is now adopting an outward-looking policy. I am delighted to hear it. May I ask that this outward looking policy should also be followed in the field of censorship&#x003F; All evidence throughout the world has shown that relaxation of censorship measures has not led to greater immorality; it has not led to greater crime. I appeal to the Government at this stage, where they are pursuing a so-called outward-looking policy, to apply this policy in the field of censorship as well. Do not let them kowtow to the Mother Grundies. the Pecksniffs, snoopers and intolerant people in their own ranks.</p>

<p><span class="col_3439-3440" refersTo="page_0274"/>I wish I could persuade the Government of the fact that the rigid way in which censorship is applied to-day, is harming our country. It is harming our image abroad in the West. Over-rigid censorship has always been recognized as something associated with persecution and dictatorship in the past. It is something associated with the Nazis and the Iron Curtain. I am not saying that ours can be equated with those systems, but why create an image, through our type of censorship which gives fuel to those lighting the fires to destroy South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>Censorship is harming the literature and the arts in our country. It is not I who say so. It is our great Afrikaans and English writers in this country, who have stated this over and over again. Think of the wonderful literary explosion there would be in this country if only some of the rigid rules could be relaxed. I believe that this censorship harms the morale of the ordinary citizen of South Africa. It causes an insidious undermining of the morale of the people. People are becoming timid and afraid to write or to perform what they wish. One of the most evil effects of a too rigid censorship is this fear that writers and playwrights have of actually expressing themselves as they feel they should in their work. They usually say: &#x201C;What is the use&#x003F; Let us cut out this paragraph. Let us cut out this scene. We shall then not get into trouble.&#x201D; It is demoralizing to the film importer as well. He has to impose self-censorship because he is not going to spend thousands of rand bringing a film into South Africa, knowing that it might be declared obscene or illegal by the Publications Control Board. Furthermore, it inhibits the importers of books. Already it has been estimated that booksellers have lost up to a million rand through publications being turned down by the board. They are being inhibited. They are actually afraid to bring in books, many of which would probably have been accepted by the board.</p>

<p>Let us look at the list of films that have been cut or banned this year alone. I have them here. Among the films that have been banned are &#x201C;The Gay Deceivers&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Lady of Monza&#x201D;, which many of us saw. I do not think that any of us really objected to them. The following films have been banned: &#x201C;Lady Hamilton&#x201D;, &#x201C;Blow hot, blow cold&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Hell&#x2019;s Angels&#x201D;. Films that have been cut include the following: &#x201C;The Damned&#x201D;, &#x201C;The Bridge at Remagen&#x201D;. &#x201C;Sand of the Desert&#x201D; and &#x201C;Desert Battle&#x201D;. There is even a film called &#x201C;The first Church of Christ&#x201D;. Other films that were cut include: &#x201C;British Movietone News No. 2127&#x201D;, &#x201C;Zabriskie Point&#x201D;, &#x201C;Eagles over London&#x201D;, and even &#x201C;Midnight Cowboy&#x201D;. I saw that film the other day. Why on earth there should have been anything objectionable in it. I do not know. &#x201C;Airport&#x201D;, &#x201C;Jannie Totsiens&#x201D; and D. H. Lawrence&#x2019;s &#x201C;Women in Love&#x201D; were other films which were cut.</p>

<p>I believe that censoring also harms the person who does the censoring, because he has to apply rules which to his common sense and judgment very often appear to be unfair. This censorship is harming our economy. Officials of Customs and Excise, who are paid thousands of rand a year, have to waste their time in presenting many of these publications to the Publications Board, only to find out that two-thirds of the publications that they submit to the board are actually passed by the board afterwards. This is a waste of time. The Post Office has to do the same thing. Officials of the Department of the Interior have to do so too. I believe that the cost of all this runs into several hundreds of thousands of rands. The Publications Board alone is going to cost this country R84,000 this year. So much of that expenditure can be avoided. Why can we not simplify the rules&#x003F; Can we not get the Publications Board to adopt a much more broadminded view and to adopt the point of view which is known in law as that of &#x201C;the reasonable man&#x201D;&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a long time since I have last heard such a destructive speech as the one which the hon. member for Orange Grove has just made. What, in fact, did he say&#x003F; He said absolutely nothing. He only said that 13,000 books had already been banned. What does that matter&#x003F; Surely the hon. member should tell us where the board has erred. Surely the hon. member should state an intelligent norm. After all, we do not know whether it was a lot or tripe that was banned. I must say I believe it was tripe. Now the hon. member occupies himself with small calculations and there makes general statements and comes to conclusions which are absolutely meaningless. He tells us we should be &#x201C;broadminded&#x201D;, but he does not tell us what his &#x201C;broadmindedness&#x201D; means. Surely the hon. member should make a positive contribution and tell us how &#x201C;broadminded&#x201D; we should be and what the board should lay down as norm.</p>

<p>Really, does the hon. member not know that &#x201C;broadmindedness&#x201D; depends on whether one is in Hillbrow or whether one is in another urban area&#x003F; After all, there is a world of difference between norms. It depends whether one is at a celebration party. Then one may perhaps be &#x201C;broadminded&#x201D; if one does certain things. If one is at another more decent place, one will, on the other hand, not do something one <span class="col_3441-3442" refersTo="page_0275"/>would have done at a celebration party. That hon. member should not come forward with utter nonsense. He tells us that we should abolish censorship completely.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am busy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member told us of two films he had seen. I happened to have seen those two pictures. Does he want the film &#x201C;Gay Deceivers&#x201D; to be shown in South Africa&#x003F; This picture deals with homosexuals and their parties. Does the hon. member want such a banality to be shown in South Africa&#x003F; I am not speaking of homosexualism as a disease, or whatever it may be, but of the banality of such a film. Is that hon. member being serious when he says in this House that these films should have been shown in South Africa&#x003F; The second film to which the hon. member referred, deals with the atrocities the Catholic Church allegedly perpetrated against its members in the Middle Ages. This is a delicate religious situation. We in South Africa have respect for every person&#x2019;s religion. I think the Publications Board was quite right in not allowing such events to be shown in a church, because it would have hurt the Catholic people in South Africa. Does the hon. member really want that film with all its atrocities to be shown in South Africa&#x003F; Another producer may come along and show a great many atrocities perpetrated by other churches, and then we may be faced with clerical difficulties as a result of people&#x2019;s feelings having been hurt. The hon. member should not make that kind of speech and make all kinds of insinuations. I do not know whether the hon. member knows precisely how to judge a film. I must say that after the few years during which I have heard the hon. member speak about films, I am beginning to realize that I can attach very little value to his opinion. The idea of a modern film is that a member of the audience must share the experience of a slice of life with other members of the audience. These characters must appear authentic and the experiences of those characters must be understood by the audience. In fact, the most successful films we have ever had in South Africa, were those ones where the majority of the audience could identify themselves with some character. [Interjection.] Therefore I want to say that the film maker must incorporate into his film all those various aspects which he wants to achieve. He must put colour, scenes, people and situations into the film. The length of the scenes, the background and the characters must all be calculated at rounding off a certain scene depicted; that is what the film critic looks for. Now I want to make the following request to the hon. the Minister. I want to make the statement that if one has to make too many cuts in a film, and I want to ask the board that if too many cuts are necessary in a film&#x2014;I want to state categorically to-day that I am of the opinion that the board does act judiciously in making cuts&#x2014;when more than four or five cuts are necessary, the board should rather reject the entire film, because otherwise the film becomes disjointed and loses its emotional tension, and then we hear this kind of talk about the board, which we had from the hon. member for Orange Grove to-day. We should prefer such a film to be rejected instead.</p>

<p>Allow me also to refer to the age restrictions which we impose on films. We find the age restrictions are four to twelve, four to sixteen, or four to eighteen and over eighteen. I should like to see the Film Board or the Ministry impress on film makers and importers of films, that what we need in South Africa, is sound films for children for matinees, nice films dealing with animal life, nice films dealing with family life, nice films dealing with heroic deeds. We must tell film importers that South Africa is not interested in all the rubbish they can bring into the country; they should not only bring films into the country to make money, but they should bring in films which are of an uplifting nature. Then I should like to see the importers of films concentrate more on nice family films, ones in which family life is idealized, films in which the mother of the family creates a fine image so that people will come to have more respect for family life. There are many such films and all that has to be done, is that these people have to have it impressed on them that this is the inclination of the South African people. Then I want to tell the board that I admit there are authorities on art. I admit there are art films which are such that they do have a message, but which children ought not to see. I want to plead that the usual age restrictions should virtually be abolished, but that films of that kind which are not suitable for children should be screened in some theatre in a city. Then the parents will know that their children <span class="col_3443-3444" refersTo="page_0276"/> should not go to such a theatre as it is showing a film which has been passed for adults by the authorities on art of the Publications Board.</p>

<p>I just want to reply briefly to what the hon. member for Houghton asked me about Mr. Athol Fugard a while ago. I have nothing against Athol Fugard. I have absolutely nothing against the man. There are many people in South Africa who disagree with our politics, and there are even some of them sitting in this Parliament. The most confirmed liberalist in South Africa is sitting in Parliament and we are not angry with you because of that. My experience is that our Department of the Interior deals most judiciously with applications for passports. I do not know what the reasons are, but I have the fullest confidence that there are particularly good reasons why Mr. Fugard did not get his visa. [Interjections.] Yes, I know the hon. member is sceptical, but she is, after all, sceptical about everything. If the hon. member herself obtained a passport, then she must know that any person who is like her will also get a passport; after all, that is the norm. No this Fugard-case has undoubtedly been seized by the Opposition and by the enemies of South Africa to cause even more trouble, and the less is said about this case, the better. However, let me just tell the hon. member for Houghton this: She is sitting here trying to extract certain information. and she is not going to succeed. According to law it is not at all necessary to give reasons for refusing something. Every country in the world refuses to give reasons as to why a passport has not been granted. It is only the hon. member for Houghton who wants to have the reasons, and I want to tell her that if she should ever come into power, she would pursue the same policy as this side of the House is pursuing at present.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Having listened to the hon. member for Prinshof, all I can say is that when it comes to deciding what films should be shown, it is largely a matter of opinion as to what is right and what is wrong Generally in dealing with this matter of censorship, a. good deal more heat than light is engendered in the discussion.</p>

<p>Sir I want to deal with another matter. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he agrees that the time has come for a more reasonable attitude on the past of the Government with regard to the treatment of ecclesiastics in this country. The other day I put a question to the Minister&#x2019;s colleague, the Minister of Immigration. I asked him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is the minimum period of domicile required in the Republic for ecclesiastics before consideration is given to applications for permanent residence, and what other classes of persons are required to serve the same period&#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply to the first question was a continuous period of four years and the reply to the question as to what other classes of persons are required to serve the same period the Minister said none. The Minister knows that some time ago I raised with him the case of the Rev. Cadigan and I do not propose to discuss that across the floor of the House. This matter which was dealth with by the Minister&#x2019;s colleague concerned a minister who came out to this country and who had to return at the end of his period. Here we find a state of affairs where ecclesiastics as a whole are discriminated against. They are the only class of persons who have to serve a period of four years before they can get permanent residence here. I think the Minister will agree with me that we should be given the reasons for discriminating against this class of person.</p>

<p>All over the Western world it is known that South Africa discriminates against clergymen. When one thinks of the history of this country, Sir, one wonders what would have happened if the Murrays and the McGregors and the McDonalds who came out here in the early days of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Methodist Church ministers, Lutheran missionaries in Zululand and the German missionaries in the Natal Midlands had been subject to this restriction; one wonders what would have happened to religion in South Africa&#x003F; I suggest that it is guite unreasonable to discriminate against these people, who have to make great sacrifices. Ministers of religion are not paid very highly; they are people who follow a calling. I had a case a year or two ago where a minister came from Northern Rhodesia. He was on the borders of Northern Rhodesia and the Congo where conditions were very difficult indeed. His church disappeared. He then came to another church in South Africa. When he arrived here he found that he was subject to this restriction. He brought back with him his furniture, his clothing and his motorcar, but because he could get no permanent residence here he had to pay full duty on these items. I raised this matter with the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor who said that he could do nothing about it. I raised the matter with the Minister of Finance who could do nothing about it. Every other immigrant who comes to this country to take up permanent residence is given a rebate of duty. They do not have to pay the full duty on their car, their furniture and their personal effects. This is not only a discrimination against ministers of religion but they are also discriminated against in that they have to pay an additional amount of duty. That additional amount of duty in many cases does no come out of the pocket of the minister. He has not the income to pay it. It comes out of the congregation. The congregation has to raise money specially to pay the duty on the minister&#x2019;s personal effects. This is a sad state indeed in the year 1970 that this Government is making special restrictions against ministers of religion. I know that members on the other <span class="col_3445-3446" refersTo="page_0277"/>side may say that there have been cases of ministers of religion who have come here and who have adopted an attitude which is contrary to the laws of the country. The Government has its remedy. Persons who flout the laws of a country can be sent back to their country of origin. But in effect the hon. the Minister is saying to the outside world that all ministers of religion are suspect until they have served a period of four years. I therefore suggest that the time has arrived when the Cabinet should reconsider this matter. On the other hand, if the Minister does not intend recommending the matter for reconsideration, the hon. the Minister should give us the reason why it is his policy to discriminate against clergy in the interests of the policy of the Government of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to associate myself with the general remarks made about the operation of our electoral machine by the hon. member for Malmesbury and I think by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as well. I recently had the privilege of assisting in the British general election in making a study of the general operation of the party machine and the general electoral set-up in that country. In many respects it was an experience for me to see how the potential of almost 40 million voters went to the polls with the greatest of ease on voting day. I could observe how a percentage poll of about 93 per cent was recorded in a constituency with approximately 50,000 voters. In this process I gained the impression that in this regard South Africa can learn a tremendous amount from a country like Britan, where the party system has been functioning for more than 100 years. The few remarks which I want to make, I should like to make as a result of what I was able to observe there, and I should like to submit them to the hon. the Minister for his consideration. I am aware that at the moment we are planning in South Africa in respect of our population register. I am aware that it is possible that the introduction of our population register will eventually affect our entire electoral machine. I understand, however, that it may take quite some time before the population register is in full operation. Against this background, I want to take this opportunity to present a few ideas to the hon. the Minister which we may perhaps consider implementing before the population register is put into operation, or in preparation for what we will gain from this population register in general. I first want to content myself with making the general statement that the State of the authorities in Britain accept a much greater responsibility or a greater obligation towards the country&#x2019;s electorate, especially immediately before and during an election in relation to the situation in South Africa. I wonder whether the time has not arrived in South Africa as well that with our growing population we have reached a situation where we should start thinking basically about this stand point. I want to refer especially to four aspects: the registration of voters in general and the part played by the State in that; the compilation of the voters&#x2019; roll; the part played by the State in activiating the voters on and before election day; and lastly, the supplying of information over the radio.</p>

<p>In regard to the registration of voters, we find that the State undertakes an annual general registration in Britain. There is no interim registration of voters. Hon. members know that there is a general registration in South Africa every five years. I think on the last occasion we had to postpone it to about six years, and eventually it became more than six years. In practice it actually boils down to the fact that during these five years the various political parties do their share as far as registrations are concerned. They see to it that in the supplementary registrations in between the five-year registrations for which the State has accepted responsibility, the general registration of voters is done with the aid of the various political parties. In Britain the State accepts far greater responsibility for compiling the voters&#x2019; roll. Every year the State generally provides very thorough organization, and it makes use of the radio and various State institutions in order to draw up the new voters&#x2019; roll in a very effective way with the help of the various political parties. In other words, the State does not accept responsibility for compiling a thorough voters&#x2019; roll every five years only, as is the case in this country at present. In practice, it means that a voters&#x2019; roll is always final between two periods. In other words, that voters&#x2019; roll is final between January, 1969, and January, 1970. In this period, no additions to or deletions from this roll can be made. This system means that the voters&#x2019; roll is always final and any addition or general registration which is done after a period of one year, is done on the preceding two months. In the meanwhile, that list always remains final between two dates over a period of a year.</p>

<p>Secondly, the composition of the voters&#x2019; roll is totally different to that in South Africa. In South Africa we have the situation that the voters&#x2019; roll is compiled in alphabetical order. In their case, the voters&#x2019; roll is compiled on the basis of the addresses. In other words, at the top of voters&#x2019; roll it is stated that the address reference is Long Street, for example. Then the list starts at Long Street No. 1 and stops, for example, at Long Street No. 20. The addresses therefore form the basis of the particular voters&#x2019; roll. I have a voters&#x2019; roll available here and if there are hon. members who would like to see it, they may do so later on. In other words, there is a complete difference in the composition of the voters&#x2019; rolls when this voters&#x2019; roll is compared with that of South Africa. To my mind this particular system of compilation has countless advantages. I was impressed by the tremendous practical advantages it holds for the various political parties. In the first place, there is more than <span class="col_3447-3448" refersTo="page_0278"/>one polling booth in a polling district. In South Africa we have the position that we have polling districts with 5,000 voters who all have to vote at the same place on one day.</p>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>10,000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there are even 10,000 and more. Because the basis of this voters&#x2019; roll is the addresses and not an alphabetical list of names, it means that 50 or 60 polling booths are provided in a single polling district. At a complex of flats, for instance, one polling booth can be provided. The people living in Long Street, for example, can vote at one polling booth in the same polling district. With the growing urbanization of our population, I think this really is a system which South Africa can very conveniently adopt.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the organization of the various parties. When we start fighting an election in South Africa, one of the first things which the parties do is to write out so-called canvassing cards. Here it is very easy, because the voters&#x2019; roll lends itself to it. The voters&#x2019; roll lends itself to that because it can simply be torn up because it is printed on one side only. There the people living in Long Street are all together, those of Bree Street are all together, and so are those in blocks of flats, for example. Seen from the point of view of political parties, this is a very great advantage, which we can consider.</p>

<p>In connection with the handling of postal votes, too, I want to say that because the voters&#x2019; roll is always final between two dates, the whole system of postal votes is facilitated tremendously. For example, as soon as a person moves after 1st February, postal votes can be attended to on any date, whether there is an election or not. I have here a number of applications for postal votes which are used in Britain and hon. members can see them if they wish. It is not the clumsy form which we use in South Africa. After the list has come into operation on 1st February of any particular year, it remains final until 1st February of the following year. The moment a voter on this list moves from one address to another within a certain distance, his vote is an ordinary postal vote, whether there is an election or not. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can assure you that I will keep within the rules. The article reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Some political observers believe that the reason Mr. Basson has not yet been asked to speak might be because of this delicate balance in Sea Point.</block>

<p>They are of course referring to the election result. I am mentioning this matter because I will in a moment or two prove, or attempt to prove, that a new way of fighting an election has emerged in South Africa. We in this House, in our wisdom or otherwise, have tried over the years to create machinery for the orderly conduct of elections. We have made bribery and corruption illegal. We have prohibited the playing of bands and martial music and the flying of the national flag on election day. We have also prohibited the use of loudspeakers on election day. It is quite easy to see why all this had to be done. We have limited the expenditure of candidates in the past, but we have now done away with that limitation. I do not think it was a wise decision. After having gone through the mill with the Progressive Party which has unlimited funds, one might well have second thoughts about the advisability of having lifted that restriction. We introduced special and postal votes for people who cannot be present to vote on election day. We have also done away with the two months&#x2019; residential requirement for registration and have substituted intended domicile only. We have also made compulsory provision for identification of voters by postal votes and special votes, but not, unfortunately in the case of ordinary voters. We have also made it compulsory for publications relating to elections to be signed by the writer if that statement is made after the proclamation day when an election is about to take place. We have also prohibited public meetings and other election meetings on licensed premises and we have also prohibited candidates of political parties from providing food, entertainment or lodging during the election.</p>

<p>I now make bold to say that during my election campaign, and anyone who fought the Progressive Party will know that it is true, the mode of the Progressive Party of holding meetings are usually at so-called house parties where liquor and food are provided free to anyone who attends that particular meeting.</p>

<p><span class="col_3449-3450" refersTo="page_0279"/>The second matter is that the prohibition of meetings which do not take place on licensed premises, has become obsolete. Although the premises are not licensed, the liquor is freely available. We have in our wisdom decided that publications must be signed by the writer or the issuer of a particular pamphlet or article in a newspaper. But in the light of this character assasination, which is a technique, an art, and has blown over from America to this country&#x2014;I shall deal with that in a moment&#x2014;I think it will be necessary for the Minister to think again whether political correspondents of newspapers should not sign their names on all occasions, so that we can know who the people are who are working up to that psychological climax where they want to assassinate the character of a person. Just to give hon. members an idea of how elections are being fought these days, I have here an article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on 26th April, just after the election. It was written by a lady by the name of Pamela Diamond. It is very well written, too. But what does she say in this article&#x003F; Referring to the battle of Sea Point, she said:</p>

<block name="quote">What few people know, is that campaign workers from the United States, who helped project the young people&#x2019;s hero, Eugene McCarthy in the American presidential election, lent their experience to the fight of their Progressive Party candidate, Colin Eglin in Sea Point. I have never seen such enthusiasm and tension in a South African election campaigns before.</block>

<p>Then it says that one woman worker said the following about the result:</p>

<block name="quote">This hurt more than my divorce.</block>

<p>She did not say why she was divorced. She continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another fell weeping into the arms of the Police.</block>

<p>The Police, of all people! She started weeping in the arms of the Police. Then the article goes on to say how they had a man here from Australia, a lawyer, who had stayed here for two months. The article continues:</p>

<block name="quote">It is estimated that over 800 people actively worked for the Progressive Party in that election.</block>

<p>Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I am just giving hon. members an instance of how these American ideas are now being brought to South Africa. I can only attribute it to strange influence from outside the country, because before we certainly never saw this way of fighting an election. I just want to give hon. members an instance of how character assassination takes place. I have here a poster that I had printed. Here hon. members can see it. It is printed in blue. The heading reads &#x201C;Progs and communists&#x201D;. There I had a photostat copy made of one single paragraph as it appeared in the <i>Cape Times</i> on 17th April, 1970. I deliberately had the top portion inserted of another paragraph as it appeared, as well as the bottom section of the preceding paragraph, to show that the middle paragraph was not taken out of context. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">In reply to another question, Mrs. Suzman said a Progressive Government would allow the communist party to operate in South Africa as long as it obeyed the law and did not disrupt or cause violence.</block>

<p>That is all right. If she wants the communist party to operate here there is nothing wrong with it. But now look at the character assassination. Now I must show hon. members how the newspapers dealt with that pamphlet. They called it the &#x201C;meanest thing&#x201D; ever, the &#x201C;most shabby trick&#x201D;. They are referring to this pamphlet. After all the dirty work attributed to me, that newspaper telephoned various prominent citizens and asked what they thought about &#x201C;this foul manner of fighting an election by Jack Basson&#x201D;&#x003F; I may say, Sir, that this poster was pulled down by the Progressive Party and actually children under the age of 12 years were assaulted by them because of it. But then they gave the comment of Mr. Ben Rabinowitz, who says that &#x201C;It is shameful of Mr. Basson to sail under the &#x2018;colours&#x2019; of his opponent.&#x201D; Another man, Mr. Dubow, art authority, said that &#x201C;Mr. Basson&#x2019;s tactics have reached an all time low.&#x201D; The only reason why they can say that I have reached such an all time low&#x201D;, is because I have used the blue colours of the Progressive Party. So they say. Actually, the Methodist Church has the same colours. Why it belongs to them, I do not know.</p>

<p>Then it goes on to say this: &#x201C;They will challenge me to produce a single respectable and decent Member of Parliament or candidate of the United Party that would sink to this level. I will now give them the name of a good, decent, respectable Member of Parliament who also used blue for his propaganda pamphlets, namely my colleague the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He was not attacked. According to certain of the newspapers, it was apparently not the colour but the contents that mattered. The contents would lead to this character assassination, and by repetition of the same lie, they eventually worked up a hatred against a person in his individual capacity. I have other very interesting cuttings here, which will prove how character assassination works. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout who stood in to-day for the hon. member for Green Point, opened the discussion and also <span class="col_3451-3452" refersTo="page_0280"/>referred to the indisposition of the hon. member for Green Point, in regard to which I also want to express my regret. I am sorry that he cannot have been here to-day to introduce this debate, but it is a good thing that he has a substitute who was able to start the ball rolling for us.</p>

<p>Arising out of the reference made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to the tact that polling day for the provincial election and for the parliamentary election should be on the same day, I can inform the hon. member that this side of the House has been considering this matter for years now. As the hon. member, who spent some time in the National Party, knows, this is something which has quite frequently in the past been discussed at party congresses. It is a matter which is at present again receiving the serious attention of the Government. I can inform the House that the hon. the Prime Minister is very interested in this question, i.e. that the two elections be held on the same day. As a result of that our Department has recently been giving this matter serious attention I shall in due course therefore come to this House with a report. I shall leave for subsequent decision whether it should be in the form of a Select Committee, which should sit to consider this matter, or in what other form it should be done.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>During the next session&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that could be. It is very probable that we will then be able to come forward with a report or a motion in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>At this stage I should like to refer now to the <i>Gazette Extraordinary</i> which appeared today. The hon. member for Durban (Point) apologized for not being able to be present here to refer to this matter. It relates to the election of Senators. I should have liked to have made a statement about this in any case, but I am just mentioning that he wanted to discuss this matter. In this regard I should now like to make the following statement:</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister announced some time ago that the election of Senators would take place after the provincial elections on 28th October, 1970.</block>

<block name="quote">The Senators&#x2019; five year term of service expires on Saturday, 5th December, 1970, and the next election of Senators will therefore, in the normal course of events, have to take place after that date.</block>

<block name="quote">Normally the election of Senators must take place at least 21 days after the proclamation which called the election, and in actual fact therefore it will only be possible to hold the election towards the end of December, 1970.</block>

<block name="quote">It was, however, decided to hold this election after the provincial elections but still before the end of December, and to make this legally possible Proclamation No. 222 was promulgated to-day in terms of which the Senate is dissolved with effect from 5th September, 1970. A dissolution in this way can at this stage, in terms of section 33 of the Constitution Act, only take place within 120 days after the expiry of the five year term of office of a provincial council, and in this case it is 9th May, 1970, when the term of service of the Orange Free State Provincial Council, which lasted until the latest date, expired.</block>

<block name="quote">The Proclamation provides further that the dissolution of the Senate does not affect the validity of the State President&#x2019;s Proclamation No. 132 of 29th April, 1970, by which Parliament was summoned, and consequently the Senate remains, notwithstanding its dissolution, competent in terms of the provision of section 53 of the Constitution Act to continue to perform its functions up to and including the day immediately before polling day, when Senators are elected in the same way in all respects as if the dissolution had not taken place.</block>

<block name="quote">The precise date of the election of the Senate will subsequently be announced.</block>

<p>I now come to the further replies to the matters raised here by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and others. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to the postal vote system. He expressed misgivings on that score and actually advocated the abolition thereof, a plea with which my side and I can in no way associate ourselves. The hon. member for Malmesbury has already pointed out that our geographical position differs greatly from that of other countries and that a comparison can in no way be made. Owing to our vast expanses a postal vote system is indeed of great advantage. For the sake of interest, during this recent election the number of postal votes cast totalled 70,000 as against 104,000 special votes.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout complained about the officials who operated the electoral machinery on polling day. I want to concede that not all those officials were experienced people, but the Department does on its part make very certain that they are well-instructed. They are properly informed on the matter and this is what we shall continue to do in future. I repeat that not all were experienced. Not all had participated in previous elections, and this could in fact have given rise to problems. The hon. member wanted to know from me how many of them were utilized in this way. The total is between 4,000 and 5,000, based on the premise that plus-minus 30 officials were active in a constituency. The hon. member advocated that a course be introduced at a university for officials having to receive training in electoral techniques. Whether a university would be prepared to do so, is another matter. We are <span class="col_3453-3454" refersTo="page_0281"/>continually asking the universities to introduce new courses. Under my Vote yesterday, someone on my side also advocated that a chair for labour relations be introduced at the universities, a matter towards which I am very sympathetically disposed. The same applies to this matter, but to cover all these matters by establishing chairs at universities, is really a major task. I really cannot take this any further now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I meant a correspondence course.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>By way of correspondence is certainly a matter which one could put to them. I shall ask my Department to take this up with the University of South Africa to see whether they could not perhaps introduce a correspondence course in this field.</p>

<p>The hon. member had a great many complaints in regard to passports. He admitted that it was a major responsibility which one placed on a persons shoulders, and specifically on the Minister&#x2019;s. It is a major responsibility. In exercising that responsibility one must take many aspects into account. One must take into account the aspect of your country&#x2019;s security and you must place your country&#x2019;s interests above all else, above personal interests. In the execution of this task it is the case that one has to take certain decisions which sometimes seems strange to people because you cannot of course elaborate on your reasons. It is also standard practice. The hon. member for Houghton complained about this and of course she went further and said that I had refused Mr. Fugard a passport because he was supposedly opposed to the Government. No, if we had to refuse passports to people who were opposed to the Government, dealing with this matter would certainly have been very easy. Then one would simply have had to establish whether or not he has a blue card, and then you could deal with the matter accordingly. But that is not the way we do it. The hon. member need not think that we do it in such an unreasonable manner. We have never interfered with her when she wanted to go overseas, even though she is an elected member, and if she were to lose her seat, we would certainly still give consideration to her case in this connection. The considerations are the interests and the security of the country. The doubt which exists as to whether there is a conflict between Foreign Affairs and Interior, is totally unfounded. There is continual consultation. In fact, consultation takes place between Foreign Affairs and Interior in regard to every case of this nature.</p>

<p>There was no hesitation, either, in dragging in the Japanese jockey again, and saying that this was a result of &#x201C;insufficient evidence&#x201D;. No, it was not &#x201C;insufficient evidence&#x201D;; it was a case of additional facts. When we received those additional facts, the Minister could view this matter in a different light and could form a different opinion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>After all, the onus rests on the man who asks.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, as the hon. the Prime Minister has quite rightly said the onus rests on the man who asks. Then, newspaper editors were quoted here. <i>Die Beeld</i> was quoted, which also wrote in favour of Mr. Fugard. With all due respect for newspaper editors, whether they support my side or your side, they are after all not informed of the facts concerning these people. When these particulars in regard to a passport come before me as Minister, the Department has already sifted and sorted out the matter, and there has been consultation with Foreign Affairs and other bodies. When it comes before you, very reliable and authoritative sources have been consulted, sources of which the newspaper editors, favourably or unfavourably disposed, have no knowledge. A Minister must exercise that responsibility, which the hon. member said rested on my shoulders, in the light of all the particulars at his disposal.</p>

<p>The hon. member once again discussed the stamp on the passport, which he discussed last year. Last year he was furnished with a detailed reply, and I do not think I need give it to him in such great detail again.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I had hoped that you were a new broom.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, there is no such idea. If we were to supply all the particulars you desire, pages and pages would have to be added to that passport. That is the reason why this pattern is now being followed. If we were to accede to your request, if we were only to mention certain countries which a person could visit, then we are going to have repeated applications from that person if he should want to visit other countries. So, it is not really practical in this connection. I now hope the hon. member will adapt himself to this and raise a new matter next year in this discussion.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton also wanted to know whether I had any intention of abolishing exit permits. No, the Government has no intention of abolishing these. The hon. member for Pinetown raised the question of clergymen, the manner of their residence and the time required. I have here a copy of the letter which was previously sent to the hon. member by my predecessor and I do not deem it necessary to read it in its entirety. This letter is dated 6th May, 1969, and, <i>inter alia,</i> it amounts to the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After a period of four years&#x2019; temporary residence, the persons concerned may submit applications for permanent residence in South Africa and provided their applications are approved they may apply for <span class="col_3455-3456" refersTo="page_0282"/>naturalization as South African citizens after five years&#x2019; permanent residence.</block>

<p>There is no need for me to hide anything in regard to this matter. Clergymen are people whom we place on a high pedestal. Most of us have some or other church affiliation in which we have very high esteem for the spiritual leaders, and specifically the Ministers, tout our experience in South Africa with foreign clergymen has sometimes been quite disappointing to us. Among foreign clergymen we have in this country in recent times only had the Huddlestones, the Reeveses and the Crowthers. They are not little angels; there areamong They are not little angels; there are among them people with ulterior political motives, and these ulterior political motives have to many been of greater importance to them than their clerical activities. Because this is the case, hon. members had better entrust this matter to us. If after four years we see that the clergymen is occupying himself with spiritual work, then one welcomes him in this country and his application for permanent residence here is given exceptionally favourably consideration. We should like to continue in this way, as far as dealing with this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury raised the question of the casting of special votes at police station. The position is that a sergeant of police is appointed to remain on duty until 9 p.m. to deal with special votes. He is even paid overtime. However, a request must be addressed to the returning officer by the parties in this connection.</p>

<p>Then, the hon. member for Houghton raised the question of the disparity in salary increases between white and non-white officials. I can only inform the hon. member that it always has been the policy to determine salaries with due consideration for the ability, the standard of living and needs of people, as well as the question of supply and demand.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg raised a very important matter here which has aroused particular interest. I have had the privilege on a former occasion as well of ascertaining what the hon. member&#x2019;s impressions are. The impressions he had of the recent British election are significant and valuable. He has conveyed these impressions to me and he has already conveyed his impressions to my Department and has asked them to consider the matter further. The question of the consolidation of the voters&#x2019; roll in particular, is a very topical aspect. If voters&#x2019; lists can be compiled according to a block system, as is done in Britain, then it will obviously be of great value for the parties during elections. This is a system which constitutes many advantages and which I find exceptionally pleasing. The hon. member also referred to the question of more polling booths which would to a certain extent eliminate transportation problems. There is much to be said for that.</p>

<p>I have already asked the Department to investigate this matter, and when we meet again here next year, I hope that I will have a report from the Department which we can then submit for discussion to the various party groups. Whether it should then be referred to a select committee, is a matter which I leave in abeyance for the moment, but I hope to be able at that juncture to make recommendations in this connection. At this juncture that is all I have to say.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I was trying to point out here that newspapers have a great responsibility in a free democracy such as we are because they, after all, are the architects of public opinion, but newspaper comment will only be valuable and to the benefit of this country if the newspapers remain responsible and present news in such a way that it is useful and not misleading. Sir, I want to give you another example to show what newspapers are doing and how they can influence people. You may have heard, Sir, that a long time before the election I was telephoned by the representative of a particular newspaper and asked what the election in Sea Point was to be about. My reply was that the election would be fought on the same issues as in the rest of the country. I was then asked, &#x201C;Have you any particular problem in Sea Point&#x003F;&#x201D; My reply, which was correctly reported, was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes. The problem that worries local residents more than anything is the behaviour of non-white visitors to this area. They come here half drunk, get more drunk and sleep here in their hundreds if not their thousands. These are people who are not employed in Sea Point. If proof is needed, just look at the buses leaving Sea Point in the morning.</block>

<p>The report then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Basson said he had many requests from people for steps against this influx, even for a curfew.</block>

<p>I then went on deliberately to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The majority of the servants employed here are well-behaved. Unfortunately some of the troublemakers are encouraged by Progressive Party thinking which tells them that they have the right to be here. This matter will have to be resolved and I will certainly see to it that Sea Point remains a white residential area. Drunkenness and lawlessness will receive my attention in no half measure irrespective of the encouragement these people may get from the Progressive Party.</block>

<p>That was quite clear. So this particular newspaper came with a heading to try and tag me onto the Nationalist Party. So incidentally I learned later on. This was agreed to long ago,<span class="col_3457-3458" refersTo="page_0283"/>long before this interview. The heading reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Keep Sea Point White&#x201D; is call by Basson.</block>

<p>I shall deal with that at a later stage. When we get to the Third Reading I will have more to say about this. But that is all right. Let them write these things under headings that I am not responsible for. I never said those things. But what do they do&#x003F; They publish that and immediately get onto the telephone. They then start telephoning prominent Coloured people, some of whom I am proud to say are my friends and for whom I have done much. Then they started contacting these people and asked them for condemnation of their own headlines which I was reputed to have said. I think that is completely scandalous.</p>

<p>But that is not enough. I addressed a public meeting with the hon. member for Green Point, Mr. Lionel Murray. There I said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are two parties that South Africa cannot afford; the one is the Herstigte Party and the other one is the Progressive Party.</block>

<p>I gave as my reasons the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If there was no law against it I am sure that many of the youth of the Herstigtes would be the Nazis of this country but I am also sure if there was no law against it then many of the youth of the Progressive Party would have been the communists of this country.</block>

<p>I stand by that. And what happened&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am just trying to explain that under the Publications Board the hon. the Minister has the right to interfere. This is being discussed here right now. At that meeting too, Mr. Lionel Murray dealt with the Anti-Sabotage Act. He said that the United Party supported the principle. There was only one person who voted against that principle, namely the hon. member for Houghton. During question time a gentleman got up and said: Are you trying to insinuate that Mrs. Suzman supported the principle of sabotage&#x003F; To that question Mr. Murray replied. I had nothing to do with it. But what appeared in the newspapers&#x003F; It was published correctly in some newspapers. But another newspaper reported that I had said&#x2014;not Mr. Murray&#x2014;that Mrs. Helen Suzman supported the saboteurs. I had nothing to do with it. I never spoke about her. But not satisfied with that, what did they do&#x003F; They started telephoning prominent citizens and asked them what they thought of a man with a character as low as mine who could attribute a thing like that to the hon. member for Houghton. [Interjection.] Wait a minute. I am coming to that too. I will deal with the whole lot if I have sufficient time. Not satisfied with that, the <i>Sunday Times</i> came with a story. The <i>Sunday Times</i> came with a beautiful story and published a nice photograph of myself too. That was the only decent thing in the whole issue on that occassion. The headlines read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Two Bassons, this Basson is verlig.</block>

<p>That is now Jaap.</p>

<p>This Basson is verkramp.</p>

<p>That is me. With reference to Japie they say:</p>

<p>&#x201C;This Basson is verlig&#x201D;, and with reference to myself they say &#x201C;This Basson is verkramp&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Then it says the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said:</p>

<block name="quote">There can be no home for verkrampte politician attitudes in the United Party.</block>

<p>He then condemned what he called &#x201C;racially insulting remarks, intolerance and verkramptheid &#x2026; irrespective of which party it comes from.&#x201D; This is quite right and I agree with it. Mr. Japie Basson subsequently stated he never referred to me. However, next to it a gentleman whom I never have seen and whom I would not recognize if he walks in here because I do not even know what he looks like, a certain Mr. A. J. Wannenburgh, had a whole story about the &#x201C;verkrampte Mr. Basson&#x201D;. He never consulted me. But what does he say&#x003F; He says:</p>

<block name="quote">Captain Basson&#x2019;s outburst against the Progressives flows largely from an attempt on his part to fight his way out of &#x2026; this &#x2018;keep Sea Point white business&#x2019;.</block>

<p>Then he said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">At a meeting on Tuesday night Captain Basson made what are described as outrageous smears against the Progressives in a fierce attack in which he appeared to throw restraint to the wind.</block>

<p>Here are some of the things to which they object and which I was supposed to have said. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">Unlike the Progressives the United Party was opposed to dagga smoking.</block>

<p>This is what they say that I said. Nobody has ever said that and most certainly I have never said that. So the character assasination Went on. They were not satisfied with this, so what did they do&#x003F; They started phoning people, the clergy in particular, and asked them what they thought of a man who has accused them of dagga smoking. I never did anything of this kind. I can prove it, but unfortunately I only <span class="col_3459-3460" refersTo="page_0284"/>have two minutes left. In any case, I have never said so. So this character assasination goes on, this new phase which is now entering into South Africa&#x2019;s political life; something which has been unheard of before.</p>

<p>I say the role of the Press can be great to make this country a happy country and to get democracy in this country to work, but democracy can only work if the electorate is capable of deciding what is right and what is wrong. The electorate can only be informed if the newspapers play the game and give truth and truthfulness to the electorate. Certain newspapers always dig for dirt. It is to be found everywhere in the world. I have travelled quite a bit in this world as well, and I want to tell hon. members that South Africa with all its shortcomings is still a better place than these new drop-outs are trying to pretend. South Africa is not bad and South Africa has served many of them themselves very well. I hope they will realize this.</p>

<p>Before I sit down I want to ask the hon. the Minister one thing and then I will say no more. See that you make it compulsory, because you have the powers in the Act, when people come to vote in areas where there is a large floating population, for those people to show their identity cards before they get their voting cards. If that is not done, we are going to run into difficulties. Where you have 800 people as canvassers, as has been admitted by Pamela Diamond, it is the easiest thing in the world to vote early, to vote Prog and to vote often.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I will never do that. This is what happens when former friends take the field against each other in the political sphere. It is then that one gets scenes such as the one which has taken place here today. It so happens that I want to discuss the same subject, i.e. the Press. The Press is one of the major institutions in our country to which a freedom attaches. This Press freedom is one of the principal freedoms in the democratic world. Next to religious freedom and the freedom of speech it is one of the greatest freedoms in our Western community. The Press as an institution operates within the framework of an agreement with the government. This agreement with the government has <i>inter alia</i> four component parts. The first component of that agreement between the Press and the government is that the government has entrusted to the Press a certain educational task. It affords the Press freedom of movement to accomplish that educational task by means of information and the dissemination and supply of news over a broad field. The second component in that agreement between the government and the Press is situated therein that the Press must present a strong and an accurate overall picture of the people and the country in which it is operating to the outside world. A third component of that agreement is that the government and the Press must guarantee that there is freedom of movement of its workers to acquire that news and those educational means and to accomplish that allocated educational task in terms of that agreement so that all those facts can be assembled. The fourth component of that agreement is that the Press should accept and acknowledge that there is only one lawful, democratically elected authority which is able to exercise power, namely the government elected at the public polls.</p>

<p>This agreement between the government and the Press imposes certain obligations on the government, as well as certain obligations on the Press. Just as the government imposes certain requirements on its teachers in the schools and at universities, just as the church imposes certain requirements on its preachers, just as industry imposes certain requirements on its technicians, as much of an inherent obligation rests on the Press to insure in terms of that agreement that its people who assemble those facts for it and who have to accomplish that educational task, who have to supply the news and present that overall image of the people and the State, should also be identifiable. I am afraid, however, that this is not the case to-day with the Press. I stated that the government guarantees the Press freedom of movement to assemble those facts and in so doing inform the public, to form in that way an overall picture and to act as spokesmen for dissensients in the political sphere and in other spheres in the State. If the Press does not comply with this agreement and if the Press does not want to indicate to us who its workers are, what training they have received, and what their general background of experience is through which they can infiltrate and penetrate through vision and the ability to project, to the core of governmental science on a national and international level, then I maintain that it is the duty of the government, and that they are entitled to demand this of the Press. If the Press do not want to remove those ramparts of fictitious correspondents, speculative conjectures and occasional harmful and malicious speculative comment, conjectures and comments which they sometimes allow to encroach on the command level of the government, so that we can see who are behind these ramparts, then I say the government is entitled to break down those ramparts. To a large extent, and I think I am entitled to say this, the overall picture of our fatherland lies in fragments today. And as a result of whom&#x003F; As a result of the so-called &#x201C;our own correspondents&#x201D; and &#x201C;our political reporters&#x201D;. When one reads <span class="col_3461-3462" refersTo="page_0285"/>newspaper reports, they teem with &#x201C;it is reported&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am reliably informed&#x201D; or &#x201C;well-informed circles say&#x201D;. I want to ask to-day what it costs our fatherland in honour, in prestige, in image and in money to confront this devastation. The overall image of our fatherland has been immeasureably obscured, distorted and demolished by speculative conjectures and malicious political speculation. Certain powerful Press organizations in this country did not perform their education task as part of that agreement. They have destroyed our overall picture and have horribly undermined our Government in a cruel manner in its lawful, allocated level of authority by means of lies, half-truths and malicious speculation, to such an extent that our Government to-day is in discredit with the nation, because in the performance of its directive it allowed feelings and emotions here in this country and in the outside world to be exploited and incited in an unashamed manner to its own benefit. They fed our enemies, who because of greed for conquest and an obsession with power wanted to assail our nation and our Government on all fronts, from our own country. I want to advocate again here to-day, and <i>Die Vaderland</i> and <i>Die Beeld</i> can go ahead and ridicule me as they did after I had advocated the same matter last year and the year before last, for a Press tribunal with statutory powers. In the interests of the overall picture of our fatherland and the educational task which has been entrusted to the Press, and in the interests of the truth, facts and deeds having to form the basis of criticism and freedom, this court must be able to act with such powers, with disciplinary measures, of a compulsory nature, against that which is having a devastating effect on the image of our fatherland, on the way of life of our people which is based on and directed by Christian principles and the ability of our Government to carry out the mandate of the peopole on the basis of good relations politics among White and non-White here in this country, to which our entire weal and woe in future will be linked. Such a Press tribunal must go and fetch out all those snipers in the mud pools behind those self-erected ramparts. We want to know who writes for our people: we want to know where they come from; how they got there and what value can be attached to their protections, speculations and coniectures. Since I have said this. I also say that it is the duty of the Government to open channels for the Press to acquire those facts.</p>

<p>I can think of two ways in which the Government can open those channels. I am thinking that more regular Press conferences on a Cabinet level will enable the pressmen, the assemblers of those facts, to acquire the necessary facts. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I do not want to waste any time on that hon. member. I can tell him that there was no character assassination of him in the Sea Point election. The only character assassination which went on came from his side, from himself&#x2014;and via insinuations were published under somebody else&#x2019;s name. He never bothered to deny that he had accused young Progressives of being dagga-smokers. To-day he stands by the character assassination of the Young Progs as would-be communists. That, Sir, is character assassination.</p>

<p>On this question of keeping Sea Point white. I want to ask the hon. member why it is that although this article to which he objected was published on the 16th January. 1970. it was not until the 17th March, 1970. that he objected to the title &#x201C;Keen Sea Point White&#x201D;. He had many opportunities in the meantime to do so. As a matter of fact, letters were written to the Press about it and he even addressed a public meeting, but he said nothing about this. It was only when he discovered that the voters of Sea Point were more enlightened than he thought they ought to be and that there was a sharp reaction against his attempt to exploit racial prejudice in Sea Point, that he suddenly denied he had ever used the expression &#x201C;Keep Sea Point White&#x201D;. I understand that a report of the interview he gave was read back to him over the telephone, and that he made no objection at the time. I am not interested in the hon. member&#x2019;s protestations. He was not misrepresented <span class="col_3463-3464" refersTo="page_0286"/> by the Press&#x2014;on the contrary, I think they were very kind to him. The very fact that his majority was reduced by more than 3,500 votes shows that the voters of Sea Point very nearly did realize that the sort of representative they had did not in fact represent their way of thinking and their philosophy of life. I want to have nothing more to do with that hon. member. He should learn the difference between the Sabotage Act, which the United Party did support&#x2014;both in principle and in the Committee Stage&#x2014;and the Terrorism Act, which the United Party did not support. Now in the so-called liberal and enlightened constituencies they say they are against solitary confinement and indefinite detention. As proof of that they say they have opposed section 6 of the Terrorism Act &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes I shall do so, Mr. Chairman. I was only giving the hon. member for Sea Point a lesson in political history. I shall now come back to the Vote. I want to deal with a much more important subject than the hon. member for Sea Point. I want to deal with the question of salary increases for non-white nurses. This I consider to be a far more important matter than the hon. member for Sea Point and his quarrel with the Press.</p>

<p>Instead of the disparity in salaries between Whites and non-Whites getting less, it is in fact increasing. [Interjections.] It is not a provincial matter. Do not try to teach me my bisiness in this House. [Interjections.] Salaries are fixed by the Public Service Commission. The salary of a white sister has gone up, and I am glad about these increases. The salary of a white sister has gone up from R1,560 to R2,400 to R3,000. In comparison with that, Coloureds and Indians remain on a scale with R1,500 as the maximum, and the African nurse on R1,200. I want to tell the Minister that this is an enormous source of grievance among the non-white nurses. Already there is a considerable drop in the number of African women who want to become nurses, and that while there is already a serious shortage. So if this sort of thing is going to go on, we are going to experience serious difficulty in staffing our non-white hospitals in South Africa. At present Coloured and Indian nurses receive about half of the pay of a white nurse, and the African nurses about one-third. For this disparity there is no logical explanation. The argument that non-whites live on a lower standard of living is always put upside down. They have to do so because they are paid lower wages. It is not that they wish to live at a lower standard of living. Professional people, like nurses, receive the same training, have to assume the same responsibilities and must therefore have the same status. That there should be discrimination between the racial groups is, therefore, a disgrace. The same applies to medical staff in all our hospitals. It also applies to medical officers, where there is a large disparity between the salaries being paid to white cotors, Indian doctors and African doctors, particularly in the Natal hospitals. Recently we had five non-white radiographers who qualified in Cape Town. These passed exactly the same diploma course as the white trainees. However, their maximum earning capacity of R1,500 per year is R540 less than that of their white colleagues. I want to know how anybody can justify this enormous disparity in the salaries of professional people.</p>

<p>Coming to teachers, one finds that hardly a week goes in which Coloured teachers are not leaving the shores of South Africa. Many of them leave on exit permits because they are denied passports. They go because they realize that the opportunities for them to earn salaries commensurate with their training and experience are simply not attainable for them in South Africa. Here again, we are going to be faced with a very serious shortage of Coloured teachers if this sort of situation continues. Indian parents and educationists are also alarmed because numbers of Indian teachers are resigning in favour of other employment which will reward them in a fairer manner. The following are the applicable salaries which I worked out from the very complicated scales I was given. A senior assistant teacher, if white, can earn up to R5,100 per annum: if a Coloured, R3,600. Category A Whites, can earn up to R3,720, and Coloureds R2,700. while the African, Category A never goes higher than R2,070. Once again, these are people with the same training. At times they even have more responsibility, because African teachers have to handle enormous classes&#x2014;something like 58 per class. White teachers have to handle a smaller number per class. I do not think there can be any justification for this disparity in wages. Of course, I reject discrimination in wages on a racial basis, no matter what the occupation. The argument that these people are living at a lower standard of living, cuts no ice with me. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I should like at this stage to reply to a few points raised here. I hope, however, that I shall also be afforded a subsequent opportunity to say what I want to say. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout had a great deal to say about the Publications Board. In this he is of course not alone, but has quite a number of friends on the opposite side. But I shall give my views on the Publications Board and its functions later on. The age limit for a film such as Helga and the fact that husbands could not see the film at the same time as their wives, created problems for him. These are things which one could take into consideration: It is not merely a question of a husband and his wife; it is also a question of a man and a girl, and it is * also a question <span class="col_3465-3466" refersTo="page_0287"/>of two 18-year-olds who might have attended that film together. The consideration as to why Helga was shown to separate audiences, applies in a different way in the case of a man and a girl of 18 than in the case of a man and his wife who are adults, although 18-year-olds can lawfully be reckoned as adults. Then he said that the censors must allow us to grow up, and the implication was that our people are not adult enough. He had a lot to say about the type of matter which was banned, and then added that we were all opposed to pornography. But can he tell me where pornography begins and where it ends&#x003F; Can he give me that reply&#x003F; It is not that easy and it will never be that easy. I shall subsequently, towards the end, return to a plan which I have to show you that what I regard as pornography, is not regarded as pornography by Customs. A little more information and insight will teach him that the word &#x201C;pornography&#x201D; is very glibly bandied about without people really knowing what it means. Now I want to say this. I would prefer to tell you a little more about these two films, Helga and Jannie Totsiens. We cannot go into all of them, but by mentioning one or two, one at least illustrates the point of departure of the Publications Board, which people maliciously, and not always maliciously but sometimes ignorantly call the Censor Board.</p>

<p>Now, the film Helga was supposed to be a documentary, and it was unanimously banned by the Board. A B Certificate was granted for the age group 4 to 18, women only, and then for medical institutions or establishments. The idea was that it was a documentary film and that it could be beneficial for women, also young women. But then a fuss was kicked up about this matter, and subsequently another Helga arrived. I do not know whether the hon. member knows that there were two Helga&#x2019;s. The second Helga was the revised edition. It was given precisely the same certificate, and in this case an appeal was then made to the Minister. The Minister upheld the appeal, but he laid down these provisions; It was once again a B Certificate, and in this case it was for separate audiences, women on the one hand above the age of 18, and men over the age of 21, and then Whites only. As far as Jannie Totsiens was concerned, I hope the hon. member saw the film. There an enlarged Board was involved, because it was an exceptionally interesting film, a film with depth, which actually gave one food for thought afterwards. It actually dealt with the behaviour of people who were not normal.</p>

<p>Yes, you might well say like the United Party, but perhaps not all of them; those of them who listen carefully to-day will not be that way after this. This film was unanimously allocated a B Certificate by an enlarged Board and the certificate specified no persons 4 to 16. Again there was an appeal and the Minister granted an A Certificate. An A Certificate means that everyone can see the film. Very well, we can agree with this, or we can differ.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is not mentioned here. I take it that if there were cuts, there were very few. But I can mention this to you, that if one views the film with a scientific eye and perhaps by virtue of the fact that you have had experience in the background of people who are not normal, then it is a film which will not affect the very young child so badly, except for the shock scenes here and there. I think it was a very good decision on the part of the Board to consider this aspect, but it was decided that it should be otherwise. I just want to mention in passing at the end that the film Helga, which the hon. member discussed in the beginning, was not a documentary picture. To an extent Helga was a documentary, but Helga was to a large extent, if one looked at the rest of the performance, at the other scenes which were filmed, that it was also merely cheap sex for sale.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Then you should not have presented it at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If we refuse to present everything which is sex for sale then I wonder what will happen in this House. We are already allowing a little bit too much of that. The hon, member wants us to allow everything. He states that we must not allow pornography, but he did not define pornography to me.</p>

<p>I come then to the hon. member for Houghton, who also had a lot to say against censorship, a word we must get away from. This Board does not undertake censorship; it controls and selects, and in addition there are always appeals. It is not merely a line with which you can delete, nor is this the case with publications because there, on the other hand, you have the courts. We talk of censorship, but censorship is something final. In any case, the hon. member had a lot to say against censorship again, and in particular she had a lot to say about Bantu who according to the classification of pictures as far as the age aspect is concerned, are sometimes only able to go to see pictures which children under 12 can see. [Interjection.] In other words, they are being discriminated against. Very well, that is correct; there is discrimination, but this is being done with a reason. Nevertheless I think the hon. member is way off the mark in more than one respect, because scores of Bantu to-day who are already sophisticated go and see these films. Our problem, and the problem of the Board is simply this. There are films which you cannot approve for the more primitive Bantu, and if you say that <span class="col_3467-3468" refersTo="page_0288"/>Bantu are permitted, you cannot prevent the primitive Bantu from seeing them, and that is the drawback here. We cannot then discriminate between the more sophisticated Bantu and the primitive Bantu who could be very adversely affected by such a film, more so than the Bantu who have already been educated and who can distinguish between what will have a bad influence and what will not have a bad influence.</p>

<p>I then come to the hon. member for Orange Grove, who has just returned. Tht hon. member of course spoke about the relaxation of control. He wants to an increasing extent to relax everything. I do not know what the hon. members want to see, but if they had seen some of the stuff they did not see, I think most of them would agree that we were better off without it. The hon. member mentioned a lot of figures which I do not want to dispute. He spoke about Virginia Woolf and the 13,0 other publications which have been banned, and he also had a lot to say about the Act. But we are not really discussing the Act here to-day. Perhaps I shall return to that. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister, who has replied to questions raised on this side of the House, will understand if I do not follow on him, but I would like to refer briefly to the hon. the Minister in regard to the reply he gave to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in connection with South Africans travelling overseas on passports. I want briefly to tell him the experience of a member of this House just a year ago on a ship approaching Penang. When the passengers were told that if they wished to apply for permission to disembark, they would have to make application, my friend in this House decided it was no good even trying. He and his wife did not try but they were called forward and they were asked for their passports by the passport authorities at Penang and were issued with notices of refusal of entry. This is the sort of thing the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was referring to. This is what is happening to South African citizens overseas with our passports. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout had a perfectly good case, and I commend to the Minister that he thinks again of what was said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, especially in regard to the treatment of South African citizens travelling overseas on our passports.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Witbank raised the question of the Public Service salaries and conditions, and he said that we were being irresponsible when we asked for better pay and conditions for civil servants. The Minister alluded to this in his reply, but I want to take the question of the Public Service a little further now. I want to deal with the problems which beset the Public Service to-day, problems which this Minister will have to solve and solve soon if we are not going to have a complete and utter breakdown of the Public Service in South Africa as we know it to-day. The primary problem is a shortage of adequately trained manpower. That is the problem to-day, but I want to ask the Minister whether he has thought what that problem will be like in four or five years&#x2019; time if he does not solve it now. I will go further a little later, but I want to start by quoting from a report which appeared in the Natal Witness of 14th August, 1970, under the heading &#x201C;Bright Young Men Shortage. Warning to Public Service&#x201D;. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because of the manpower shortage not enough young public servants with above-average ability were available to take over when to-day&#x2019;s top officials retire in a few years&#x2019; time.</block>

<p>This statement was made by none other than the Secretary of the Public Service Commission, Mr. H. G. van Zyl, and what Mr. Van Zvl has said here is perfectly true and correct. There was a time when men of above average ability entered the Public Service because they saw a future in it. I am talking about the &#x2019;thirties and even the early &#x2019;forties, but that is not happening any more, and I will produce figures to show it. There are very few talented people to follow those men who are now at the top and hold the top positions in the Public Service. This Government has had a respite of five years since it increased the retirement age from 60 to 65 years, but this was a stop-gap measure. Those civil servants who have given the best years of their lives, those people to whom to-day I pay tribute for keeping the civil service going, are now reaching the stage where they have to go on pension. They are moving out, and behind those people there is this vast vacuum. This is the problem the Minister is facing to-day and he cannot put off this question any longer. Unfortunately he has just inherited this Department and it is a problem he has inherited, but he will have to do something about it soon because we find that the Public Service cannot retain officers of any experience.</p>

<p>Because he cannot retain officers with experience it must detrimentally affect the work performance in the Public Service; in other words, there must be a falling-off in efficiency to the point where even we in this House must now have doubts as to whether the money which we vote for the various departments can be adequately handled, let alone whether the staff of the various departments can handle the stores and equipment and other things of which they have control.</p>

<p>Sir, this position is serious and I am sure the Minister realizes it. The staff position is critical. We find that in the Department of Labour, out of a total of 1,853 posts, only 1,100 are filled with permanent staff. In that same department, out of 403 administrative assistants only 240, a little over 50 per cent, have had more than two years service. This <span class="col_3469-3470" refersTo="page_0289"/>is the position in that department and it is not the only department in that position. The Department of Public Works has 138 professional posts for architects, quantity surveyors and engineers, and only 75 of the 138 posts or a little over 50 per cent are suitably filled. The Department of Inland Revenue during 1968 had new appointments in the administrative assistants group totalling 611, but it lost through resignations 711 personnel in that same year. The Public Service as a whole in the two years ended 31st March of this year (the latest figures I have been able to get,) ended up with a net loss in the clerical division of 649 units. There is 649 less staff, notwithstanding the increasing work.</p>

<p>What are the reasons for this situation&#x003F; Sir, I do not know whether I can have the attention of the hon. the Minister. I do feel that it might be a little bit better if the hon. the Minister was listening to me. Perhaps he might do me the courtesy of listening when I discuss his Vote here. I see that I cannot expect that sort of courtesy from the hon. the Minister, so I might as well continue. Generally, Sir, there is dissatisfaction in the Service, not only about salaries but also about the different rates which are applied. I want to mention one here, the grade of health inspector. In the technical division of the Service you have two grades of health inspector: you have the grade of senior health inspector and chief health inspector on the respective salary scales of R3,600 X R150 X R4,200 and R4,200 &#x00D7; R150 &#x00D7; R4,800. But, Sir, in the administrative and professional divisions of the Service that scales are combined into one. When a man reaches the salary notch of R4,200, he does not have to wait for promotion to chief health inspector, for example, before he receives his next increment. Sir, this is the sort of thing which is causing dissatisfaction. There is also dissatisfaction with the salary scales generally, and the gap between the salaries paid in the Civil Service and by the public sector is too great. As I have said, a chief health inspector in the Civil Service receives a maximum salary of R4,800. In the South African Railways that same man with the same qualifications, holding the same job, goes to R6,900; in the Durban Municipality he would go to R6,540: in the Newcastle Municipality, a small local authority, he would go to R7,200</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>In the Ladysmith Municipality, an even smaller local authority, he would go to R6,200 compared with the maximum of R4,800 in the Public Service. This is why we cannot keep men in the Public Service. The increases which were granted in April of last year had no effect; they did not stem the outflow of officials from departments, and as far as the latest increases which have been announced, are concerned, doubts have already been expressed by the Public Servants&#x2019; Association as to whether they would be adequate to stop this outflow.</p>

<p>Sir, there are other questions also. Primarily I think the hon. the Minister must ask himself whether the Public Service Commission is really serving its intended purpose; is it in touch with conditions and with reality&#x003F; Sir, only the Minister can really answer this, but I want him to consider certain things with regard to the Public Service Commission, and the first one is one of the things which, I believe, has caused a lot of dissatisfaction within the Public Service. I refer to the increase in the political activities of members of the Public Service. Another thing which is a cause of dissatisfaction is the number of political appointments within the Public Service. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I was replying a moment ago to the hon. member for Orange Grove. The hon. member raised quite a number of matters here. Because time does not allow, I cannot go into all these matters. I can just tell him, since he advocated greater freedom, that he is not alone. There is a school of thought in the country which would agree with him; in fact, there is always such a school of thought. But the question of how much freedom should be allowed, is a matter which is very difficult to determine, and if he is not specific, it is difficult for me to know precisely what he has in mind. But since the hon. member made the deduction that sex crimes have decreased in Denmark after pornography was allowed there, I want to tell him that this is an in correct deduction. It is not based on a scientifically grounded investigation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Very well then. That is more or less the same argument. I want to point out that sex crimes in Denmark have decreased as a result of legislation which was passed after pornography was allowed. The age of consent was decreased from 16 <span class="col_3471-3472" refersTo="page_0290"/>to 14 years, and if the woman agrees, then it is no longer a crime, and in the same way the possession of pornography was no longer a crime. Actions which were previously sex crimes have been reduced to a large extent as a result of new legislation. I am simply mentioning this.</p>

<p>I also think that the hon. member should not be concerned about the fact that the works of good writers are being banned. It is in truth the spirit which prevails in any period which determines what is good and what is not good, what is decent and what is indecent. The hon. member will recall that in Mother England, which was so democratic, Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover was for many years banned by legislation before it was eventually allowed. The hon. member referred here to Caliculus &#x2026;</p>

<p>No.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then I misunderstood him. If he spoke about Caliculus then I just want to say to him that that writers works were widely read in the time when the Roman Empire was beginning to decline. The same could easily apply in this case as well. Sir, I have now furnished the hon. member with a reply, as well as I am able. The hon. member for Prinshof has already replied to him in respect of &#x201C;The Gay Deceivers&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Lady of Monza&#x201D;. I have nothing more to add to that, except just to say the following: I must express my disapproval of film magrates who invite Parliamentarians and others to private exhibitions of film with the purpose of calling on their assistance to agitate against the decisions of statutory bodies in the country. This is a matter in regard to which, in my opinion, steps ought to be taken. We must protect those in the film industry who act lawfully and who show decent films; we have a duty towards them, I am merely mentioning this; I do not want to say anything more about it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof made a very good suggestion here in regard to cuts. In a certain sense I can agree with him that one does not want to cut a film in such a way that one subsequently has 14 or 15 cuts, with the result that the continuity and the thread of the story is lost as a result. Even in this short time I have been dealing with the Board, I am also in a position where I can exercise criticism and can try to be Constructive. Sir, we can differ with them on the age limits; we can do so as long as we do not dispute the high-principled norms which this Board applies. We shall give thorough consideration to what the hon. member for Prinshof said here about theatres for adults and the question of cuts. I am quite certain that the Publications Board will take this into account, because inevitably one moves, without realizing it, slowly with the times. You must simply ensure that you do not allow yourself to be carried along against your own will. You must try to retain your own identity and your own sense of values.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Carletonville discussed the matter of a Press tribunal. I think what the hon. member had in mind was far stricter control over the Press. Hon. members know what the position at this stage is. It is that newspapers and magazines which are members of the Press union are not subject to control by the Board. They can appeal, but they are not under the control of the Board. If any hon. member finds that any other magazine is pornographic, or should not be allowed, then he can submit it to the Board, and since the end of last year, he need not even pay for that, previously he had to pay R2 to do so. Only printers and publishers and book-sellers have to pay this fee. The Board can then decide whether such material, whatever it may be, should be banned. If a monthly journal or a book is banned, then an appeal can be made to the courts. As far as the Press is concerned, the Press is in fact free. As far as I am concerned the freedom of the Press is something which is precious. The Press has a long tradition of freedom. Sir, these are not merely words I am using here, it is also the view of this side of the House that the freedom of the Press is something precious, but then that freedom must be utilized with great sense of responsibility. The freedom of the Press is something which any Government in the democratic western world must try to preserve to the best of its ability. But, Sir, the pen is always mightier than the sword, and if the freedom of the Press is abused then it is extremely dangerous. At this stage the Press Union and its members are in fact their own court. They have the Press Reference Board as their own body to which complaints can be referred. Sir, this council decided unanimously in 1963 or 1962, that there should be some or other form of control over the Press. The Press Union, against the findings of the then Press Commission, was then given the right to proceed to keeps its own house in order. I get the impression that the public either do not know enough about this or else have not been educated sufficiently in this regard. If any member of the public is dissatisfied with what appears in the Press, then he can appeal to the Press Reference Board, provided the newspaper in question is a member of the Press Union. At this stage I just want to inform you that there is no idea of interfering with the Press, but the Press must keep its own house in order. Sir, the Press has a very fine code which provides <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">News reports must be free of any glossing over, distorted presentation or emphasis which leads to the provisions of clause so and so being contravened; placards must not be exaggerated and must be a fair reflection of the news report or articles to which they <span class="col_3473-3474" refersTo="page_0291"/>refer. Exaggeration in the reporting and presentation of sexual matters ought to be avoided, whether this concerns reporting, court cases or anything else for that matter. The use of indecent, sensual and such undesirable material in general ought to be avoided.</block>

<p>Sir, I should like to say this to the Press: You are people who are as responsible as we are; you have a long tradition; it is admitted that you occupy a special position in our society, a position of authority, a position of influence. I want to ask you whether you have ensured that your house has always been in order in the past&#x003F; One sometimes receive requests of this nature which we cannot at this stage accede to, although the hon. member is perhaps right in more than one respect.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to make a brief statement in connection with the increase in party politics in the Public Service. I regard this as an extremely undesirable phenomenon. I want to express the opinion that it is basically unsound to allow party politics in the Public Service, and because this is so, I want to make a special point of avoiding party politics in my speech. The reason is that I want to address a very serious appeal to the hon. the Minister, and I do not want to chase up any political hares. We know, of course, what these cases were. Reference was made to those cases in this House. Questions in this regard were put to hon. Ministers and they replied to them. I do not have the time to go into those cases. I want to come to the principle without going into details.</p>

<p>Let us, in the first place, see what the Public Service Act, Act No. 54 of 1957, provides. This Act was passed during the r&#x00E9;gime of the present Government, and therefore one has to accept that the principles contained in that Act meet with the approval of the Government. Section 17 of the Act provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that any officer shall be guilty of misconduct if he becomes a member of any political organization or takes active part in political matters. It is in fact true that the Act gives the Minister a wide discretion. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the principle of participation in politics by a civil servant is undesirable and a punishable irregularity. My objection is that it is being condoned, that it is being overlooked and that it is increasing. I am not concerned about the odd cases. What does concern me is the watering down of the principle. There is a kind of permissiveness with regard to this matter. I am concerned that the watering down of the principle may lead to its total rejection.</p>

<p>But let us leave aside the discrepancies between the Act and what happens in practice. Let us rather consider the reason for the original prohibition, the principles involved in the matter and the consequences of the rejection of those principles. In the first place, there are very good reasons for the special confidence which has to be created between the public and the Public Service. The public believes that the Public Service occupies a very special position. They believe in the sincerity and in the impartiality of the Public Service. The Public Service must be like Ceasar&#x2019;s wife &#x2014;not only beyond suspicion, but must be seen to be beyond suspicion.</p>

<p>If a civil servant is allowed to participate in politics, no matter how lofty his motives may be, it may seem to the public that he is in fact partial in his dealings with the public. It is not a question of whether he is partial or not partial. The question is that he must appear impartial. This confidence he must create.</p>

<p>In order to maintain these principles there is a whole series of rules which is generally accepted in our democratic traditions. The first of these is that the civil servant must avoid participation in public politics. A second is that when he intends to stand as a candidate in an election he first has to resign from his position in the Public Service and then stand as a candidate. Another principle is that an officer must accept no posts which is in conflict with his duties in the Public Service. The fourth is that he may accept no directorships in businesses which are in conflict with the interests of his Department or in which he may gain personal advantages because of his special knowledge or influence. Another rule is that the civil servant may not use confidential information obtained by him from official sources. All these things are very important. When the civil servant accepts these principles, he earns special recognition and privileges. I want to present this virtually as a kind of social contract consisting of the civil servant on the one hand and the public on the other hand. The counterpart in this social contract is that the officer enjoys special recognition and confidence on that account.</p>

<p>For example, he is not regarded as legally liable for what he does in the execution of his official duties, and where he may possibly fail to execute his official duties, he is not regarded as being legally liable for that; he is not subjected to public censure. If he does perhaps make a mistake and the mistake comes to the attention of the public, the attack will be launched at his Minister, who is a political figure, and not at him personally. The most important things is that he enjoys security of office, especially when a change in Government takes place. In that case his office is secured because he has been impartial and has not participated in party politics. In that case the new Government will maintain him in his post.</p>

<from><span class="col_3475-3476" refersTo="page_0292"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>But there are, nevertheless, principles in South Africa. If we do not keep to these principles, there will be certain consequences. There will, of course, be a loss of confidence in the Public Service and there will be a loss of confidence within the Public Service itself. If any officer may nail a political banner to his office door, then, when preference is given to him or when it seems as though preference is given to him, as regards promotion, etc., the other civil servants will be inclined to think that preference is being given to him on that account. Therefore, there will be a competition in the political field. As regards his dealings with the public, there will be the same dangers, and these must be avoided. I feel that very important principles are at stake, and I have learned with some concern of a likelihood that the Cabinet is going to give consideration to reconsidering the entire principle of participation by a civil servant in party politics. This virtually sounds as though a synod has been summoned to meet to reconsider whether sin may not, after all, be something good. To me this sounds unnecessary. The principles have been laid down very clearly and the authorities, whose books are all in the library, are all opposed to any weakening of this principle I am discussing.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to a former Minister, the late Mr. Eric Louw. When he was Minister of Foreign Affairs he referred to this principle at times, i.e. he referred his civil servants to the old classical type of civil servant from whom we inherited this important principle. He said the motto of the old classical civil servant was: &#x201C;To treat all governments with equal loyalty and with equal contempt.&#x201D; He said this somewhat cynically. but the message is perfectly clear. &#x201C;To treat all governments with equal loyalty and with equal contempt&#x201D; means, of course, that they stand aloof from party politics, from the government concerned, but that they will always offer their complete loyalty to the government.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in connection with the appeal which the hon. member for Von Brandis has just made, I am sorry but I should like to make exactly the opposite request to the hon. the Minister. My request is that public servants be allowed to participate in party politics after working hours. I personally will also be pleased if the members of the various services can be included in such a concession. The position is that the officials, as we know them in South Africa to-day, each have a particular disposition towards the different parties. After all, they all belong to a party, whether they participate actively in party politics or not. They all vote for a candidate who is a representative of a particular party. It would now appear to me that if this person who is entitled to vote and who can also make his will and his attitude felt cannot participate in politics after hours, it is a form of hypocrisy. In connection with the question of candidates, I can only say that a man who is prepared to make himself available as a candidate, should rather resign after he has been officially nominated as a candidate. I do not think he should resign when he only intends to become a candidate, as the hon. member for Von Brandis said. I want to say that the public have confidence in the objectivity of public servants and that they believe that the public servant who is a member of a particular party will not act in a way which will prejudice a member of the public who is a member of another party.</p>

<p>To-day I just want to say a few words in connection with the Press. One of the greatest assets of any community is its Press, provided its Press is free and responsible. A free Press is of great importance for the existence and survival of democracy. The task of a Press is not only to enlighten the community and to supply information. Often the Press is also the conscience of the people. The task of the Press is to encourage the people and to inspire them to action, but also to criticize and to reprimand the leaders of the people when they are wrong. The Press plays a powerful role and, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, the pen is mightier than the sword. Today this truth is more generally applicable and has more significance than in years gone by. In South Africa we have Press freedom, but this is in fact a relative concept. Just like the freedom of the citizen, the freedom of the Press does not mean licence. The freedom of the Press is only one of the interest of the community which must be weighed up against the other interests of the community such as state security, public morals, and so forth. In South Africa it is not necessary to obtain prior approval for the publication of any article, except in so far as it concerns the publication of certain articles which are prohibited by the authorities. The general principal in South Africa is that the Press is free.</p>

<p>In respect of politics, the Press wields great power. It decides what is important and also what is necessary for the people to know. It creates the images of persons and especially the images of politicians. It also creates the images of political parties, and what is also important, it creates the image of South Africa.</p>

<p>Now, I feel that the English language Press has not carried its task in a responsible way, especially not in the last-mentioned case. Financially, the English-language Press is a powerful organization. It is able to do its news coverage widely and well. As a result of this good news coverage, many Afrikaners also read the English-language Press. In respect of politics, the English-language Press employes the best propagandists rather than reporters. It is a fact that the political thought and orientation of the English-language Press is extremely liberal, in contrast with which the people of South Africa are very conservative.</p>

<p><span class="col_3477-3478" refersTo="page_0293"/>The English-language Press and the South African people are poles apart in South Africa. It is this liberalism which the English-language Press wants to establish in South Africa. We find that the English-language Press has to an increasing extent been making the lie its servant and misrepresentation is ally.</p>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>The case of the hon. member for Sea Point is an example.</p>

<p>In its task, the English-language Press has certain aids and certain henchmen. Its aids are smear techniques and character assassination. Its henchman is the United Party. Once the English-language Press has achieved its goal, it will kick the United Party out of its nest. There are certain persons, however, whom it will not kick out of its nest, certain persons who are also sitting in the United Party.</p>

<p>It is important to note that by its actions in South Africa in general, the English-language Press has undermined its own credibility. If I may mention certain examples, I should like to refer to the case which was mentioned this afternoon by the hon. member for Sea Point. The hon. member for Sea Point is less liberal than the Progressive candidate who opposed him in that constituency. I can mention further examples about reports which appeared in the <i>Argus</i> and the <i>Star</i> about the so-called action of the hon. the Minister of Planning when he insisted on being served in Afrikaans. A slant was given to the correction which was made, when the Press said that he had said that he was not guilty of an &#x201C;Abraham-type&#x201D; of incident. This was done to create the impression that there was a clash, a difference between the action of the Minister and that of the Commissioner-General.</p>

<p>We recently had a very important example of misrepresentation in the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i> The speech made by the hon. member for Brakpan in which he said that the 12 public holidays should not be abolished, but should for practical reasons be added to the annual leave of the ordinary worker, was interpreted by the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> in a leading article as though the hon. member for Brakpan had said that public holidays should simply be abolished summarily. The small newspaper of Brakpan, <i>The Brakpan Herald,</i> elaborated upon this lie.</p>

<p>A week ago, with the assistance of Dr. Van Niekerk of Wits, the <i>Sunday Times</i> made a base attack on the judiciary of South Africa which covered six columns and was printed in heavy black type. Last week they corrected the matter and apologized in a small singlecolumn report. The position is that these people have no respect for truth or dignity.</p>

<p>But the question is what we should do about it. The answer is simply that the public here in South Africa must realize that in the English-language Press in South Africa they have an organization whose word they cannot accept, which they cannot believe and must take with a pinch of salt. But we on this side of the House say that we prefer the lies of Joel Mervis to a Joel Mervis who has become silent, or the misrepresentations of the Argus group of newspapers to an Argus group of newspapers which no longer wants to make any representation as a result of Press censorship. We prefer the poison pen of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> to a <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> whose pen has dried up as a result of action by the authorities. We are in favour of the freedom of the Press, but while we affirm this and believe that we shall always have Press freedom in South Africa and will fight for it, we also want to say to the people of South Africa, &#x201C;Beware, those people are our enemies&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if ever we heard a one-sided story coming from the hon. member for Pretoria (Central), we have heard it this afternoon. The sins are on the one side and everything on the other side is pure and as white as the driven snow. But I must agree with him when he says that the people of South Africa are conservative by nature. I am glad to see that, when he referred to the Public Service, he referred to a conversatism which is inherent in our South African people.</p>

<p>The Public Service to date has been one which has served South Africa truly and faithfully without fear or favour and to the best of its ability. In particular I would like to refer to the Police who have served this country well and who have been the first line of defence ever since the days of Union. The Public Service Commission consists of five worthy gentlemen who have been appointed by virtue of their knowledge and experience in the Public Service. They have very creditable characteristics. But I regret to say that there is not a single policeman on that commission. Here I should like to inform the Committee that, as long as I was in the Police, it was a bone of contention that we in the Police were treated as the Cinderella of the Government Departments because we had no representation on the Public Service Commission. Our duties are not the same as those of the ordinary public servant. We are not bound by the clock or the five-day week, nor by weather; the crooks do not knock off at 5 o&#x2019;clock when everybody else knocks off; that is when they start.</p>

<p>My point, Mr. Chairman, is that the time has <span class="col_3479-3480" refersTo="page_0294"/>come that the Police should be given representation on the Public Service Commission or else be entirely divorced from that commission. I ask this on account of the particular nature of the duties of the Police and service conditions which cannot be equated with those of clerks in the Public Service. No doubt there are other hon. members who can make representations in this regard for the Defence Force and for the teaching profession; I shall confine myself to the Police. The Police, as I have said, feel that the time is now ripe that they should either have representation on the Public Service Commission or else be divorced from it entirely. The members of the Public Service Commission have no intimate knowledge of the conditions of policemen&#x2019;s duties and equate the ranks of policemen with those of clerks in the Public Service. That cannot be done. It has been a bone of contention.</p>

<p>Yes, thanks for the salary increases granted to civil servants. Is that hon. member not also pleased about the salary increases of the civil servants&#x003F; It really seems to me as though the Opposition has objections to the fact that Government has increased the salaries of civil servants. If so, they must say so straight out. As far as I am concerned, I should like to thank the Government on their behalf of this amount which has been set aside for them. I can give the Government the assurance that it is welcomed from all sides. I have many civil servants in my constituency and for that reason I want to thank the Government for these increases.</p>

<p>Another step of the Government which we welcome, is the appointment of an inter-departmental committee to inquire into the training of civil servants. Such a step is a necessary one and is welcomed. We trust that this committee will come forward with important proposals. I also trust that in this way it will be possible to relieve the pressure of the manpower shortage. When one listens to what the Opposition has to say about the manpower shortage, one notices that they have a negative approach; they are constantly trying to exploit the situation. They have no positive proposals. Apart from talking about relieving the manpower shortage by means of the employment of non-Whites and by means of immigration, we may perhaps, with a little bit of imagination, look at other ways in which we may wipe out the manpower shortage. The Minister once said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indeed, if every white worker in the Republic were to raise his productivity, even if only fractionally, we would come close to wiping out the labour shortage reflected by the manpower survey conducted by my Department last year.</block>

<p>I want to say that we should show a little imagination in connection with this problem. In this regard I wonder whether we cannot launch a system which will encourage all of us to greater productivity. In South Africa we have a Water Year this year. Perhaps the Government and private sectors may also come forward with a similar idea with regard to increased production, for example, during the summer months we can put in a little more work by starting earlier in the mornings. This, of course, will have to go hand in hand with additional compensation and we shall have to give consideration to that. Then we should also ask ourselves whether all the computers we have in South Africa are being utilized to the fullest extent. Personally I do not think so. I am, therefore, of the opinion that through the better utilization of computers we shall also be able to make a contribution towards relieving our manpower shortage.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Reference has been made on both sides of the House to the position of the Public Service and to the salaries of public servants. In reply to that I firstly want to point out that the improvements made in the salaries of public servants in recent years amount to R107 million having been voted since 1968 towards the improvement of salaries of public servants, apart from the R69 million announced by the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech, which will come into effect on 1st January, 1971. Since this Government came into power the salaries of public servants were revised as follows: In 1953, in 1958, in 1963, in 1966, in 1968, in 1969 and now again as from 1st January, 1971. These increases certainly demonstrate the Government&#x2019;s sympathetic approach to the position of the public servants. As the Minister of Finance announced in his Budget speech, the R69 million now being voted for improvements includes improvements for non-white as well as white public servants. Teachers are also included in this. When his Vote is discussed, the Minister of National Education will give further details of the salary position of teachers.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton spoke about the salaries of non-white public servants. Non-white salaries were just recently consolidated. The percentage increase which non-Whites will receive from the recently announced improvements is exactly the same as that which the white public servants will receive, i.e. 10 per cent. She also referred to the salaries of non-white nurses. The position is that the increases on the lowest scale amount to as much as R240 per annum, and on the highest level R750 per annum from 1st April, 1970. In addition, the key scale has also been improved to such an extent that they will derive considerable benefits from the increases which come into effect as from January next year. Since 1st April, 1969, an amount of R22 million has been spent on the improvement of the salaries of non-white public servants. This includes the latest increase. The hon. member spoke of 273,000 non-Whites which were allegedly employed by the Public Service. Of course, that figure is not correct; the correct figure is 130,000. The fact that there are fewer non-Whites than Whites in the Public Service is of course related to the fact that, generally speaking the non-Whites are not qualified to such an extent that they can be appointed to the high, skilled positions and can so earn high salaries. This is a development which still has to take place in future.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) made a plea in regard to the efficiency of the Public Service. Of course, every effort is being made to train officers and to equip them better for their task. A committee of inquiry has just been appointed to place the training of officers on a sounder basis. I also want to point out that we are making a special recruiting effort abroad in order to recruit technical and professional officers. An important consideration in the latest salary increases is to retain people in the Service and to bring their salaries closer to those paid by other bodies.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to health inspectors. We must note that the salary structure of the Public Service takes into account the nature of the work and the responsibility attached to it. We therefore cannot base the salary structure of the Public Service on a few unrealistic examples.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi made a plea for the Police Force to be represented on the Public Service Commission. The position is that two years ago we appointed a representative of the Services to the Public Service Commission. The reason for this was that that representative would be better able to look after the interests of the Services. The request made by the hon. member has therefore already been met.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis and the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) made contrary pleas in regard to the question of the participation of public servants in politics. As far as public servants are concerned, I believe that one should adopt the attitude, firstly, that they are also citizens of the country in which they live and in which they render their services. The public servants are citizens of South Africa just as any other group in the country. In addition, we realize that they have enough common sense and enough sense of responsibility to maintain an efficient and sound Public Service by always placing their political convictions in the background in the performance <span class="col_3483-3484" refersTo="page_0296"/>of their duties. I think that, as far as this sense of responsibility is concerned, we can deem ourselves very fortunate in this country with the kind of public servant we have and the sense of responsibility of our public servants. I think we have very little reason to complain&#x2014;just to take the period in which we have been in power&#x2014;that officers in our time have abused their position on account of political considerations The fact of the matter is that public servants have for years been tacitly participating in political activities, in the sense that they belong to branches; in addition, they do canvassing during election times; they do this on both sides It is being done tacitly, and the officers have been doing it in a judicious way too, in the sense that they have avoided catching the public eye unnecessarily. But the Public Ser vants&#x2019; Association has now taken a resolution requesting the Government to give statutory recognition to this right which the Public Servants have been exercising tacitly. The Government is giving attention to this. I have referred this request by the Public Servants Association to the Public Service Advisory Council for its comment, but on account of the limited duration of this session it will not be possible for any recommendations made by Public Service Advisory Council, on which the Cabinet will still have to decide, to be embodied in legislation during this session. It any constructive proposals flow from this, as I personally expect will be the case, we shall be able to introduce a Bill in this regard during the next session of Parliament. But I should like to give the Committee the assurance that, irrespective of whatever form in which these political rights of the public servants may be cast, our public servants will continue to maintain the fine Public Service tradition of impartiality, as they have in fact done in the past.</p>

<p>Then I just want to make one further announcement before I sit down, and that is in connection with the Government Printing Works. The Goverment has decided that a new Government Printing Works will be erected in Pretoria, in the Koedoespoort-Silverton area, a Government Printing Works which will cover one million square feet and which will, according to the latest estimates, cost R13 million. The fact of the matter is that in recent years we have to an increasing extent been giving out work to private printing works. In the past year work to the amount of R4 million, which would normally have been done by the Government Printing Works, has been offered on tender to all other printing works. But despite the fact that such a large amount was spent, the volume of work done by the Government Printing Works increased by 37 per cent. Unfortunately the machines of the Government Printing Works are obsolete; the accommodation is very limited, and I may say, very much outdated as well. In view of this and of the increasing demands made on us by this developing country, the Government has thought fit to take the step of having a new Government Printing Works erected at Koedoespoort. I may just mention that at present new machinery to the value of R500,000 is being purchased for the Government Printing Works, and that we have sent officers overseas to acquaint themselves with this modern machinery. This will enable the Government Printing Works properly to meet the ever-increasing demands made on it.</p>

<p>This is all I have to say to hon. members for the time being.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Before I react to some of the matters raised by the hon. the Minister, might I first of all take this opportunity&#x2014;and I think it is appropriate on Settlers&#x2019; Day&#x2014;to refer to the two contributions which appear under the Interior Vote for the current year, the first being the contribution towards the costs of the Republic Festival of 1971 in an amount of R250,000, and secondly a further contribution of R750,000 to the costs of erection of the 1820 Settlers&#x2019; Monument. It is fortunate that one can on this day record the gratitude, I think, of the whole country for these contributions, and particularly the second one for the 1820 Settlers&#x2019; Monument, and to record also our gratitude for the fact that this monument will be useful for the development and the continuance of the traditions intoduced into this country by those ancestors of so many South Africans who arrived here in 1820.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has referred to the question of politics in the Public Service and I do not want to take the matter any further, because obviously no final decision has been taken. But there is one matter which I do believe is important and that is that there should be clarity, and clarity as soon as possible, because at present there are certain regulations which have to be conformed to by members of the Public Service, but there is a rather lax method by which those regulations are being applied. I trust that there will be no delay in reaching finality as far as the Government is concerned, so that this House and public servants will know what they can and cannot do in the realm of politics and that we will not have the position, as we have at present, where there are discretions and uncertainties and where one Minister may take up a certain attitude whereas another Minister may decide to adopt a different attitude.</p>

<p>I want to refer to one matter which is still unsatisfactory in so far as the Minister is concerned, and that is the handling and the issuing of passports. I refer in particular to the position in regard to Athol Fugard. I have studied what the hon. the Minister has said so far in reply to the debate, but one matter which is not yet clear to the people of South Africa is how it is that a playwright of the standard of Athol Fugard can enjoy in South Africa, State support for a play which he did <span class="col_3485-3486" refersTo="page_0297"/>in fact receive from the Transvaal Peforming Arts Council and the Cape Performing Arts Board, and then be refused a passport to attend a production of that very play in the U.S.A. The answers which have been given and the evasiveness which has arisen in regard to this matter, do not satisfy any section of opinion in South Africa, whether it is opinion which normally supports the Government or which normally does not. I believe that this position has to be clarified. We have it in reverse to the question of visas. How can the country feel confident that these matters are being promptly adjudicated upon when one can have a Minister saying in regard to a visa that new facts came to light&#x003F; When a decision is made as to whether a passort is to be granted or a visa refused, the full facts should be before the Minister, and if there is any doubt the person concerned should have the opportunity of appearing before a tribunal in camera in order to deal with those doubts which have been raised. Sir, this is not a matter which is impossible of solution.</p>

<p>But I want to leave that alone for the moment to deal with the question of the Public Service Commission as it exists at present and to make an appeal to the Minister please to do something in so far as the Public Service of South Africa is concerned. The Public Service Commission, as the Committee knows, came into being in terms of the South Africa Act. In 1912 it consisted of three commissioners. In 1970 there are five commissioners. But the extent of the Civil Service has changed out of all recognition in the intervening years. We have a Public Service now which is faced with great shortages of staff and technical and professional posts which cannot be filled. If one looks back only to 1920, one finds, in the report of the Public Service Commission, that 30 vacancies in the Public Service were advertised and 1,123 applications were forthcoming. And at that time there was a commission of three members. At present the Public Service is too large, too cumbersome and too complicated a machine to be dealt with under one commission. Changes have taken place. The S.A. Railways and Harbours now deals with its own establishment and salary scales, etc., and in terms of the Post Office re-adjustment Act of 1968 the Post Office Staff Board has now taken over from the Public Service Commission and deals with the 46,500 employees of the Post Office. In 1968 we had a further move in so far as Defence is concerned and the special requirements of the Defence Force have now led to the determination of the establishment and the organization of the Defence Force being removed from the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>I believe we have to go further. The time has come that the 18,000 to 19,000 employees on the staff establishment of the Defence Force should be under a Defence Force Staff Board. It is also time that the 33-34,000 odd persons who form part of our Police Force should be placed under a Police Staff Board. The teaching profession of South Africa, from the professional staff down to the teaching staff, should also be dealt with by their own particular staff board. I believe that modern scientific and technological progress in mechanization and in sophisticated and business methods, makes it necessary that there should be an evaluation within the sphere of activity of these specialized groups of public servants. I also believe that that time is overdue and that our Public Service Commission as such could well be utilized to see to the speeding up and the efficient management and control of what I might refer to as purely administrative aspects of the Public Service of South Africa. At the present moment there are so many anomalies that heads of the departments resort to all types of subterfuges. It is much easier now for a head of a department to upgrade a post and to call the person a senior assistant instead of an assistant to get a salary increase for that person than to have the salary of that post reviewed and amended. In other words, we are getting a top heavy echelon, in name only, of staff because it is a way of getting an increase for those efficient persons on the staff whom you would like to see advanced. I am sure the hon. the Minister of Finance knows that in his Department there is upgrading of posts because it is much easier to do that to get past the Public Service Commission than it is to get a review of the salary structure of a particular post. That type of practice is not good for the Public Service.</p>

<p>Let me for example refer to the number of Generals, and by that I mean Brigadiers and upwards, in the Defence Force. A lot of those ranks are unnecessary, but these posts were created in order to give appropriate remuneration to a person who holds a position of responsibility. It is not always necessary to increase the title in order to compensate a person for the work which he is doing, but that is what is being done at the present moment in various Departments of the Public Service. I think it is an unhealthy procedure.</p>

<p>I believe that the Public Service Commission has another statutory function. That is to give greater attention to departmental efficiency, the speeding up of mechanization and the introduction of modem business methods. These are not the days when the public will tolerate interminable delays in getting replies from the departments. The public expects efficiency in the Public Service and it will pay for efficiency, but it wants to know that efficiency is being maintained and it wants to know that a few are not carrying the load for the drones in the Public Service. I hope the hon. the Minister will give regard to this division of the responsibilities of the Public Service and to the establishment of particularly those three staff boards to which I have referred, namely the defence, the police and the teacher staff boards.</p>

<from><span class="col_3487-3488" refersTo="page_0298"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN TONDER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am glad the hon. member for Green Point is back in this House and I can assure him that the hon. members on his side of the House missed him during the few days he was away. They missed him because the debate on this Vote was without the usual lamentations which this hon. member brought back into it this afternoon. I shall not react to his whole speech, but just to a few points. The first is in respect of what he said in connection with the 1820 Settlers. I do not differ with him at all in that respect, and am in complete agreement.</p>

<p>The second matter which the hon. member raised was in connection with the political rights of public servants. I want to say to the hon. member that I also had experience of political rights when his party was in power. In those days the Nationalist in the Public Service had absolutely no rights. If he wanted to express his national feelings in any way, he was victimized to a tremendous extent. However, what is the position under this Government&#x003F; This Government was elected to govern the country and to do it well. In respect of political rights, and I am not talking about rights which are laid down by law, the public servant has complete freedom to do what he wants. Ex-public servants are sitting on that side of the House as well. For example, I am thinking of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). One does not land up in Parliament as a politician after resigning from the Public Service if one has not previously entered that field. I am thinking of the hon. member for Umlazi as well. While he was in the Public Service, he continued to exercise his political rights. No National Party Government victimized him. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana is sitting here as well. I take it that he was interested in politics all these years, otherwise he would not have landed up here.</p>

<p>However, I want to discuss another matter, namely the control of elections. I am in a position to discuss this, because in the past election I was one of the candidates who were almost voted out. They could not count me out, but I was nearly voted out. I should now like to draw the attention of this House to a few irregularities which I want to lay directly at the door of the United Party. I should like to tell this House what my experience was in my constituency. During the registration campaign last year, which ended on 31st October, both parties carried out registration. My party carried out a certain number and the United Party carried out a certain number. I kept a record of what my party did. I also kept a record of what the other parties did. To my dismay I established, after the supplementary voters&#x2019; roll had become available, that people were registered at certain addresses who should never have been registered there at all. People were registered on vacant plots where no houses had ever been built. They were not supporters of my party.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN TONDER</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately for him, the hon. the Opposition&#x2019;s candidate for Germiston (District) lives very close to me. At his address, seven voters were registered, while not more than three lived there at any stage. They were not people who had been registered there five or ten years ago so that one could say that they had moved. Those people had registered in Germiston (District) for the first time in October last year. I saw them. They were officials who helped the United Party in the election and who had for the sake of convenience been registered at that address in order to vote in that constituency. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to ensure that his Department keeps a close watch on these matters in future.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that I have the greatest respect for the way in which the officials of the Department of the Interior handled this election. I have absolutely no complaint to make against them. They performed their task excellently under difficult circumstances. However, I want to point out another matter to the hon. the Minister. On election day the United Party actually held demonstrations. At one of the large polling booths in my constituency they shouted slogans from 5 o&#x2019;clock like virtual lunatics and blocked the people so that they could not reach the polling booth. Mr. Chairman, these were United Party supporters. I would not have expected anything like this from educated people. They kept people away from the polling booths by blocking the booths with cars which they had brought from all over the country, because they were so keen to take Germiston (District). They can thank Heaven that the result in Germiston (District) was not in their favour, because then they would have been involved in the most comprehensive election court case ever. I think they are very pleased that they lost, because all their misdemeanours would otherwise have been revealed.</p>

<p>I take pride in having the most detailed statistics of my constituency. I know who lives in every street, who should live there, who votes there and who should vote there. I also know of everyone who voted. This large block of flats happened to be in one man&#x2019;s block of flats. I can tell hon. members that on polling day, 708 persons voted at that particular polling booth who did not live in that constituency. They had moved or were unknown. By means of my statistics, I have traced some of those votes in the meantime. But that is not the worst. While we were counting that night, their assistant agent at that polling booth, and old, shrewd and skilled politician, strutted about outside the hall where we were counting and boasted that he personally was responsible for the fact that more than 500 people had cast ghost votes. Sir, it is an absolute disgrace. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister that his officials <span class="col_3489-3490" refersTo="page_0299"/>should be on the look-out for these ghost votes, especially in marginal constituencies. I can assure him that in many constituencies that party on the other side is applying stratagems in order to lay their hands on those marginal constituencies. Since we as a democratic country, with a democratic government, want to see that justice is done and that the voters&#x2019; wishes should prevail, I want to ask the hon. the Minister that when polling officers are appointed in marginal constituencies to be on duty in the booths competent, trained and experienced people should be appointed, although I know it is impossible to do so throughout the country, and that we should not have the present position, where volunteers who have never worked at a polling booth before, offer their services. I think this is very important, not only in the interests of the governing party, but in the interests of the whole country, that nothing should go wrong in those constituencies, so that the wishes of the voters may be carried out.</p>

<p>United Party speakers complained about postal votes in this debate. I want to say to hon. members that the postal vote system is much better in comparison with this shameful attempt of the United Party to employ every means in order to regain one single seat.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is unfortunate that I have only ten minutes at my disposal, because the hon. member who has just sat down, raised so many matters to which I can reply. In the first place, he accused the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) and the hon. member for Umlazi of having been politically active while they were still employed in the Public Service. I want to say to the hon. member that he should make sure of his facts. He should try to prove that any of those hon. members participated actively in politics while they were still employed in the Public Service.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I challenge anyone to prove that I participated actively in politics while I was a member of the teaching profession. Sir. I should like to associate myself with the plea which was made by the hon. member for Green Point, and that is that education should be divorced from the Public Service Commission. We should see this plea in the light of the deep desire which exists among teachers to obtain professional status for the teaching profession eventually. This is an ideal towards which teachers have been striving for a considerable number of years. However, teachers have reached a stage where they realize that the mere establishment of a statutory body will not be adequate to restore the status of the teachers. Therefore it has become necessary for the teaching profession to be divorced from the control of the Public Service Commission. This is why I am now drawing the attention of the Minister of the Interior to the matter. The mere coming into being of a professional status will not be the magic wand which will remedy everything which is wrong in education to-day. As long as teachers have to work within the framework of the restrictions laid down by the Public Service Commission, we shall find that from time to time they will be forced to take part in salary campaigns. If there is one action on the part of teachers which causes damage to their profession, it is the fact that they become involved in public campaigns to increase their own salaries. I can give hon. members the assurance that the schools where teachers act militantly, are in fact the schools which produce the smallest number of prospective teachers.</p>

<p>The Teachers&#x2019; Associations agree that it is necessary to revise the post and salary structure. I have learnt that the Minister of National Education is to make an announcement in this regard, but I want to say at once that this is not going to help in any way, because as a result of the restrictions laid down by the Public Service Commission and as a result of the way in which formulae are being applied, one will be able to do nothing but patch work under the present system. What we need in South Africa, is the creation of a completely new post structure. As long as it remains restricted by the Public Service Commission, it cannot possibly come about. I shall explain why I am linking this matter to the ideal of a professional status. Hon. members might say there are engineers and architects to-day who are in the employment of the Public Service and who fall under the control of the Public Service Commission. The fact is that we cannot compare teaching to any other Public Service structures. It differs in essence from other professions. In this regard, I have in mind engineers and architects in particular. They have a measure of uniformity. As soon as a person qualifies, he is an engineer or an architect. What happens in the case of teaching&#x003F; In the case of teaching, we find that a person who has qualified, may start in one of six different categories of teachers. We cannot do away with this, because some people have completed post-graduate studies, while others have completed only a two or three-year diploma course. We cannot expect all of them o be fitted into the same scale on the same basis. Here the problem starts, because different categories must necessarily be created as far as commencing salaries are concerned. Because there is a difference in commencing salaries, that is eventually reflected in maximum salaries.</p>

<p>In addition to this, there are other problems with which the Public Service Commission has to contend. There is the question of promotion posts. I think it is a sound principle that the salary attaching to a post should be a reflection of the responsibility that post carries. We shall never be able to do away with the different gradings we have in various <span class="col_3491-3492" refersTo="page_0300"/>schools, because there is a difference in responsibility if one is principal of a high school which has 300 or 400 pupils and if one is principal of a high school which has 500 or 600 pupils. There is also a difference in responsibility when one comes to colleges. This also holds true of primary schools. These ratios must be determined. I can give hon. members the assurance that the Public Service Commission has my sympathy because a stage has now been reached where one cannot remove by means of salary increases the anomalies which have been created. In the second place, it is virtually impossible to create certain new posts which are necessary. I refer here to a specific case as an example. As a result of the salary changes announced in 1968, there is a system at present according to which more senior assistants may be appointed in high schools. In the past there was one senior assistant per subject. But as a result of this new adjustment, the position has been reached where certain schools and certain subjects have a senior assistant and suddenly three or four other teachers have also been promoted to senior assistants. The result is that the Teachers&#x2019; Associations desire the creation of a post such as head of a department. But one cannot fit in a post of head of a department. The gap between the various posts is such that no new post can be created. The end result is that even if increases are announced and adjustments are made, we shall always find a group of dissatisfied people. The gap between promotion posts, for example, is so small that it does not really serve as an inducement to certain teachers to accept the added responsibility. These are the problems with which we have to contend as a result of the fact that the present Government obstinately refuses to regard the teaching profession as something which can be independent of the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>My advice to the Teachers&#x2019; Associations in South Africa is that, although we have sympathy with their pleas concerning professional status for teachers, they will have to put first things first. We shall first have to separate the teaching profession from the Public Service Commission and then create a post structure which will not require patch work every time any change is made. This post structure will have the result that it will not be essential for teachers to participate in salary campaigns. We conduct debates here on manpower problems in South Africa and on shortages in certain fields. I know that there is a shortage of teachers in the teaching profession and there is adequate proof that in certain cases there is a decline in the standard of the people who enter the teaching profession.

<p>Mr. Chairman, on Friday I envisaged that I would give my views on the Publications Control Board later and I also mentioned that I was considering a plan to bring Parliament and the public outside into closer contact with the work of the Publications Control Board. To know means to understand better. The Publications Control Board was established seven years ago, after a heated debate in this House. Although there was difference of opinion on how the principle should be implemented, there was no disagreement on the principle itself. On 18th April, 1962, a Select Committee of this House adopted the following unanimous resolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in the opinion of the Committee legislation is desirable to prevent the dissemination or exhibition of indecent, obscene or undesirable publications, cinematograph films, entertainments and certain objects and to provide for other incidental matters.</block>

<p>In other words, both sides of this House agreed that we should have some form of control. The Publications Control Board has now been carrying out its functions for seven years, and I think it has rendered excellent services in these seven years. I pay tribute to them for that. As I said here last Friday, I do not think this Board is beyond reproach. There can be no doubt about the integrity of the persons who constitute the Board, about their academic abilities and about their sound judgment, as seen from the point of view of the general public. Furthermore, the Board has revealed a measure of flexibility which proves that they take note of what is going on in our changing world. They take note of what is good and what is bad. In fact, they must take note of a Western world which is sliding downwards as far as morality is concerned. I am sorry to have to say this, but it is true. To-day we have reached the situation where those who are in favour of control think they are letting through too much, while those not in favour of control are becoming increasingly militant. We have now reached the stage where there are two irreconcilable points of view Over the past few weeks, mainly the English Press has been conducting a continual campaign with the object of bringing the Publications Control Board under suspicion among the general public. The whole purpose of the campaign was to have any form of control abolished. The taps must therefore be opened.</p>

<p>If the hon. member is not a stranger in Jerusalem he will know, by reading the daily newspapers and the weekend Press and the opinions of persons such as Prof. Hugo of the University of South Africa, that there is a consensus of opinion which wants no compromise and no control. Let me read out. a few of these opinions. We have a certain gentleman, Mr. Owen Williams, who regularly writes in the weekend Press, but I shall not quote what he <span class="col_3493-3494" refersTo="page_0301"/>has been saying lately. Then there is Mr. Stanley Uys, who also declared under great headlines in the weekend Press: &#x201C;A very dull society in a backward country&#x201D;. In the <i>Cape Times</i> of a few days ago, we heard that &#x201C;Every man is his own censor&#x201D;. Four &#x201C;hardboiled journalists&#x201D;, as they called themselves, went to see different films, but could not agree in their views. This &#x201C;every man is his own censor&#x201D; reminds me of the days of the Wild West, when it was a case of &#x201C;every man is a law unto himself&#x201D;. Prof. Hugo said that there was no middle course; we must either have control or no control at all. I have here a file of letters which were written to the Publications Control Board, letters in which people expressed their appreciation and praise for the work of the Publications Control Board and asked for even more control. There are other people whom we can regard as experts in this field and whose opinions we can quote. Mr. Felix Barter, a film expert in London, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I suppose it is possible that over a period the depicting of casual sexual behaviour may affect the general moral climate. Teenagers may think that if this is the scene, then we must be with it.</block>

<p>In <i>Newsweek</i> of a short while ago, we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Almost everyone agrees that children are vulnerable to trauma in an exploded atmosphere of explicit image, language and behaviour.</block>

<p>On 15th September, 1969, the Pope said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Current immorality indicates the realm of man&#x2019;s self-degradation and promotes filthy fantasies and depraved, disgraceful thoughts, sometimes even wretched crimes.</block>

<p>We cannot simply disregard opinions of this nature. To me the best opinion is that of a young, brilliant scientist and politician, a man of sound judgment in this respect. I am referring to Dr. Jeremy Bray, who was a Parliamentary Secretary in the British Ministry of Technology under the Labour Government. He is a Baptist. Recently he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is surely wrong to identify what has been called the permissive society with a civilized society. Historically, permissive attitudes have been more associated with the decline than with the growth of civilization. I have voted for most of the recent social reforms and will do so again, but I am not sure that my libertarian friends know where they are going.</block>

<p>Here we have the two sides of the matter. We know what the attitude of the Afrikaans churches is. In yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Times</i> we read that the Church of England also welcomed the action taken by the Publications Control Board; in fact, the Board was encouraged to act even more strictly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Church urges the Publications Control Board to exercise the utmost vigilance at all times. The Synod also calls on the weekly Press to exercise more restraint and refrain from giving undue publicity to immoral and scandalous behaviour.</block>

<p>I think the truth perhaps lies between these two extremes. In fact, the Publications Control Board is not too enlightened or too conservative; it is sensible. Six of the persons who serve on the Board are professors in various fields. In my opinion, the Publications Control Board has enough intelligence and background to be able to make a sound judgment. It is not subject to any pressure either. When the Board makes a mistake, it will be prepared to admit it. In any case, decisions of the Board can be taken on appeal to the courts or, in the case of films, to the Minister. [Time expired.]</p>

<p> Mr. Chairman, I would like to take this very first opportunity, right at the beginning of the debate on my Vote, to react to certain statements made by the hon. member for South Coast during the censure debate. I would like the hon. member to hear what I have to say; I would not like to speak in his absence. Sir, subsequent to those statements made by the hon. member for South Coast, other leading spokesmen of the United Party also made certain statements, and I want to devote special attention to the statements made here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, whom I would also like to be here. Sir, it is necessary to deal with the statements made by these three hon. members in close association. The hon. member for South Coast put two questions to me and to the Government. He asked me whether the establishment of a Territorial Authority for Zululand was as he put it, something which nobody could stop. He also phrased his question differently and asked whether we had reached the point of no return there. He would like to know whether this Parliament can nullify the establishment of the Zululand Territorial Authority and whether Zululand could be brought back to the <i>status quo ante</i>&#x2014;as he put it. Secondly, the hon. member for South Coast asked me what was the point of no return where this Parliament could no longer step in with regard to this Territorial Authority in Zululand&#x003F; He <span class="col_3495-3496" refersTo="page_0302"/>asked, &#x201C;Is Parliament not supreme; cannot Parliament undo what you have done in Zululand&#x003F;&#x201D; The hon. member for South Coast, in his very typically tempestuous mood, gave a melodramatic description here of the dangers which he regarded as inherent in the new constitutional development in Zululand.</p>

<p>Yes, in respect of Zululand and greater Natal. The hon. member very clearly indicated that he was opposed to this political development in respect of the Zulu people and said that he would like to nullify or undo this, if possible. Sir, I wish to give the hon. member very clear replies to his questions. This matter of the constitutional development not only of Zululand but of all the Bantu nations in South Africa has a legal as well as an ethical or moral aspect, and may I say that the moral, ethical aspect is stronger than the legal one. Primarily it must be remembered that the Territorial Authority there exists in terms of a Government notice and of a Proclamation issued by the State President, and it is functioning there on the basis of the Bantu Authorities Act, 1952. Now, in a narrow legal sense this Parliament can take steps to have that proclamation repealed, and the Bantu Authorities Act of 1952 can also be repealed by this Parliament, legally speaking, and another Act can be substituted for it. This Parliament can even repeal the constitution of the Transkei and substitute another in its place with even less powers for the Transkei.</p>

I therefore very emphatically say to all and everyone, and particularly to the hon. member for South Coast, that this Government, my Ministry and my Departments have taken steps with regard to the political development of the Zulu nation and of all the other Bantu nations in South Africa which cannot be nullified by any Government whatsoever.</p>

I made an agreement with that hon. member that I would reply to him to-day under my Vote and I was doing so in his absence and I will, repeat what I said for his benefit if you, Sir, will allow me to do so. I said that this matter of the Territorial Authority of Zululand, as well as the constitutional position of all the other Bantu nations, including that of the Transkei, has an ethical as well as a legal aspect. I said, and I repeat, that legally this Parliament can take steps to have the Proclamation and the <i>Government Notice</i> repealed in respect of the Zulu nation, and I have said that this Parliament can also take steps to repeal the Transkei Constitution if it likes and to put another Act in its place, even one giving lesser powers to the Transkei than they have to-day. In other words, this Parliament is supreme and it can do that legally, but I said that this matter also has a moral aspect. I said that for moral and ethical reasons&#x2014;now the hon. member must listen to me because I am repeating all this for his benefit only. The hon. member for Zululand must now make it possible for me to repeat what I have to say to the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

For ethical reasons we will not ask this Parliament to do so although we have the legal right to do so. I will go further to say, and I will say very emphatically to everyone concerned, that this Government, my Ministry and the Departments have taken steps in regard to this matter of the political development of all the Bantu territories, especially in regard to this one in question, namely that of Zululand, which cannot be nullified by any Government except&#x2014;and I wish to stress this&#x2014;if such a Government is prepared to be reactionary and unethical and if it wishes to drag those Bantu <span class="col_3497-3498" refersTo="page_0303"/>nations back from their courses or their roads to their independent destinations.</p>

They realize that they will not be able to stop it. The hon. member for South Coast is one of the persons who realizes this very well. In view of all the protestations by the hon. member for South Coast, I want to know from him unequivocally whether he and his party, if they return to power in South Africa and in this House, will abolish the Territorial Authorities of the Zulus and of the other Bantu nations in South Africa.

<p>I want to refer now to what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, particularly during the Budget debate.

Opposition what they, and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast by name, have to say about these points. In the first place, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, and here I have his Hansard with me, that he and the United Party recognized the multi-national position in South Africa. I know the hon. member for Bezuidenhout recognizes and accepts it, but I say that the other hon. members on that side do not recognize and accept it. Later on today I want to come back to this point that was made by the hon. member. In the second place, the hon. member said that a position had to be created where people would be able to realize themselves without the one dominating the other. The hon. member very obviously meant that the one people should not dominate the other people. This was recorded very clearly in Hansard. In the third place, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that the United Party was, amongst other things, also in favour of large-scale political development in the Bantu homelands. We have now heard that the hon. member for South Coast wants to undo what has already been done in the homelands.</p>

The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that under their policy those Bantu territories could be taken further than provincial status until they were local politically autonomous units.

<p>I have no quarrel with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I laud his frankness, and I want to know whether the other hon. members on that side are saving the same thing. There are a number of principles, but we know what the most important principle of the Tomlinson Report is, i.e. separate Bantu homelands with a separate political development up to eventual independence. This is a basic principle of the Tomlinson Report. This is also the principle of <span class="col_3499-3500" refersTo="page_0304"/>this Government. As the hon. member for Bezuidenhout accepts the principles of the Tomlinson Report, he also accepts this principle. Now I want to ask the hon. member for South Coast very pointedly to tell us whether we have already gone too far with Zululand.

<p>*It gives me pleasure to be able to get under their skins this way, and I am not through yet by a long shot. The hon. member for South Coast and his party must now tell us unabiguously whether all of them are in favour of its being possible for the Bantu homelands to develop further politically than is the case with the provinces to-day, with more status, and with local autonomous status, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, and then, of course, further, in terms of the Tomlinson Report, to full independence. That is what we want to know from the Opposition. [Interjections.] Yes, wait a minute. The backbenchers can also speak in a moment; all they have to do, is to wait until I have finished. There is something I should like to know. The second statement which was made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and which I quoted, was that the one people should not dominate the other people. This is my question: Do the hon. member for South Coast, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Cadman and all the other members opposite also say this&#x003F; They say that under their policy of race federation with white leadership, the Whites will always have to be on top and the Bantu in a subordinate position. Do they also agree with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that, in a country where he accepts multi-nationality, the one people should not dominate the other&#x003F; But, of course, they do not accept multi-nationality. I shall prove this in a moment. I am asking the hon. member for South Coast this question: Would he, too, promote that large-scale political development to which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not setting up skittles here. I am hitting the hon. member&#x2019;s targets. I am asking the hon. member for South Coast whether he and his whole United Party agree that they accept all of the most important principles of the Tomlinson Report. I should also like to know from the hon. member for South Coast whether he also accepts that we have here in South Africa many peoples, various nations. This is what we want to know from the hon. member for South Coast, Sir, for the hon. member is a person who, in 1964, told me in this very Chamber that the Bantu man and the Bantu woman who entered the white area, were my co-citizens. At that stage I was still a Deputy Minister, and he said: &#x201C;They are the co-citizens of the Deputy Minister.&#x201D; I am asking him whether he still adheres to the view that the Bantu man and the Bantu woman are my co-citizens as members of one nation, whereas the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is saying that we have multi-nationality in South Africa. I want to know from the hon. member for South Coast whether, in referring to the point of no return with Bantu authorities, in referring to turning back from the realities, he wants to reverse this situation, if they shall come into power, in order to carry through the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2019;s ideas of a status higher than provincial status. He must tell us this.</p>

<p>Now I am also coming to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I understand that he cannot be here, and I am sorry about that. But there are many others here who are only too keen to take over his role, and they may as well reply, and so may the others who do not want to take over his role, such as the hon. member for Transkei. I know he is a modest member. He does not try to rival the Leader of the Opposition. But what I am going to expect him to do, is that he should at least reply to these questions. I want to know from the hon. Opposition, and from the Leader of the Opposition by name, how it reconciles these divergent views which are held by the hon. members for South Coast and Bezuidenhout and which I have just pointed out. But, in the second place. I also Want to know whether he wants to confirm that, if his party came into power, the Zululand Territorial Authority, as well as all the other territorial authorities, all of which have in actual fact reached a slightly more advanced stage of development than the Zululand Territorial Authority has, will be nullified. This is what I want to know from them. It is essential that they say this.</p>

<p>In the third place, I should like to go into the so-called challenge of the Leader of the Opposition which was issued here during the debate on the previous Budget. I quote (English Hansard, 1970, Col. 2055)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My challenge is that the Government shall accept that we are not economically <span class="col_3501-3502" refersTo="page_0305"/>strong enough to-day, nor I believe, ever likely to be, to develop the Bantu areas into sovereign independent states, each economically strong enough to support its black population as citizens of an independent nation state.</block>

<p>This is his challenge. I am going to deal with that challenge of his. Then I shall also, quite modestly, come forward merely with a request, not even with a challenge. I hope he will also reply to mine as I shall reply to his. Sir, basically I reject the entire basis of the challenge issued by the Leader of the Opposition. I reject that challenge <i>in toto.</i> I am now coming back to the details of that challenge. I appreciate that that hon. member cannot understand why I reject the challenge basically. For the sake of his comprehension I am going to deal with the matter in detail. On close examination there are, in particular, two aspects of that challenge which one should examine more closely.</p>

<p>Whereas the hon. the Leader referred to the economic position of the Republic, I want to say that we as a Republic are economically so strong and will in the future still become so much stronger that we shall be able to contribute our share as regards the development of the homelands to fully independent status. This I want to state very clearly. In the second place, I say, with reference to that challenge, that the Leader of the Opposition and all the other members who are echoing those sentiments, are totally wrong in saying that every homeland has to be economically strong enough to support its own population by itself. That is a wrong premise. No less a person than the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has already said that before now. No country in the world is so self-sufficient that it can only enter its independence once it has become completely self-sufficient economically. Let us compare this position with that of the three African countries or black states, which are situated nearest to us and which have become independent. I just want to do this very quickly. More detailed comparisons can be drawn.</p>

<p>I want to point out that the gross national income of each of Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland is smaller than that of the Transkei I think that the gross national income of Botswana and that of Swaziland is smaller than that of the Tswana homeland. I am not even referring to the Transkei. Secondly. I say that the gross domestic product of each of these three independent states is also Smaller than that of the Transkei. Thirdly, the 1968-&#x2019;69 Budget of each of those three independent countries is also Smaller than that of the Transkei, as expressed in terms of money. There is also a fourth criterion which we can use. The percentage of the population of the independent country of Lesotho working in the Republic, is roughly just as large as the percentage of the&#x2019; population of the Transkei working outside the Transkei. Now hon. members must tell me why my argumentation is wrong.</p>

<p>While I am referring to this matter, I want to come back to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and call attention to a major inconsistency between him and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, i.e. as regards this very point. Both of them discussed the question of the economic strength which a Bantu territory must demonstrate before it can become independent. Once again this is a major inconsistency in respect of our Bantu politics, and this is also an utter unreliability which must be attached to the Opposition&#x2019;s statements and policy. In that challenge of his, which I have just read out to the House, the Leader of the Opposition says that the economy has to be very strong before the Bantu territories can be granted independence. In his speech during the same debate the hon. members for Bezuidenhout levelled the reproach at us that we had not yet granted independence to the Transkei and other Bantu territories, whereas other states in Africa had gained independence although economically they were in a weaker position than was the case with our Bantu territories. In other words, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that none of our Bantu territories can be granted independence, as their economy is too weak. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, on the other hand, says that we could already have granted independence to those territories, in view of the fact that the economies of other countries which have already been granted independence, are weaker than those of our homelands.</p>

<p>Sir, whom must I believe&#x003F; Whom must the people believe&#x003F; That Opposition is blowing hot and cold to such an extent that its own members, especially its new members, really do not know whom they must believe. I would not be dumbfounded if my good old neighbour from Florida were still to come and ask Uncle M.C. whom to believe in this regard. I now ask hon. members whom of these two, i.e. the hon. the Leader of the Opposition or the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. is correct. The National Party says very clearly that the Bantu homelands can gain their political freedom before they are economically as strong as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition believes they have to be. In this regard the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is much closer to the National Party&#x2019;s views than the lion, the Leader of the Opposition is. However, this is not the only point in regard to which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is close to the National Party&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>No, he will not come again, [Interjections.] I am pleased to hear from that side of the House that one never <span class="col_3503-3504" refersTo="page_0306"/>knows whether the hon. member will not perhaps do so yet. I wonder whether they distrust him! The National Party will continue the political development of the homelands along with the general economic and agricultural development within those homelands and also along with the positive consolidation of the homeland territories. In this regard I want to call attention in particular to the establishment of the Economic Committee as a branch of the Bantu Affairs Commission. By this time this has already become common knowledge. This Economic Committee is a great help to me in regard to the general economic development of the homelands, not only in respect of the development of the agency work, but also in respect of investigations. In fact, this Committee assists in regard to all sorts of economic projects which must be undertaken, and it is very successfully being assisted by the Bureau for Economic Research and Bantu Development (BERBD), which has its headquarters with the Bantu Investment Corporation. There are members in this House who are also members of the Economic Committee. They can elaborate further on this matter.</p>

<p>Over the past two years I have already formed eight homeland governments with their own legislative assemblies, with their own executive committees, or call them cabinets, and with their own government departments in those particular homelands where previously there were only territorial authorities with quite limited powers and functions. I established these eight governments, not in order that they might sit there and become rigid and bleed themselves to death as governments, but in fact for the purpose of promoting the process of evolutionary political development on the road to their separate independent destinations. At the moment, therefore. there is in each of these Bantu territories in the Republic a representative and responsible government, which can in its own development be involved by us in our planning and with which we can negotiate on all sorts of matters relating to its own territory. But most important of all is the fact that in each of those Bantu territories there is at the moment a proper people&#x2019;s government which can lead its own people in the process of development in the future. Previously there was no such thing. Along with the governments of these peoples we are moving along the road ahead with internal development, with political development and with the consolidation work of the Bantu homelands. Before long what is being accomplished in this regard, will become increasingly apparent. As theoretically-minded foreign visitors have often asked me, hon. members, too, should kindly refrain from asking me what my timetable is. They should not come and ask me what the date, the day and the hour of every event is.</p>

<p>We are not introducing into the Bantu homelands the independence, in particular, but also the other developments, in a precipitate and rash manner. I want to remind hon. members of the fact that a little more than ten years ago it was also said that on 30th June, 1960, at 12 o&#x2019;clock midnight, that specific territory would become an independent people. We also know what happened in the country concerned when the former colonizing power withdrew from that country without ever having trained one single member of the native population to face their independence at midnight, 30th June, 1960. We know what happened there&#x2014;chaos, bloodshed, murder, disorder and even fragmentation of the country. This, too, may be what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other people who are in such a hurry, want to have here in our country, but we shall not do that. We are opposed to presenting itemized timetables to the country. We insist that the Bantu governments of the various Bantu peoples should themselves do all the preparatory work and design their future in conjunction with us. In other words, they will, as training, have to go through a political evolution on the road to their gaining independence. For that reason we do not give any date or hour down to the midnight hour. Every day, every moment, we are doing everything that is practicable and desirable. Then it must come when it is right.</p>

<p>We, in conjunction with them; this Parliament and they. The Transkeian government is definitely going to be granted even more responsibilities, even more functions<i>&#x2014;inter alia</i> as regards police, prisons and health services. The Departments concerned are at present carrying out the necessary investigations in this regard. They are definitely going to reach the top rung of the political ladder vet. And we are not going to leave them to their own devices, as was done elsewhere in Africa; we are going to help them. This holds good for each of the Bantu people in South Africa. Correspondents, spokesmen and journalists talk about these matters far too easily and too superficially. They should kindly not create the impression that they obtained their information from me, neither directly nor indirectly. The United Party, which have so much to say about the internal development of homelands, should also say whether they stand for development to the maximum, to the maximum political development, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout suggested and to which I referred. Otherwise they must say whether they want the political development of the Bantu homelands to be frozen in order to keep the Bantu in a subordinate position, as was suggested by the hon. member for South Coast. This is what we want to know from them.</p>

<p><span class="col_3505-3506" refersTo="page_0307"/>While we are referring to the inconsistency, the unreliability and the discord with the Leader of the Opposition and his party, I must also call attention to another caper in regard to multi-nationality. I pointed out a moment ago that in the course of the Budget debate the bon. member for Bezuidenhout had pointed out that he recognized the many peoples in South Africa. I appreciate his doing this; he is, at least, realistic. But the Leader of the Opposition, as well as some of the other members opposite, does not admit this. I am now going to furnish you with proof. As far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, as recently as in the past Budget debate he was still referring to the &#x201C;20 million society&#x201D; in South Africa. But better still, I want to remind you of their slogan at their Bloemfontein Congress a few years ago: &#x201C;One country, one nation, one loyalty.&#x201D; But if that is still not enough, I want to hurry on to something better. Let me read out to you what the Leader of the Opposition said in this House on 8th June, 1961. In column 7559, it was recorded as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hitherto we have still been inclined to speak of national unity with reference to the two white sections of the population only, but it is quite clear that unless steps are taken to create a common patriotism amongst all sections of the population&#x2014;it does not matter what their race is&#x2014;we shall never be able to achieve unity and nationhood in the true sense of the word.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Unity and nationhood in the true sense of the word,&#x201D; irrespective of race. And the following year, in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 24th April, 1962, the hon. member for Durban (North) examined the policy of separate development and contrasted it with the United Party&#x2019;s policy of race federation. At that time he said, amongst other things, the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The difference in approach stems from our belief that South Africa is a multiracial nation.</block>

<p>Now, ten years after that, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says that he accepts the multi-national situation of South Africa. I thank him for accepting it, and I pray that the others will do so, too. Perhaps they are doing this now, after ten years. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is honest, and we appreciate that. The others must do this, too; they must put a stop to their antics and ambiguity. Or is the party of the Leader of the Opposition, as far as multi-nationality as a principle is concerned, also adopting the National Party&#x2019;s standpoint and policy, as is being done in regard to so many matters&#x003F; In that case, they must tell us. We praise them and we laud them for having adopted the Republican standpoint of ours subsequent to our becoming a Republic; we shall also praise them if they were to do so in this respect. We are merely waiting for them to do so.</p>

<p>As regards the politically free homelands within the borders of our country, there are here in South Africa two realities which no other country could offer its emancipated, subordinate territories in Africa. We have two things here; they are an asset to us, and the National Party accepts them. In the first place, there is the situation of South Africa, as the country which is granting freedom, bordering on and surrounded by all the homelands which are gaining their freedom. None of the colonizing countries themselves had common borders with their African territories, which would have enabled them to assist such territories. We have common borders with and are surrounded by the homelands which can be granted independence under our policy. This fact is of great material value and benefit to both Whites and non-Whites, also of security value&#x2014;of greater security value than it is a danger to us, the danger with which hon. members opposite want to scare the country. The second characteristic is one which I have often mentioned, i.e. the interdependence, mutually between us as Whites and the peoples of the Bantu homelands. Let me mention a number of examples of this. There are others as well, but I am now going to confine myself to a few only, and I am not going to elaborate on them either. Hon. members are welcome to reflect upon them by themselves. We as a white state have already granted a great deal of assistance and will in future have to grant much more assistance once the homelands are independent, i.e. assistance in regard to professional, technical and academic manpower for the Bantu peoples in their homelands and also in regard to the establishment and maintenance of the public administration of each of those homelands. A moment ago I referred to the eight governments which we had established. Nearly 50 government departments are already in operation in respect of those eight governments, and a few are still to be added to each of them. By these means we are helping to maintain them. We have not withdrawn from them, as was done by the other powers of Africa, for we are here close to them and with them and for them.</p>

<p>Sir, in the third place, I shall mention the economic development within those homelands in respect of mines, in respect of commerce, in respect of industries, etc. I mention the marketing of their agricultural produce, with which we are helping them; I mention the fact that we are providing them with infrastructures in respect of such important matters as railways, freeways, post and telegraphs, radio service, water provision and numerous other matters which I could mention, all of them for the purpose of providing them with an infra-structure. We are assisting them directly in these respects. They are making use of our railway network, of our system of harbours and of our post office system. They are <span class="col_3507-3508" refersTo="page_0308"/>freely making use of these, thanks to our mutual assistance to them. Sir, I could mention to you what we are doing in respect of defence against aggression and, last but not least, what we have been doing over all these years and will still be doing in the form of funds or appropriations for their budgets in order to initiate their own development&#x2014;not disguised or false loans, which are called soft loans&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, these are but a few of the things which we can mention under this principle of interdependence and which have been flowing from us and will continue to flow to them, also when they are independent. And from their side to us, Sir&#x003F; This is an inter-dependence. We are also indebted to them for certain privileges; we also receive certain assistance from them. The homelands have already granted assistance, and that to the Whites of South Africa, and will always grant assistance in regard to the necessary, permitted labour in the white area and in regard to the marketing of many products which we can get from them. They are also helping us with food production and with the supply of raw materials for processing in our factories. They will also help us&#x2014;and of that I am more convinced than perhaps any other person, for I come into contact with them every day&#x2014;if it should ever be necessary, with a united resistance to communist infiltration if this should ever happen in South Africa, for we have already received their offers in this regard, which we need not broadcast.</p>

<p>Sir, I am telling you that the judicious implementation of this principle of inter-dependence or, if you want to give it a different name, the inter-dependent independence of each of these countries, implies unlimited security to all of us. That is why one expects the Opposition to act responsibly towards the Bantu homelands and not to try in every respect to belittle and disparage everything as much as possible.</p>

<p>Sir, how are the homeland territories going to become independent, when they eventually become independent&#x003F; [Interjections.] That famed member for Maitland may as well listen to this; it will do him good to listen. How are they going to become independent&#x003F; Sir, the question answers itself. How does any subordinate territory in the world become independent&#x003F; There are only two basic ways in which independence can be gained. The first is by means of revolt and revolution, and I am telling you, Sir, that not one single homeland of ours is aspiring after that and will ever want to become independent in the revolutionary manner.</p>

I come into contact with them in the homelands and with their fellow-nationals outside the homelands more often than any other politician in South Africa does. I come into contact with them every day, personally and impersonally, and I am telling you that there is not a single one of them who will ever dream of becoming independent in a revolutionary way.</p>

<p>As the hon. member behind me has rightly said, that is not necessary either, for all of them are very clearly aware that we are helping them in the second way, the best way, along the road leading to independence, i.e. in the evolutionary way, the development way. Yes, and that process is in progress, and because they know it is in progress, they are not interested in any other process and have every confidence in us. As they so often tell us from place to place where we go, &#x201C;Hold our hand on the dark road ahead.&#x201D;</p>

<p>When it comes to such an evolutionary gaining of independence of the Bantu homelands we know, or hon. members opposite ought to know, how they become independent. They become independent on a basis of mutual agreement. They become independent by way of a treaty which is concluded, and subsequently each of us who has *to do it, takes the necessary steps to create the constitutional instruments for that purpose. In those future relations, in that treaty, the two parties concerned, those who are gaining independence and we who are granting it, lay down all sorts of points of agreement and, amongst other things, these things which a moment ago I mentioned as being elements of interdependence plus other points which will, of course, still have to be added. Then hon. members want to know how and when they become independent, as though they do not know how the Transkeian Constitution came into being and how any other country which became independent, gained that independence.</p>

<p>But in terms of this policy of ours, i.e. that of gaining independence or of the multi-nationality of the Bantu territories, we should also look at the basic position in regard to labour. Labour is one of the most Important things, as I mentioned a moment ago, which we, white South Africa, will need as one of the means for inter-dependence, and in this respect there is a profound and fundamental difference between us and the Opposition. Especially over <span class="col_e1" refersTo="page_0309"/>Col. 3510: Line 41: Delete "not" <span class="col_3509-3510" refersTo="page_0310"/>the past week we have heard this time and again in the debates in progress here. Essentially it only amounts to this, i.e. that the Opposition&#x2019;s cry which they are raising here, and which is also being raised on their behalf by the people outside, is that the labour shortages in the white area should be met out of the ranks of the Bantu, and not only the lowest strata but especially the higher strata of the labour community. The hon. member for East London (City) was so frank as to admit this very candidly, and this was recorded in his Hansard. This is the object of their campaign, i.e. that the Bantu should be trained and prepared for being introduced into the higher strata of labour. The National Party&#x2019;s reply to that is an unambiguous &#x201C;no&#x201D;, not only because this implies errors of reasoning, but also because basically it is in conflict with our policy of multi-national development to independence for each of these homelands. For allowing the Bantu to enter the top strata of labour will lead to labour integration and labour equality It will also lead to many other forms of integration, such as in respect of residential areas, social matters, territories, political authority in this Parliament, education, recreation, etc. People who are guilty of this error of reasoning, by advocating that labour shortages be met in this way, are people who are also shirking their duty in respect of the responsibility for the large mass of people of the many peoples in South Africa; for in this regard, the supplementation of labour, a colossal irresponsibility is being committed by people who only see the possible worker in the Bantu person.</p>

<p>Sir, the Bantu persons in South Africa also have other human interests and human needs They also have a partnership with their people and the development of their state, even if these are a people and a state in embryonic form. Those people who are advocating that are only mindful of the material aspects, they do not see the human beings in the Bantu being, but only the labourer. There are two types of these people. The first type is those who do not mind that in every other respect the bantu are placed on the same level as the Whites in the white area; and the other type of person who does not notice this, is the one who only concentrates on the material aspects and with whom the human and sociopolitical aspects do not count at all. Both of these types are dangerous to us as Whites in South Africa.</p>

<p>The only correct approach and the best solution to these problems are to be consistent in carrying through the National Party&#x2019;s policy of multi-national development with all the implications it involves for both the Whites and the Bantu population. The National Party&#x2019;s policy is based on principles and not on such opportunism as we have to hear and read as coming from that side of the House. The consequences of the broad policy are many, but I merely want to mention a few which are relevant in this regard. I refer to labour as seen against the background of our policy of multi-national development, where every ethnic group is on a course leading to a separate destination of independence. The first consequence which I want to mention to the hon. member, is that, on the basis of the reality of multi-nationalism, the white people and every Bantu people have to go through a separate development connected with their own homeland and their own people. By those means it should be possible for every people in its interests and rights, to realize itself fully within the framework of its own context and within its own ranks. This must be done without the people concerned being dominated by any other people, as was also said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, or threatened by any other people. Here we have the major gulf between the approach of the Opposition and the approach of the National Party members must bear in mind that I said a moment ago that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other members on the other side of the House see the large mass of people in South Africa as one large comprehensive unit and nationhood. Those were the words of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in 1961. In short, the National Party approaches the mass of people in South Africa multi-nationally, whereas the Opposition approaches them uni-nationally. Another consequence of this is, that no matter how important all the other facets of development may be to any people, the political development of every people is of primary importance. It is given priority in order that it may as soon as possible, be made clear, unambiguously, that the Whites do not want to share their own political authority with any other people in South Africa. When I talk about any other people in South Africa, I am referring not only to the non-white people in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We do not want to share our, independence with the Coloureds, in case that little hon. member does not know it vet The second point which I want to mention to the hon. members in this connection, is that the Bantu peoples will therefore be granted every opportunity of realizing themselves and obtaining political authority. Thirdly, in so far as the presence of Bantu in white areas is concerned it is in a loose capacity and not in terms of a shared citizenship with us, as the hon. member for South Coast tried to indicate to me in 1964. Therefore, it follows logically that the white entrepreneurs and the white people who require labour in the highest strata, must not look to the Bantu for that, but must apply themselves to the improvement of the standard of labour and training an improvement of the labour methods, the more effective use of time and, last but not least, more white people in South Africa. In so far as Bantu can in fact be employed in the lower strata, it is being done in a controlled <span class="col_3511-3512" refersTo="page_0311"/>and systematic manner, as has often been said here in previous debates. This is, of course, always being done with due regard being had to whether that labour is available. A day may come that there will no longer be any Bantu labour available for those posts, and then they cannot be made for that and we cannot terminate the development in the homelands so that the Bantu may be released to go and work in the white areas. Surely, this is obvious. A public department such as the Railways, which handles these matters as a Government Department, can be trusted twice as much as any private employer who is not as closely connected with the Government as a Government Department is. It is this view we take of our policy, this view we take of labour in terms of multi-national development, of which our employers, the people of South Africa and the newspapers will have to try to gain a much better understanding. It will pay them to try to gain a better understanding of it. It will also pay them to come forward with their ideas within the framework of this interpretation of policy and to accept these ideas rather than to try to divert us from the basis of our policy by means of all sorts of plans and skilful manoeuvres, sometimes even by means of misrepresentations. The pattern of the presence of the Bantu in our white areas must be revised by those employers who are trying to divert us from the basis of our policy by means of such skilful plans.</p>

<p>&#x201C;They&#x201D; are those members of the Opposition and also those employers in South Africa who ranted so loudly in the past few weeks to try to divert us from the basis of our policy. They must ensure that they adapt themselves to the requirements within the framework of the Governments policy, as I stated them, i.e. the requirements of the employers as well as those of the Bantu, who is not merely a worker, but, as I said a moment ago, also a human being who is a member of a people, who has a political affiliation and also a political future which he must realize. If they would rather devote the larger expenditure which they want to incur to create this type of adjustment facilities, it would be better for them, much better even than all the profound ideas of large monetary levies which they are prepared to pay in order to, as it were, buy Bantu manpower from the Government in order to work here in the white areas. Those matters will not be of any use. They should rather make adjustments and use that large expenditure which they want to incur to buy Bantu for themselves from us, to adjust themselves in the right way within the framework of our policy. This, and nothing else, is what the speech made here by the hon. the Minister of Finance means. This is the background against which hon. members, and especially the employers in South Africa, should see it to-day.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They can come to learn from the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>In the light of the general features which I have mentioned here, the policy of the National Party is soundly based and its course is very clearly indicated, with clarity and with firmness on our side. However, what is the position at the moment in regard to the United Party&#x003F; They must speak up now. They must not play hide and seek now and say that this is not their Vote. In the discussion of this Vote, they must tell us in what other way it should be spent in terms of their policy. The United Party cannot do this. Why not&#x003F; Because the United Party is full of contradictions and doubts, because they are so unreliable, because they are sitting at the crossroads and because they are divided on this matter of Bantu development. One cannot deal with these questions and the labour matters which I brought into this matter, without keeping an eye on the political development of each of these Bantu peoples. Note the doubt in the United Party. For that reason the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also said in the Budget debate, &#x201C;Let us make it the task of the 1970&#x2019;s to make our South Africa so strong that we will be able to choose between several possible solutions of our non-European problem.&#x201D; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke blatantly and openly of &#x201C;several possible solutions for the non-European problem&#x201D;, and then hon. members on the other side laugh and snigger when I say that they have doubts. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition still wants to choose, but we on this side and the people chose a long time ago. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, however, still wants to choose in the 1970&#x2019;s between various possible policies. yes, Sir, then the same hon. Leader of the Opposition and the member for Bezuidenhout tried in their clumsy way to implicate the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council in this matter. Then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, once again honestly&#x2014;I take my hat off to him&#x2014;what the terrible implications would be for the Leader of the Opposition if the Advisory Council arrived at certain findings. In other words, they admit that there still is for them the possibility of a different policy, and that the Advisory Council should kindly devise this for us.</p>

<p>The new mirages of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout about the high status, higher than provincial, is also proof of their doubt. Yes, Sir, also his covert reference to the effect that we can grant independence to the homelands, which are economically weaker than Lesotho is, is a manifestation of their doubt and ambiguity. But while the hon. member <span class="col_3513-3514" refersTo="page_0312"/>for Bezuidenhout, with his doubt, inclined towards the National Party, the hon. member for South Coast kicked against it with both feet, and he wished he had more, and wanted to undo everything which we had done. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout wanted to elaborate on that towards a greater measure of freedom in future. The hon. member for South Coast wants to undo everything and takes a stubborn stand. He never wants to reach any point of no return. This is the conflict and the dilemma of the United Party. Some of them tend towards the National Party standpoint on the homelands; others stop short of the idea of supremacy in this mixed unit or nationhood.</p>

<p>I have spoken in detail about the present and the future. I have replied to the hon. members for South Coast and Bezuidenhout and to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, those three members, whom I should like to call a politically active triangle of the United Party. They are not radio active, Sir, but politically active.</p>

<p>Now I am asking and challenging, if it is necessary to challenge them, both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for South Coast&#x2014;I am not concerned with the member for Bezuidenhout, who has spoken his mind&#x2014; to reply to the questions which I have put to-day. I am asking the Leader of the Opposition to admit that he and his party are in doubt and are sitting at the crossroads between the hon. member for South Coast, who obstinately refuses to budge, on the one hand and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, the restless anticipator. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must tell us which of the two represents the United Party&#x2019;s present course, i.e. that of the man who obstinately refuses to budge, or that of the restless anticipator. Or is the hon. the Leader of the Opposition still waiting for the &#x201C;possible solution of the 1970&#x2019;s&#x201D;&#x003F; It seems like it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast and the Leader of the Opposition must speak up, because the members of the United Party differ so much among one another that nobody can believe them and nobody wants to trust them. If these two hon. members remain silent, it is just a confirmation that the United Party has fallen into doubt, that my charge of falseness is correct, and that they are untrustworthy and unreliable. Sir, the tragedy, a deep tragedy, is that nobody believes the members of the United Party any more, even if they speak the gospel truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the United Party&#x2019;s theme in the censure debate, in the Budget debate and under the Labour and other Votes, has been consistent, namely that under the policy of this Government there cannot be the necessary development to make the homelands viable and to enable this Government to carry out its policy. Under this Government&#x2019;s policy there can be no proper use made of our manpower. That has been our theme. We little dreamt that we would be so successful, although the Press gave it a lot of publicity, until the hon. the Minister intervened in this debate. The Afrikaans Nationalist Press has been forecasting that we were going to get an important announcement of policy from the various Ministers. According to one we were going to have a bomb, and according to <i>Die Vaderland</i> we were going to have a &#x201C;nuwe plan&#x201D; from the Minister of Labour. This Minister got up at the outset and addressed us for over an hour &#x2026;</p>

<p>I sat quiet while the hon. the Minister spoke and did not interrupt once, because I wanted to be given a fair chance against him. Sir, I did not realize how ignorant the hon. the Minister was about the policy of the United Party as he showed by the silly questions he asked us here to-day. Surely we have made so many statements that he knows that our policy is to develop the reserves politically and economically&#x003F; Surely he knows that our criticism against this Government is that it is not developing the reserves fast enough and economically. Our Leader, Sir De Villiers Graaff, has often stated in this very House that our policy is to develop the reserves beyond even provincial council status. He likened it to the status of South-West Africa. Surely the hon. the Minister knows that that is our policy and that that was the theme of the address by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x003F; There was nothing wrong with what the hon. member said; it all fits in with our policy. Surely the hon. the Minister knows, too, that when the Government passed either the Promotion of Self-government Bill, or the Transkei Constitutional Bill&#x2014;I cannot remember which one it <span class="col_3515-3516" refersTo="page_0313"/>was now&#x2014;our Leader said here that he was telling the Bantu and the rest of South Africa that we did not consider these promises of independence to be promises from the white man, and we would not carry them out. Sir, our policy is quite clear in that respect. Now, the hon. the Minister attempts to throw some doubt as to which line we are taking. There is no doubt about it. Regarding the point of no return, I want to ask the hon. the Minister why he did not reply to the hon. member for South Coast, when this question was raised, and why he had to wait all this time to work out his long speech in reply to that.</p>

<p>Sir, could not the hon. the Deputy Minister have done that&#x003F; Somebody could have done it. I also dealt with the question of the point of no return. Our criticism of both the Progressive Party policy and the Nationalist Party policy is that they can reach a point of no return, whereas with the United Party that point is not reached. The hon. the Minister mentioned there being a legal and a moral aspect. Of course there are these aspects to the policy. As far as the legal aspect is concerned, the hon. the Minister cannot bind future Parliaments and he cannot bind the United Party as to what may happen in the future. On the moral issue we have made our position quite clear. Nobody is under any misapprehension as to what will happen when we get into power. So on the moral basis we are clear as well.</p>

<p>When the hon. the Minister got up, I was expecting some important announcement from him that the other hon. Ministers had not made. Again we have been disappointed. The hon. the Minister has said absolutely nothing that is new. He spent over an hour talking, but said nothing.</p>

<p>My attention has been drawn to a leading article in <i>Die Vaderland</i> of the 20th August in which there is a complaint that I incorrectly quoted from a main news report in an early issue of this paper, issued during the Budget debate. I had said that the Government was preparing the country for economic integration and amidst interjections I went on to say that <i>Die Vaderland</i> had said so. The main news article actually stated that an important statement was expected, probably from the Minister of Labour. It also said that political observers thought that more skilled Bantu would be employed in the white areas and that there was speculation at this stage that it would be within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s policy on separate and multinational development. And it goes on to say that the mere fact that Bantu work in white areas does not mean integration. When reading Hansard one might get the impression that I said that the report in <i>Die Vaderland</i> had used the words &#x201C;it would be said this is economic integration.&#x201D; It did not use those words, and I am sorry if I gave the wrong impression and the paper feels aggrieved. But why it should feel aggrieved I do not know because I used the words they used, i.e. &#x201C;this is not integration&#x201D; and, surely, they cannot object to the fact that I used &#x201C;economic integration&#x201D;. This Government always claims that what is happening under the policy is not economic integration. Therefore there can be no objection to the word &#x201C;economic&#x201D;. This jitteryness is symptomatic of the Nationalist papers today. They are all on edge. No one knows what the other will say or what the Minister will say for that matter on any of the major colour problems which are daily coming to the fore. Why is this so&#x003F; It is because of this Government&#x2019;s fetish for restricting by legislation every conceivable point of contact between the different colour groups and promptly nullifying these restrictions by granting exemptions. <i>Die Vaderland</i> has no more idea than <i>Hoofstad</i> about what is to happen to the Chinese in any area or to Bantu mineworkers in the reserves. Why was it necessary for the news reporter referred to, to mention that there was speculation that the employment of Bantu in more skilled jobs in white areas would be within the framework of Nationalist Party policy&#x003F; Why was there this speculation&#x003F; Why was it necessary in the very next paragraph to say that this would not be integration&#x003F; It was necessary because the writer knew very well that people would look upon this as integration. And this further employment of Bantu in the white areas in industry or in any other way, is integration. The leading article then went on to challenge me to prove that the Minister of Labour had not said anything which was not reported in that article. I did not say he had not said anything. I said he had said nothing new. If one looks at this leading article, one sees that the heading is printed in large letters, about three-quarters of an inch thick which reads: &#x201C;Arbeid &#x2014;Nuwe plan verwag.&#x201D; This is <i>Die Vaderland.</i> What did the hon. the Minister say that was new&#x003F; He said absolutely nothing new. Now I want to challenge <i>Die Vaderland</i> to tell us what the hon. the Minister of Labour said that was new in regard to this employment of Bantu in the white areas.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The point is that what the <i>Vaderland</i> tried to do here, is typical <span class="col_3517-3518" refersTo="page_0314"/>of what the Afrikaans papers are trying to do and what Nationalists are trying to do outside, to pretend. <i>Die Vaderland</i> keeps on challenging me. Now I challenge them or any other paper to say what new announcement the hon. the Minister of Labour made. It is time they realized that there are two Ministers who control the pattern of labour in South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Labour is not one of them. The first is the hon. the Minister of Transport who does what he likes on the Railways irrespective of Government policy. The second is the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development who dictates the policy for the rest of the country. The country, and especially industry, was all excited after the speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance where he invited industry for a dialogue with him. I should like to remind hon. members that he made this statement when he delivered his Budget Speech. Therefore it could not have been something which was not considered. It must have been approved by the Government. Then again, in his reply on the debate, the hon. the Minister repeated that if industrialists were to help in the development of the homelands the Government would be in a much better position and more willing to help them in the development of industry in the white areas. All this is idle talk; all this talk by the Minister of Finance is idle talk. There is only one man who can talk to industrialists&#x2014;the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Once the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Labour agreed to the amendment of the Bantu Labour Act at the beginning of this year authorizing the Minister of Bantu Administration to prohibit Bantu from doing certain work in the white areas, they handed over the control of labour to that Minister. In terms of section 20 (a) of the Bantu Labour Act, the Minister can prohibit the performance of work or the employment or continued employment of Bantu in any specified area, in any specified class of employment, in any specified trade or in the service of a specified employer or class of employer and he can make the prohibition apply in a specified area or right throughout the country. Consequently, it would have been idle for the Minister of Labour, had he tried it, which he luckily did not, to talk of &#x201C;&#x2019;n nuwe plan&#x201D; of his own for labour. Equally the industrialists will be wasting their time to talk to the Minister of Finance if they hope thereby to be able to employ more Bantu in white areas. At the time the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill was passed, I pointed out that this Minister controlled the entire destiny of South Africa that he controlled the entire economy because he can deny labour in the white areas and frustrate development in the Bantu reserves. So, how can the Minister of Finance have a dialogue with industrialists on development in the reserves without the approval of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development&#x003F; What <i>quid pro quo</i> can the Minister of Finance offer to industrialists as far as Bantu labour is concerned&#x003F; After all, that is what the industrialists are mainly interested in&#x2014; Bantu Labour. But after having listened to the talk of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration here this afternoon, I wonder why industrialists would want to see the Minister of Finance. I should like the Minister to tell us what he thinks the Minister of Finance meant when he made that statement. We have had various opinions from the other side about what the Minister actually meant. We say he meant one thing and they say he meant something else. This Minister should tell us what the Minister of Finance meant. I also wanted him to tell us what he intends doing. The Minister of Finance must have consulted him. What new incentives is he going to give industrialists&#x003F; This Minister is all-powerful and he should tell us what he is doing about the manpower crisis in the country. After all, they must admit that there is such a crisis, otherwise we would not have had the discussions we have been having and the Minister would not have stepped in to prohibit the employment of Bantu in jobs they have not been doing before. The Nationalists have now been in power for 22 years and if the Bantu had only been doing traditional work, it would not have been necessary for him to take this power to maintain our traditional way of life. The first notice of the Minister&#x2019;s intention to prohibit was published on the 3rd April. It was quite clear that the Minister&#x2019;s thinking was that no Bantu would be employed in the white areas, other than in a border area, as a counter assistant, a salesman in a shop or caf&#x00E9;, as a receptionist in a commercial or professional undertaking or as a telephonist in a shop, office, factory or hotel or as a clerk, cashier or typist in a shop. This notice was not lightly published; on the contrary, great thought must have been given to it. The hon. the Deputy Minister with all the publicity he could get said he was responsible for it; he said he was proud of it. In terms of that notice we were entitled to expect one month later a final notice as to what the position was going to be.</p>

<p>I am not talking nonsense. In terms of the Act the Minister has to give one month&#x2019;s notice of his intention to do certain things. However, the first month passed and so the second, the third and the fourth without a final notice and yet just before the election the Deputy Minister was proud of it, proud that he was going to stop integration. On the 7th August, there was a further notice of his intention to prohibit Bantu from doing certain classes of work except on certain conditions. But what a difference <span class="col_3519-3520" refersTo="page_0315"/>there was in the two notices! The first notice was a blanket prohibition, without any exceptions; the second allowed all the prohibited classes to be employed under certain circumstances. In the meantime entrepreneurs had been waiting for four months uncertain as to what the future was going to be. Meanwhile a fifth month has gone by. What made the Minister change his mind so drastically about the type of work he is going to prohibit&#x003F; Are we now going to hear the specious argument, that it is economic integration if the different colours work together in the same room and at the same time but not integration when they work for the same business but in different offices, or in the same offices but at different times&#x003F; If it is integration when a Bantu shop assistant or a salesman works alongside a white man, why is it not so when he works as a petrol pump attendant or as a waiter&#x003F; There must be a reason for these distinctions, and the Minister must tell us. We also want to know why we cannot be told what surveys have been taken into account in coming to a decision about the type of work to prohibit&#x003F;</p>

<p>We have not had the information. We have asked for it but the Minister said he would not tell us. So, I say the Minister is not telling the truth when he says he knows how many people will be involved by the proposed prohibition. He does not know because he does not know how many people are employing Bantu. There are heaps of people employing Bantu that he does not know about. The Minister is not being frank with the House or the country. He is treating this House with contempt; he showed it again this afternoon in his speech. His contempt is in keeping with his arrogance. He has been given so many powers that he now has an empire of himself and has become the most powerful man. He has become arrogant and conceited; he has become too big for his boots. It is either that or he is slipping; he is getting afraid of all the criticism that is coming and he feels he is going to be bowler-battered or, as they may say in his Department, Commissioner-general.</p>

<p>After all, why is the Government in trouble&#x003F; I am not talking about their minor troubles&#x2014;about the veracity or otherwise of the Minister of Health, or of the blunders with the Japanese jockey, D&#x2019;Oliveira and Arthur Ashe, or of the hamhanded handling of the Haak loan or the Chinese community; I am not talking about these. I am talking about the big problem facing South Africa, the problem our financiers, our economists and our industrialists are worried about. It is not necessary for me to tell them what this problem is because they too read the Afrikaans press, the Nationalist press and also the English press. They know what is worrying everybody. They know that what is worrying everybody is what is worrying Sabra and the intellectuals in the Nationalist Party, people who support their policy of separate development to eventual independence. What is worrying them is the lack of development in the reserves. And, Sir, this Minister is responsible for the development in the reserves. He is the responsible Minister and he has failed. That is why he now pretends that the reserves do not have to become viable before they can get their independence. The hon. the Minister got up and said in answer to the Leader of the Opposition: &#x201C;I say that the homelands do not have to be viable in order to get their independence&#x201D;, and he mentioned the example of the protectorates. Sir, we do not agree that those Protectorates should have been given their independence. We could not interfere because this was done by the British Government. Sir, when he says that we are in a better position to know what to do because we live alongside these people, we say that that is the very reason why they should not be given their independence; that is why the British and the French and other governments could afford to give independence to their former colonies because they were thousands of miles away. But we are in a different position in that we live right alongside them.</p>

<p>We do not agree with the Miniister&#x2019;s statement that the homelands do not have to be viable before they can get their independence. We say that unless you make them viable you cannot give them their independence and we say that these reserves cannot be made viable and we have told the hon. the Minister that.

<p>I am dealing with the Tomlinson Commission now, and I will deal with it in my own way.

The commission said that the matter was one of urgency and that it must be tackled with dedication. <span class="col_3521-3522" refersTo="page_0316"/> The commission recommended that a lot of money must be spent on the development of the homelands.

He said that it was not necessary to spend all that money; he was going to spend less.

<p>Yes, there was a minority report signed by two civil servants. I am surprised that the hon. the Minister should even make that interjection. Those two civil servants signed the majority report and after the report had been seen by the Government they asked whether they could alter their report. The chairman said that this was most unusual but he allowed them to submit a minority report and what did they do&#x003F; They said that they disagreed with the idea of white capital being allowed into the reserves. Sir, I will say this to the credit of Mr. de Wet Nel: He stuck to his guns; he refused to withdraw and adhered to his recommendation.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister has now turned to agencies to try to help him to develop the reserves. Why did Dr. Verwoerd reject the idea of allowing white capital to go into the reserves&#x003F; He did it for one reason; he said: &#x201C;If you have white capital going into the reserves, then you have to have white management and all the other requisites that go with it and you would then establish white colonies.&#x201D; That is what he wanted to avoid. But now that this Government has adopted the agency system, they are going to bring about what Dr. Verwoerd feared would happen. White capital will go into the reserves together with white management. Sir, we are in favour of white capital going into the homelands and we do not foresee the troubles that Dr. Verwoerd foresaw. This Government is now running away from Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy on that point. Sir, it does not help this Minister to tell us that it has always been Nationalist Party policy to establish industries through agencies. The fact is that they never did it; it is only now that they are starting. We are often told how successful this method is but we do not believe that it is successful because we can get no information. The Minister hides his failures in secrecy and it is most difficult for us to find out exactly what is happening. If you question him too closely, Sir, then the ex-school master becomes a petulant school boy and refuses to speak.</p>

<p>I want to ask him this. In reply to a question by me, he said there were employed under the agency system 1,610 Bantu. When I said that a small number like this was infinitesimal he said that I did not understand it. I asked him to explain what he meant and he said: No, he would not. He repeated that twice and then he said he would not tell me, for a good reason. [Interjections.] The Minister said he would not tell me about the agency development when I asked him about it. But the point is this. We are entitled to know. The Minister is not dealing with his own money. He is not giving concessions on his own bit of land but on land owned by the State, and he is using State money to develop it. I Was told that I could get a general form of agreement. I have asked for that and the Department has promised to get me the general form, but unfortunately it has not come yet so I did not see it. Why cannot we know what this agreement was&#x003F; There is a news item in the <i>Star</i> of the 1st about a platinum mine being developed under a lease to a company, in the Bapa Reserve. It was estimated that the tribesmen would receive R1,200,000 a year from this mine, being 10 per cent of the profits. Now will the Minister please stop talking to the Deputy Minister and tell me this&#x003F; Is this correct&#x003F; Is it expected that they will get R1.2 million a year, as being 10 per cent of the profits&#x003F; Then I want to know whether other companies were also given the opportunity to tender for this lease, to enter into a contract, and under what conditions are the Bantu working in that mine&#x003F; You see, Sir, on 4th June the hon. member for Orange Grove was informed that the Impala Prospecting Company had applied for permission to allow Bantu labourers to do work normally done by Whites in the mines at Rustenburg and that the application was being considered. On 13th April, 1969, just about a year later, the hon. member for Parktown asked the same question and he received the same reply, viz. that the matter was being considered. Now what is the Government&#x2019;s policy with regard to mines in the Bantu areas, and what is their policy in regard to the employment of Bantu in those areas&#x003F; Are they being restricted in the work they do&#x003F; We could not find out from the hon. the Minister of Labour and I think this Minister must now tell us what he is going to do. Is this mine which is now going to make this <span class="col_3523-3524" refersTo="page_0317"/>terrific profit in the Bapa Reserve, which belongs to the Falconridge Group, according to the newspaper report, which is all we have, a member of the same group as the Impala Mining Company which was referred to earlier by the Minister in answering the previous questions&#x003F; Is it the same company or is it not, and how do these companies become interested in mines&#x003F; Are they invited to go there and prospect, or do they go and ask the Government for a contract&#x003F;</p>

<p>It is important for us to know the terms of this contract in connection with the agency business as well. There are rumours&#x2014;I do not know whether it is true&#x2014;that an industrialist will be given a lease of premises built by the Department for 25 years and the rental will be, I understand, 4 per cent of the cost of construction. We have to go by rumours, by what we hear, and I would like the Minister to tell us whether this is correct too. How are they trying to encourage industrialists to go into the Reserves&#x003F; Is any assurance given to the industrialist that the wage determination will not be applied in the Reserves&#x003F; We know it has been suspended now.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat broached a multitude of minor matters to avoid the question of their stating a policy. Firstly, arising out of his reaction to what the hon. member for South Coast asked the Minister. I want to quote to him from Hansard of 22nd July. The hon. member for South Coast said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is what we want to know. We want a clear statement from the hon. the Minister in this regard. When his Vote comes under discussion I hope he will give us a full detailed explanation of precisely where the people and the Parliament of South Africa stand in regard to the newly-constituted authority which he has created to-day.</block>

<p>He was referring to the measure of self-government which had been established in Zululand. That hon. member then put the question very clearly to the hon. the Minister. When the hon. the Minister replied to that to-day, the hon. member for Transkei came forward with a lot of stories and said that the reply could have been presented in a different way. The hon. member for South Coast went further and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By doing this he has moved away from the concept of General Hertzog and the 1936 legislation. We on this side of the House are prepared to carry out the Land Act of the late General Hertzog. Our resolution in 1959 said so.</block>

<p>He wanted to know something further, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is too dangerous for 3 million people who are in our midst.</block>

<p>This is the reply we want. Here the hon. member for South Coast came along and stated that the hon. the Minister had gone too far. He said it was too dangerous, and there the hon. member for Transkei rose to his feet and said that they were in full agreement with the development of the Bantu areas in both the economic and political sphere. It is those differences in that party on which we want clarity. The people of South Africa, the electorate, want clarity as to where they stand with that party. The hon. member touched on a lot of general matters here, but we want clarity on basic principles.</p>

<p>The hon. Opposition are going to the polls with a great clamour and are saying that apartheid has failed. But the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. member who has just resumed his seat come and make these statements here. That hon. member supported the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, but he spoke against the hon. member for South Coast. That is not what the hon. member for South Coast was in agreement with; he stated that he did not go along with that. We want clarity as to where we stand with him. I now want to mention a few other matters, and it is necessary that we focus attention on them, The hon. the Minister gave a comprehensive elucidation here, and before I go into the dissension in the Oppotion further, I want to state very briefly that we have in 10 years, with the policy of multi-national development, given the Bantu more in both the economic and the political spheres than has been given to them in the previous more than 300 years. This is what we have accomplished, and the various Bantu peoples have maintained their soul under the legislation of this side of the House and under the development which has taken place as a result.</p>

<p>What do we find in regard to the United Party&#x003F; I want to quote what a few of them have said, because I want to get clarity from them. They are not going to the nation with a clear picture, and they are spreading stories about lack of development and matters of that kind which they want to give out is inconsistent. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said: &#x201C;Here sits the only party which stands for large-scale political and economic development in the Bantu areas&#x201D;. He said that they were the only party which did that. Now I should just like that hon. member to clear something up for us. What does he mean by &#x201C;the only&#x201D;&#x003F; Is he turning Nationalist&#x003F; After all, he knows what development the National Party has very systematically brought about. There are still a few other matters. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also stated that they admitted that a situation must be created in which people were able to realize themselves without the one dominating the other. The hon. the Minister also referred to that. What did the hon. <span class="col_3525-3526" refersTo="page_0318"/>the Leader of the Opposition say in the debate on the 20th July&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are realizing more and more that it is the quality of people which counts. Politically we accept the desirability of the non-Whites in time sharing the responsibility on a federal basis with the white elite.</block>

<p>How does one reconcile these two things&#x003F; We want clarity in this country on these matters. The standpoint of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, that this will be shared with the white elite, is not clear to us. We want clarity on this, and the electorate wants clarity on this. To what extent do they want to share&#x003F; Will it be &#x201C;one horse, one rabbit&#x201D;, or what is the position&#x003F; The hon. member for Bezuidenhout stated that they firmly supported economic and political development. The hon. member for Transkei confirmed this and stated that that was their policy, but the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not say that. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated here in the debate on 20th July that &#x201C;The non-Whites will in time share responsibility on a federal basis with the white elite&#x201D;. Now we want to know, and it is necessary for the electorate to know, where that party wants to go. Does it want to go the way of the hon. member for Houghton and the Progressive Party&#x003F; Hon. members on the opposite side who do not want to do this, must say so very clearly to us. On these two basic aspects, i.e. economic and political development, the United Party must give the Bantu clarity. It must also give the electorate of South Africa clarity. The hon. the Minister this afternoon issued the following challenge to the United Party: Let us therefore thrash out these various matters now so that we know where we stand. Hon. members on the opppsite side must cease this double-talk.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the economic development of the homelands, which the United Party wants to have take place so rapidly. Various hon. members on that side referred to this, while a few things are also said about it in this yellow statement of policy booklet of the United Party. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition maintains that the great mass of the non-white labour force should be made into more productive workers. He said that they should as a whole be made more productive. However, how is the United Party going to fit this into our labour pattern&#x003F; In this yellow booklet the following is said: &#x2019;&#x2019;job reservation is not enough to protect white workers, while lower paid Bantu workers in white border areas are threatening the security of white workers everywhere&#x201D;. In the policy statement the United Party therefore states that the white worker is being afforded insufficient protection. They state clearly that: &#x201C;Job reservation does not go far enough&#x201D;. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition maintains that the mass of non-Whites must be admitted to the labour force and trained to produce greater productivity. It is in regard to these matters that we must have greater clarity from the hon. the Opposition, so that the people of South Africa can know what their policy is. The Whites want to know, and so do the Bantu.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House have a proud record. It is often intimated that the development is not taking place rapidly enough, and then we have the contradictory statements by hon. members on the opposite side. But let us see what happened. The hon. the Minister has already pointed out that in the political sphere there are already eight territorial authorities in various stages of development. In that way we have already set them on the road to development. We are not setting about this matter in an irresponsible way. We are doing so slowly, systematically and step by step, as these people are able to absorb it. There are two factors which play an important role here. The one is the ability of these people to absorb what is being offered to them and to apply it beneficially and in their own interests. The other is the willingness of the Whites to give. We cannot proceed at a pace which could disturb the balance to one side or the other. It is very clear that the National Party is applying its policy systematically and according to circumstances in both the economic and the political sphere. As far as economic development is concerned, I just want to make one further point. The United Party has stated that they will bring in white capital. The National Party policy is that this should only be done on a controlled agency basis. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that the homelands represented one-seventh of our agricultural land. However, one cannot discuss the size of the area as a basis, only the agricultural potential of an area. When one examines the agricultural potential of those areas from the north down to the Transkei, one finds that it will in future probably be as great as the industrial potential.

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, nothing has been more illustrative of the defensive position of the Government to-day than the speech by the hon. the Minister and the speech that we have just heard from the hon. member for Nelspruit. One thing that the hon. the Minister learnt very well from the late Dr. Verwoerd. was something which he demonstrated so well to-day, namely &#x201C;when in difficulty, resort to the pure theory of separate development; get up into the clouds with separate development and you are all right&#x201D;. We know very well what the theory of separate development is. We have listened to it for the best part of 20 years. We know to the finest detail the theory of that policy. But what we, the country, and especially the Minister, more than anybody; are concerned with and that is why he is trying to hide it, is how the pure theory of separate development is to be applied in the harsh reality of <span class="col_3527-3528" refersTo="page_0319"/>1970. That is what we are concerned with. That is what we want to hear from the hon. the Minister. The object of this debate is for us to vote money to the hon. the Minister, which he will spend on applying his policy to the reality of South Africa to-day. So far, having listened to the hon. the Minister for an hour and 10 minutes, we have heard not one word of that. But I suppose, Sir, in the course of the discussion in the next day or two, we can hope at least that something of reality will emerge from him.</p>

<p>But let me come to one or two of the questions which the hon. gentleman put to this side of the House. First of all, there was the question of &#x201C;the point of no return&#x201D;, which will be dealt with by my hon. leader in Natal later this afternoon in this debate. It was the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Commissioner-General who raised this issue. The hon. the Minister was at the inauguration of the territorial authority in Zululand. He heard the Commissioner-General not once, but two or three times, emphasize to a large audience that the point of no return had been reached. He raised it. So, dealing with a matter of this importance, it is quite right that we should expect something in detail from the hon. the Minister as to what he intends in that regard. The hon. member for South Coast will deal with that later on.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman asks us and others whether we accept the Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s report. What is that report, Sir&#x003F; It deals with a factual analysis.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Let me make my speech now. It deals with a factual analysis of the facts of South Africa. It makes certain recommendations which it says are indispensable to the success of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy. We agree with the factual analysis, by and large. We agree that in order for their policy to succeed, the recommendations, by and large, of that commission had to be accepted. But one of our main criticisms of the hon. gentleman is that he has run so far away in the application of his policy from what that commission has recommended that there is no prospect whatever of it succeeding.</p>

<p>Now we come to this semantic argument about &#x201C;veelvolkige land&#x201D;, &#x201C;nasiedom&#x201D;, and so forth. It gets us absolutely nowhere. The term &#x201C;nation&#x201D; is inappropriate to any multi-racial or multi-national state. One never hears it used by the Prime Minister of Malaya in regard to his people, who are Chinese and Malayans. One never hears it used by the Swiss President in relation to the Swiss people. One seldom hears it, indeed, used by a British Prime Minister in regard to the various peoples who make up Great Britain to-day.</p>

<p>What one can talk of with some measure of intelligibility, is the South African people. That is the term which is used by this side of the House. Let me say to the hon. gentleman opposite, do they include the Coloured people as part of the South African nation&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. One seems to get general acceptance of that. Now, Sir, this is precisely the standpoint of the United Party. When we had at our congress &#x201C;een volk. een land, een nasie&#x201D;, it was a congress which was representative of the white people, and related to them. Just as the hon. gentlemen opposite cannot see their way to accept the Coloured people as part of the South African nation, but would prefer to use the term &#x201C;the South African people&#x201D; when dealing with the various races which they accept as being indigenous to this country and part of the people of this country, so do we use that term in respect of the Bantu people as well. I may say, in regard to an earlier debate, that the Leader of the Opposition has never used the term &#x201C;nation&#x201D; in respect of the Bantu people.</p>

<p>Sir, let us come to the question of the repeal of the territorial authorities. The hon. the Minister is so busy at the moment dealing with other matters that he seems to have no interest in this debate at all. Perhaps his Deputy will make some notes and pass them to him later. What is the position of this side of the House&#x003F; We shall repeal or modify anything which this Government has enacted and which is inconsistent with the Bantu people remaining part of the subject population of the South African sovereign Government. At the same time, as we have said over and over again, we stand for the development of the Native reserves. As the hon. member for Transkei has said to-day, we stand for the development of the Native reserves as parts of the South African State, both economically and in the sphere of politics. There are many aspects of the development which has taken place under the hon. the Minister which can be adapted and modified, to fit in with the United Party&#x2019;s view of South Africa as a federal state in which the various Bantu races represent some of the federal elements.</p>

<p>Let us come back to the question of the application of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy to the realities. I referred, the last time I spoke, to the proceedings at the inauguration of the Territorial Authority. As I have said, we are to-day concerned with the application and the reality of this policy. I should like to <span class="col_3529-3530" refersTo="page_0320"/>point out what the very first thing was which the new executive officer, Chief Buthelezi, demanded on the occasion when he was given his new authority by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am afraid my time is very limited. The hon. member can make his speech later. Chief Buthelezi said: &#x201C;This raises quite a number of issues. The first of these, which I consider a priority, is for the Government to give the Zulu nation more territory, for without more territory our scheme will not make sense.&#x201D; This is what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Chief Executive Officer said. I have only two minutes, left, but I want to say that this very point is dealt with in the latest edition of the house journal of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department. It talks about the &#x201C;creation of homogeneous administrative areas concentrated in coherent homelands where possible&#x201D;, The journal then goes on to say: &#x201C;There are formidable obstacles to be overcome in the immediate future if the rather scattered Natal homelands are to form an adequate basis for a viable state under the Zululand Territorial Authority.&#x201D; Every document one can find points to the fact that this is an essential part of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy. They all point out that, if the policy of the Minister is to be implemented, enormous obstacles have to be faced. This is the main debate on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department, and all we have had is an airyfairy discussion on the philosophy which is behind the Minister&#x2019;s policy. We all know that. We have heard it a thousand times. What we do not know and what we and the people want to know, is how the hon. gentleman is going to implement this policy, in its various aspects, the very first of which is the provision of land which can form the basis of a viable state. We have not heard a single word here to-day in that regard.</p>

<p>In addition, a commission was appointed almost ten years ago by Mr. Sauer, when he was Minister of Lands. This commission was to inquire into this very problem of the reallocation of the boundaries of the Native reserves in Natal. It has done its work on two occasions. We have not yet heard which aspects of that commission&#x2019;s report, whatever they may be, this Government has accepted and what they are going to do about it. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Zululand, who has just resumed his seat, is, after all these years, still under the illusion that separate development is a mere theory. That hon. member has accompanied us on tours to go and see what is actually being done within those homelands. What did that hon. member see there&#x003F; Why did he go there&#x003F; Did he go there to see what was being done and what was being achieved there, or did he go there merely to suck poison from the tour which he could subsequently use&#x003F; When reference was made by way of an interjection while the hon. member was making his speech to the Report of the Tomlinson Commission, he said that they only accepted the factual findings of the Tomlinson Commission, According to him they accepted it only in part. In contrast to that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout stated very clearly in this House that when the Tomlinson Commission Report appeared he and his party accepted its general principles. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">And yesterday my hon. Leader intimated clearly again that we accept the general principles of that report.</block>

<p>There we immediately have now the double-talk of the United Party. The hon. member for Transkei rose to his feet here and requested the privilege of the half hour. In a brilliant speech the hon. the Minister had put an elementary question to him. The least we expected was that he would reply to that question in the course of that half-hour speech. It ought to have been easy for him to reply to the question whether the United Party, which is laying claim to taking over the reins of government, would or would not repeal the political development which has already been in the Transkei and in Zululand. I would be pleased if the hon. member for Bezuidenhout would refrain from distracting the attention of the hon. member for Transkei. I hope the next speaker on that side of the House will furnish a very clear reply to this question. In the short while this debate has been in progress, it has become very clear that the United Party has no well-considered Bantu policy on our relations politics. It has been shown very clearly during the past six weeks, but particularly during the past few minutes during which this Vote has been under discussion, that there is a profound division in the United Party. [Interjections.] Yes, hon. members on that side of the House may laugh about this, but it is an embarrassed laughter. There is a profound division in the United Party on our relations politics. To every member in this House and also to every political observer outside it has during the past six weeks of this Session become strikingly obvious that there are three different streams in the United Party. Firsly, there is the Douglas Mitchell stream in the United Party. How much sympathy and how much support this stream enjoys, I do not know. The hon. member for South Coast will know better, because he stands for a particular direction in that sphere. Secondly, there is the Japie Basson stream. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout indicated clearly to us here for what stream he stands. I want to say that he has already placed his party in a very embarrassing position, but this afternoon he placed it in an even more embarrassing position after the hon. the Minister had finished speaking. Then there is, in <span class="col_3531-3532" refersTo="page_0321"/>addition, the Jacobs stream in that party. The hon. member for Hillbrow is the man who says that we Nationalists are wearing chequer-board spectacles, to use his own words, and that we only see either white or black. Then he added at once that, after all, there can also be shades of grey. This reveals another stream in that party. The members of that party will themselves know how much support and how much sympathy each one of those streams has. What is most tragic of all is that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is alternating between these three streams. He is going from pillar to post and he does not know where to next because he evidently does not himself know which is the strongest stream in that party. On the 20th July of this year the hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled at the hon. the Prime Minister the accusation that the race policies of the Government were isolating white South Africans to an increasing extent from all the major European powers, as well as the Anglo-Saxon powers. This can be read in Volume I, column 33 of Hansard. In other words, this is the situation which has resulted from the policy of separate development. I should now like to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I am sorry that he is not present, but perhaps one of the front-benchers there will have the courage to reply to this: How far is the Leader of the Opposition prepared to go to satisfy the outside world; how far is he prepared to go with our relations politics in South Africa to satisfy the outside world&#x003F; We should like a reply to this. Will his 25 representatives in this House satisfy the world&#x003F; Sir, hon. members on the opposite side must reply to this. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is levelling the accusation at us that our race policy, our policy of separate development, is isolating us from the major countries of the world. Will they follow a policy which will not isolate us from the world&#x003F; That is a very clear question. How far is the Opposition prepared to go&#x003F; Did the policy which was followed in Kenya, the policy of &#x201C;partnership&#x201D; under the old British Colonial Office, satisfy the world&#x003F; Did the white man retain his identity there, or has the white man left Kenya&#x003F;</p>

<p>Yes, but what say do they have there: who is governing Kenya; who is the Prime Minister of Kenya&#x003F; Must I deduce from that argument that the white man will remain here in South Africa, but that the Prime Minister of this country, according to that recipe, will be a black man&#x003F; Has the Federation of the Rhodesias satisfied the world&#x003F; Did Africa satisfy the world&#x003F; Do hon. members on that side want to take South Africa along the road taken by Africa, when they level such accusations as were levelled by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition at us here&#x003F; What would satisfy the world&#x003F; No, Africa has given the answer: Absolute equality will satisfy the world; absolute equalization and the elimination of all colour bars will satisfy the world. Sir, I want to say this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: When he makes such utterances and accusations, then he influences the World Council of Churches to adopt resolutions such as the one they adopted last week. Yes, Sir, those bodies, the enemies of South Africa, see here within South Africa an ally in the United Party when its leaders make such statements, because they know that that party will not follow the policy of separate development, contrary to what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says. For that reason we can safely accept that the United Party will never sit on this side because no nation will allow any speculation with its survival and its future, and that is why the people will not vote the United Party into office. Until such time as we are given a more acceptable alternative from the Opposition side, I know and I believe that the problems which arise out of the policy of separate development are not political problems, but problems of national importance. We have over a long period been placing legislation on the Statute Book; we have authorization to act; we are giving shape to the Bantu homelands. Because of its multi-nationality one can govern a country like South Africa according to the principles and the policy of only one party, and those are the principles and the policy of the National Party, and that is why we will abide by them. Sir, I maintain that the plans have been drawn up; it took a long time; we had to demolish old ruins to make room in order to build, and there is no doubt, these building operations are under way. Just look at the progress which has been made in the sphere of political separation; look at the achievements which have been made in the sphere of politics. Sir, I want to say this to the hon. the Minister: He deserves a vote of thanks and appreciation not only for this clear policy line which he indicated here to-day, but he and his officials, who have an enormous task in South Africa, deserve a vote of thanks and appreciation from every white man and from every black man in South Africa for the clear guiding lines which have up to now been laid down.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, his time; I am not denying that. I am saying that he took his time at the beginning of this debate. Sir, when he did that my mind went back to previous Ministers of Bantu Administration, because it proved at once that he was going to try to get <span class="col_3533-3534" refersTo="page_0322"/>in first and try to meet the case which he knew was coming against him by putting up all this mass of meaningless verbiage. But he was not prepared to discuss the native policy of the Government, which is the issue before us. That is the one issue which he was determined not to deal with it, nor was the hon. member who has just sat down. Do you know, Sir, that he devoted less than half a minute of his speech to an outline of Nationalist Party policy; the rest of the time he was asking policy; the rest of the time he was asking questions. Not since my eldest son was five years old have I known anybody who could ask so many questions within such a short time as the hon. member did this afternoon. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Nelspruit is in exactly the same position. Sir, they do not want to discuss their policy; that is the one thing they do not want to discuss. Then, Sir, the hon. the Minister comes along at this late stage to deal with the position that arose in the Censure debate. Let me read to you what happened on that occasion, because he took half an hour to deal with one issue, the sovereignty of Parliament. That is what he was dealing with here this afternoon. That is the issue which I put to him in the Censure debate and to which he gave his reply this afternoon. I want to read out what he said, and it is no good his trying to get away from it; he said this clearly and one of his most senior officials said to me afterwards: &#x201C;I never believed that I would hear my Minister say that there was a limitation to the sovereignty to the Parliament of South Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The Minister nods; in effect he says that Parliament is not supreme in this regard. This is a new philosophy and this is why I am so interested. Here is a Minister who is now saying that Parliament is not supreme and that Parliament cannot undo that which he has done after a certain point is reached &#x2026;</p>

<p>[Interjections] I am sorry if the Minister does not like it. I cannot help it if he does not. I am not here to tell the Minister what he likes; I am here to tell him what is Hansard whether he likes it or not. Let him stop becoming so flustered about it, whether he likes it or not&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Will the Minister be prepared to say when he anticipates that point will be <span class="col_3535-3536" refersTo="page_0323"/>reached&#x003F; He says that it has not yet been reached but it will be reached.</block>

Parliament, in the opinion of the hon. the Minister, cannot go back when he has gone so far with his development of Zululand and the Zulu Territorial Authority. The South African Parliament at that point will be powerless. That hon. Minister can commit the people and the Government of South past redemption by the Parliament of South Africa.

When I discussed the matter here on 22nd July, he said that there was a limitation on our sovereignity and I finished my speech then by asking what had happened to the sovereignty of our Parliament. Because he denied it, He limited the sovereignty of Parliament, but to-day he leaves that door closed and says there is morality. What does he know about morality in his policy towards the Bantu of South Africa&#x003F; What does he know about morality in regard to the Zulu people, when he made that speech at the opening of their territorial authority the other day. What a shocking speech he made! Did he talk about independence&#x003F; Did he tell them he was promising them independence&#x003F; Morality&#x003F; That word does not lie in the mouth of the hon. the Minister.

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it became very apparent from the speech made by the hon. member for South Coast, who has just resumed his seat, precisely in how much difficulty the United Party finds itself this afternoon. If he had looked carefully at his own Hansard and read it, he would have read the following statement there. After he had himself dealt with the questions which he had put to the hon. the Minister, he said the following, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is what we want to know. We want a clear statement from the hon. the Minister in this regard. When his Vote comes under discussion, I hope he will give us a full and detailed explanation of precisely where the people and Parliament of South Africa stand in regard to the newly constituted authority which he has created to-day.</block>

<p>Now I am asking the United Party and everybody present here to-day what the hon. the Minister did if it was not to furnish the replies under this Vote at the request of the hon. member for South Coast. If one does not have a case, one does what the hon. members did here this afternoon.</p>

<p>Now I want to point out the following. The hon. member for South Coast did not try to reply to one single question put by the hon. the Minister. He was unable to do so, and we know it. I now want to know why those hon. members are unable to reply. I think that in regard to this question, i.e. the independence of the Bantu homelands in South Africa, the United Party finds itself in a domestic crisis. They cannot evade the implications of what they have entangled themselves in. In 1959 when Dr. Verwoerd rose to his feet here in this House and, made <span class="col_3537-3538" refersTo="page_0324"/>the speech on Bantu self-government, they had the choice, but they allowed the opportunity to pass. This domestic crisis of the United Party is absolutely inevitable and unavoidable. Why&#x003F; Because the United Party has arrived, and will have to arrive at the crossroads where it will have to make its choice as soon as one of these Bantu nations gains independence in South Africa. They will do so. I am convinced that even the hon. member for Houghton will still live to see this. Why will they be confronted by this inevitable choice, and why are they trying to avoid it&#x003F; The reply is very clear, it is namely that the point of departure of the Opposition is that South Africa is &#x201C;one multi-racial people of 20 million&#x2019;&#x2019;. That is the standpoint of those hon. members.</p>

<p>If one were to ask what the basic view of the United Nations and the outside world is on the Republic of South Africa, they would say, and they do this in season and out, that South Africa consists of &#x201C;one complex society, a multi-racial state of 20 million people&#x201D;,. If we were to ask the hon. member for Houghton what her basic view on South Africa is, she would tell us, South Africa consists of &#x201C;a a multi-racial state of 20 million people&#x201D;. If one were to ask the Opposition what their basic view of South Africa is, we see that it is the same as that of the U.N., the outside world and the Progressive Party, i.e. that South Africa is a &#x201C;multi-racial and complex society consisting of 20 million people&#x201D;. Between those four there is no difference. They are four udders on the same cow, i.e. the outside world, the U.N. the Progressive Party and the United Party. All that is happening now is that the United Nations organization and the outside world are making certain deductions from this basic view and hypothesis. They stand apart, they view this matter objectively, and they are honest and because they are not directly involved in the matter, they take it to its logical consequences by advocating equality for all, regardless of colour. The Progressive Party, a little less honest, makes certain deductions from this basic hypothesis, but the United Party in its attempt to be obliging and to gain the favour of its voters so that it can regain power, finds itself the furthest driven into a corner of all these three bodies as a result of the fact that they have been carrying this basic view along with them since the days of the old Domion Party. This is the choice facing the Opposition, and they are welcome to laugh about it if they want to. The fact of the matter is that the United Party, in respect of our relationships policy, has never severed the umbilical cord linking it to its past. That is why the United Party finds itself in this position.</p>

<p>Now, as the hon. the Minister said, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is beginning to see these things. He is the restless anticipator and the hon. member for South Coast is the stubborn recalcitrant. Now the United Party finds itself caught in a position from which it cannot extricate itself. We on this side of the House have great respect for the hon. member for Zululand, and I, personally, also have great respect for him because in my opinion he is an honest politician. He was the only one on that side of the House who tried to furnish a reply to a very important question, i.e. whether the United Party, if they were to come into power, would undo what had been accomplished with the Bantu homelands and what their policy in that regard was. If I understood him corrently, he said something more or less to this effect: &#x201C;That we will repeal or modify anything&#x201D; if it were opposed to the concept of one nation in South Africa.</p>

<p>It is an extremely important reply which we are now getting from hon. members on the opposite side. An honest politician states that if any of the Bantu homelands were to receive independence &#x2026; [Interjections.] The United Party has a terrible problem. The hon. member for Zululand has just this moment, and in the presence of everyone here in the House, admitted and stated that I was interpreting him correctly and that if some of these Bantu homelands were to gain their independence, they would &#x201C;repeal or modify&#x201D; it if they should come into power. [Interjections.] If the hon. the Opposition does not want &#x201C;repeal or modify&#x201D; it, they must then tell us what they will do with a Bantu nation living in a homeland which has obtained its independence. What will they do&#x003F; We will afford hon. members on the opposite side another opportunity so that they can make it clear to us what their policy in regard to this <span class="col_3539-3540" refersTo="page_0325"/>important matter is. Then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout must also tell us how he explains his standpoint in regard to this matter. We have reached the crossroads of relations politics in South Africa. The United Party is going to come up hard against this principle and consistency of the Government in respect of the honest, fair, just and Christian manner, based on sound principles, with which we are applying our policy of multinational development. They cannot escape it. Why not&#x003F; Because they will have to agree with me that it is clear that in Southern Africa, in the seventies, there is no future other than the mutual and inter-related co-operation of Southern African states with each other. Surely this goes without saying, and the hon. Opposition cannot dispute it. How is one going to achieve co-operation among these States, including Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Malawi and others which may still be added, if one is not prepared to give, that right of self-determination to the Transkei as well, our own Xhosa people, to the Zulus, to the Tswanas and to all the other peoples&#x003F; How can one reconcile those two things&#x003F; It is quite impossible and one can never do so.

<p>Mr. Chairman, to anyone who has been following the debate up to now, it must be clear that we have been speaking at cross purposes. The United Party or any other party that comes into power may obviously change laws regarding matters over which this Parliament still has jurisdiction. Therefore, if Parliament still has jurisdiction over the Transkei and Zululand when any party assumes the reins of government, that party has the power to amend or repeal laws regarding those territories. [Interjections.] Ten minutes pass very quickly and there is a great deal to which I want to reply. Surely this is clear, and this is the only thing hon. members on this side of the House are saying. We add to that, however, that when a territory has become independent and has been removed from the jurisdiction if Parliament, this Parliament can do nothing about that; it cannot revoke that. What is this argument about&#x003F; It is a sclear as daylight. We have never denied that the matter is over and done with once a territory such as the Transkei has acquired the same international position as Lesotho, and that this party, if it should come into power, will have nothing to say about that.</p>

A great deal has been said here about independence. That is the point at issue now. As I understand it, the policy of the Government is that a territory such as the Transkei should have the right to become independent. He must tell me whether this is so. Dr. Verwoerd said in one interview after the other, <i>inter alia,</i> in the one with Field Marshal Montgomery, &#x201C;I am not saying those territories should leave South Africa and become independent; all I am saying is that they should have the right to become independent&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but there is a difference between the two matters. Let us for once and all get the Bantu debate on a sound basis and let the Government tell us exactly what it means. We shall be prepared to say what we mean. In other words, in that case the question is not that they will be pushed from the jurisdiction of South Africa but that they have the right to become independent. That right of becoming independent is based, according to the leaders before them, on the right of self-determination. In other words, if I understand this correctly, those territories will have the right to say whether they want to become independent or not. We, as a responsible Opposition, should also take notice of the wishes of those people. There are no representatives of the non-white peoples in this House. We cannot simply adopt the point of view that they want to become independent. There is the right of self-determination. Therefore, I want to ask the hon. the Minister if the Bantu do not have that right of self-determination already, at this <span class="col_3541-3542" refersTo="page_0326"/>very moment, when does that right of self-determination become operative&#x003F; Does Parliament, or do those people, have the final say&#x003F; At what point shall we know when the right of self-determination becomes operative&#x003F; I see here in the Government&#x2019;s standpoint a contradiction between independence and the right of self-determination.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>We have always recognized the right of self-determination. I want to go further and ask the hon. the Minister this. When the right of self-determination becomes operative, how will he have that right exercized&#x003F; Will he have that right exercized by the entire people, for example, of the Transkei&#x003F; This is very important, because at present the Parliament of the Transkei is not elected entirely by the Xhosa people, wherever they may be living in South Africa.

If the day had to come when the right of self-determination was being exercized by the Parliament that was not representative of the Xhosa people, we would have created a very dangerous situation for ourselves.</p>

<p>Will it be exercized through the voice of all the Xhosa&#x003F; If a parliament that is not representative of all the Xhosa, because many of its members are still nominated, has to decide to withdraw from the Republic, the descendants of the Xhosa will always be able to say, &#x201C;We have been fooled. We as a people never took that decision&#x201D;. I am prepared to concede that if the majority of the Xhosa in South Africa were to decide to-day that they wanted to withdraw from the Republic, we would be faced with a situation where we would have to take the wishes of those people into consideration in all seirousness. We want the Minister&#x2019;s reply in this regard. When we have had that, we shall be able to continue with the debate.</p>

<p>There are a few points which the hon. the Minister mentioned. In the first place he rejected the challenge of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. At the same time he also rejected the invitation of the hon. the Minister of Finance by adopting the attitude that businessmen who came to talk to him, should come to the Government only &#x201C;to learn&#x201D;. The Leader of the Opposition gave the Government an opportunity of placing its cards on the table. I want to tell the Minister that if he ever wants to have any hope of making the ideas for which his party stands acceptable to the people, they should not be afraid to reveal the full consequences thereof in the political and economic fields. It never goes any further than words, intentions and formulas. Not once has one hon. member on that side said, &#x201C;Here are the full consequences of what we want to do; we are submitting them to the people&#x201D;. The attempt made by the Leader of the Opposition is also rejected. Will the Minister explain the full consequences to us&#x003F;</p>

<p>We have heard a great deal about multinationalism and multi-racialism. I can probably bring 100 quotations of leaders of that side in which they have used the word &#x201C;multiracialism&#x201D; in connection with South Africa. Even the present Prime Minister has used it. It has been used in official documents of South Africa. Our standpoint is that there is no difference between the two. We are multiracial and we are also multi-national. I should like to indicate where hon. members on the opposite side go wrong. They attack the Leader of the Opposition on a legalism. They attack him on a constitutional concept. When we as Afrikaans-speaking people speak of &#x201C;volke&#x201D; (peoples) and &#x201C;nasies&#x201D; (nations), we confuse the words. For example, we speak of the &#x201C;Boerenasie&#x201D; (Boer nation) and we also speak of the &#x201C;Afrikanervolk&#x201D; (Afrikaner people).</p>

<p>No, the Tomlinson Report does not. The Tomlinson Report states that those people can obtain their independence within their own homelands and develop accordingly. I now want to deal with this federation plan. We have many peoples in South Africa, of which 19.6 per cent are Whites, 10.6 per cent are Coloureds, 3.1 per cent are Asiatics and 66.7 per cent are Bantu peoples. That 66.7 per cent of the Bantu peoples is divided up into the following ethnic groups: the Transkei Xhosa, totalling 16.1 per cent, the Ciskei Xhosa totalling 3.7 per cent, the Zulu people totalling 18.5 per cent, the Tswana totalling 7 per cent, the Southern Sotho totalling 7 per cent, the Northern Sotho totalling 6.2 per cent, the Shangaan and the Tsonga totalling 2.4 per cent, the Swazi totallig 1.9 per cent, the Southern Ndebele totalling 1.9 per cent, the Venda totalling 1.6 per cent and the other groups totalling 4 per cent. In the United Party&#x2019;s policy they propose that 8 representatives be given in this Parliament to the Bantu people, consisting of about 13 7 million people. The hon. member knows that this House of Assembly consists of 166 members, representing in this Parliament 19.6 per cent of the population of the Republic of South Africa. In a federal House of Assembly the 10.6 per cent of the Coloured population would be represented by six people, the Asiatics, totalling 3.1 per cent, by two people, and the Bantu peoples, totalling 66.7 per cent, by eight people. According to the United Party&#x2019;s ideas the 66.7 per cent of the Bantu peoples are subdivided into 10 historically ethnic-divided peoples. How does the United Party suggest should these eight representatives in this House be divided up among the Bantu peoples&#x003F; This question was put clearly to the United Party when, in the Langlaagte election, I published a pamphlet in which I stated that the logical consequence would be that these 66.7 per cent of the Bantu peoples in South Africa would not be satisfied to have eight representatives. Mr. Chairman, can you imagine how the United Party will allocate these people&#x003F; How are these eight representatives going to be elected&#x003F; Are 16.1 per cent of the Xhosa going to obtain one representative, or will the Venda population of 1.6 per cent also obtain one representative&#x003F; Eventually there would be a Parliament in the Transkei, another one in Zululand, one in Tswanaland, and one in Vendaland, and in each of the other countries which is eventually going to become independent. We want to know how the United Party is going to divide them up. The United Party says that the 20 million people of South Africa will be represented in this Parliament. I then want to ask whether 66.7 per cent of the people will forever be satisfied with just eight representatives in this House of Assembly, when 10.6 per cent of the population, i.e. the Coloureds, is given six representatives, and the 3.1 per cent Asiatics are given two representatives&#x003F; Sir, surely it does not make sense; there is no logic to it all. The logical consequence is going to be that 66.7 per cent of these people are going to revolt in South Africa, and you must remember that those people are going to sit in this House. You are going to create a legal forum here for those people to agitate and say: &#x201C;Why must we, who constitute 66.7 per cent of the population, be satisfied with eight representatives in this House, while you, who constitute 19.6 per cent of the population, obtain 166 representatives&#x003F;&#x201D; Sir, you must not forget that those eight representatives, who are going to sit here, are going to be people of the calibre of the hon. member for Houghton, of the calibre of Sam Kahn who was here previously, of Margaret Ballinger and people of that kind. That is what those eight representatives are going to be like. We know them, after all; we know what kind of people will be elected. They are going to be the people who will represent 10.6 per cent of the population, i.e. the Coloureds; also the people who are going to represent 3.1 per cent of the population,<span class="col_3545-3546" refersTo="page_0328"/>i.e. the Asiatics. One would have an agitation block here which is going to agitate unanimousely that more representatives be given to those people and that their representation should be <i>pro rata</i> in respect of the representation of the 19.6 per cent of the population of South Africa, i.e. the Whites. Sir, if those people did not agitate for that they would be the biggest political fools in South Africa. Of course they would agitate for that. How is the United Party going to satisfy the world with that kind of representation; how are they going to satisfy the U.N.; how are they going to satisfy the hon. member for Houghton&#x003F; No, Sir, we want clarity about the federal policy of the United Party. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, and other members on that side who are still going to speak, must clarify this matter for us. Sir, the National Party has a clear, consistent policy of multi-national development in South Africa; it is logical; it is moral; it is ethical and it is of a high standard.</p>

<p>Sir, I just want to dwell for a moment on the point which the hon. the Minister mentioned, i.e. that there is an economic committee, which was established as a sub-committee of the Bantu Affairs Commission to work out the further development in the homelands. I am fortunate in being a member of that committee, and I want to say that the committee, under the chairmanship of Prof. Lombard, will shortly make its recommendations to the Minister in respect of the economic development of the Bantu homelands. Emphasis is being placed, in particular, on the practical settlement of the Bantu ethnic units in their homelands. A comprehensive task, which required a lot of study and research, has virtually been completed. The committee is already engaged in final recommendations to the Minister, and we hope to be able to submit them to him within a tolerable space of time. The settlement task will be a comprehensive one. The purpose is to make a determined and co-ordinated attack on this problem, through a maximum effort in terms of money and manpower.

<p>I have listened for more than an hour to a speech of the hon. the Minister which I thought he would make at the beginning of his Vote and not at the end, and I also listened to the hon. the Deputy Minister, and the whole affair is a big smokescreen in an endeavour to drive a wedge between the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, the hon. member for South Coast and other hon. members. Then there were such elementary questions. If we were now to come into power, what would we do with the constitutional rights, or the right of administration, which have thus far been given to the reserves&#x003F; And then there was another question, and there the hon. the Deputy Minister was actually in his element. Once a country is sovereign and independent, would we try to destroy this by means of this Parliament&#x003F; I cannot imagine a more ridiculous question. If a country has obtained its sovereign independence we have no control or jurisdiction over it; it may do as it likes, and that has nothing to do with us. But with all these smokescreens we do not come to the cardinal point, and that is that if we have 14 million Bantu in the year 1970, and if by projection we shall have 30 million Bantu in the year 2000, with all this Government&#x2019;s idealism and ideology, this Minister will be the first to admit that with the best efforts of the Whites here in South Africa, those areas, which have been allocated to them, will not be able to contain half of them.</p>

What applies to the one applies to the other. But I want to come back to the practical point and ask where, in the year 2000, even though eight independent sovereign areas have been created, covering 12 per cent of the land in South Africa, with an additional 1.6 million morgen which must go to them&#x2014;making it 13 per cent in all&#x2014;will these 30 million people work, eat and live&#x003F; For whom do they work&#x003F; And do you know, Sir, what this Minister said&#x003F; He simply said that the white area in South Africa would prosper to such an extent, and its economy would be so strong that it could pay for the development of those areas, m order to make them self-sufficient, that is what he said.

It was because we say that all the Bantu, or the overall majority of them, will have to work in the Republic of South Africa.

Since when&#x003F; Who advocated that&#x003F; We have never advocated uncontrolled employment. We advocated controlled employment of the labour which industry and commerce needs, on the basis that we shall discuss with the trade unions where they can work and in what categories they can work.

<p>I did not speak of the highest rung of industry. You are now accusing me falsely. I spoke of the categories in which they could be employed, whether in the Post Office, the motor industry or the engineering industry. If those categories in which the Bantu could be employed in the Republic of South Africa, are determined in co-operation with the trade unions, it is our duty to ensure that he is available, because if this is not done then the economy weakens, and if the economy weakens, we do not have the money which the Minister wants in order to help the Bantustans along. I pointedly want to ask the question, and the Minister must reply to it. Where must that shortage of 6,000 workers in the engineering industry come from&#x003F; The Minister, the Minister of Labour or the Prime Minister will have to tell us. How does he want to supplement them&#x003F; And that is only one industry. As if we do not know that in the engineering industry every qualified person has a crowd of black people working next to him and learning how to do this work. Through doing this work they learn increasingly more and become increasingly usable in the economy. Let us, after all, be reasonable in this connection. Not every person needs to be qualified as an engineer in order to play a part in engineering. Usage is also something whereby a person learns. Where did we all learn to do these things in engineering that we do as practical farmers&#x003F; In no other way but by doing them. And this remains a fact that is as plain as a pikestaff. The Minister tells us that the economy can grow and become even stronger, but the Whites will have to learn to get along without the Bantu, because the Bantu areas would be so prosperous that there will no longer be Bantu available to the Whites. That is only a dream, a smokescreen, that will get us nowhere. It has no correlation in practice. It is simply a dream that he is dreaming. But the hon. the Minister goes even further, and this surprised me. He spoke of the wonderful dream that he sees in respect of the white area; the Republic of South Africa is a white man&#x2019;s country, and then an hon. member on this side asked, by way of an interjection, but what of the Coloureds&#x003F; And do you know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply was&#x003F; We want a Republic without the Coloureds. It is not the Coloured Vote we are discussing now, but the Bantu Administration Vote, but if a Minister goes as far as saying on his Vote, and in connection with the Bantu, that we want a Republic that is devoid of Bantu labour, in other words a Republic that eliminates all non-Whites, then we have reached the stage where things are so ridiculous that we cannot speak about them any further.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) dealt with a few matters here, and with your permission I shall first reply to his last statement, where he said that Bantu will no longer be available for work in the Republic of South Africa and for the sale of their labour here. I want to tell the hon. member that it is a misrepresentation of the policy which has been adhered to until now and which shall also be adhered to in the future. We would welcome it if South Africa could develop in such a way that only Whites worked in the white Republic, but this will never happen because the Bantu will always make his labour available in the Republic, not only for the benefit of the economy of the Whites, but most certainly also, and to a very large extent, for the benefit of the Bantu himself. That is why this idea, which the hon. member expressed here, is really very childish, to say the least. The hon. member was actually advocating a form of integration, and I believe that if the United Party were to come into power it would immediately begin with a policy of integration, because, after all, they reject this National Party policy of job reservation. But what the Opposition also loses sight of is that if we want to develop the Bantu homelands until they become independent and self-sufficient, who else is there, other than the Whites, to bring them the knowledge, the expertise, the technical knowledge and the academic knowledge, etc.&#x003F; This must surely come from the Whites. I do not know why this hon. Opposition is so grievously hurt by those matters. However, I have other ideas. I regret having to express this idea here, but I think that there is something else underlying this kind of game. They want the Bantu in the white area, and they also want to give them a measure of franchise, even though it be a qualified kind of representation. What will they eventually use the Bantu vote for&#x003F; They will use it to do what they have already said in the past they would like to do, i.e. to plough the National Party under.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I think it is the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s underlying idea. I want to speak <span class="col_3549-3550" refersTo="page_0330"/>about another matter. In the censure motion debate the hon. the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the question of the Bantu&#x2019;s proprietary right. I think I had better quote, because then the House will gain a better understanding of what I mean by that. They say, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must remember that it is in the name of apartheid, or separate development, that many negative and oppressive things are done.</block>

<p>Since the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; was used for the first time here in South Africa, the Opposition and the English language press have made it their aim to make a monster of this word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; and later &#x201C;separate development&#x201D;&#x2014;every one surely meant throughout that apartheid means separate development Since it was broadcast to the world that that meaning attaches to the word &#x201C;aparheid&#x201D;, the world has increasingly intensified its opinion against us in such a critical attitude that to-day we find its opinion against us in such a critical attitude that to-day we find that the World Council of Churches has decided to assist terrorists who are being used against us. As a result of what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said another idea was expressed here about our apartheid policy and about how monstrous it is. With reference to land tenure he went further and referred to the 1936 legislation in which the promise was made. The hon. the Prime Minister pointed out that the establishment of the Progressive Party was attributable to the United Party&#x2019;s breach of faith at the Bloemfontein congress, when they said that they did not want to make the land available to the Bantu. Now we repeatedly have them mentioning the question of land tenure here in a debate. It has already been laid down by way of legislation, but this argument is used by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition because Matanzima and Buthelezi have already referred to it. What is wrong with that&#x003F; When any of the ethnic people move along this road, and they definitely are doing so, they will try to obtain whatever territory they possibly can. Living space is, after all, necessary, but we already have legislation laying it down.</p>

<p>Those arguments are used to imply that this could cause a revolution in the future. I ask the United Party, if that policy which was advocated by the hon. member for Yeoville, that proprietary rights would be granted within the white area, were to be implemented, would there not also be subsequent demands for larger and larger property ownership&#x003F; What would then be the difference between the Bantu who wants more and more property ownership in the white areas and the one who, in his own Bantustan, already thinks he may ask for more&#x003F; What will the eventual difference be&#x003F; We must accept it as such, The difference is that those who have now asked for more territory are doing so under the guidance of the whites. The whites have led them along the road to independence, have led them along the road to where they can administer their own affairs and work out their own salvation. On the other hand the United Party has been guilty of the greatest measure of discrimination towards these Bantu peoples. If there is one aspect of this situation, in which we find ourselves to-day, that will cause a revolution to take place, then it is the policy of the United Party, which allows a certain measure of discriminatory representation in this white Parliament. The hon. the Minister also stated it very clearly here. According to the National Party&#x2019;s policy we do not begrudge the Bantu development towards total independence along his own road. Any person with the smallest amount of intelligence can realize that one cannot immediately give peoples such as the Tswana or the Southern Sotho their independence. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked very dramatically in this House when it would be D-Day. A people surely develops systematically. Did it not take the Afrikaner nation 51 years, i.e. from 1910 to 1961, to make, South Africa free independent Republic&#x003F; I think that throughout the years the white man had a great deal more knowledge at his disposal than the Bantu peoples have. They will also have to walk the path to full maturity. Who is going to hasten that process&#x003F; No-one. By way of the assistance the Whites are giving the Bantu to-day, as is the case in terms of the National Party&#x2019;s policy, we know that that road is the right one. It is not the road of revolution. The Opposition speaker who follows me up must explain to me and offer me proof that this road which the National Party is following is the road to revolution, in contrast to the road being followed by the United Party. The National Party at least has the honesty to tell, not only this House, but also the people of South Africa and the whole world, that our final objective, with respect to the Bantu, is independence. That is the task. It is morally right, good and Christian. However, the road of the United Party leads us to a precipice.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Harrismith had a few things to say that I just want to dwell upon for a moment. He said, for example, that on this side of the House we had made a monster of apartheid. I think that the hon. member has got it slightly wrong, and that what he actually meant was that apartheid has made a skunk of South Africa. That is probably what he heard. It was not the United Party that said it either, but the <i>Burger.</i> The <i>Burger</i> said that aparthedi had made a skunk of South Africa, and not that we had made a monster of apartheid. However, I want to say something of a more serious nature to the hon. member.

Can a responsible hon. member sitting in this House have something so scandalous to say, i.e that we want to use the Bantu franchise to plough the Nationalist Party under&#x003F; If the hon. member for Harrismith has the least sense of responsibility and recognition for the goodwill of this side of the House, he surely knows that he is not only talking nonsense, but that he said a very scandalous thing. The hon. member ought to apologize for that, To speak here of the policy of integration&#x0021; He of all people ought to know, after all the years of discussion, that integration is no policy It is an economic fact, and whatever hon. members on the other side, or ourselves, say it will not offset the fact.</p>

<p>I want to dwell on a few basic ideas. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the Deputy Minister asked a lot of questions. I should just like to ask the hon. the Minister one question. He made a very important statement this afternoon about black labour being made avai1able to the white economy. The substance of his statement may be summed up as follows. He must now help me if I am wrong. He said that as far as the higher occupational levels were concerned, they would not make the Bantu available to the white economy. But as far as the lower levels of labour are concerned, he was indeed prepared to make Bantu available. Is that correct.</p>

<p>I do not really care what the hon. the Minister says about my presentation of it. All I want to say is that he must clarify it for us. The question I am putting to the hon. the Minister is that when he speaks of the higher levels of labour, to what joubs is he referring&#x003F; Is the job of motor mechanic one of the jobs at the higher level&#x003F; The hon. the Minister is now &#x201C;zip&#x201D; He does not want to listen. When are we dealing with a low-level job and when are we dealing with a high-level one&#x003F; When will the hon. the Minister be prepared to make labour available to the white economy, and for which levels of the labour field&#x003F; These days that hon. Minister is no longer only Minister of Bantu Administration and Development; he has, as it were, also become the ruler over the labour sources in South Africa. The extent to which South Africa&#x2019;s economy can develop will to a large extent depend on his policy formula, and also whether we shall be able to implement the Bantustan idea, if he wants it. He will have to tell us. The South African economy cannot get along without labour. The hon. the Minister does not reply. I shall continue.</p>

<p>The basic idea from which the Bantustan ideal emerged, the basic though underlying the idea of partition, is one that eminates from the danger of numbers. That is where the old Bantustan policy came from. The people argued that if the Bantu were to form the majority here we would not always be able to keep the reins of Government in our hands. That was the argument. Partition was therefore thought of as an attempt to deal with that danger. Now, Sir, we come to a basic question I want to put to the hon. the Minister. When the hon. the Minister tells me that his policy is one of partition, because that is what it amounts to, he must also tell me whether I am right in saying that one of the main requirements of his policy is to make the ground, the land, available for the Bantu.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before dinner I was pointing out, to give substance to the policy of separate development, that one of the prime requirements is that the Government must continue at high speed with the consolidation of the Bantu areas. I also pointed out that unless the Government could do so, they did not have a hope of succeeding with their idea of separate development. When I listen to the remarks from the other side, it seems to me as if the Government accepts that one of the main requirements is that the Bantu areas, as countries, should be consolidated.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member must just read the reports about this matter, because it is very clear that his political background is inadequate. I should like to come to a second requirement. Mindful of the numerical danger, on which the Bantustan philosophy is based, a second requirement is, in my opinion, that the Government must succeed in decreasing the number of Bantu in white areas until there are fewer Bantu than Whites in white areas. In other words, the over-all majority of Bantu must be accommodated in the Bantu areas. We know that for years now the Government has been of the same opinion. That is why they have said that 1978 is the date when the black stream will be turned back. We also know, at this stage, that nothing at all will come of that whole idea. Instead of the stream being reversed, we know that it is increasing. Let us, however, for the sake of argument. accept that the philosophy is correct and that the stream must be reversed. Regarding it from that point of view, I want to ask the hon. the Minister this evening; If he wants, to a large extent, to remove the Bantu from the white area, where is he conseauently going to find the necessary labour to keep the economic machine going in the white areas&#x003F; In order to keep the white economic machine going and also to develop the Bantu areas, it is of the utmost necessity that we have the necessary Bantu labour. Even if the hon. the Minister were to tell me that it is not necessary, and that we could also develop the Bantu areas with the white machine alone. I want to ask: What is he going to do with the Bantu he removes from here&#x003F; Where is he going to find jobs for them in the reserves&#x003F; Those areas will first have to be developed. If the Government wants to be fair they must accept that it has to be an extremely long-term policy, if it ever succeeds. Now the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration asks: &#x201C;What are you going to do when independence comes&#x003F;&#x201D; Sir, the hon. the Minister has not yet even begun with the realities of independence. He does not have the right to ask that question here. At this stage it is nothing more than a hypothetical question, which contains not the slightest element of political truth. We could continue in this vein. If we remove the Bantu from here, the Whites cannot get along without them to keep the machine going. If the Bantu is removed to his area, another machine must be created for him there, in which he must be able to participate in order to live. The Whites do not only have a responsibility to themselves. They also have a responsibility to the Bantu. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>He also repeated a few statements which the hon. member made earlier this evening. In the course of what I have to say I shall come back to that. The interesting aspect of this debate is that the United Party is only now coming to the rude awakening that we are now in the midst of a constitutional development which can be described as the constitutional emancipation of the Bantu homelands. This emancipation has taken place so peacefully that the reaction of those hon. members this evening puts in one mind of Rip van Winkel. The National Party, as represented by the hon. the Minister and his predecessors, could handle this constitutional development because they, and ourselves, have the experience of how constitutional changes can be brought about in a peaceful way. Was it not the National Party which took part in the Imperial Conference of 1926&#x003F; Was it not the National Party that helped to engineer the Statute of Westminister of 1931. whereby the Colonial Laws Validity Act was repealed and followed by the Status Acts&#x003F; Hon. members ought to know that the steps towards independence of the Republic of South Africa were taken by negotiation and agreement. This will also be the course that will be adopted in leading the Bantu homelands to independence. Those agreements that we shall conclude with the Bantu homelands will rest on mutual trust and an inter-dependence, dictated and demanded by the collective, strategic and geographic circumstances. It is possible in practice that agreements similar to the Simonstown Agreement, can be concluded between ourselves and the homelands.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand made a number of statements in the no-confidence debate against which he wanted to test the viability of the Bantu homelands. The hon. member for Maitland wanted replies to them. It is surprising that the hon. member for Zululand made a few highly intelligent statements, exceptional for that side of the House, but when <span class="col_3555-3556" refersTo="page_0333"/>he comes to the conclusion that the Bantu homelands policy, tested against its requirements, is not viable, he is using altogether superficial arguments. Those arguments do not support his conclusions. For example, he referred to the question of territory. In that connection the hon. member asked: Is it possible that the economy of the Bantu homelands will be able to support that Bantu population&#x003F; The hon. member took no cognisance of easily obtainable and self-evident information. We know, for example, that although the Bantu homelands will eventually cover approximately 13.7 per cent of our total land area, those homelands are situated in areas within a climatic belt which is highly beneficial to development. Only &#x00BD; per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the Republic&#x2019;s desert climate is located within the Bantu areas. The republic only possesses 11&#x00BD; million morgen of the moderate, humid climate which is regarded as the world&#x2019;s most productive climate. Almost half of this, i.e. 5,700,000 morgen, is situated in the Bantu homelands. An analysis has indicated that 100 morgen in the Bantu areas has, on the average, the same potential as 147 morgen in the white areas. About 75 per cent of the Bantu area receives a rainfall of more than 20 inches a year, while 35 per cent of the Republic is blessed with such a rainfall. It is very interesting to rote that the Transkei alone is 506 square miles larger than Switzerland. The Transkei, with a population in 1965 of about 3 million people, has a surface area of 16,500 square miles, while Israel must accommodate a population of 2 million on a surface area of 7,992 square miles. Sir, the hon. member for Zululand took his argument further and specifically drew the line back to Zululand. I want to tell him immediately that this side of the House is burdened with the task of correcting past mistakes in Natal. It was the antecedents of members on that side of the House whose policy it was to divide and rules it was they who brought about the dispersion of more than 100 small groups of Zulu over the whole surface area of Natal.</p>

<p>It is the result of their policy of dividing and ruling, and it is now the task of this side of the House to correct it. Sir, when the hon. member came to the conclusion that those areas are not viable, did he take proper cognisance of scientific analyses&#x003F; I refer here, for example, to an article in the <i>Journal of Racial Affairs,</i> in a recent issue of which they come to the conclusion that those areas afforded the entire Zulu population of Natal sufficient subsistence potential. Thereupon the hon. member for Zululand put forward a further requirement. I am not going to dwell on all his requirements now. He said that firstly a territory should exist which can form the basis of a state. You know surely, Mr. Chairman, that we have the example of a country such as Portugal, which administers a state by means of provinces. In other words, even if no consolidation took place in Natal, it is not impossible, where we have a central homeland, for the other areas to be administered as provinces or as areas independent of the main area. This is altogether practicable.</p>

<p>Although we acknowledge the ideal of having the greatest possible consolidation, we shall ensure, where it is required in practice, that administration takes place properly by way of a main central homeland, with its provinces or sub-units. Sir, I refer also to a further requirement which the hon. member put forward. He said: Fourthly, have the Bantu themselves accepted that all their interests&#x2014;material, social, spiritual and political&#x2014;are really centred in that territory&#x003F; He comes to the conclusion that this is not the case, but at the same time he said in his speech (translation): &#x201C;I believe that an exclusively white state, if this could be achieved under reasonable circumstances, will be almost generally accepted&#x201D;. From this I conclude that it will also be accepted by the Bantu, if the ideal of such an exclusive white state can be achieved. I do not know what the hon. member will say to that. Since I am asking the hon. member to give us greater clarity about certain of his standpoints, he could perhaps also tell us what he meant when he said that. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Sir. as a backbencher I listened to the speech of the hon. the Minister with a certain amount of amazement and disillusionment. One has come to expect that in speaking to a Vote the Minister in charge will at least give an account of the work of his department during the past year. There are few persons in South Africa more involved in the Minister&#x2019;s portfolio than the Bantu themselves in this country. I think it is fair to say that economists, housewives, other South Africans and the Bantu have been waiting for some time to hear the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to criticism of his policy. Sir, I would like to test the Minister&#x2019;s success in handling his department against four of the recommendations contained in the Tomlinson report and to see to what extent the Minister has failed. The commission stated that the initial step towards the practical realization of the separate development of European and Bantu lies in the full-scale development of the Bantu areas. Sir, that was said 15 years ago but time has telescoped for the Nationalist Party and for the hon. the Minister. The population increase is 15 years ahead of time and the implementation of the Minister&#x2019;s plans is 15 years behind the time, and all that same, practical persons such as professor Sadie are asking for is the realization of economic facts.</p>

<p>Sir, South Africa is being crippled to-day by the shortage of labour. We have the plea of the industrialists we have the plea of the farmer and we have the plea of the housewife. In the homelands themselves, what is the situation&#x003F; The Government has had some 70 Bantu towns developed&#x2014;clear evidence of the poverty and inadequacy of the Government&#x2019;s present plan for the development of the homelands. What of the border areas, Sir&#x003F; The border area plan, I suggest, is the greatest fraud that has been perpetrated in connection with separate development. All that the Government is doing is to surround our major industrial areas with a political periphery of industrialized towns to which they are bringing the Bantu from the hinterland of the reserves to the border areas, so that they can have labour which is not paid at the same rate as European labour and which can do virtually the same jobs as European labour. Sir, perhaps the greatest deceit of all lies in the Government&#x2019;s concept of developing the Bantu areas with their rich mining fortunes. Sir, let me quote from a Government brochure, <i>Bantu</i> of August 1970&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Money from Home: Mining is playing an increasingly important role in promoting the economic self-sufficiency of South Africa&#x2019;s Bantu homelands and in particular of those in the Transvaal and the Northern Cape Province where nearly 57,000 Bantu are already employed in 52 operating mines.</block>

<p>But, Sir, listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The sky is the limit for the two-year-old Impala platinum mine which is already the second largest platinum mine in South Africa. The largest is Rustenburg Platinum. Situated inside a Tswana homeland about a 100 kilometres west of Pretoria, Impala produces 200,000 ounces a year and expects to be producing 300,000 ounces by the middle of 1972, almost as much as the total free world, excluding South Africa.</block>

<p>But here comes the dig&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since the homelands are Bantu territory there is no permanency attached to white mining there. Prospecting and mining leases are granted for specific periods.</block>

<p>Now, if we are going to allow the Bantu to develop their own homelands to the status of a national state and to realize their maximum economic power, they must have social development, economic development and home development. Here we are again seeing a case of exploitation of the Native where the riches will come to South Africa and a mere pittance will go to the homelands. What will happen when the day comes when the Bantu homelands are no longer part of our South Africa but are dissociated from us&#x003F; Do they take their mining wealth with them&#x003F; I hope the Minister will give an answer as to whether they will take the Mines and Works Act with them too and whether he will declare that he is prepared to see them have the same economic future that we in white South Africa have.</p>

<p>The challenge to-day is a real one. The economist is waiting for an answer. The country is stifled and we cannot to-day meet our balance of payments because of our lack of economic development. [Interjections.] I submit that our adverse balance of payments is probably the most fundamental question threatening the development of the homelands. It is easy to have an economic idealization, but where are the funds coming from in order to develop the homelands at the rate at which they should be developed&#x003F; It is no good to say that we have sat in power for 22 years and to say, as the hon. the Minister has said himself, that the time will come; we are not in a hurry and the problem will solve itself. White South Africa to-day is short of time. The economy is short of time and we have to have an answer which is practical politics, the politics of the people outside, and the answer must come from the Minister and not in promises for the future which he cannot fulfil.</p>

<p>It makes no difference which; it amounts to the same thing. But I want to return to the so-called &#x201C;point of no return&#x201D;. Hon. members on that side of the House stated to-day that we were going to reach a &#x201C;point of no return&#x201D;. I recall that the late Dr. Verwoerd said in this House one afternoon&#x2014;I am speaking under correction now, but I think it was at the time the Transkeian Constitution was being discussed&#x2014;that a right once given could never be taken back. It might have been before then, but I am talking under correction now. That is why, when this right has been given, to the Transkei for example, we can never take it back again. We can never take back the right to self-government of the Transkei. The Transkei is self-governing and it would be morally wrong of us to take it back. Legally we have the sovereignty to take it back, but morally we would never be able to do so. It is not in the nature of our population to take a thing like that back. I want to accuse the United Party to-night of advocating a policy of eternal white supremacy in South Africa. If they are not in favour of eternal white supremacy, they must quite simply be in favour of integration. I want to prove to hon. members that what I have said here is the truth. During the recent election a great deal of propagande was made, and one of the porpagandistic tricks they used, and quite successfully too, was that there was not much difference between our policy and the policy of the United Party. Then they say that the policies are more or less the same, except that the Government is not genuine in its policy of eventual right of self-determination for the reserves. The hon. member for Hillbrow said it here in the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow said, and I quote: &#x201C;Dr. Dennis Worral recently conducted a study in which he found that less than 30 per cent of the voters who were included in his spot check believed that the Government was going to grant independence to the black states it was creating. What a shocking accusation against the Government which has been in power for more than 20 years!&#x201D;. They create the impression outside that we are not genuing. in other words, that we are being dishonest in our policy. That is why I am accusing the United Party of heading for permanent white supremacy with their plan to have eight representatives for the Bantu here in this House. How can they for all time, as has already been mentioned here this afternoon, support 16 million people with eight white representatives in this House&#x003F; Here I have with me this &#x201C;Goat fodder booklet&#x201D; <i>(bokvreetboekie</i>) as the hon. member for Parow called it, and I want to quote from it. Here is their policy, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">United Party policy differs basically from Nationalist policy because our policy accepts the facts and specifically plans to deal with the problems arising from these facts.</block>

<p>A moment ago that hon. member spoke about labour. I am quoting further, particularly in that connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Farmers businessmen, industrialists, householders, all need Bantu labour and will always need it.</block>

<p>We admit this, but on a migrant labour basis and not on a permanent basis. That is the crux of the difference between them and us. We believe that the homelands must be developed to the full consequences but they believe in developing the homelands without the blacks that are to-day residing in the White area. In South Africa the homelands are in the exceptionally privileged position that they are situated in our midst and on our borders, so that they can make use of the dynamic economic growth of the white areas. They can derive benefit from this. If Lesotho for example had been situated in any other place in Africa, it would have found itself in an entirely different position. Since 1896 the excess population of Lesotho has systematically been flowing over into the white areas, with the result that to-day there are many Basutos living in the white Republic of South Africa. Now the United Party wants to do the same in regard to the present overflow from the reserves into the white areas. Every population must accept its own responsibility. One day, when we are over-populated, we must simply emigrate from here. If Holland is over-populated, the people must emigrate, but the Hollanders are most certainly not overflowing into France and Germany. They are properly controlled when they emigrate. Here in South Africa we cannot accept that we must absorb the surpluses from the reserves in the white areas. That is why we have reserves, and that is why the reserves must be developed. We admit that things will develop slowly, and we know that it will take a long time, but despite that the reserves will ultimately supply the needs of their own people. As the hon. member on the opposite side put it, the reserves are the most fertile parts with the best rainfall in South Africa, and that is why they will be able to supply the needs of their own people.</p>

He spoke about a &#x201C;point of no return&#x201D;, which brought us again to the speech by the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister gave us a recipe for failure tonight. The hon. the Minister did not in any way reply to accusations from hon. members on this side of the House that no foundation had been laid for continuing the movement towards so-called freedom. In the censure debate the hon. member for Zululand set out five points which were absolutely necessary as a basis for any such continuation. In the same debate, and also in the Budget debate, my hon. Leader pointed out what was necessary as a basis for any continuation of such a policy. Without furnishing any replies to these fundamental matters, hon. members on the opposite side merely say that &#x201C;they are pressing on&#x201D;. As we would say in English, &#x201C;we press on regardless&#x201D;. That is precisely the position in which we have now found ourselves. The Government does not in any way have the answers to our problems. It does have a policy, but the policy does not have any bearing whatsoever on the actual facts of our situation. However, because the Government sees no other way open to it, it is merely pressing on regardless. It has been said by their own people that the Bantu must be &#x201C;siphoned back&#x201D; (teruggesuig), to the reserves. What does &#x201C;siphoned back&#x201D; (teruggesuig) mean&#x003F; It means that avenues of employment will have to be created in the homelands to keep the Bantu there in that way. Hon. members on the opposite side have also said that the Bantu must look forward to that, and must direct their gaze at the homelands and that all their interests can be incorporated there and a satisfactory solution found. Without that background, however, the Government merely wants to press on regardless. It might sound fine to say that a common market similar to that in Europe will be established and that we will conclude a treaty with any Bantu state which develops to full independence. It might sound fine to say that everything will take place in an orderly fashion and that we will always be able to cope with the situation. There is a saying which goes &#x201C;there&#x2019;s many a slip twixt cup and lip&#x201D;. In the times in which we are living, this is very true. By opening a door on our east coast in this way, I want to submit that our enemies will find it very easy to get at us through it. It is, however, not my intention to elaborate on this matter now.</p>

<p>I want to return now to the matter of the urban Bantu.</p>

<p>This will happen if the Government continues with its policy. During the Budget debate my hon.</p>

<p>Leader said that the Government must stop acting as if their policy were succeeding. I just want to mention a few cases where they are doing so to the detriment of relations in South Africa. They are proceeding on the basis that the policy is succeeding. In the first instance I want to mention the question of the housing shortage for Bantu in our major cities. The Government is acting as if we have already effected a physical separation and as if there are no more Bantu here. Take Johannesburg for example. There is a tremendous shortage of housing in Johannesburg. What is the result&#x003F; We find that one, two and three families are living in a house which was built for only one family.</p>

<p>But it is true. It is stated in newspapers and has been officially announced.

I am asking the hon. the Minister to furnish us with that figure to-night. How great is the shortage really&#x003F;</p>

<p>We know this on the basis of the facts. I know that it will not be possible to deny this. But the Government is proceeding on the basis that this is not so. I want to remind hon. members on the opposite side of the fact that at one time they claimed credit for having established this housing. I now want to ask them to what extent they have actually slowed down the construction of houses in recent times. I want to ask them this, because they are proceeding on the assumption that the people are not here and are not going to remain here, and that consequently we need not build houses for them. I want to inform the hon. the Minister that many of the unpleasant conditions which occur in the so-called white sectors of our major cities are owing to the fact that there is no housing for the Bantu. That is why they creep in to live with their friends in backyards in the white parts of the city. That is not all. We are experiencing other difficulties as well.</p>

<p>I want to make haste and deal with the second matter. I now want to draw attention to a second aspect, i.e. the channels of representation of the urban Bantu in getting their case put. In terms of the Urban Bantu Councils Act provision is made for them to have these township councils and that they may also be granted powers now to regulate their own affairs. <i>Inter alia,</i> they may regulate this question of influx control. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister: What has become of his policy of transferring powers now into the hands of these urban Bantu councils&#x003F; It <span class="col_3563-3564" refersTo="page_0337"/>is government policy that these Urban Bantu Councils be established. They are definitely part of the whole policy in respect of urban Bantu.</p>

<p>I read the Act again to-night. If that is not the precise provision, it is more or less the same. I therefore want to ask him what his intention is with these Urban Bantu Councils. Is it his intention to allow them to fall into disuse&#x003F; Is it his intention to breathe life into them&#x003F; What is his real problem&#x003F;</p>

<p>Now I want to come to a third question, namely that of the hostels. It seems to me that the present plan of the Government is to remove Bantu, who are at present working as servants, from the so-called servants quarters of dwellings and to place them in hostels. I definitely regard this as a retrogressive step, because in the first instance they have accommodation in these houses of their house-owners. The accommodation is already there. At whose expense are these new hostels going to be constructed&#x003F; I think it is going to be done at the Government&#x2019;s expense. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether this is the case. If so, then this expense is so much wasted money, because there is already housing for these people and consequently money is being spent unnecessarily. In addition there are many other matters which are detrimentally affected by this. In the first place, the Bantu stay with the family which employs them as servants and they live as one part of the family. This is a very good thing for their level of civilization, their personal frame of mind and happiness. When they are taken away there and placed in a large hostel with thousands of other Bantu, they find themselves in a completely impersonal environment, and I definitely think that this will be prejudicial.

<speech by="#rossouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall come back to the hon. member for Pinelands. I do not think the hon. member understands or has any knowledge of the subject he discussed to-night.</p>

<p>In the first place, allow me to thank the hon. the Minister for the fine, well-considered and lucid speech he made here to-day. For many years to come we shall have the privilege to refer to this speech, which will be recorded in Hansard. This speech presents a clear picture of the policy of the National Party as against the policy&#x2014;which nobody understands&#x2014;of the United Party. I believe that the United Party itself does not understand its policy. Every hon. member on that side of the House who gets up to speak, has something different to say. They will become so confused in the desert of their Bantu policy that they will not be able to find an oasis but will die of political thirst.</p>

<p>To make a success of this policy of ours is a major problem and a task which requires the full attention of everyone in South Africa. The policy has to be successful, because the National Party is honest in its principles. I and every hon. member on this side of the House believe that a great measure of success has already been achieved and that an even greater measure of success will be achieved in future as far as the Bantu are concerned. The development of the homelands is a most difficult process. It is something which requires a great deal of time and presents major problems. We have already achieved a great deal during the past few decades in this respect. Hon. members need only look at the results which have been achieved and the developments which have taken place. I do not think any country in the world can do what we have done. The Bantu people have to be educated. The Bantu have to be taught to love again what has been and is their own. The Zulus, who, as the people of Natal know, are a proud nation, should be brought back to the land of their fathers. Their identity should be maintained. Just as the Afrikaner, both English and Afrikaans-speaking, are proud of their identity, so the Zulus also want to maintain their identity. So the Xhosas also want to maintain their identity. So every Bantu group in the Republic wants to maintain its own identity; the Tswanas want to remain Tswanas; the Sothos want to remain Sothos and the Zulus want to remain Zulus. But is it not that side of the House which did these Bantu peoples a gross injustice by opposing the Bantu Citizenship Act&#x003F; Both English-speaking people and Afrikaans-speaking people claim for themselves their own citizenship. But when we wanted to grant citizenship to the Bantu peoples in terms of that Act the Opposition opposed it tooth and nail. I say this is scandalous. They refuse to give the Bantu something they claim for thefselves. They did not want t0 see justice being done to the Bantu people of the Republic of South Afrika.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands referred to the severe housing shortage for the Bantu. I agree with that. But at this stage there is a housing shortage for the Whites too. In cases <span class="col_3565-3566" refersTo="page_0338"/>of dire need, however, everything possible is done to provide housing of a high standard to both Whites and Bantu. The hon. member referred to cases where more than one Bantu family were living in one house. But surely the regulations applicable to any Bantu township or location prohibit three or four Bantu families from being cooped up in one house. Surely, what the hon. member said, was nonsense. There is no such thing. In addition, hostels for unmarried Bantu are being built in the cities. In these hostels they are able to live as a community. Those Bantu who are staying in these hostels live close to their work and can reach their work easily. This is a fact. Every year thousands of houses are built for the Bantu on the Witwatersrand an in other major cities in the country. Housing is being provided for them. If I were to say to-night that we had already solved the housing problem as far as the Bantu were concerned, I would be telling an untruth. This is not so. However, we are trying our best to meet the requirements of the Bantu where the need is most pressing.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the speech made by the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens). This was a speech meant for the outside world. In that speech we on this side of the House was presented as the tyrants who were suppressing the Black man in this country. The hon. member referred to Famine. Surely, that hon. member does not only confine his movements to the gardens adjoining the Parliamentary building; the hon. member probably moves further afield. We sometimes have to cope with perilous conditions in this country as a result of droughts, and so forth, and these conditions also affect the Bantu. But this is nothing compared with conditions people sometimes have to put up with in India and other countries. The Bantu of this country are being cared for. I want to ask that hon. member whether he has ever done anything for the Bantu, whether he, out of his own pocket has done anything for the Bantu or is it merely talk on his part&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. I. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>A great deal more than that hon. member will ever do. But I do not want to talk to that hon. member now. I admit that some of the Bantu are probably having a difficul time now, but the State is dome everything in its power to relief and to render assistance. Is it not this National Government which has helped Lesotho again after they have asked for assistance&#x003F; Is it not this National Government which helps Botswana when they ask for assistance&#x003F; Why should we refuse to assist our own Bantu when they need help&#x003F; Sir. I want to tell that hon. member that he made a speech here to-night which can only harm this country&#x2014;him as well as me. If the world were to crucify us one day for what we honestly believe, I shall meet my end without having any self-reproach, but that hon. member will meet his end too, but will do so with self-reproach. Sir, the National Party has every confidence in the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and in the hon. the Deputy Minister and in their officials, officials who are waging a severe struggle but who are, at the same time, waging a pleasant struggle because they can already see the signs of victory. Sir, there is one thing the United Party is as scared of as the devil is of holy water, and that is that independent homelands will become a reality. I want to say to them again to-night as the hon. the Minister has said to them on so many occasions: The Bantu homelands will become a reality and if the hon. member for East London (North) only lives that long, he will have the privilege one day to see that independent homelands have become a reality. Sir, our view of the future is not a gloomy one. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe it is very fitting that a debate on Bantu Administration and Development should be taking place on a day such as to-day when we are celebrating Settlers&#x2019; Day. I myself am a direct descendant of the 1820 Settlers, and that it why I am particularly interested in this Bantu Vote. This Vote deals not only with the Bantu in many parts of the Republic but particularly also with Bantu in an area which was occupied by the 1820 Settlers and where a Bantu homeland is now been established. Sir, it is very significant, after 22 or 23 years of National Party rule, that we should be hearing so much about the development of the border areas; that we should be hearing so much about border industries. This is evidence, this is positive proof, that the Government&#x2019;s policy of developing the reserves as independent viable states has broken down. The more the borders of the reserves are developed through the establishment of border industries, the more reason there is to believe that the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s Bantustan policy will never work. I am sure that many members on that side of the House believe this too. Sir, it was only in February of this year that the hon. the Minister was asked a question in regard to the amount of money which was being spent on the development of the Bantu homelands. The question was: How much money was spent in the Bantu homelands in 1958, 1968 and 1969, and the Minister gave us the figures. I do not want to go into detail, but he said that in 1958-&#x2019;59 R12 million odd was spent, in 1967-&#x2019;68 R48 million odd and in 1968-&#x2019;69 R61 million odd. Further to this question, the Minister was asked by the hon. member for Simonstown: What amount was spent in the same years on Bantu administration, education and social services and for other purposes for Bantu in the Republic, in areas other than the Bantu homelands&#x003F; The Minister replied that the department&#x2019;s records did not distinguish between expenditure in respect of Bantu homelands and those in other areas, so that the required information was not readily available. When we as an Opposition are asked questions at public meetings as <span class="col_3567-3568" refersTo="page_0339"/>to how much money is being spent in the Bantu homelands, we find it very difficult to answer the question because the Government refuses to give us the answer to our question. The Minister refused to give us the answer we wanted, and when hon. members opposite are asked how much is being spent in the Bantu Reserves they quote the figures which I have given here, as being outside the Bantu reserves. This makes a tremendous difference, and this is where the people are being confused and misled hopelessly as to the true picture in regard to what is taking place today in regard to the development of the homelands. There is virtually, as we all know, no development taking place, no development in so far as being able to house the people in the homelands to bring their policy to its logical conclusion.</p>

<p>Why is it that we hear no more mention being made of the year 1978&#x003F; What has happened to the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, who was always talking about the year 1978 and saying that we must not be in a hurry; everything was working according to plan; by 1978 we would see an appreciable influx of Bantu into the homelands&#x003F; Now that Minister has disappeared from the scene we hear no more about that date. Why are the Prime Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration not prepared to accept the challenge issued by our hon. Leader on this side of the House in regard to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Advisory Council&#x003F; Surely, the Advisory Council is in the favourable position to decide as to whether this policy is practicable and whether it can be carried out or not. But the Government are afraid of the consequences; they are afraid of the verdict of the Advisory Council. The Minister mentioned this afternoon the morality of this whole concept. As far as we are concerned, we are not bound in any way. As hon. members on this side have already said, where the morality figures, is in the Minister and his Government carrying out their policy, and if they cannot or do not carry it out, what of their morality then&#x003F; We are not bound in any way, and the Bantu people know exactly where they stand as far as our policy is concerned.</p>

<p>Coming back to the development of the reserves, it is interesting to see that only a month or two ago, on 12th June, 1970, when the hon. the Minister opened the Territorial Authority of Zululand, the newly-elected Prime Minister in his speech made a very important statement. This is what the chief said at this particular gathering. He said to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Minister must please give me a chance to speak, because I have only 10 minutes. The Zulu Prime Minister asked Mr. Botha to act urgently on the following points, and then he followed up by saying that they wanted more territory for the Zulus and that without more land the scheme would not make sense. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are 3.3 million Zulus centred all over the Republic of South Africa. (This is almost as many as there are Whites in the Republic.) This makes me shudder, said the newly-appointed Prime Minister, when I think of the responsibility you as Minister have today placed on our shoulders. Not one day passes without some of our people approaching chiefs for sites and available land, yet we are already forbidden by the Government officials from granting land because our areas are already occupied to their full capacity.</block>

<p>That is the crux of the matter because this is where the whole exercise fails. This afternoon, the hon. member for Harrismith had the audacity&#x2014;I think it is due to ignorance&#x2014;to say that we would not stand by the 1936 Land and Trust Act at our Bloemfontein Congress in 1959. What utter nonsense! The United Party has never deviated from this Act, but where in the whole Land and Trust Act passed by Gen. Hertzog in 1936 does it say that the 7&#x00BD; million morgen of land which the Bantu was still to receive will be given away to form sovereign independent states&#x003F; Where in that Act does it say so&#x003F; And this is the issue which has worried many of us in the North-Eastern Cape, the fact that this land will be given away to become sovereign, independent, viable states.

<p>Hon. members, including the hon. member for Pinelands, made a great fuss this evening because of the enormous shortage of housing and maintained that apartheid had failed because there were no houses for the Bantu in the cities. But surely the hon. member is not a stranger in Jerusalem. He is a person who is usually fairly well informed. Has he forgotten about the clearance work that was done in Sophiatown and in Lady Solborne in Pretoria and in Cato Manor&#x003F; Does he now know how many houses were built there for the Bantu&#x003F; I am going to furnish the figures. From 1920 to 1948 a total <span class="col_3569-3570" refersTo="page_0340"/>number of 16,299 houses were built. From 1948 to 1968 no fewer than 488,000 were built. The average per year since 1948 has been 24,000 per year. The average per year from 1920 to 1948 was 582. Hon. members do not know what is going on. However, I should like to say a few words about numbers. But hon. members do not understand this. Do they not realize what is going on in South Africa or in any other country&#x003F; It does not matter what policy one is implementing or what policy one is not implementing, and whether projections are right or wrong. One has the numbers with one. All that remains then, is what plan we can devise as regards numbers, and what plan the Opposition is devising as regards numbers. This is the crux of the matter. The crux of the matter is how one is dealing with numbers, and what the consequence of one&#x2019;s dealing with numbers will be. Now I should like to quote an authority, and this authority tells us what the consequence of numbers is in a common country in which there is only one nation. This authority is no less a person than the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, Sir De Villiers Graaff. I quote from his speech of 18th May, 1959, as published in column 6038 of Hansard:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and it should be remembered also that as the standard of civilization of a community is raised, leadership will depend to an increasing degree upon numbers. Restrictive laws alone can never be a final solution.</block>

They will give the Bantu eight representatives in Parliament, and if they want more a referendum will be held.

<p>Yes, when that time comes, there will still be sufficient time. A hundred years from now hon. members will still have sufficient time. This is the reply of those members as regards the question of numbers. Now the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens can read his numbers another time. The numbers are there, and that is the crux of the problem which has to be solved. Now hon. members proceed to making a great fuss about the question of whether the number of Bantu in South Africa is decreasing or whether the number of Bantu in White South Africa is increasing. Those hon. members&#x2019; policy, as set out in their booklet, will give industry as much labour as it wants and where it wants it. They say they will settle them there on a family basis, but in the same breath they also say that they are going to develop the Bantu homelands. If hon. members are prepared to give the industrialists labour just where they want it and when they want it, I challenge any one of the hon. members to tell me how they are going to develop those homelands. How are those hon. members going to develop the homelands&#x003F; Do hon. members think that any industrialist will go to the homelands if they are prepared to give industrialists labour just where they want it and when they want it&#x003F; No, the National Party is the only party which has a plan with those numbers and which in addition is at least prepared to give those people an outlet where they can settle themselves and can develop to the fullest extent. We are not making a din as the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens did, because Bantu can develop their mining industry. Is this an honest way of acting&#x003F; The accusation of the words of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition still attaches to these people, and to that I should like a reply from hon. members on the opposite side. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition very clearly said, and I am going to read his words to hon. members again, that &#x201C;as the standard of civilization of a community is raised, leadership will depend to an increasing degree upon numbers. Restrictive laws alone can never be a final solution&#x201D;. Hon. members have now conveniently forgotten about this. They are now speaking of restrictive laws and they think they can bluff this House and the people outside by those means. That bluff will not, however, succeed. There are two choices open to South Africa. There is either the policy of the hon. member for Houghton and the Progressive Party, i.e. of equality in all respects, or another more honest policy, i.e. that of the National Party.</p>

Leader and other hon. members on this side had already referred, i.e. that if this party were in power and a referendum were to be held to-morrow, in the circumstances prevailing at present, we would recommend to the people of South Africa that non-Whites should be represented in this House by Whites.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>When we talk of the people, we are talking of the existing electorate in South Africa, i.e. the White voters. All day long we hear from hon. members on that side of the House how they want to justify the Government&#x2019;s Bantustan policy with a story of &#x201C;give unto others what you want to give yourself&#x201D;. I should like to dwell for a few moments on this idea. South Africa is the most developed country on the continent of Africa, and, I believe owes its development to two fundamental aspects. In the first place, the free capital and initiative of the Whites, on the one hand, and the labour forces of the non-Whites on the other. Then I believe that the cultural maturity of the Whites has played a primary role in taking the lead in this process of development. We now hear from the Government, however, that they want to get away from the so-called suppression of the Bantu by the Whites, and that they want to offer the Bantu so-called &#x201C;equal rights&#x201D; in their own territories. The question which occurs to me now is what these so-called &#x201C;equal rights&#x201D; mean and what this story of the Government about &#x201C;give unto others what you want for yourself&#x201D; comprises. If the Government is sincere in its intentions in this regard, it must indeed apply the formula to the Bantu territories, a formula which has been successful in South Africa for so many years, i.e. free capital and the initiative of the Whites on the one hand and the labour forces of the Bantu on the other. But what is the Government doing&#x003F; They want to make political rights primary and they want to make economic rights secondary. They want to put the cart before the horse. I believe that this Government is creating rotten spots in the sound economic unit of South Africa. Instead of also applying to the Bantu territories the formula by which South Africa has achieved success, this Government is only making labour reservoirs of these territories from which sound South Africa has to draw its labour forces. My colleague, the hon. member for East London (North), has already referred to the demands which are now being made by Bantu such as Chief Butelezi when he said: &#x201C;When man is reaching for the moon, the Zulus cannot be expected to move towards self-determination at oxwagon pace&#x201D;. I now want to know whether this man is already at this stage referring to the political self-determination of his territory or whether he is referring to economic underdevelopment. Sir, this is the problem now. These labour reservoirs, economically dependent on White South Africa, are now getting political independence from South Africa to boot. Our labour forces are now being united and political independence is being given to them, one big Bantu workers&#x2019; union, which will not only be a workers&#x2019; union, but an independent state which will be able to make an international case of every labour question or argument in South Africa. Yet this Government talks about its opposition to the establishment of Bantu trade unions. But they are prepared to hand over our entire labour force to independent Black states over which South Africa has lost control. The future implementation of the Bantustan policy of the National Party then means, in the first instance, the so-called removal of the Bantu from the White areas to their homelands, the development of politically independent Black states, which will be economically poor and dependent on so-called White South Africa, the removal of our industries from stabilized white cities to the so-called border industries on the borders of the Bantu territories, and the control of our labour forces, by politically independent Black states over which South Africa will have no control. If we accept that this policy is capable of implementation and at all feasible, then I believe the voters are entitled to know when the Government thinks it is going to start removing the Bantu from the white areas, and what criterion and what principle will be applied in making the Bantustans independent. Is it only going to be on a political basis, or will these territories have to show a certain degree of economic development&#x003F; The voters want to know what the Government is envisaging as far as the stabilized industries in stabilized White areas are concerned, where millions of Bantu work, live and are already settled. When are these Bantu going back to their homelands&#x003F; What measures is the Government going to take with the independent Bantustans with regard to labour which we in the so-called White South Africa have to obtain from these Bantustans&#x003F; I should like to know whether this Government is serious in this line it is taking&#x003F; Sir, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education speaks of a recipe for an explosion under United Party policy. But here there already is a recipe for an explosion. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs speak of &#x201C;revolutionary circumstances&#x201D; if the United Party were to be in power. But here opportunities are being created for revolutionary circumstances. I believe that this Government cannot run away from this problem by using a political dummy, i.e. political franchise to the Bantu. Why is there an influx of the Bantu from the reserves to the white areas&#x003F; Surely it is obvious and normal. After all, nothing is going on in those Bantu territories. Indeed, as far as economic development is concerned, nothing is going on. There is no development. There is nothing to induce the Bantu to go back to the reserves. Does this Government think for one moment that it can bring about a flow in the opposite direction so that the Bantu will return to the Bantu territories, merely on account of the fact that they get political franchise in those territories where they will have to perish with a political franchise which means absolutely nothing to them&#x003F; Sir, the United Party believes in the recipe which has been successful in South Africa. Develop those Bantu territories by means of private White capital and by means of the leadership and initiative of the Whites on the one hand, and then use the Bantu labour lying fallow. Let us then make these Bantu territories <span class="col_3573-3574" refersTo="page_0342"/>economically strong so that they may serve as magnets for drawing back the Bantu who are superfluous in the White areas. These territories must, however, be retained under the control of a Central Government as part of one great South Africa. Hon. members on that side are crying all day long that we would allow an uncontrolled influx of Bantu into the White areas. As long as this Government does not develop the Bantu areas dynamically in the economic field, they will not put a stop to the influx of Bantu into the White areas.</p>

<p>What does this Government envisage as regards the Bantu townships in the White areas&#x003F; I am now referring to townships such as Soweto in Johannesburg. Are they going to move these Bantu together with stabilized industry in the White areas to the so-called border areas&#x003F; Sir, we want to know how they are going to do this, and we also want to know when they are going to commence this. I think they should take cognizance of what Schalk Pienaar said in <i>Die Beeld.</i> It has already been quoted, but I want to quote it again. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So many years have passed by now, and 1978 is so many years closer. Open invitation to all: Come and have a look at Johannesburg. Come and have a look at Soweto. What your eyes behold obviously makes nonsense of 1978 and of every other date. We have a permanent black urban population &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, we should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he agrees with <i>Die Beeld,</i> or whether he still thinks that these people are there temporarily.</p>

<p>Sir, we constantly hear the story of independence for the Bantustans. We want to know at what stage they are going to get independence. I think this Government is bringing the Bantu leaders under a misapprehension. Let us consider what Headman Pilane of the Tswana Territorial Authority said. He was referring to what the Deputy Minister of Bantu Education had said when he made the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He had promised our territorial authority more power. We should be given independence because it is the policy of the Central Government &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is very obvious that the hon. member for Turffontein is the political cosset of a gentleman called Jacobs. He spoke of rotten spots. When he was still swinging on the gate, he should have looked at Johannesburg&#x2019;s Black spots. I had to study at that red university, and let me tell the hon. member to-night what Sophiatown and those places looked like. At that time he was still swinging on the gate, the very person who is representing an urban constituency to-day. The voters of Turffontein should take cognizance of the speech this member made here to-night. The hon. member for Turffontein is only interested in economic growth. He is not at all interested in the political set-up in the Republic of South Africa. What is the political set-up with regard to this Vote&#x003F; One need not be clever politically, in fact, one can be as dull politically as the hon. member for North Rand is and still see that there is a crisis in the United Party with regard to Bantu Affairs. I shall prove this. Sir, what are we dealing with here&#x003F; We are dealing with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and we are dealing with my good old friend, the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope I shall be given that injury time, because the hon. member prevented me from proceeding with my speech. The hon. member for South Coast has beeen very badly injured on a certain railway line. I am concerned about him. Sir, what is the set-up this evening&#x003F; I want to put a hypothetical question to the Official Opposition. I want to put a question to the most senior member of the opposite side, i.e. the hon. member for South Coast, the leader of the United Party in Natal. If the United Party were to come into power at a time when the Transkei had already gained its independence and the other Bantu peoples in our country had not yet gained full independence, what would they do&#x003F; In that case, would they be prepared to grant those states their independence, too&#x003F; Or would they act like the hon. member for East London (North)&#x003F; I did not expect that that hon. member would say here this evening that morally and ethically speaking they had no responsibility with regard to legislation which had been piloted through this House of Assembly. When a Bill has been passed by this House of Assembly it becomes a law of the Republic of South Africa. Ethically speaking, they, too, are bound to that legislation. But do you know, Sir, what the real position is&#x003F; The summary given by and the foresight of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout cannot be compared to the other speeches by that side of this House. That hon. member realizes that we are achieving success with multi-national development in the Republic of South Africa. His main fear is, as in the case <span class="col_3575-3576" refersTo="page_0343"/>of South Africa becoming a Republic, which directly affected the Whites and which was opposed by hon. members opposite, that this may be a political injury with which they will have to live for many years to come. The hon. member is coming to realize that the development of the Bantu peoples in their own territories in the Republic of South Africa is successful. The other hon. members also realize this, but try to combat this by belittling it in the eyes of the electorate. I have always thought that the hon. member for Pinelands is a responsible member. What did he say about the Transkei this evening&#x003F; He said we were opening a door for the communists. That is the last party in South Africa that should ever speak of the communistic danger. They have never lifted a finger in the struggle against communism. Basically we are concerned here with a problem of alarming proportions. Members such as the hon. member for South Coast and the hon. member for Transkei come into close contact with Bantu leaders in the areas they are representing. Now I want to know from the hon. member for South Coast how he acts when he speaks to Bantu chiefs. Does the hon. member encourage them to get their own independent governments or not&#x003F; Simply reply &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;. No, the hon. member will not tell us that here this evening. After the performance of the hon. member for South Coast in this Chamber. I am convinced in my own mind, however, that he is sowing suspicion among the Zulu. It is one of the most shameful things when a White person in South Africa tries to disparage the progress in the direction of identity development made by another people that is on a lower evolutionary level than he himself is. The hon. member for South Coast should fully realize his responsibility. He must realize that we are aware of his actions. This applies to the hon. member for Transkei as well. The Official Opposition has a task to encourage the ethnic groups in South Africa to accept multi-nationalism and not multi-racialism. The basic difference between this side of the House and that side of the House become very evident last Saturday evening. That evening my hon. Leader addressed the Jeugbond in the Transvaal. I regret the fact that the press did not make full use of that speech. In all honesty and sincerity he clearly set our course by saying that when the Transkei wanted its independence, it would get its independence. We are not afraid to make these statements. We believe in our policy of development along individual lines. But what about the official Opposition&#x003F; They have been doing a proper egg-dance. This afternoon the hon. the Minister very courteously put questions to various members by way of repetition. The hon. member for South Coast was sitting there, shut like a clam. The hon. member refused to reply. Why&#x003F; There is strife in that party. The time has arrived when the Official Opposition, in the interests of the Republic of South Africa, should have the courage to adopt a standpoint. The United Party, with its approach to South African politics, is clouding relations affecting the Bantu peoples. What respect can the Bantu peoples have for the Official Opposition when it does not have the courage to say what its policies are. The hon. member for Turffontein, who has again disappeared from the Chamber, made the statement here that nothing was being done in the homelands. That simply illustrates their irresponsibility; that proves that they have not even made a study of the estimates which have been tabled here. The Estimates make provision for R90 million from Revenue Account. The Estimates set out what is being done for each ethnic group, such as the Tswana and the Ovambo. Expenditure for this year exceeds that of last year by R15 million. Yet the hon. member speaks of the failure of our policy in the homelands.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens who, if I am to judge from the speech he made here tonight, has never gone beyond the mountains here, had the arrogance to say that the Bantu were being wronged in connection with the mining of minerals in their homelands. Let met tell the hon. member that 30 per cent of the taxable revenue from the mining of platinum at the Impala mine goes to that Bantu tribe. It is not Bantu Trust land; it is tribal land of the Bantu. The hon. member creates the impression here that the Bantu is being wronged. What about all the other Bantu in South Africa&#x003F; They themselves do not have the acumen to undertake the mining of their minerals. Sir, at Present these people are receiving these royalties, and this applies to the Bantu in the tribal area in which the Impala mine is situated. They receive 30 per cent of the taxable revenue and the money is spent on the development of the homelands. It is completely unfair to say that no development is taking place in the homelands. Sir. take a place like Temba. It is a town in which water, electricity and all kinds of facilities have been provided. At present the Minister and his Department are developing areas in which there was no planning before, there was nothing but bush. If the hon. member for Gardens were to come there, he would run; he would see a lion in the way! Let the hon. member go and have a look at a place like Temba; let him go and have a look at a place in my own constituency if he wants to see what development on an enormous scale has taken place there in a Bantu township.

<p>The hon. member started off his speech by asking a hypothetical question, and indeed he said that it was a hypothetical question. He asked what the United Party would do if the Transkei already had its independence when we took over the government. He asked whether we would then stop the granting of independence to the other reserves which had not yet received their independence. Sir, he was here when we discussed this matter earlier on. We stated quite clearly that once a reserve such as the Transkei had been given its independence and had become sovereign, there was nothing that we could do about it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>That is why the United Party says that under the Government&#x2019;s policy there is a point of no return, because once you have given them independence you cannot take it back. If South Africa finds, having given the reserves their independence, that it is detrimental to the interests of South Africa, there is nothing that the Government can do about it. The United Party, however, does not promise them independence and therefore will not reach that point of no return. With regard to the other reserves, the hon. member asked what we would do in the case of those reserves which had not yet been given their independence. Was he not here when the hen. member for Zululand stated quite clearly what our attitude was&#x003F;</p>

They keep on trying to get away from it and I am not coming back to the issue again. They are not going to get away with this. I addressed the House on this issue and I have not had a reply from the hon. the Minister yet. I would have thought that the hon. member for Rustenburg would have answered some of the questions I asked about the mines which are being developed in the Rustenburg district, in the BOPA Reserve. Sir, I asked what the position was of the Bantu mine worker. I have not yet had a reply from any Government speaker.

<p>Sir, in 1968 the hon. member for Orange Grove raised this question and the reply was that this matter was receiving consideration. In April, 1969, the hon. member for Parktown asked the same question, a year later, and what was the reply&#x003F; The Government was considering the question. That was a year later. Sir, this is a most important point. I want to know now whether they have made up their minds.

I hope that after two years he will now make up his mind and that the Government will be able to tell us what they are going to do.

The Government has tried to bring about development through its own agencies, the Investment Corporation, the Xhosa Development Corporation and the Bantu Trust. We pointed out at the time when the enabling Corporations Act was passed by this Parliament that these corporations could serve a purpose, but that they were not the solution. It was obvious from the report of the Tomlinson Commission that these Corporations could not carry out the task. Sir, we have already received last year&#x2019;s annual report from the Xhosa Development Corporation and I must say that it is a very disappointing document, not because of the achievements of the organization but because of the paucity of information. It is impossible to tell from its accounts which businesses are paying and which are not paying.

<p>Sir, two matters have become very clear in this debate so far. The first is that the Opposition is confused in regard to their own policy, and the second is that the policy of this side of the House has not yet penetrated to them. The hon. member who has just sat down, again put questions in connection with the issue of labour and employment. This matter has been explained to them many times by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development himself, as well as by the hon. the Minister of Labour, and a moment ago the hon. the Minister also said that he would reply fully to the questions put by the hon. member for Transkei. Sir, what also astounded me this evening is this: The hon. member for Turffontein mentioned here that the eight representatives for Bantu in Parliament would be Whites, but apparently the hon. member does not know what his Leader himself said about this matter. I should like to quote what the hon. member for Yeoville said in reply to a question put by the hon. Minister in 1965, when he was still Deputy Minister. I am quoting from Hansard, column 606. The hon. member for Yeoville said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another answer is that if circumstances are so changed in South Africa that, thanks to the implementation of our policy, the civilized White leadership of our people is secured in South Africa, then we might consider it, but not before &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is, to introduce Bantu as representatives. I think the hon. member for Turffontein must first brush up his political knowledge a little before speaking about these contentious matters. It is very clear that the policy in regard to relationships is one of the most important aspects of politics in this country. Apart from the relationship between White and White, we <span class="col_3581-3582" refersTo="page_0346"/>also have the relationship between non-White and non-White, but the most important is of course what we are discussing here now, namely the relationship between White and non-White. As far as the National Party is concerned, its policy is very clear. It is a policy of multi-national development; it affords each people full opportunities, and has been stated clearly and repeatedly here to-day. Over against that, we have the policy of the United Party, which speaks of a uni-national community with a federation of race groups. What this all involves, is still not clear. It seems to me, however, that under their policy we shall eventually sit with approximately 20 million people in the Republic who will be neither fish nor flesh. Over against that, the policy of the Progressive Party is very clear, and we all know what it is. It is immediate integration and immediate surrender to the Bantu; simply let them take over South Africa and let us see what will happen further. When we look at other countries in the world which also have to deal with this question of relationships, Whites as against non-Whites and Coloured races as against one another, we find that in America, as the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs quoted in the no-confidence debate, they are in a very serious dilemma. It is so serious that a newspaper such as the <i>Daily Sketch</i> even said that particularly as far as integration in education is concerned, &#x201C;it is a tragic failure of colossal proportions&#x201D;. In spite of the fact that the people were educated to understand the position, that they were pleaded with, that they were spoken to firmly, and that force of arms was used against them, nothing helped. There have also been cases and episodes such as the Little Rock episode and similar incidents. We find the Black Power movement in America, which is agitating for more rights for the non-Whites. In England, too, we find the same problems and racial clashes of the worst kind to-day. But as far as Africa itself is concerned, who of us have forgotten the Mau Mau episode in Kenya&#x003F; Are these matters which we can simply ignore&#x003F; But then the Opposition comes along and says that the Government&#x2019;s policy has failed up to now. Can they name me one single Bantu in this country who has pleaded for the United Party&#x2019;s policy of race federation&#x003F; Name me one case where they have expressly or tacitly accepted or welcomed it. They cannot do so.</p>

<p>Over against that, there are numerous examples of the National Party&#x2019;s policy having been accepted by the Bantu leaders, because they know that when they have their own homeland, they can develop themselves there and find peace, prosperity and happiness in their own areas. I should like to mention a very recent example of where the policy of this side of the House was accepted, and by a very important chief in the Republic at that, the chief of the North Sotho. He is Chief Maserumule Matlala, who lives in my constituency. About nine days ago the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration opened a large extension of a hospital at Philadelphia, close to Groblersdal, and among other things this Chief Matlala said this in his speech. Then I want to mention this to you, Sir. I know the North Sotho, and if this chief, who is their ruling leader, says something which is not to their liking, it is very certain that he will promptly and unceremoniously be thrown out of that territory. He therefore said this with very great responsibility and I was present on the platform when the large mass of Bantu in front of him cheered him and uttered a cry of joy, because this leader said, among other things (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a great honour and privilege for me to be celebrating with you to-day. This is further tangible proof of White and non-White co-operation in this country. It is proof of the great love which prevails. If a person does not like you, he will not invite you to such occasions. He who invites you, is your friend and one who likes you. It is a great honour and privilege to find oneself in the company of Minister Botha. It is a great joy for us to be able to talk to him and to meet him face to face. We regard him as the &#x201C;old father&#x201D; of many tasks who performs them in a wonderful way, for which we are very grateful. When an invitation is extended to him, he accepts it, in spite of all the work he has to do. His words to us are well-known: &#x201C;Do not be afraid of me; I am there to help you and further your interests. Let me know what your obstacles are so that I can help you to remove them&#x201D;. To-day I want to take my stand next to him and tell my people that we must not be afraid of the White people &#x2026;</block>

<p>And I should like the Opposition to listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but must co-operate with them, because the time of dissension is gone forever. All that remains is consultation and co-operation &#x2026;. We shall be ever grateful to the Republican Government, who did not sit with folded arms to look at the missionaries struggling, but came to their assistance. The purses were opened and the work carried out to where it is to-day. They have not only provided financial assistance, but have also made trained doctors, nurses and other staff available. You must know that they struggled and laboured to do this. The Whites had to leave the cities and go far away from their own people in order to come and help us here in the open veld and to pave the way for our nurses to-day. Our eyes are upon our own doctors and nurses to see whether they can carry on the work started by White leaders. We want to see whether they will discharge that responsibility faithfully and will be able to say to <span class="col_3583-3584" refersTo="page_0347"/>the Whites one day: &#x201C;You have led me through the dark night, and now that day has dawned, let me see whether I can carry the burden further&#x201D;[Time expired.]</block>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Before I go on with what I wish to say, I must just mention the interjection of the hon. member for Brakpan in relation to the point attempted to be made by the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to my remarks earlier. I have not seen my Hansard yet, but I am quite certain that it will say that I said we would abolish or repeal anything which has been done by this Government which was inconsistent with the Bantu people remaining part of the Union of South Africa. I am sure that is what I said and I said it specifically and I am sure the hon. member will find it in my Hansard if he looks to-morrow if I say that I was replying to a question by the hon. the Minister as to what we would do with the territorial authorities. And the territorial authorities, I need hardly say, are not governments of independent states. It goes without saying that once an independent state is created, it is inviting the intervention of the United Nations for any Government, South African or any other, to march in or to attempt to interfere in any way with a state that has sovereign independence.</p>

<p>I was coming back to the point where I left off earlier, and that was the application of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy to the facts of the South African situation. It is quite unreal to have to sit here and listen to hon. member after hon. member standing up and asking us what we are likely to do when this or that state has achieved its independence, when, as I have said earlier, we have not even been told how the Government is to begin to lay the foundations of such an independent state. Far from our having reached the stage where we can talk about independent states, the very foundation has not yet been laid. I happened to get quite recently the annual report of the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa, a Government-sponsored body, and in the central pages we find perhaps the most graphic illustration of what I am trying to say. There are depicted on this map the Bantu areas of Natal in yellow, the Bantu areas of the Transvaal in blue, green and red and the Transkei in pink. There is nothing else on the map except the colouring in of the Bantu areas of South Africa, and if you look at Natal it looks for all the world like a patient suffering from measles, except that the spots are yellow, and if you look at the Transvaal you see precisely the same. It looks like some dreadful disease which covers the patient with a number of blotches, except that they are in colours not normally found on the human body. This is the state of affairs as it is to-day, and bearing in mind that we are dealing with a map of South Africa which looks like this, how unreal can you be to have the type of debate that we have had here this evening. Let us look at the Minister&#x2019;s own paper, &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D;, the latest one issued by his department. I read a little of it earlier, but I should like to deal with it in greater detail. The author of this paper&#x2014; and I emphasize that it comes from the Minister&#x2019;s department&#x2014;sets out the task before the Nationalist Government and he reduces the subject in this manner&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Applied to the particular case of the Zulu, the aims and objects which the Government, acting through the Commissioner-General of the Zulu national unit and the Natal representatives of its Department of Bantu Administration, hopes to achieve in terms of that Act may be outlined as follows: The creation of homogeneous administrative areas by uniting the members of each Zulu-speaking group in one national unit concentrated in coherent homelands where possible.</block>

<p>Where do you have any state of affairs in Natal even remotely approximating to that ideal&#x003F; Then the paper goes on to say this, and I quote now from page 14 under the heading &#x201C;Actual Problems and Potential Assets of the Zulu Territorial Authority&#x201D;. It goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unlike the Transkei, unfortunately, the homelands of the Zulu-speaking people which are now to come under the jurisdiction of the new Territorial Authority do not constitute a geographically unified and territorially homogeneous area, but consist of various former Native reserves widely scattered over Natal. In fact, the Bantu areas of Natal as described in the report of the Tomlinson Commission consist of more than 100 units of land, with a combined area of about 3 million hectares. Instead of being concentrated in the historical Zululand, they are scattered all over the surface of the province from the Mozambique border in the north to the Transkei border in the south.</block>

<p>Now I am not reading from a speech by the United Party. This is the Minister&#x2019;s own publication, dated July, 1970, and it goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nevertheless the largest blocks of Bantu land lie north of the Tugela River and it is clear that the future seat of the Territorial Authority will be located there.</block>

<p>My first question to the Minister is where is that seat to be. Then it goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is there that the largest measure of territorial consolidation seems likely to be achieved in time to come.</block>

<p>They go on to set out the further problems and then it concludes in this manner&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is widely recognized by economists and other experts, and has been stressed by the Minister concerned, that there are formidable <span class="col_3585-3586" refersTo="page_0348"/>obstacles to be overcome in the immediate future if the rather scattered Natal homelands are to form an adequate basis for a viable state under the Zulu Territorial Authority.</block>

<p>It refers to formidable obstacles to be overcome in the immediate future. Now, what are the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s plans for overcoming these obstacles in the immediate future&#x2014;not in <i>22</i> years&#x2019; time, but in the immediate future&#x003F; Now, bearing in mind what I said earlier, that the hon. the Minister or his predecessors have had commissions sitting for over 10 years, or nearly 10 years, inquiring into this very problem of the realignment of boundaries in Natal, we find that already reserves are being done away with to bring about the development of Richard&#x2019;s Bay. We have a territorial authority established, but admittedly the Prime Minister of that authority does not as yet even have an office or a telephone, I understand. Still, he is the executive officer of that authority. He himself in his very first speech, as I have indicated on another occasion, has stressed this as the very first point of view of the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy. As I have said before, it can only be done by a substantial re-allocation of land between Black and White in Natal. This is the most likely cause of difficulty, to put it mildly, that one could wish to have in a multi-racial country. What are the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s plans in this regard&#x003F; Forget what might or might not happen in the remote future should we ever reach the stage where independence is granted. A thousand and one details of the most elementary kind have to be faced, discussed and dealt with before we reach anything like that stage. Here we have a debate which has been going on for two to three hours already and during which the hon. the Minister has spoken one hour and ten minutes without mentioning one syllable as to how the Government in the implementation of its own policy after 22 years is going to deal with these real matters. Neither has any of the other hon. members on that side of the House mentioned anything about that. These matters affect the livelihood of the majority of people, whether they be black, white or brown, who live in Natal. At the moment I am only speaking of the Zulus. I would like to say this to the hon. members opposite, and that is that if they look at the map of the Industrial Development Corporation which shows the Northern and the Western Transvaal and the Northern Cape, they will see that the position is equally as difficult. Let me come to another aspect of the matter. There is the question of labour. It is part of the policy of this Government to remove the Coloureds and the Asiatics from Zululand. I have no doubt that a large share of the responsibility for that decision rests with the hon. the Minister, but I am not going to discuss that. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the previous speaker addressed himself mainly to our hon. Minister, I shall leave him in the hands of our capable Minister.</p>

<p>One thing has become very clear to me from the debate on this Vote to-day, and that is the reason why the Opposition has been occupying the Opposition benches for as long as 22 years, as well as the reason why it will probably remain in opposition for at least another 22 years. That reason as the fact that although the Opposition is living with us in South Africa, it still cannot understand even to-day the way of life and the pattern of life of all people in South Africa. From the earliest years it has been a law of life here in South Africa that the various colour groups exist separately and want to exist separately. The Whites want to exist separately, and the Coloureds as well as the Bantu want to exist separately. When we now come to the relations situation between White and Bantu, we must realize that this situation can be handled successfully only if one&#x2019;s handling of that situation rests chiefly on two important pillars. The first pillar in my opinion is the pillar of Christianity and morality. In short this means that I regard the Bantu as a full and equal human being who is entitled, as I am, to a place in the sun, money in his pocket and food in his home. In addition he must also have full rights of citizenship in his own homeland just as I have them here in my own country. To me the principle that I shall grant to him what I claim for myself is, in short, the principle of Christianity and morality. Now I know that the Opposition is going to tell me that this is irreconcilable as the Bantu who outnumber the Whites four to one have only one-fifth of the country. My reply is that it is not irreconcilable, as it is by no means a pattern throughout the world that the territories of nations are determined according to their numerical strength. What is, in fact, and must be a pattern throughout the world is that peoples must be and want to be independent and full and equal. Therefore this is the policy of the National Party for the Bantu. The Opposition asks time and again whether our policy is, in fact, Christian and moral as we shall have more territory than the Bantu under our policy. This situation is a heritage of our history, as we know it and as it has come to us. I want to ask the Opposition whether it is Christian and moral that under their policy 4 million Whites will be represented in Parliament by 160 members of Parliament and that 13 million Bantu will be represented in the same Parliament by 8 representatives&#x003F; Is that policy moral or is it exploiting and misleading the Bantu and the electorate outside in a shameless manner&#x003F;</p>

<p>The second pillar, as I see it, on which we are building the policy of separate development, is the practicability of this policy. In other words, is it humanly possible to implement our policy&#x003F; Yes, it is. We have progressed a long way on the road of our policy <span class="col_3587-3588" refersTo="page_0349"/>The Opposition speaks of the point of no return. That is so. I want to tell the Opposition this evening that if in the near future something highly freakish were to happen in South Africa and they were to come into power, they would not be able to turn the people of South Africa away from the policy of separate development. The people of South Africa have placed their feet on the road of separate development and will continue on that road. Our policy is to keep the number of Bantu, and especially the number of Bantu families, in the White areas as small as practicable. I put it to the Opposition that if they had been in power, the number of Bantu who are in the White areas at the moment would have been three, four and five times the number of the few million who are present in these areas under the policy of the National Party. Under our policy we want the position to be, at present as well as in the future, that the Bantu male will come from his homeland to sell his labour to the Whites in the White area. The Opposition says that this is not moral. Let me put it to the Opposition in the following way. If a country such as Germany, England or Holland were to offer me or any White person in South Africa employment in their country, and one of their conditions was that I should come by myself without my family, and if I could earn 50 per cent more in that country than my present earnings in South Africa, it would be a consideration for me to go and work in that country for a year and to earn extra money while my family safely remained in their own homelands in which they belonged. That is how the National Government wants to organize the Bantu and Bantu labour in South Africa. The choice rests with the Bantu whether he will want to come or not. Nobody will force him to do so.</p>

<p>This, in short, is the difference between the policy of the National Party and the policy of the United Party. I conclude by saying that the Whites in South Africa, the descendants of the Dutch Protestants, the Huguenots and the 1820 Settlers, to whom an hon. member referred have placed their feet irrevocably on the road of separate development; but the implementation of this policy requires doers and not doubters. The people of South Africa are doers and for that reason they will fully implement the policy of separate development now and in the future.</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Heidelberg made an interesting speech. I just want to refer to a few points raised by him. The first statement he made was that the people would not allow itself to be diverted from the road of separate development. I should like to tell the hon. member that if the people could have a referendum to-morrow on the question of having independent black states or not, and if the people could keep all other political implications from its mind, then I say the people would vote against independent black states. As a matter of fact, the hon. member knows that his own Nationalist Party supporters do not want independent black states. But they vote Nat and the hon. member knows why they vote Nat. They vote Nat because they believe the Nationalist Party is simply doing window-dressing for the outside world. This has been the case throughout the years. If I have come across one Nat I have come across dozens of Nats who have said to me, &#x201C;Oh man, my Government will never give them their independence&#x201D;. While I listen to the hon. the Minister when he is speaking about what we shall do if the Transkei gets its independence, I think of my old Nat friend in Kuruman who has told me, &#x201C;Oh Mr. Hickman, my Government will not ever give the black territories independence&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister is waiting and he is trying to make the people wait, too, but I have an idea that if the matter has to be brought to a head, then even the Nationalist Party Government will say, &#x201C;No&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But I want to mention another point. Reference was made here to-night to the requirements of the policy of the Nationalist Party. Now I may mention in passing that we are considering the Vote of the hon. the Minister and his Vote is his policy. His Vote, for which he is being paid concerns the implementation of the policy of the hon. the Minister and not the implementation of my policy. He is supposed to answer the questions for us. It seems to me, when I listen to the hon. members and see the practical implementation of their policy, as though they are under the impression that they have all the time in the world. Now I ask them this evening just to go back to the report of the Tomlinson Commission. If they do so they will find that that report conveyed a sense of urgency. That report concluded with the following injunction, i.e. that this was an urgent matter, one which had to be tackled and implemented immediately.</p>

<p>That is the recipe of the hon. the Minister, but unfortunately he does not want to bake this apartheid cake according to his own recipe. This evening I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that the time factor is one of the most important requirements in his policy. The hon. the Minister cannot come and tell us now that only 15 or 22 years have elapsed. Time moves on. Hon. members on that side of the House are creating a particular attitude of mind among the Bantu. They approach the Bantu with definite promises. They are encouraging with might and main black nationalism and nation-building. Although it is my belief that their policy is not capable of implementation, they are creating the most serious dangers in South Africa in the process of attempting to implement this policy.</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I want to tell that hon. member that I had criticized his policy long before he came to this House.</p>

<p>But I want to come to a second point. I said here to-night that if Bantu labour was eliminated, we would be required to find alternative labour. In that case we would also have to create employment opportunities for the Bantu in his own territory. The answer we get is that Bantu labour will not be eliminated, but that it will be used in the form of migratory labour. There is, however, a serious question which bothers me in this regard. The question is whether this now means that we need not be concerned about numbers&#x003F; The Deputy Minister of Finance said the other day that it did not matter whether they were many or few in number, as long as they were here with us in terms of the law of the land. The cardinal question is: Does this mean that we should simply continue to allow the influx of hundreds and thousands of Bantu, as long as those people remained migratory labourers, or would a level be reached when we would say, &#x2018;&#x2018;So far and no further&#x201D;&#x003F; I put it to the Minister: Even if it were migratory labour, he must understand the spirit of migratory labour. He told us this evening that we were the people who regarded the Bantu as a source of labour. Sir, migratory labour is in fact the lowest source of labour because it has no regard to the human aspect. The Bantu is engaged and disengaged like an instrument, and the hon. the Minister knows this. The basis of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy is to give the migratory labourer the minimum rights here with us, and he knows that. The Bantu are deprived of their existence as human beings. In addition migratory labour is the most expensive form of labour as migratory labourers cannot be trained properly. As soon as a migratory labourer has been given a little training, he is removed.</p>

<p>There is another point which is also a cardinal question. I said this evening that the entire philosophy of Bantustans was built on the danger of numbers. I want to tell the hon. the Minister this evening that as long as the Bantu outnumber us, whether or not they are migratory labourers, the hon. the Minister would not in the least have offered a solution to the problem as seen by the Nationalist Party. It is of no avail to tell the 5 million Bantu, who are here as against 3 million Whites, &#x201C;You are migratory labourers. You cannot be enfranchised&#x201D;. If the arguments of the hon. the Minister are correct, and if numbers are a danger, those 5 million Bantu will simply say, &#x201C;Migratory labour or not, we are in the majority, and because we are in the majority we shall claim definite rights.&#x201D;</p>

<p>That is the argument of the Nationalist Party. The Nationalist Party does not listen. The entire policy of the Nationalist Party is modelled on the danger of numbers. That is the entire spirit of their policy and now they are running away. I want to tell them that the danger of numbers will never be solved under their policy. They are now running away from the basis of their policy. If they accept the danger of numbers, as the motive for their policy, then I say they must eliminate it. They should not try to mislead us by saying that it is only migratory labour. Whether a Bantu is here as a migratory labourer or not, he remains a human being, and the hon. the Minister will have to take that into account. The Minister does not have the solution. He can tell us this evening that they have dropped the question of numbers. I still remember that the late Dr. Verwoerd said in this House that the emphasis should not fall on numbers, but on political development. The moment the Nationalist Party had said that, he dropped his policy as formulated by Dr. Verwoerd in 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that I have to deal at this late stage with the matter raised by the hon. member for Maitland. I want to say that the hon. member for Maitland&#x2019;s argument in connection with numbers, where he tried to indicate that our policy deviated from the attitude adopted by Dr. Verwoerd, is just as muddled as the whole United Party policy of race federation. This evening I want to submit the following to the United Party for their consideration: When we speak of a race federation in this country, we must forget about quibbling over what is meant by a nation, a race or a people. The fact of the matter is that the United Party must admit that there is more than one people in South Africa. It does not matter whether they call it a people or a race. There is another fact that the United Party must acknowledge, and that is that the ultimate ideal which the United Party cherishes for this country, i.e. total integration, is locked up in the word &#x201C;federation&#x201D;. [Interjections.] I shall come to that, Sir. Hon. members must not get excited. If the United Party wants to cooperate on a federal basis with other peoples or other nations or other races, as they call them, it means that they must understand the concept of &#x201C;federation&#x201D; properly. It means that they will have to co-operate in an integrated way. If the United Party spoke of a confederation of races and peoples, it might perhaps have been something understandable. Those hon. members must go and ascertain what the difference is between a federation and a confederation.</p>

<p>No, the hon. member must do his own homework. I am not prepared to do homework for a United Party member. We must realize one thing this evening, i.e. that the time has arrived for the United Party to accept that there are only two courses open as far as our human relations are concerned. The United Party and everyone outside must also know that human relations is the main issue in all the conflicts in this world. It is no coincidence that six out of the Ten Commandments are to regulate human relations. The fact that people have to do with each other, is regarded as one of the most important matters. We must not try to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds as the United Party does. In the rural areas the United Party wants to propagate its race federation plan, in terms of which they can tell the people there: &#x201C;What is wrong with permanent supremacy&#x003F;&#x201D; I can furnish them with proof that it has happened in my constituency. On the other hand, the United Party would like to move in the direction of the Progressive Party. As a result they are not prepared to go all the way, and are not prepared to say what they really want to do.</p>

<p>They want to have their bread buttered on both sides.</p>

<p>Sir, I am sorry that my time is nearly up. I want to raise a matter this evening which the United Party will not understand in any case but the Minister of Bantu Administration will. I want to make a plea in regard to a matter which affects us in the Northwestern and the Far Western Transvaal. I want to ask whether it is not possible for his department to establish a Tswana Development Corporation as well, like the one we already have in the case of the Xhosa. The Tswana people have already set their feet firmly on the road towards looking after themselves.</p>
