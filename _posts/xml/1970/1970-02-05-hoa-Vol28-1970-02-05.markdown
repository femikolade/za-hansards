<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned yesterday I was dealing with the impracticability of implementing the Government&#x2019;s policy of establishing a white South Africa. Fundamental to this is the establishment of seven or eight independent black states which would form almost a horseshoe around what is erroneously called white South Africa. I say it is erroneous, because even if we could remove all the Africans from this white area, the Whites would still be outnumbered by the Coloureds and the Indians, who will still be integrated in our economy, and so separation would have failed. I do not propose to deal with the Coloureds and the Indians. The hon. the Prime Minister has admitted that he has no solution for this problem.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He said he would leave it to our children to solve that problem. The hon. the Prime Minister will have a chance of replying to me. I take it he is going to take part in the debate. [Interjections.] I want to deal with this problem for which they believe they have a solution. For this policy to succeed it must be able to give Africans homelands where they can all enjoy normal home life and political rights. But it is admitted this ideal cannot be achieved, and in assessing the success or otherwise of the Government&#x2019;s policy we are now told that numbers are not decisive. This is a far cry from the attitude of the previous Ministers, Dr. de Wet Nel and Dr. Verwoerd, who told us that we could expect the turn in the tide in 1978 when the Africans would flock back to the reserves. Sir, on Tuesday the Minister attempted to show that progress was being made in giving employment to the Bantu in the reserves. He showed that more Bantu were being employed in border industries and he had hopes that white entrepreneurs would take advantage of the agency system to establish industries inside the reserves.</p>

<p>May I say a word or two about border industries? I notice that Dr. Rautenbach, the planning adviser to the Prime Minister, does not talk of border industries; he talks of decentralization of industry as part of our traditional way of life. Later on in his speech he said that in 1960 the application of decentralization became practical politics for the first time. What sort of tradition is this which started in 1960? He also says that party politicians have opposed decentralization although the rest of the community wanted it. Sir, I do not know who those party politicians are who have opposed decentralization. The United Party has always stood for the decentralization of industry for strategic and economic reasons, but what we have opposed is <span class="col_267-268" refersTo="page_0146"/>decentralization of industry solely for ideological purposes. Sir, the Minister has given us instances of the implementation of his policy of establishing industries inside the reserves on an agency basis but he has picked one or two reserves. I ask him, Sir, what is happening in the largest reserve in South Africa? You cannot ignore the almost 2 million Africans who live in that reserve. Where are they to be employed? I submit and I say without equivocation that there is no border industry for the largest of the reserves, the Transkei, and no border industry is being planned for the simple reason that there is no suitable spot for a border industry.</p>

<p>Border industries have failed to supply sufficient work to absorb the Bantu workers, and now we are told that industries are to be started inside the reserves on an agency basis. Now, this is not the present Minister&#x2019;s idea; the previous Minister spoke about this too but nothing was done. Years were allowed to go by without doing anything. I want to know, in regard to the agency basis, if that is the new hope of this Government, what is being done in the Transkei? There is no industry being started on the agency basis there. We know that a private concern has taken over the meat factory, which was built by the Government at considerable expense and, we understand, at a considerable loss. Then there is a small weaving factory which I assume is also run on the agency basis, but that only gives employment to a couple of hundred women. No worthwhile industry has been started on the agency basis in the Transkei. While talking about the agency basis, the late Dr. Verwoerd opposed &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Let me ask the hon. the Deputy Minister how much employment has been given in the bag factory at Butter-worth? Sir, the late Dr. Verwoerd objected to white capital going into the reserves because he said that if white capital went in, then white management would have to go. If white management went in white families would go and if white families went in there would be children and there would have to be schools and churches and places of entertainment. In this way a white colony would be started there. Sir, what is the difference between taking in white capital on the agency basis or allowing private white capital to go in on a profit making basis? But, Sir, I see from a suggestion made by the Minister the other day that he may be thinking of allowing white capital and Whites into the reserves on a migratory basis only. He was quoted as suggesting&#x2014;and this was obviously done to appease the critics of black migratory labour&#x2014;that it may be possible to fly African workers home from the white areas to their families in the reserves for a week-end. His fancy then took flight and he also suggested subsequently that it might be possible to fly white migratory workers home from the reserves to the white areas for their week-ends &#x2014; a shuttle-cock service. He did not say whether the same planes may be used to bring the Blacks in and to take the Whites out, and I would suggest that the verkramptes keep their eye on this. All I am waiting to hear now is that some Nationalists have got together to form a company to exploit this shuttle service on an agency basis where there can be no loss.</p>

<p>The Government fiddled while the black population grew. When they do at last accept the principle of allowing white capital into the reserves as we have advocated for so long, they do so on the wrong basis. My leader has already pointed out that, on the agency basis, it cannot succeed. The Tomlinson Commission was a commission of experts, appointed by the Government, to go into this question of economic development, and to give its advice. It reported in 1954, 16 years ago. That Commission estimated, on projections placed before it then, that in 25 or 30 years&#x2019; time, the Bantu population would number 21 million. Later projections have of course far exceeded this number. It is now estimated that the Bantu population would be approximately double that number by the year 2000. But no matter whether there is an increase of 30, 50 or 100 per cent&#x2014;and the 100 per cent seems to be more likely&#x2014;the Tomlinson Commission development programme envisaged the attainment of a total <i>de jure</i> population of 10 million in the Bantu area. They use the phrase <i>de jure,</i> namely those people living in the Bantu areas. They said that of this number only 8 million would be dependent for their existence in the Bantu areas. The other 2 million would still have to rely for their existence on areas outside the Bantu areas. The balance of the Africans, of course, would be existing and living outside those areas.</p>

<p>Sir, they also said that if the Bantu areas were not developed on the scale they recommended, 17 million Bantu would have to be accommodated in the European areas. This figure will now have to be doubled because their projections were found to be hopelessly wrong. But the Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s recommendations were not carried out. A major recommendation was that white entrepreneurs should be encouraged to take part in the development of the reserves. This recommendation was rejected by the late Dr. Verwoerd.</p>

<p>I do not say that the Government has done nothing. It certainly has spent money, but this <span class="col_269-270" refersTo="page_0147"/>has been money wasted. Not all of it, but a large Dart of it has been wasted by the B.I.C. and the Xhosa Development Corporation. I have referred to the meat factory. I should like that Deputy Minister to tell us what the loss has been on that meat factory. [Interjections.] A hotel was necessary for Africans in Umtata, but what have they done? They have built a luxury hotel, which is not needed there. Sir. The cost of the building was over R300,000, and, with the cost of the furnishings, which have all been done in the best taste, with wall to wall carpeting and that sort of thing, the total cost must be something like R400,000. We still hope to get the full details of what has been spent on that hotel. It was quite unnecessary to undertake a project on that scale. The United Party wants the reserves to develop economically, but we want it done effectively. We gave them an example. Before the Nationalists took over in 1948 we had given them an industry in the reserve. We had built and got under way the Good Hope Textile industry, where thousands of Africans are employed. It is the showpiece of the Government to-day. In all the years that they have been in power, they have done nothing to compare with that industry. We want to utilize private white capital and initiative to avoid undue waste of the taxpayer&#x2019;s money. We opposed the Xhosa Development Corporation Bill when it was introduced in this House, not because we were opposed to the Xhosa Development Corporation taking part in the development of the Transkei and the Ciskei, but because there was no provision for the Auditor-General to audit their account. We felt that the Members of Parliament, the watchdogs of the taxpayer&#x2019;s purse, should see what is happening to the money which is being put into this Government organization. When we talk about development, we want to know how many jobs have been created to provide employment for the natural increase of Africans in the reserves. We are not even worrying at the moment about all the Africans living outside the reserves because under this Government&#x2019;s policy they will never get work in the reserves. We want to know how many jobs have been created there.</p>

<p>The Government is attempting to keep the Africans at home. When one considers that an estimated 60 per cent of the male population of the Transkei between the ages of 18 and 45 are working outside the Transkei at any given time, the question arises: where is the Minister going to give these people work in the Transkei? How is he going to find work for them in the Transkei? He tries to keep them there, and every day we see them standing in queues before the Labout Bureau, trying to get permits to go out to work. They do not want permits to buy luxury articles. They want permits to go out and work in order to get money to buy food for their families. The necessity to work has become more and more urgent because of the series of droughts we have experienced. These people are filled with resentment. They know that the jobs are there for them and that their labour is wanted and what they resent is all the red tape associated with getting through influx control. It is not only the Africans in the reserves who are resentul but also the Africans living in the urban areas. They are resentful because they feel that their security is being threatened. In 1952 the late Dr. Verwoerd altered section 10 of the Urban Areas Act to give them certain rights. Those who were born in an area or who lived there for a certain period had the right to remain in that area but they fear, listening to Government spokesmen and also considering the Bill which the hon. the Minister introduced last year to control their labour, that this may be an indirect way of getting them out of the cities. This resentment is there. It may not always come to the force because a lot of them are afraid to criticize. They see what happens to others who criticize and they know that the security police are active. A lot of them are afraid to criticize although the resentment is burning within. What we have got to do is be careful that we do not unwittingly drive these people into the arms of terrorists because they will become ripe for indoctrination.</p>

<p>I want to give an example of one man who was banned because he criticized Government policy. At one stage he was banned and he lost his job but then we believe through the influence of the Chief Minister of the Transkei the ban was lifted and now he is a Cabinet Minister in the Transkeian Government. Now he can talk more freely. He made a speech the other day in which he set out the frustrations of the Africans and what their hopes and ideals were.</p>

<p>The voters must now decide for which policy they are going to vote, the Government&#x2019;s policy or ours. What they must bear in mind is that once the Government puts its policy into effect it can never be withdrawn. Once we give independent status to these Bantustans we cannot take it back. We must learn the lesson of what has happened up North where independence has been given to moderate people who were thought would form the new government whereas in time, usually after the first election, it was found that the Government had been taken over by extremists. Now we have an example on our borders. If it should happen that we give independence to one of these Bantustans and hand the government over to people whom we think are moderates and able to govern, and then find that they lose control, and that the government has been taken out of their hands, we cannot then order a general election as is being done now in Lesotho. Then we can do nothing. We will be completely helpless. We must also remember that these Bantustans are going to be on our borders. It is amazing how many people are under the impression that the coast of the Transkei belongs to the Republic and is not included in the area which was handed over to the Transkeian government. Of course they are quite wrong because the <span class="col_271-272" refersTo="page_0148"/>coastline was in fact also handed over. The proof of my argument is that boarding houses which were previously owned by white persons are now being handed over to Africans for them to run. The whole coastline will therefore eventually be taken over by the Africans. As I have said it does not matter if we have a sympathetic government which is friendly disposed to us, but we never know when the government may change. We never know what may happen there on those boundaries. That does not only apply to the Transkei but to all the other territories, part of the boundary of the Transkei and Lesotho as well. It will apply to all the other territories. I ask the electorate to bear that in mind. The electorate must remember that once the Government&#x2019;s policy has been carried out there is no turning back. In terms of our policy the control will be left in our hands. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. H. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat spoke in the general vein of the charge sheet submitted to this House by the United Party. I also want to speak about that charge sheet; consequently I believe that the hon. member will excuse me if I do not specifically follow him up in his argument. The Opposition submitted a six point charge sheet to this House. If one looks at those six points it appears as if this Government has failed on all fronts. It has failed on the economic front as well as on the political and social fronts. That is according to the United Party charge sheet. To have, on the one hand, a government that has failed so completely, and on the other hand, a nation enjoying so much prosperity, peace, quiet and order as we have in this country, are two ideas that are irreconcilable. This brought to mind the question: Is the Opposition serious in coming to the House with this charge sheet of theirs? In the course of the debate I tried to measure the degree of their seriousness. At this stage I just want to mention one test to prove that, in my opinion, the Opposition is not serious.</p>

<p>Sir, if things in South Africa are as this Opposition has claimed them to be, it is vitally necessary that there should be a general election, not on 22nd April, but sooner. This would be vitally necessary, because in that case South Africa is in a perilous position. If things are as the Opposition claims them to be, and if they themselves believe this to be so, one would expect them to grasp at the opportunity of going to the voters in order to try to save South Africa from this situation. But. on the contrary, what do we find? Objections to the election on 22nd April. They do not want an election now. How is this reconcilable with this state of emergency which they have, in point of fact, presented to this House? They do not want a general election now.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. H. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>We have now heard all the criticisms. One objection is, for example, that we must think of the millions of rands which are going to be spent on this election. If, on the face of it, this is the position, those few million rands which are possibly going to be spent on an election are a mere bagatelle to save South Africa and to give these people on my right the chance to do so. Apart from the fact that that million rand story does not hold good at all, a general election must in any case take place, a year later, in fact, if not now. The millions of rands would in any case have had to be spent. This gives us an indication of how little seriousness there is on the part of the Opposition. They object on the basis of not wanting an election now. Why do they not want an election?</p>

<p>This is the first time that that is being said in this debate, and the first time that I have heard that they are looking forward to it. Why do they object to the earlier election? There can only be two reasons.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. H. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>There was an abundance of objections here. The hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2019;s objections stirred him to eloquence. The first reason is that the Opposition has no faith in the case which it submitted here The only other possible reason is that if die Opposition does, in fact, have faith in its case, it does not have faith in the sound judgment of the voters. There is no justification for the existence of an Opposition party, any party, in fact, which does not have faith in the sound judgment of the voters. Its existence is futile. Why would it exist if it does not have the confidence to go to the voters when an election must take place? The Opposition may now argue about this as much as they like. One of these two considerations apply. They may decide which of the two it is.</p>

<p>I have also looked at this yellow booklet which is lying around here. &#x201C;You may ask and we shall give&#x201D; and &#x201C;You want it, we have it&#x201D;. Both these slogans mean more or less the same thing. As a person from South West Africa I specifically looked in that booklet for two answers which are very important to me. I did not find those two answers. I want to deal with these two unanswered questions. At this stage I want to tell the Opposition that general statements such as those made in that booklet are mass-appeal statements so obviously aimed at the man who is harbouring one or other grievance or fancied grievance. The booklet is specifically aimed at canvassing the votes of such people. I also want to tell the Opposition that to build a future party upon aggrieved persons or upon the grievances of persons holds nothing but disaster for such a party.</p>

<p>We are now in 1970 where we have sufficient white bread to eat and not in 1940 when we did not have it. In that yellow booklet the question about what is going to happen to South West Africa, the original mandate territory, is not answered. It is a very important question, and what will eventually happen to South West Africa will have to be decided in this House and not in South West Africa. The governing party in this House will have to make that decision. The Opposition claims that it is going to be the governing party. Such a decision could bring it into conflict with international forces. However, the people in South West Africa know what the answer of the National Party and the government to-day is. The people in South West Africa do not know what the answer of this Opposition is. [Interjections.] The United Party wrote three lines in that booklet and they did not even have the courage to write what the hon. member for Yeoville has now been telling me so loudly, i.e. that they fought for South West Africa. They did not even have the courage to write it down there. The three lines they wrote in the booklet about South West Africa are meaningless. If, then, the hon. member for Yeoville has the answer which he has just called out to me, why did he not write it down in the yellow booklet, so that the people in South West Africa could read it.</p>

<p>I know what people in South West Africa know and I also know what they do not know. The second question, which is of the very greatest importance to us in South West Africa, is what the Bantu policy of the alternative government in South Africa is. For us. who are in a much less favourable position, in respect of the numbers of Bantu, than the Whites in South Africa are. this question is very important. For the first time in my life&#x2014;it is perhaps my own fault&#x2014;I have seen the United Party&#x2019;s Bantu policy in writing. Before I come to the relevant question, I first want to sketch the background as I see it. If this party wants to see its Bantu policy only succeeding temporarily, only at the moment when it is instituted, it will have to turn back the clock for the Bantu in South West Africa by 50 years, it will have to turn back the clock 50 years for the world. Can they in all honesty stand before the people of South Africa and say that the Bantu will accept that policy which will, in the future, contain nothing for them but frustration, frustrated leaders, leaders which are created and then put under restraint? Can they say for one moment that the Bantu of today. at his present stage of development, who has to develop further, will accept this? Or do they immediately want a continual clash as a result of their frustrated leaders and their people, literally and figuratively, marching. They will get as far as that wall they are building and no further. With that wall they are building there will always be White domination for them. It is clear, and it does not help to hide it, that human material will beat against that wall day after day, hour after hour. It is also clear that at some stage that wall will break. The United Party is making provision for the moment when that wall breaks. They are making provision for something which must happen in the future. However, they do not tell us what they expect will happen. But all that can be expected is for that wall, which they have built, to break. They do not tell us what will break that wall. They are making provision for it by saying that the day on which that wall breaks the voters of South Africa will, one way or another, decide what must be done. There is nothing strange in a party saying that it will go to the voters and ask for a decision. The National Party has already done so here and in South West Africa. But that party has a responsibility, i.e. when the voters are approached the party must have a standpoint upon which to do so. When in the past the National Party said it was going to the voters, it did so with a standpoint. It said, this is my standpoint and in this connection I am testing the opinion of the voters. What is the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint in respect of the day when that wall will break? The voters must know. Look how unreasonable they are. It is such a simple matter simply to shrug off your responsibility by saying that if matters take a different turn in the future to what I expected I will ask the voters to give a decision. But I am not going to adopt a standpoint now about that decision that must be made. I am just going to leave that to the voters. A man who says in his will that the children must decide is a fool. Is it right to shrug off, in that way, those responsibilities which I must meet to-day in order to plan properly for the future? Look what they are doing to those children who must decide. By this policy of theirs they want to place those children, who must decide, irrevocably in a crush-pen. They are already doing so now with this policy. Then it is said that they will have to decide later. Every cattle farmer in this House knows what a crush-pen is. One cannot move to the right or to the left. One cannot go backwards, one just has to go forward. That is exactly what they are doing here. And when this decision is one day made, a decision which the children will have to make, as the hon. member to my right so wisely said &#x2026; [Interjections.] If any of those hon. members can say to-day precisely what the future development pattern of the Coloured will be I could give him my reply. The Coloured does not know it, he does not know it and neither do I. To-day, for the first time in his history, the Coloured is being placed on a path of development where he can work out a pattern for himself. It would be foolish to try to anticipate that pattern. I think hon. members ought to know that. Mr. Speaker, they are placing these children irrevocably in a crush-pen and when this choice must be made, which they envisage will have to be made in the future, only one of two things can happen. Either one must give less, i.e. one must take away, or one must give more. One cannot <span class="col_275-276" refersTo="page_0150"/>move to the left or to the right. Neither can one take away what one has given. This Opposition policy is in the first place calculated to satisfy the voter who believes in &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. In this policy that voter can see the realization of his standpoint. In the second place it is calculated to canvas the vote of, and to satisfy, that individual who thinks no further than the present day and the comforts of the present day and who is not prepared to make sacrifices where they must be made under National Party policy.</p>

<p>After seeing this policy in writing, and after having given it my consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the policy of the Progressive Party in South Africa holds out better prospects for the Whites in this country. I have come to the conclusion that the policy of the Progressive Party in South Africa at least contains more vision and more honesty than the policy of the Opposition. We know where the Progressive Party is heading. They also accept the course they have adopted. Their course is not acceptable to us, leading as it does to a point where the Whites will one day lose all control over themselves. At least they want to take a path of peace. From the onset this Opposition chooses a path of clashes and conflicts.</p>

<p>Another aspect which struck me was the way in which, during this Session, the Opposition has revelled in the supposed adversity which had overtaken the National Party. I say &#x201C;supposed&#x201D; adversity because the ballot boxes will still indicate the true victims of adversity. I think the hon. member for Durban (Point) realized this when he tried to make us believe that the Nationalists to my side were exactly the same kind of people as the hon. members of the Herstigte Nasionale Party. He realized that the effort involved in burning all the midnight oil, with all the ink that flowed, in order to make the English-speaking people in South Africa believe that the National Afrikaner is a racialistic bully, could now be nullified by the actions of this hon. gentleman sitting here in front of me. It must be stopped. That is why the hon. member spoke as he did and why an hon. member to my right spoke as he did yesterday. This must be stopped. I want to express my regret to the hon. members of the Herstigte Nationale Party that they came to South West Africa. I hoped they would not come. And if these words of mine afford them any pleasure I do not begrudge them this pleasure because I think they will need it, in South West Africa as well. We have three white language groups in South West Africa, and through dedication and the principles laid down here in the House we have created harmony among these three groups. We have created trust between these language groups. We told the other language groups, i.e. the English-speaking people and the German-speaking people, that the Afrikaner knows his own language struggle; he knows his cultural struggle and he knows humiliation for the sake of those spiritual pos sessions. That is why I said that they could trust the Afrikaner with their spiritual possessions. Now these hon. members of the H.N.P. have come to South West Africa, and I want to give them credit for having made a good effort at undermining that confidence in the Afrikaner&#x2019;s judgment. I think my time is nearly up, but I just want to say in conclusion that the Afrikaner has had a taste of humiliation on the way up. He has a knowledge of humiliation, and I myself can mention many examples. These hon. members of the H.N.P. can themselves mention many examples, but if they should succeed and the Afrikaner were to go back on his word, given in the course of the years, i.e. no discrimination in respect of language, culture and spiritual assets, and respect of religious convictions, it will be the greatest humiliation the Afrikaner has yet known in his history. That is why I say that I regret the fact that this party came to South West Africa at a time when we have an agreeable harmony between the white language groups. We in South West Africa have experienced what racial clashes entail. Twenty years ago there was a United Party Government in power and there was discrimination between Afrikaans-speaking people, German-speaking people and English-speaking people. That racial discrimination was applied in the administration of the area and in legislation there, and we plucked the bitter fruits. However, this racial feeling was neutralized. These hon. members of the Herstigte Nasionale Party may investigate what I am saying now, i.e. that between the Afrikaans-speaking, German-speaking and English-speaking people in South West Africa there exists a mutual trust, even though we differ politically, as it is, of course, each person&#x2019;s right to do. There is a pleasant relationship between the language groups. If I may, in addition, make this last appeal to the hon. member for Ermelo, I want to tell him that South West Africa&#x2019;s position is a difficult one. The position there is even more difficult than that of the Republic. Please do not come and disrupt that now. However, if the hon. member for Ermelo thinks that I am addressing these words to him because I am afraid of what his party is going to do in South West Africa or wants to come and do there, let me tell him that in that case he had better come right along.</p>

<p>This is the fourth day of this no-confidence debate. On the very first day of the debate my Leader made detailed criticisms of the Government party&#x2019;s policies, and among them was a detailed criticism of the overriding question in South African politics, namely that of the race relations policy. He not only again destroyed that policy by his arguments, but in his opening speech, and in great detail, he set out the policy of this party. In the course of four days to date there has been an opportunity for the governing party to criticize the policy outlined by my Leader, but apart from one or two minor points of criticism no hon. member <span class="col_277-278" refersTo="page_0151"/>opposite has found it possible to make chinks in the armour of that policy. On the contrary, we have had the position that to the criticisms of my Leader and others on this side of the Government policy of race relations we have had singularly few answers from hon. members opposite. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that it is only the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration who attempted any serious defence of the Governments policy, and what did he attempt to achieve? He attempted to show that in the border industries over a period of 10 years a total of 81,000 Bantu hid found employment. As he spoke he virtually conceded that this was an absolute drop in the bucket, but he offered it to the House as what had in fact taken place. Neither he nor anyone else opposite was able to come to this House to show how this policy was working out in practice. They were not able to show how we can already see to-day that this policy is succeeding. Indeed, the contrary is true. There was no answer to the figures and facts which show that we can see to-day that this policy has failed. Therefore, where we know that this is the great question for the future, I, from my admittedly perhaps biased point of view, must join issue with the hon. member for Windhoek also. The hon. member for Windhoek, we know, is a very polished speaker, but I suggest that he has not been long enough close to the centre of the Republic to know the weight of the Native policies of the two parties. [Interjections.] When South Africa on 22nd April decides to whom it shall entrust the future, it should certainly know that we look forward to this election with very great enthusiasm. If he in any way divines the fact that we criticized the excuses given by the Government for this election as meaning that we in any way shirk the fight, then he has misinformed himself considerably.</p>

<p>Where one goes into an election the people outside should also realize that behind this race relations policy of the United Party we have an entirely united party, whereas behind the Government party there is the gravest division both on the policy itself and in respect of many other policies. We know that there are countless leading verkramptes&#x2014;I am not going to mention their names to-day&#x2014;who differ fundamentally and on fundamental principles with the governing party, and yet they stay in that party because they say &#x201C;Ons moenie jukskei breek nie&#x201D;. That is the approach. They stay there, although many organs of the Nationalist Party have said that these are fundamental points of difference, because they are seeking to maintain the unity of their party rather than the interests of South Africa. I have no doubt that the people outside realize this situation. If they only knew how divided the governing party was on its own native policy! To deal with this would require a speech on its own, so I will content myself with merely stating the facts here.</p>

<p>Sir, my Leader has pointed out that in the light of the latest figures the whole Native policy of the Nationalist Party is doomed to failure; it is a failure. We do not base this upon our hypotheses; we take the very criteria for success laid down by Nationalist Party leaders. The Nationalist Party leaders&#x2014;firs! of all the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2014;said that by the end of the century there should be approximate parity between the Whites and the non-Whites if there was to be security for the Whites and, by implication, if their policy was to have any validity. This was said not only by the late Dr. Verwoerd, the great architect of the Nationalist Party policy, but we had people like Mr. Willie van Heerden saying as long ago as 1960 that there must be &#x201C;an ensured white majority&#x201D; in the so-called white areas. Sir, we know from the latest figures that the Nationalists&#x2019; calculations were hopelessly out and that they are hopelessly wrong with regard to this basic need for the success of their policy. We know from the latest figures that instead of there being a possibility of parity, we will be roughly one White to three or four Blacks by the year 2000. The figures indicate that there will be 35 million to 40 million Blacks in this country by the year 2000, and the Tomlinson Commission expressed the opinion that a maximum often million may then be considered to be in the reserves. It is quite plain therefore what the ratio is likely to be by the year 2000. Sir, in the face of these figures one would expect some sound arguments to be advanced from the other side to show why there should still be the slightest faith in this policy, but we get none. We simply get the statement from the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development that 81,000 have been given employment in border industries.</p>

<p>Sir, another vital question on this point concerns the attachment or otherwise of the Native peoples outside the reserves to those areas. A well-known Nationalist intellectual, Dr. Rhoodie, has admitted quite frankly that there is not this attachment and that it is not growing. You see. Sir, therefore, that this policy literally stands in ruins. Let us pause and reflect on one or two points here. First of all, the United Party was right from the beginning in regard to the question of numbers and the Government was wrong. The United Party would have been very happy had all the Whites of South Africa lived in a homogeneous homeland somewhere and all the Blacks in some other homogeneous homeland. But we realized that this was not so and that it would never be so, and in the interests of South Africa we said so. The Government gave the people to understand that this degree of separation with a view to ultimate parity in the white areas could be achieved, but it has not been achieved, and I ask the people of South Africa to take account again of the error of the Government in that regard. I <span class="col_279-280" refersTo="page_0152"/>may say that this is still where we are heading notwithstanding the simple device of changing boundaries from time to time to which this Government resorts.</p>

<p>Sir, some of our friends opposite and their supporters outside seem to think that we rejoice in the present situation. I have stressed already that we would be more than delighted if we had homogeneous separate homelands for white and black in this country. We do not rejoice in the fact that we do not have them, but we are entitled to say that we have been right. You do not rejoice because you happen to be right but you are entitled to have it acknowledged that you have been right. Sir, another argument is that we are attempting to frighten people with these numbers. It is the governing party that is trying to frighten the people into supporting their policy by mentioning these numbers. We of the United Party are in no way frightened of numbers. Indeed our whole policy is based on the fact that this theory of one-man-one-vote is so much nonsense. We do not accept it in the slightest in a multi-racial community such as we have in South Africa. It is quite incorrect to say that we are attempting to frighten the people by quoting these figures. It is the Government supporters and Government members who are attempting to frighten the people into doing something about it by citing these overwhelming numbers. The fact is, Sir, that the people of South Africa have more common sense than the Government. They will not be frightened by these figures. [Interjections.] The people of South Africa will not be frightened by them. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said as much. He said this very thing in his speech. He said that he cannot get the people to feel strongly about this. And why do the people not feel strongly about this? It is because they know that it does not accord with common sense to be frightened by this. Many of the hon. gentlemen opposite are farmers. Many of them are outnumbered on their farms by perhaps a 100 or even more non-Whites to one White, but they are not frightened. Indeed, it is on those farms where stable labour conditions have existed for generation after generation that there is the greatest security and stability for all concerned. It is, therefore, a complete fallacy that we in any way are frightened by these numbers. The whole basis of my Leader&#x2019;s speech was that the governing party do not have enough faith in the white man to believe that he can lead this country notwithstanding the disparity of numbers.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration in his speech did a second thing. He asked us to give guarantees that the United Party will reduce the number of Bantu in the so-called white areas. Now I want to say at once to him&#x2014;and I believe I do so on the basis of both past experience and future policies&#x2014;that I think there will be relatively little difference in the numbers of Blacks in the so-called white area whether that Government is in power or whether the United Party is in power.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister is fidgeting in his seat. Let me first of all remind him that we have been able to put this matter to the test. From 1936 to 1948 the United Party with its policies was in power, and thereafter we have had this Government in power. I believe I am correct in saying that the rate of increase of the Native people in the so-called white area has been faster under this Government than under the United Party Government. That is the fact of the matter. I know this does not accord with what hon. members say from platform to platform to try to frighten the people of South Africa about their non-European fellow countrymen. I know that this is a great weapon the Nationalists use to try to frighten the voters. The fact is, however, that under United Party policy of old the rate of increase of Blacks was lower than under the policy of this Government. If we take future policy, the same argument holds good. I believe that the difference will be absolutely minimal. When one bears in mind that, according to the experts, there will be between 35 and 40 million Blacks by the end of the century, of whom clearly 25 to 30 million will be in the &#x201C;white&#x201D; area, I say it will make no difference to the future safety of South Africa at all if there is perhaps a half million more under the United Party at the end of all that time. Let me tell hon. members why. It is true that we have wiser policies in regard to labour matters, but there are many policies of ours which will cause a reduction in the number of Blacks coming to the white areas. One of them is that we shall develop the reserves far faster than they will. It is well-known that they are going at an absolute snail&#x2019;s pace now. It is well-known that we shall encourage private white enterprise to establish factories in those reserves, very much with the purpose of giving employment to the Native people there. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration can say as much as he likes about his 81,000 Bantu in the border industries over 10 years, but he has not told us what harm he has done to the establishment of industries inside those reserves by this policy of border industries. He has not told us.</p>

<p>The whole policy of the Government of course is one of migratory labour as far as possible, and everybody knows that this is about the most inefficient policy possible. I may pause here to say that we are, I notice, having a struggle to make our exports balance with our imports. The whole future of South Africa depends on our being able to stay afloat and being competitive in a risky and competitive world. If we are going to rely on inefficient labour and think that we are going to be able to compete with some of the highly industrialized countries of this world, we have <span class="col_281-282" refersTo="page_0153"/>another thought coming. Under our policy we may have somewhat less migratory labour than under this Government but that labour will be much more efficient and it will require far fewer people to come out of the reserves in order to do the necessary work.</p>

<p>I suggest that it is absolutely apparent to every member in this House that Government policy has hopelessly failed and will not get off the ground. I want to say, as my hon. Leader said last year to the hon. the Prime Minister, that to go on stubbornly with this policy is not the course of statesmanship. Hon. members opposite should really search their consciences as to whether they should not immediately call a halt to this dangerous policy because as I say, there are countless harmful and dangerous consequences of this policy. In the first place let it be absolutely clear that everyone of us in this country is poorer economically as a result of this policy. The pensioner, the farmer and even the parliamentarian is poorer as a result of it. The railwayman, the industrialist and the housewife along with every one else is poorer. [Interjections.] Hon. members ask me why this is so. I will tell them why. I will give just one example. The hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development with great pride in his voice told us that in terms of the Physical Planning Act they had during the course of the past year prevented industry being established on 6,500 morgen of land. He said that this would have given employment to about 260,000 Bantu. In the course of 10 years in the case of his border industries he has given employment to 81,0 Bantu. You can see therefore what a massive amount of wealth-producing industry we have lost in the course of the past year. If the hon. the Minister feels that he is well enough off not to be troubled by that, I can tell him that 99 per cent of South Africans do not share that view. And so this is going to go on. We are going to have more and more wealth-producing factories denied to South Africa because of this policy, which is already on the rocks. This is, as I have said, going to make every one of us poorer and heaven knows it is hard enough for the people to earn a decent living as it is. We just cannot afford this type of waste under a policy that has failed. That is one simple example based on the speech of the hon. the Minister. There are hundreds which could be mentioned which will show that we are a poorer country and therefore much less able to defend ourselves in a dangerous world. This is a point to which hon. members opposite do not seem to attach any weight. We are having to arm ourselves considerably in order to be able to defend ourselves in this world and yet we are making it increasingly difficult for ourselves to be adequately equipped to do so because of our lack of economic progress. I have mentioned various of the harmful effects and dangers of this policy. I touched just briefly on the fact that these border industries, if they are going to mean anything, are going to have to be situated close to international boundaries. That is what border industry means. In other words, we are placing a lot of our productive capacity within the grasp of a country over which we will have no say. If we have not by now learnt that there are various communist and other sharks moving around South Africa to exploit and make trouble for us, it is high time that the Government did.</p>

<p>We have tremendous labour shortages and at the same time tremendous unemployment. Every industrialist, housewife and farmer, with few exceptions, is experiencing difficulty with labour. Yet there are people queueing in their thousands in the Eastern Cape and these other reserve areas looking for jobs. The fact is that they are not able to get these jobs legitimately. They are streaming down here without the proper authority to look for work. It is very well known. When one goes to the Bantu Commissioner&#x2019;s court here, one can speak to any of the old policemen in that court and they will tell you that all these unfortunate people from these areas do, is that, although they cannot get permission to come, they come down here. They lie low until they have saved up enough money to pay the fine for being here without permission. When they have enough money to pay that fine they start going about in a normal way. They are picked up. Of course in this way we have this tremendous number of pass offences. They pay the fine imposed and then remain here illegally. This is what is happening. Therefore, even the numbers that we receive from the hon. Ministers and Deputy Ministers make very little impression on me, because everybody knows that there is a tremendous number of people down here in all these parts quite irregularly.</p>

<p>I am moving to another harmful effect. One of these aspects of Government policy is not to give sufficient houses for the non-European and particularly the Bantu population, because they are presumably hoping that they will not come down here. But what effect does this have? These people have to come here in order to work. So they come here, and what do they do? They do two things. Firstly, they double up in the existing houses in the locations. Secondly, they go and sleep with friends in the white townships of South Africa. If only they would receive the proper housing, these people, instead of being in Sea Point and these other places, would go to their own townships and spend the night there. But that does not happen. They cannot be here on a proper legal basis; they are here on an illegal basis. No wonder we experience a massive amount of crime. This policy, of course, causes massive harm to the whole social fabric of our people and particularly of our Native people, because their family life is undermined so much. The hon. the Minister said that the increase in the population of the Natives in the white areas is largely due to births. That may be true. It was always true in U.P. times as well. But the fact is, of course, that a very high proportion of those births are illegitimate births. Another aspect, in regard particularly to the Western <span class="col_283-284" refersTo="page_0154"/>Cape, is that a very high number of illegitimate births among the Coloured people is due to the migratory system. So, Sir, it is not as if the country can tolerate these harmful effects for a certain time with any possibility that, because of a later success of the policy, they are going to be removed. The fact is that the statistical basis of the policy is absolutely destroyed. The basis which the Government themselves laid down has been destroyed. Yet we have them muddling along year after year in the country with this policy. We have heard no defence of that policy in this debate which held water and in any way restored credibility of this policy. Apparently we are going to muddle through. However, I believe that the Government supporters are realizing that they have no answer. I sense a certain satisfaction, almost, that their own time in government is running out. They are quite unable to cope with the policies of the future. Their whole defence in this debate, the whole basis on which they resort to argue this debate, has been matters that occurred long ago in this country of ours. The whole argument in this debate has been what they did for the people long ago in regard to the flag, this or that or the next thing. But where they have to have policies to face the 1970&#x2019;s, I say they are completely without it. What South Africa needs, is the policy which my hon. Leader outlined at the start of this debate. It not only needs that; it needs above all that my Leader should have his hand on the wheel of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think anyone who has listened to the hon. member for Transkei and to the hon. member for Pinelands, who has just resumed his seat, would agree that my summary of the speeches of both of them was a fair and just one if I said the charge they made against this side of the House was that apartheid was as dead as a dodo. Their view is &#x201C;segregation is as dead as a dodo&#x201D;. Now I want to point out to the United Party that in 1939 in this very House the then Leader of the United Party, General J. C. Smuts, made a speech which had exactly the same theme, i.e. &#x201C;segregation is as dead as a dodo&#x201D;. Therefore, we have been hearing the same refrain from that side of this House for 30 years or more. The only thing that has happened during all that time is that the United Party itself has become as dead as a dodo and that the policy of apartheid has become as lively as a springbuck in South Africa and that it is being applied systematically, as I shall indicate to you, Sir. I should have liked to confine myself to the positive aspects of the application of our policy of apartheid, but with the statement that not one speaker on this side of the House had as yet attacked United Party policy, the hon. member has now forced me to do so. That is the simplest thing in the world. The United Party has a past as regards the white nation in South Africa and it is a dark and black one indeed. I want to take hon. members back to 1929 when the United Party was fighting an election in this country. They are the people who are now asking the Whites to trust them with leadership over a mixed undivided Republic of South Africa. In 1929 General Smuts and others came forward with the grotesque idea that there should be only one dominion in Africa, from the Cape to the northern borders of the Sudan. The 1929 manifesto of the National Party contained the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party coldbloodedly suggests our being swallowed up by the Blacks. Our national pride, our patriotism as well as our own preservation and our own progress must be wiped out as the name of South Africa must also be wiped out from the dictionary of nations.</block>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, the South African Party. The hon. member is simply wasting my time now. After that, when their alliance with the British Empire still existed, they came forward with the partnership idea. At that time it was the policy of the British in Kenya. Subsequent to that, as we will all remember, they came forward with their ordered advance policy. Thereupon they came forward with their middle course policy. Hon. members should please note now, and the electorate will note this, too, that these policies have always had one underlying idea, and that is one mixed, undivided South Africa. That Party has never given up this idea. Following upon these policies they came with the diabolic Senate plan, as hon. members will remember. All these policies were ones designed to sell out the white man in South Africa to the black man. In the same way they came forward in 1929 with the grotesque idea of a dominion of Africa. One can imagine what would have happened had that idea been accepted. At that time the ratio of White to non-White here was one to three. But if that idea had been accepted, the ratio of Bantu to White would have been ten to one in 1929. Hon. members can think for themselves what the position would have been to-day if that idea had been accepted. It will probably hurt United Party members when I say this, but as recently as 1962 the hon. the Leader of the United Party made the following remark in his well-known De Aar speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party policy will lead eventually to a racially mixed Parliament, but <span class="col_285-286" refersTo="page_0155"/>power will be retained in the hands of the white group for the foreseeable future.</block>

<p>In his speech of 9th May, 1962, he was speaking of this Parliament. At that time his honourable adjutant also said in London that in the beginning the Bantu would, of course, be represented by Whites in Parliament, &#x201C;but of course in future we all accept, and our Leader accepts, that they will be replaced by Bantu people&#x201D;. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself said this in 1962 as I have just proved with my quotation. At that time he also spoke of a &#x201C;racially mixed Parliament&#x201D;. In those days their story was that the black man was being suppressed by this Government. I have here a full list of quotations from their speeches, but unfortunately I do not have the time to read them to hon. members. At that time they were the inveterate champions of integration in this country. They preached it openly, and still did so seven years ago. But then they took fright.</p>

<p>Now I should like to indicate to the United Party how they have always had the underlying principle of &#x201C;one leadership over one undivided mixed South Africa&#x201D;. From the year dot we have been fighting with them about that. But then they took fright because they could not win any election. In 1962 we had that speech by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition at De Aar, from which I have just quoted a passage; to say nothing of the hon. member for Karoo who made the following proposal in April, 1967, i.e. three years ago. I quote him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; The urban Africans be entitled to purchase land for building purposes or buy a house in proclaimed African location townships. From these people will grow a responsible class of African citizens and these will be entitled to elect eight Africans to Parliament.</block>

<p>He proposed that in 1967. We then gave the hon. the Leader of the Opposition such a sound thrashing in this House that he did not know what was happening to him. If I have to withdraw that, I do so at once. But I can remember the time when I, as a young back-bencher. issued the challenge to the Leader of the Opposition that we would like to see him repudiate that member publicly or that we would watch to see what was going to happen to the hon. member for Karoo. I can also recall how he sweated that afternoon when the hon. the Prime Minister took him to task on that matter. I spoke next and I told him that we would watch with interest to see what action they were going to take against that hon. member for Karoo. These are the people who are denying that they stand for integration. Up to the present time no action has been taken against that hon. member; he is still in the United Party. Now I just want to ask, how will they gull the voters into believing that the voters should entrust their future for the maintenance of the white race to them? When they saw that they could not win votes by those means, they came forward with the federation idea. That, however, is still based on the same old principle, i.e. one undivided mixed South Africa. Now we find this bit of ridiculousness, i.e. that in the year 1970, after this National Party has been in power for 20 years during which time it has not been idle but has been achieving many fine results, as I hope to illustrate to you, Sir, they come forward with this booklet, &#x201C;You want it, we have it&#x201D;.

Neither the United Party nor anybody in the Republic of South Africa can undo the Transkeian territory, the Transkeian people with their Assembly, Prime Minister, all the Departments, Bantu Ministers, several thousands of public servants in those various Departments, a people that has been led on the road of independent development by this Government. But they still talk of an &#x201C;undivided South Africa&#x201D;, which no longer exists, as they did in the year 1929. An undivided South Africa is gone for ever, and for that reason I say that this so-called &#x201C;cornerstone&#x201D; mentioned in the first sentence, on which their <span class="col_287-288" refersTo="page_0156"/>policy is based, and on which they are going to fight an election, no longer exists at all. In this regard I can also mention the Shangana people and its territory, Assembly, Prime Minister and other Ministers and Departments, to say nothing of the Bavenda, the Tswana and the seven or eight others. The United Party has become absolutely antiquated. They have allowed history to leave them behind altogether as though they were living 40 years in the past. Now they tell the people quite magnanimously that they can maintain leadership over an undivided South Africa. That is impossible, because it no longer exists. Consequently they have no cornerstone on which their policy is based.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said here to the effect that our policy allegedly was such a failure. Let me say at once that we have been proceeding very systematically with the implementation of our policy of apartheid. It has been implemented in a planned fashion. During the past 10 years we have placed the emphasis on the political development of the Bantu. At the end of that period of 10 years the political set-up of the Bantu and the Bantu homelands has been given its final form, so much so that only one people remains, i.e. the Zulu people, that has not obtained its own Assembly as yet. If the Zulu king had not died, this matter would have been completed according to plan by the National Government at the end of the ninth year, i.e. the laying of the foundations of this political and independent development. Nobody is going to undo this. In the second phase of the implementation of this policy we have been moving gradually in the direction of the economic development of the Bantu homelands. Allow me to say with the utmost emphasis that this Government regards the economic development of the Bantu homelands as one of the biggest tasks with which our people&#x2014;and this includes all of us&#x2014;has been faced in the 300 years of its history. It is an ambitious and difficult task to give economic content to the political development that has been created. It is a new political set-up that has been created here in Southern Africa by the National Government over the past 10 years. We have progressed a long way on that road of economic development.</p>

<p>In this regard we have plans we can present to our voters, plans of our intention to make an epoch-making decade of the seventies by leading these homelands to further economic development during the next ten years. When we speak of economic development, our aim is very simple and very clear, i.e. the establishment of employment opportunities for the Bantu in each homeland so as to enable the largest number of Bantu to obtain work in the homelands and to settle there. That is our plan and we have progressed a long way in this regard.</p>

<p>Now I want to give hon. members a few examples. This year the Rand Afrikaans University established a Department of Development of Under-Developed Nations. Here people with the necessary grounding and with the necessary background are going to be trained to assist with this difficult task, i.e. the creation of employment opportunities in the homelands. They will also help to give economic content to the political development of the homelands. I am no prophet when I say that the institute for development which has been established there is still going to receive wide international recognition. I say this on account of the fact that South Africa has already distinguished itself in this field. Even at this stage there are many leading figures overseas, and I am able to speak from the personal testimony of a few of them, who say that there probably is no country in the world which has progressed as far as we have in the field of the development of its underdeveloped population groups. Hon. members opposite will not say this, but I will say it, because it is true thanks to this National Government. Surely this is a proud achievement. Our great task here in South Africa was, <i>inter alia,</i> to make our people conscious of the need for doing this.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize once again that if there is one matter which we should regard as being above politics, it is this. We must involve all our people in the task of setting this economic development into motion. Since my appointment to this position, I have been paying special attention to doing so. Do hon. members know what the result has been? The result has been that a city council such as the Johannesburg City Council has decided in principle to make a large amount available for homeland development and homeland settlement. On 12th February &#x2026;</p>

<p>I know this hurts, but it does show how antiquated the United Party has become. This party has fallen behind a very long way indeed. I want to interrupt myself for a moment in order to bring them up to date. Two speakers rose here this afternoon and made the statement, &#x201C;segregation is as dead as a dodo&#x201D;. I asked them <span class="col_289-290" refersTo="page_0157"/>whether my interpretation of what they had said was correct and they actually said it was. If this is what they believe, they are overlooking the oracles against apartheid in the U.N. Do they really think &#x201C;segregation is as dead as a dodo&#x201D; if such things are happening against South Africa at the U.N. Surely, that is being childishly naive. Why, in the opinion of the hon. members, were demonstrations recently staged in England against the Springboks? Surely they were aimed at our policy of apartheid. While this is happening in the outside world, we actually have in this House an antiquated party, these speakers of which maintain that &#x201C;segregation is as dead as a dodo&#x201D;. They should ask the Blask Sash whether &#x201C;segregation is as dead as a dodo&#x201D;. They should ask the Progressive Party whether &#x201C;segregation is as dead as a dodo&#x201D;. They do not know what they are talking about. They think they can govern this country with General Smuts of 1929 and that they can go to the electorate in that way. Do they think the electorate will take any notice of them? I think in this election they will be rejected by the electorate as they have never been rejected before. They deserve that. Politically they are as dense as can be, and one is astonished at the lack of political susceptibility on the part of the people of this party. I have mentioned the fact here that the Johannesburg City Council has voted a certain amount for homeland development. I may tell the hon. members that we have expectations of the Port Elizabeth City Council doing the same thing at an early date, and we are grateful for that. We are not trying to make political capital out of this in any way, and I shall be very pleased if those hon. members will not try to make political capital out of it either. The following town councils have all voted money for this purpose, and I shall give the relative amounts: Benoni&#x2014;R152,000, Boksburg&#x2014;R300,000, Alberton&#x2014; R50,000, Alexandra Peri-Urban Board&#x2014; R290,000, a small town like Empangeni&#x2014; R8,000, a small town like Escourt&#x2014;one can virtually say the widow&#x2019;s crock&#x2014;R10,000, the Resettlement Board&#x2014;R70,000, Klerksdorp &#x2014;R100,000, Krugersdorp&#x2014;R80,000, Ladysmith &#x2014;R50,000 and a very small town like Modderfontein, R5,000. In addition there was a very small village like Maburgh, which voted an amount of R500 for development.</p>

<p>Is that not from the beer profits?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I shall come to that. These amounts were made available by local authorities to the S.A. Bantu Trust in order to assist with the development of the Bantu homelands, and the amounts from the profits on beer I have just read to you, Sir, total R2,052,000. This was done unconditionally. I now come to the question put to me by the hon. member for Transkei. I shall now give the round figures from fees levied by those local authorities for the development of towns in the Bantu homelands; this is specifically for Bantu homeland towns: Durban, R14,368,000; Nelspruit, R143,000, East London, R8,368,000, Pietersburg, R831,000, Pretoria, R2,402,000, Rustenburg, R415,000, a total of R26,729,508. And then, from the local authorities jointly, further funds were made available from the surpluses of the Bantu Revenue Account for the development of townships and homelands, and in respect of the East Rand this amount came to R2.1 million [Interjections.] In respect of the West Rand the figure was R1.4 million. The position simply is that we have succeeded along these lines, in spite of the United Party, to activate local authorities, other institutions and our people to carry out this important and noble task, a task we are accomplishing so successfully.</p>

<p>But this is not all. We have also succeeded in obtaining the assistance of the Bantu. I want to mention one example only. The example concerns a Bantu party which recently fought an Urban Bantu Council election, and I quote from its manifesto&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Once more, my people, I say to you let us start now to develop ourselves. Let us accept self-development now to develop ourselves. Let us accept self-development now and not wait until it is too late. Let any nation try to attack the Republic of South Africa and it will be disappointed to find that all Bantustans which are known to us as a Republican commonwealth will stand side by side with the Central European Government for the motherland of South Africa.</block>

<p>And this party won the election with as great a margin as that with which the National Party defeated the Van der Merwe United Party men in a previous election. In this way we have awakened the Bantu as far as these matters are concerned. The hon. member for Transkei said we had failed to implement the recommendations of the Tomlinson Report, but I want to point out that the Tomlinson Report recommended that an amount of R208 million be spent on Bantu homeland development during the first 10 years. But during the period 1959 to 1969 this National Government spent R332.202,000 on development in the Bantu homelands. [Interjections.] In this way we have achieved results which virtually exceed all belief. But, Sir, I just want to point out what <span class="col_291-292" refersTo="page_0158"/>success we have achieved in establishing Bantu in the homelands and in creating employment opportunities for the Bantu in the homelands, and what success we have had with the progressive withdrawal of Whites from the homelands in which we have established self-government for the Bantu. In 1968 there were 2,822 positions in the government services of the homelands. In 1969 this number was increased to 4,235 high positions for Bantu officials. The number of positions was virtually doubled. The number of Bantu labourers in the service of these governments increased as well. In 1968 there were 10,234, and this was increased to 28,195 in 1969, i.e. nearly three times as many. Does this resemble a policy which is not succeeding? As regards the settlement of Bantu in the Bantu homelands, we succeeded in the case of the Zulu people to settle 11,034 Zulu in Zululand from the Bantu urban prescribed areas within a single year, i.e. 1968-&#x2019;69. Do they think it is an easy matter to resettle 11,000 people from the urban areas, and do they think that most of these people are sitting there without employment? That is not true. As regards the Tswana people, within a single year, 1968-&#x2019;69, we resettled 5,280 Tswana in the Tswana homeland from the urban prescribed areas. Surely this is a tremendous achievement. As regards the Xhosa people, of whom that hon. member is supposed to have some knowledge, we succeeded in a single year 1968-&#x2019;69, to resettle 21,631 Xhosa in the Transkei and the Ciskei from the white prescribed areas, a total of 40,095 for all the homelands in 1968-&#x2019;69.</p>

<p>How many Bantu do you expect there will be in South Africa by the year 2000?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can only say that I personally said two years ago in a speech I made at Pinetown that there was every indication for us to expect that there could be at least 40 million Bantu in South Africa by the year 2000. You may consult the cuttings from the <i>Natal Mercury.</i> But whether one has 30 million or 40 million Bantu here does not dishearten us in the least. What we are concerned with here is this policy under which we are creating the means of livelihood for these people in their own homelands with their own governments and are creating all kinds of employment opportunities for them. The people outside are realizing this to an increasing extent, for example, the town and city councils I have mentioned, but the United Party will never come from its antiquated lairs and no one will get it from there; it will simply die there.</p>

<p>But in addition I should like to point out to you. Sir, seeing that we are dealing with the question of employment opportunities, that the B.I.C. has spent R13 million on the development of the homelands since the establishment of the corporation by this Minister. Through the agency of the B.I.C. only, we have succeeded in providing 2,600 Bantu dealers and 350 householders with an amount of R6.25 million in the form of direct loans and trade credits. We have erected 260 business premises to the value of R1.5 million in the Bantu towns. We have established 10 large business undertakings, 15 factories and 35 beer distribution points. We have established 26 retail businesses and 28 savings banks, all of which employ Bantu. And now I want to say that the B.I.C., where it has achieved all these things within a few years, plans to establish approximately 250 industries and other undertakings, which will provide employment for well over 24,0 Bantu, in the homelands in the next five years. And if we succeed in doing so, we should not overlook the fact that these 24,000 Bantu who are to be provided with employment in this way, will give rise to other jobs. I have the figures here which illustrate what progress we have made with the Xhosa Development Corporation, but I have to conclude this part of my speech by saying that the successes we have achieved in this regard are simply unbelievable, because we have succeeded in bringing about separation in the Republic of South Africa to an increasing extent. We have made an accomplished fact of political separation in this House and we are bringing about to an increasing extent economic separation, social separation and all those things.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. DELPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, initially I want to address myself very modestly to the four members of the Herstigte Nasionale Party. Those four hon. members and their party are thriving upon the finest and holiest of cultural institutions and assets of the Afrikaner nation, of which they are members. In the process they are causing some harm to that nation, of which they are members, but what is more, since South Africa became a Republic a fine spirit of co-operation and friendship has developed and flourished in this country between the Afrikaans-speaking and the English-speaking South Africans. Those four hon. members are obstructing this spirit which has grown and blossomed, and I want to tell them very modestly that for the continued existence of the white man in South Africa the two white groups need each other&#x2019;s help in this country. But I also want to put the question to them: Why are they trying to discredit their erstwhile colleagues day by day, in season and out of season, erstwhile colleagues who remain loyal to the National Party which, under its celebrated leader, never hesitates to accept the challenges of the modern world. You, Mr. Leader of that young party, are discrediting them, but you are also treading the path of the past enemies of the National Party and of South Africa. You know that they never succeeded. They never succeeded in discrediting immortal leaders such as Dr. Malan. Advocate Strydom and Dr. Verwoerd, and I want to assure you that this National Party and this South African nation will never allow you to discredit our celebrated leader. Mr. Speaker, a certain report which they called &#x201C;The True Story&#x201D; came to my attention a short while ago. Here is &#x201C;The Whole Story&#x201D;, by Mr. J. A. Marais, which appeared in <i>The Star</i> of 9th January. I do not want to refer to all the blunders; I just want to refer to one important blunder. On that day I was privileged to visit the Prime Minister in the company of Mr. Marais. We held discussions about certain principles, and among other things the Prime Minister asked us: &#x201C;If I were allowed the time, the place and the opportunity. could an Olympiad be arranged in South Africa?&#x201D; Sir, plainly and without any doubts the hon. member for Innesdal said that he had no objections in principle to an Olympiad in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, what is strange is this: It is the hon. member who, for the sake of a possible All Blacks tour, thought fit to establish a new party in South Africa.</p>

<p>In one of the newspapers which they publish, which is sometimes called an Afrikaans translation of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> and which is also called <i>The Afrikaner,</i> it is, for example, claimed that (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is it not also a shocking experience for Mr. Kruger to hear that as a witness Mr. Delport contradicted the Prime Minister?</block>

<p>This was as a result of the discussion which took place in the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office. Sir, on that occasion I was privileged to be present, and at the end of our discussion I had the privilege of saying to the hon. the Prime Minister: &#x201C;Mr. Prime Minister, I endorse this sports policy without further ado (<i>klakkeloos</i>).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#delport">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. DELPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I could also say it because I have said it in this open House of Assembly. Referring to the hon. the Prime Minister I said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was my leader who drew up a formula for the coming generations, a formula in respect of our participation in international sport, and I venture to say that coming generations will also pay tribute to my leader for this formula which he drew up and through Which he placed international sport on the footing where it belongs.</block>

<p>Sir, then there still remains this question: Why must the hon. members of that young party, together with the official Opposition, now try, in season and out of season, to criticize National Party Members of Parliament and National Party candidates? The answer is very clear. The joint Opposition is labouring under the false impression that certain constituencies in South Africa, Where there was not a large majority in the 1966 election, are now borderline constituencies. Let me just give them the assurance: According to their standards, my constituency is also a borderline constituency, but on 22nd April a very great disillusionment awaits the joint Opposition. [Laughter.] That hon. member is laughing. There are two very important reasons for that: Those hon. members opposite dare not go to the people of South Africa and match their policy point for point against ours. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Newton Park, who has just made that interjection, dare not come to Port Elizabeth and say that he wants to do away with job reservation or that he wants to oppose the Physical Planning Act.</p>

<p>What remains to a party wanting to contest an election? First try to run down the leader of this party, as they tried to do at the beginning <span class="col_295-296" refersTo="page_0160"/>of this no-confidence debate. But surely they know that it did not succeed in the past. Let me once more give them this assurance: The National Party in South Africa will never allow them to succeed this time.</p>

<p>Sir, I actually stood up because I want to pay tribute to the National Party which has meant so much to my voters and also to the hundreds of voters in other constituencies in terms of our policy of separate development in order to bring peace and quiet to our residential areas. This National Government has ensured that, in terms of our policy of separate development, a once-mixed residential area such as Port Elizabeth (Central) is to-day a purely white residential area where the voters may live in their houses in peace and in honour. I want to add this, since the hon. member for Newton Park will perhaps not like it if I do not say so immediately, because then he may be harangued by the other liberalists in his party: Every non-White from Port Elizabeth (Central) who was resettled was properly and happily settled in other residential areas. The second reason, as I said just now, is that those hon. members do not dare to put the policy of their party to the voters of my constituency or of any other constituency.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#delport">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. DELPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I have done so very frequently in the past, but that hon. member has never held one, and if he does hold one he does so in a small Office. Sir, yesterday the hon. member for Green Point spoke here about our housing question as if it were a question restricted to South Africa alone. That is why I find it so strange that he, as a shadow minister in the United Party, does not also know that it is an international tendency which we find in all the civilized countries of the world. I am not speaking now about all the less-privileged countries. In this connection I should like to mention a few examples. In the Netherlands a young couple&#x2019;s marriage date is sometimes postponed for up to four years because there simply is no suitable accommodation for them. In England, apart from the prevailing housing scarcity, there are a large percentage of dwellings without the basic facilities for hygiene. In the U.S.A. 20 per cent of the inhabitants live in slums. I am not mentioning these matters out of a sense of malice. I am just mentioning these things to indicate that this hon. Minister and his Department were, as far as South Africa is concerned, checking an international tendency.</p>

<p>Sir, there are also other circumstances in South Africa which have made this problem more difficult for us. We inherited an Opposition which not only retarded all the good things we wanted to do in this respect, but <b>which also left us a</b> legacy. They left us a legacy which, according to the Economic Planning Council of those years, it was calculated, would amount to a shortage of 70,000 houses for Whites by the year 1948. We inherited an Opposition which counteracted statute after statute and measure after measure intended to deal with housing in this multiracial country with all its problems. Where were those hon. members opposite, who are now so talkative, when the Group Act was passed in the House of Assembly? What was their contribution to that? What was their contribution when the Community Development Act was passed in this House? What was their contribution when those important amendments to the Slums Act had to be brought about? They were here but they made no contributions.</p>

<p>But there are also other factors which make the task of this hon. Minister of Community Development so much more difficult, and our tributes to this Government so much greater. We have also had other exceptional circumstances here in South Africa. We have had an excellent influx of immigrants. Our natural population growth has increased beautifully. As a result of the drought which ravaged the interior, a large number of our people moved to the cities. They had to be properly accommodated there. If we add to this the tremendous industrial prosperity, and the attendant rapid development of the infra-structure, the task has only become greater. Therefore I say that, on behalf of my voters and the thousands of other voters in South Africa, we pay tribute to this Government for the way in which it has provided accommodation for our people and for the way in which it has brought about apartheid in our cities so that there can be peace and quiet.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I also want to pay tribute to this Government because, in the first place, it also restored the honour of the South African people when declaring this country a Republic. Also in that respect I do not want to rake un old stories, but through the establishment of the Republic of South Africa and the constitutional development of the many peoples in this country in terms of our policy of separate development, constitutional and political peace prevails here. What does that hon. member, who was so talkative a moment ago, suggest for his voters? That hon. member and his party suggest a mini-U.N. in this white Parliament for the voters of South Africa. That is why they cannot put their policy of race federation to their voters. They dare not risk it because the voters of South Africa have rejected it and will do so again. I also want to pay tribute to this Government because, in terms of our labour policy, there is peace in our labour sphere. There could only be this peace because we apply the policy of job reservation. Yesterday we heard a tirade here by the hon. member for Hillbrow. It appeared to me as if he was convinced in his own heart that he had proved that there is a tremendous manpower shortage in South Africa. He was convinced in his own heart that <span class="col_297-298" refersTo="page_0161"/>that tremendous labour shortage is the result of job reservation. Then the reasonable question was put to him: If your party were to come into power, would you be prepared to abolish job reservation? He did not want to reply to that. I now ask this question: If a man is convinced in his own heart that he has decided a question, that he has put his finger on the problem, and a question is put to him and he does not have the courage to reply to it, what right have those hon. members to go to the voters of South Africa with this propaganda booklet and to expect them to believe that the promises contained in it will be implemented?</p>

<p>No. It is a privilege for me to pay tribute to this Government because it has also ensured that the young people of South Africa are no longer, as in the past, denied the great privilege of receiving higher education merely as a result of a lack of money. That is a period which is past. In terms of the policy of this Government no young person with the intellectual competence will be denied the privilege of receiving higher education. My constituency and the city from which I come are privileged in that this Government has given us our own university. [Interjection] That hon. member who is so talkative may tell the House in a moment what part he played in having that university established for that city of ours. This Government gave us our own university. In our part of the world, as in the rest of South Africa, a young generation is growing up which, if it has the intellectual competence, can also enjoy that wonderful privilege of higher education at a university. Mr. Speaker, to this National Party which has grown in the relentless footsteps of our immortal leaders, to this party which is being led by our dynamic and celebrated leader, to this National Party, which is the only true political home for the white man in South Africa, and to this Government do I bring my humble tribute.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, allow me, just in passing, to refer to what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) said today to the effect that he endorsed the sport policy of this Government without further ado. He should really read the Hansard of 9th February, 1967, column 953, where he will see what he himself said when the sport policy still was as Dr. Verwoerd had laid it down. Then he will understand why he still has the problem of keeping matters in order. Then he will probably not juggle matters to and fro to such an extent, because he had to chop and change so much regarding this policy that I want to tell him in all sympathy that I think he does not quite know what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end &#x201C;because of &#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) its persistent watering down and abandonment of the sound and proved principles of Nationalism in which the people expressed its confidence under the leadership of the late Dr. H. F. Verwoerd;</li>

<li>(b) its weakening of the conditions for a successful policy of segregation between Whites and non-Whites;</li>

<li>(c) its abuse of the powers of the State; and </li>

<li>(d)its adoption and pursuit of United Party policy, for which the Government has no mandate, and which, <i>inter alia,</i> finds expression in&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) its outward and economic policies which form the basis of the Government&#x2019;s rejection of the point of view of the late Dr. Verwoerd in connection with non-Whites in visiting sporting teams;</li>

<li>(ii) the increasing admittance of non-Whites to hotels for Whites and other forms of social mixing of the races;</li>

<li>(iii) the ousting of Whites from their employment by non-Whites; and </li>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before returning to the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Transport last Tuesday, I am grateful that the hon. the Minister of Community Development is in his bench, because there is something which I would like to address to him. There were reports in the Press about the permission which he gave to the Girl Guides for a mixed parade and a mixed tea party on the Caledonian ground in Pretoria. According to newspaper reports, the hon. the Minister indicated that he had not said, &#x201C;The Government is happy about the mixed parade&#x201D;. For the record, I just want to have this very clear. Here is a photostatic copy of a letter from the Office of the hon. the Minister, reference number M/C/l, of 16th June, 1969, signed by his private secretary. It is addressed to the &#x201C;Chief Commissioner, Girl Guides&#x201D;, and it reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By direction of the Hon. B. Coetzee, Minister of Community Development, I acknowledge receipt of your circular letter, dated 30th May, 1969, regarding Lady Baden Powell&#x2019;s proposed visit to South Africa, and have to inform you that he agrees with your exposition.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, he states explicitly that he agrees with this &#x201C;exposition&#x201D;. How does the &#x201C;exposition&#x201D; read? Paragraph (2) of the &#x201C;exposition&#x201D; begins likes this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_299-300" refersTo="page_0162"/>The Government is happy about the mixed parades.</block>

<p>Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister: If he says, &#x201C;The Government is happy about the mixed parades&#x201D;, or the Girl Guides say, &#x201C;The Government is happy about the mixed parades&#x201D; and the Minister says, &#x201C;I agree: The Government is happy about the mixed parades&#x201D;, what is the difference? [Interjections.] This hon. Minister tried frantically to get out of it by splitting hairs, but I just want to tell hon. members that, if they still cannot believe what stands here, there is the &#x201C;Government&#x201D; which is &#x201C;happy about the mixed parades&#x201D;. He does not look too &#x201C;happy&#x201D; to me, I must say.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Vryburg asked me, when I recently held a meeting there, whether I would be prepared to appear on the same platform with the hon. the Minister of Community Development and debate this matter. I said there that it would be a very great pleasure to me. Now I just want to say something to the hon. the Minister and to the hon. member for Vryburg to-day. If that offer is made, I shall accept it.</p>

<p>I also want to tell the hon. the Minister that this policy which he is busy applying is not the apartheid policy. It is the policy of racial integration. It is the application of the policy which he followed in the United Party. He is not busy promoting apartheid. He is busy breaking down the resistance of the white man to the idea of racial integration. He is busy creating the conditions for the destruction of the policy of separate development.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. I am grateful that he is here. I would greatly appreciate it if he would listen to a paragraph from a document which I want to read to him now. The paragraph reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Monitoring (<i>meeluistering</i>) will continue as in the past: Provided that information from all monitoring sources which is or may be of security importance is to be made available to the Bureau and other members of the intelligence community who are concerned.</block>

<p>In case the hon. the Minister clearly heard what I read, I want to state quite clearly that it appears on page 6, paragraph 10, of the document. The front page of this document is a letter-head from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office. The address on the letterhead is as follows: The Office of the Prime Minister, Marks Building, Parliament Street, Cape Town, and the letter is dated May, 1969. On the front, in the handwriting of the hon. the Prime Minister, the following appears: &#x201C;as agreed with Minister P. W. Botha&#x201D;, and it is signed by the Prime Minister. I do not wish to read any further, because the document runs into eight pages, but the document is signed by the Prime Minister of South Africa. I want to say at once that this photostatic copy of the document was sent to me through the post, without any identification. I invite any hon. member in this House to come and see whether this document is genuine, but I myself have no reason whatsoever to doubt the genuineness of it. However, the hon. the Prime Minister is sitting over there, and he can tell us whether the document is not genuine. What does monitoring mean?</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister will tell us. The hon. the Minister of Defence has just said that this is not telephone tapping, but there is a method by which listening in takes place. We are interested not so much in that method now, but in whom is being listened to in this way. I personally have been told from this cryptically mentioned intelligence community that my telephone and other telephones are in fact being tapped.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister will tell us if this is how he wants to govern this country and who are being listened to in this way. [Interjections.] <i>Die Beeld</i> told certain hon. members some time back to &#x201C;shut up&#x201D;, and now they think that they must give full vent to themselves here. The Prime Minister will tell us if this is how he wants to govern the country. I want to tell him that the Afrikaner people is not prepared to put up with such methods and such abuse of the power of the State. We will not be intimidated by this sort of political bullying, nor by all the untruths and misrepresentations which are sent into the world from the Government side and the use of these methods.</p>

<p>I want to return to the hon. the Minister of Transport, who came forward here last Tuesday with a string of untruths which testify to nothing but his complete political impotence. I do not wish to be as personal as he was. I just want to tell him that his colleague the hon. the Minister of Defence told him on occasion&#x2014;and he will remember it well&#x2014;that he is a cynical old man. [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Transport tried the other day to attack the political integrity and the personal integrity and morality of the hon. member for Ermelo and of Dr. Willie Lubbe. Let me just tell him at once that those men have more integrity and morality in their little fingers than he has in his whole body. He proclaimed a series of untruths here. For example, he denied that Adv. Strydom had asked Dr. Hertzog to stand for election in the Ermelo constituency. Does he now expect me to accept his word before that of Mr. Wennie du Plessis? Before he gives me a reply to this, I want to tell him straight away that I shall not do it, because I trust Mr. Wennie du Plessis much more than I would trust him. The hon. the Minister of Transport spoke here of a salary of R15,000 for Dr. Willie Lubbe, a figure which he obtained from <i>Dagbreek,</i> the newspaper of which he is the chairman. I now declare here that that report which appeared in <i>Dagbreek,</i> is a naked lie. As far as the conditions of service too are concerned, I say the same.</p>

<p>That sworn statement to which the hon. the Minister of Transport referred and which states that I gave a list of questions to a certain Mr. Wheeler, is a naked untruth. Such a list does not exist&#x2014;nothing like that ever happened. He also said that Mr. Willie Marais and I had given him the assurance that we endorsed the entire policy of the Government. I say that this is an untruth. He also alleged that I had never objected to any of these matters. He knows that I objected to them in the caucus, at chief executive meetings, at a conference and at a congress. If he does not know this, then I do not know how impenetrable his mind is.</p>

<p>I should like to give the hon. the Minister of Transport an opportunity to show the world how much value he attaches to his own information. Will he support a motion of mine that a select committee be appointed to investigate the truth of his assertions? They were key statements, on the grounds of which he made deductions and the grossest insults and accusations against various people. The assertions to which I have referred are naked untruths. Now I challenge him to say whether he would support me if I moved that a select committee be appointed to investigate the truth of his assertions. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>This hon. Minister talks about political morality. He was a member of Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s Cabinet. Here is a statement which was issued by ex-Minister Ian de Klerk on 8th September, 1965. He issued the statement on behalf of the Cabinet as the Minister responsible for sport matters. In this he says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As on an earlier occasion the Cabinet has decided unanimously &#x2026;</block>

<p>and he underlines the word &#x201C;unanimously&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; against the reception of mixed teams &#x2026; Moreover, I recently spoke frankly to Dr. Craven and others about this problem again, and unequivocally informed him that Maoris would not be acceptable as members of a touring team &#x2026;</block>

<p>To-day that hon. Minister is adopting precisely the opposite standpoint. And now he does not have the courage to say that he turned his back on Dr. Verwoerd. Now he says that he is following Dr. Verwoerd. He is a political deserter. He has accepted the policy of the United Party. What difference is there between the <span class="col_303-304" refersTo="page_0164"/>policy of the United Party and the policy which he is advocating in regard to this matter to-day? At the congress of the National Party the question was put to him bluntly: If five full-blooded Maoris were selected, would they be allowed here? The Minister evaded that question. He refused to reply to it, but then already the hon. the Minister of Sport said that the official policy was to receive the Maoris. When that Minister was asked that question at the congress of a party of which he is a leader, he ran away from the question. Two weeks later, however, he went on a platform in Johannesburg and according to an article on the front page of <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 26th September, 1969, it was reported (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Schoeman said that Mr. Marais and Dr. Hertzog were now saying that they had heard for the first time that full-blooded Maoris would be allowed in a touring team to South Africa in a speech which Mr. Schoeman had made at Innesdal.</block>

<p>And now, in quotation marks, his own words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say with the greatest emphasis that that is untrue. They already knew two years ago that full-blooded Maoris could come.</block>

<p>Where is that hon. Minister&#x2019;s political courage? When that question was put to him at the congress, he remained as silent as the grave and misled those congress delegates. Two weeks later, however, he got onto the platform and then he was a big boy. Is that political morality? Is that political courage? Is that the kind of man who presumes to attack other people&#x2019;s morality and integrity here under the protection of Parliamentary privilege? On 25th September, 1969, he declared that it had been the policy of the governing party for two years already. What congress took that resolution two years ago?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to refer to the hon. member for Innesdal&#x2019;s disgraceful action, and specifically in respect of the military security of South Africa, with his suspicious attitude in regard to the concept of &#x201C;listening-in&#x201D; <i>(meeluistering).</i> If he would only consult a dictionary or had at least analysed the technical term he would know that &#x201C;meeluistering&#x201D; has nothing on earth to do with a telephone, that it has nothing to do with any citizen in South Africa, that it has to do with the security of the country and that it is a military situation with which he is at the moment playing a dirty game directly into the hands of our enemies and the communists. If he had simply taken the real meaning of the word and not drawn his own conclusion as to the meaning thereof, he would have known that &#x201C;meeluistering&#x201D; has nothing to do with tapping a telephone. That is exactly where the problem lies with the hon. member and his Party. They are so suspicious that they <span class="col_305-306" refersTo="page_0165"/>imagine that we are trying to harm people left, right and centre and are trying to create problems. I want to state this matter frankly by saying that it is one of the most contemptible modes of conduct to expose one&#x2019;s own country in this way and hand it over in this way to the people outside. For that reason the negotiations take place between the hon. the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister and not the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Cannot he deduce this? It has nothing to do with the Post Office. The hon. member must have taken cognizance of this before he stated the case. Then I want to refer to the matter in regard to which the hon. member complained so much and kicked up such a row towards the end of his speech, i.e. the Maoris. I want to refer hon. members to the speech by the hon. the Prime Minister as it appears in Hansard of 11th April, 1967. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">It is true that the 1929 touring team included two Maoris &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not persons of Maori blood, but Maoris &#x2026;</p>

<p>Here in Hansard reference is made to Maoris. I complete the quotation:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Maoris or people of Maori blood.</block>

<p>The people were received here, etc. Let us now speak plainly. When this policy was announced in 1967 the hon. the Prime Minister at that stage already used both terms. It is as clear as daylight, because it stands there in print. When the hon. the Minister of Transport made his statement he suggested that those hon. members had in fact been aware of the fact that Maoris would be included in 1967. The statement by the hon. the Minister of Transport is based on this statement of the hon. the Prime Minister which was subscribed to by that hon. member. Now surely that hon. member cannot come and argue about the matter. Let us now return to the hon. member. I still have quite a lot of material (<i>stof</i>) here which I have to deal with.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the first instance I want to put it that in every organization, undertaking, people or political philosophy there are two forces at work. These two forces are impelling or driving forces, and restrictive forces. It is a good thing that there are both, because the relationship between the two determines the success or failure of the undertaking as a whole. If the impelling forces in any organization are too strong then they charge precipitately into new undertakings and things, which can eventually lead to ruin. If the restrictive forces are too powerful there is immobility and stagnation and retrogression, and eventually death. For that reason file ideal situation is that there should be restrictive forces as well as impelling forces, but the impelling forces should always be a little stronger than the restraining forces so that planning can be undertaken, and peaceful and responsible progress can be made, and so that there is no immobility and retrogression. In politics we have precisely the same position. This is the first leg of my argument to which I shall return in a moment.</p>

<p>The second leg of my argument is that no leader is bound, or can be permanently bound, to the statements and the standpoints of a predecessor, for the simple reason that circumstances change from time to time. I want to furnish an example. If we had adopted the attitude that one leader could not amend the standpoints of a previous leader then we would in fact not have had a Republic now, because there were leaders of the National Party who were not Republicans and who did not want a Republic, and there were leaders of the National Party who said that there should be a two-thirds majority for that. But Dr. Verwoerd was able to amend that standpoint of his predecessor and say that a majority of one was sufficient, and with that we got a Republic. Do you want to tell me now that a leader may never depart from the attitudes himself from his predecessor? I want to mention another example. If a leader was unable to change a predecessor&#x2019;s policy, or amend his standpoint, then we would have had the Coloured representatives sitting here permanently, for Dr. Verwoerd stated that he was not going to abolish them, and the present Prime Minister said that he was going to abolish them. In other words, the fact that a leader has the right to change his predecessor&#x2019;s standpoint results in continual progress being made as circumstances change. With that premise, in spite of that argument&#x2014;and I am raising this argument deliberately for this was the case in our history&#x2014;I nevertheless want to follow this argument. The leader of the H.N.P. insisted very emphatically that Dr. Verwoerd had a specific plan and system and that he had planted certain beacons along a course the party could follow without danger. I am in complete agreement with him that this is the standpoint and the policy, and in the rest of my speech I am going to indicate these beacons planted by Dr. Verwoerd, and I shall also indicate who is following that path and who is not following that path. I just want to add that it is strange to find, sitting in the hon. member for Ermelo&#x2019;s party at the moment, completely swallowed up, the Van der Merwe group of the 1966 election. The leader has gone, but there are at least three or four candidates for his party who in 1966 were candidates of the Van der Merwe group. Now the hon. member for Ermelo is adhering staunchly to Dr. Verwoerd, but as allies in his bosom he has people who in 1966 stood against the National Party and Dr. Verwoerd. Now they are his allies. The leader of that little group <span class="col_307-308" refersTo="page_0166"/>states that the National Party is rejecting the policy of Dr. Verwoerd, and the same thing is stated in their motion, and the hon. member for Innesdal says the same thing. They find themselves in company in which they feel quite at home, I want to quote something here, and I shall then indicate by whom this was said. I am quoting from the publication, <i>New Nation</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is happening in and with the National Party to-day can be spelt out in one sentence&#x2014;the rejection of the policies of Dr. Verwoerd, and the Party is only at the beginning of the process.</block>

<p>Who said this? The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, Mr. Japie Basson, in this article. [Interjections.] Now I want to take the first point, the Afrikaans-English relations and the question of bilingualism in South Africa. The policy of the United Party is stated here in a booklet. They stand for a bilingual nation. It is stated thus in the latest of their publications. They stand for a bilingual nation, from which one can deduce that it is still precisely the same as the policy of Mr. Wolfie Swart, namely that his children must be brought up in such a way that they are neither Afrikaans-speaking nor English-speaking, a hybrid kind of something so that nobody can know what they are. I leave it at that. The Hertzog group adheres to the standpoint that it stands for Afrikaans as the official language. Now I first of all want to quote from an interview the <i>New Nation</i> conducted with Mr. Jaap Marais, the hon. member for Innesdal in regard to this entire matter. In the interview, states the <i>New Nation,</i> Mr. Marais was asked: &#x201C;People say your party wishes to degrade the English-speaker to the status of a second-class citizen. His language is, for example, no longer to be given official status.&#x201D; Then Mr. Marais said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a young nation such as ours one must accept that there is a hard core and around it, as in a chemical solution, there is much that is still in a state of solution, a state of suspension.</block>

<p>Then <i>New Nation</i> goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Do you then regard the English-speaker as still in suspension? Do you wish to say that he is in his deepest nature already an Afrikaner and that it remains for him to realize what is already latently there?</block>

<p>To this Mr. Marais replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He is an Afrikaner in the making.</block>

<p>Mr. Douglas Mitchell of South Coast is an Afrikaner &#x201C;in the making&#x201D;; Mr. Hourquebie of Natal is an Afrikaner &#x201C;in the making&#x201D;. But then he goes further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But we don&#x2019;t want to force him artificially to break his ties and join the Afrikaner. I think it can be taken ill by English-speakers that we now want Afrikaans as the only official language.</block>

<p>But then the interviewer drives him into a corner and asks him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You said the English-speaker is an &#x201C;Afrikaner in the making&#x201D;. But if an Afrikaner is not only someone who is Afrikaans-speaking, but also a Christian Nationalist, does that mean that an English-speaking Catholic is not an Afrikaner in the making and can never become an Afrikaner?</block>

<p>To this the hon. member for Innesdal replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes &#x2026; you know, we apparently already have a few Afrikaners who have become Catholics and nothing can detract from the fact that they the Afrikaners have become Catholic.</block>

<p><i>New Nation:</i> Are they still Afrikaners?</p>

<p><i>Marais:</i> Yes. One must accept that in every nation there is that diversity&#x2014;one would not want to deny it. The crux of the matter is really what is at the centre of that nation.</p>

<p>The matter is very clear. The question is: What is the definition of an Afrikaner? An Afrikaner can only be an Afrikaans-speaking Christian Nationalist, according to that definition. Sir, now I want to go further and mention to you the beacons planted by Dr. Verwoerd in regard to this matter. On 27th April 1962 Dr. Verwoerd made a speech, which is included in &#x201C;Dr. Verwoerd aan die Woord&#x201D;, page 645, and there he states (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have said before and I should like to repeat to-day that the Afrikaner is not only prepared to accept the English language, but he cannot do anything else and would not want to do anything else than to regard the present Republic as the country belonging to all of us and both our languages as the proud and valuable possessions of all of us.</block>

<p>And then he goes further, and on 4th September in his Loskop Dam speech, to which I shall return in a moment in regard to sport, states (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The English-speaking Nationalist has every right to the maintenance of his own language, his own church, his own institutions and his own view of history if it comes to that.</block>

<p>That is the beacon planted by Dr. Verwoerd; that is the course we must follow. I need not quote our present <span class="col_309-310" refersTo="page_0167"/>Prime Minister in this regard. Hon. members know precisely what his standpoint is. I do not want to quote it, but it stands as clearly as daylight in Col. 4504 of Hansard that there should be equal treatment for both languages. He stated this very clearly in that debate on 22nd April 1969, and then the hon. member for Ermelo who was sitting on this side replied and at that stage said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister gave such a clear exposition of the standpoint in regard to the relationship between English-and Afrikaans-speaking people in our party that I do not think a single one of us, nor anybody outside, could ever differ with him on that.</block>

<p>And now? Where does he stand at present on that specific standpoint which he still subscribed to wholeheartedly last year? Who has now departed from Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy. Who has wandered off from the beacon planted by Dr. Verwoerd? I am putting this question very clearly to the people outside, and just before these people further abuse the situation, because that is precisely what they usually do, I also want to quote the standpoint of our present Prime Minister (Senate Hansard (Afrikaans edition), Col. 4622, 1969)-&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I as an Afrikaner can only co-operate with English-speaking South Africa if I can do so as an Afrikaner with the full retention of my identity, my language, my religion, my customs, my traditions and everything which pertains to these things.

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now want to come specifically to the sport situation. Once again I want to deal with the matter in the same manner. The policy of the United Party in regard to sport is as objectionable as the sports policy of those hon. members. The policy of the United Party in regard to sport is that they will exercise no control of any nature whatsoever. The sports administrators can go ahead and do just as they please. It does not matter whether they embarrass their country or not. they can go ahead. That is the policy of the United Party in regard to sport. Everything is left in the hands of the sports administrators. That is their standpoint. That is what they say. It is cut and dried. I shall leave it at that. That other group of people on the opposite side state that they are totally opposed to any form of mixed sport in South Africa. Now I want to say at once that they therefore want to go back further than 1919. They want to adopt an attitude which is more extreme and more opposed to mixed sport than the one which existed in 1919. As long ago as 1919 there were people with Maori blood in South Africa in a rugby team. In 1949 there were All Blacks with Maori blood. In 1960 there were All Blacks with Maori blood. In 1966 the Australian team with Thomas as a member came to South Africa. They wanted to go back further than the policy of Dr. Malan in 1949 and the policy of Dr. Verwoerd in 1960 and 1966. They wanted to go back further than the Papwa Sewgolum case. The hon. member for Ermelo, who was then a member of the Cabinet, allowed Papwa Sewgolum to play. Why did he not then establish a new party? Mr. Speaker. I want to quote the Los-kop Dam speech of the then Prime Minister. I want to quote specifically what he had to say about sport. This part of his speech deals specifically with sport (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not know precisely what their reply is (this is a reference to Dr. Craven and Mr. Louw), but what I do know, is that the Opposition newspapers deduce from this and state openly that we will receive mixed teams here and then they deduce from that that once we have received teams with Maori members here, an additional consequence of that will be that we will also have to include Coloureds in our team. They want to make immediate use of the opportunity, knowing that the Government does not like to discuss this matter, and while our teams are guests there, to create the impression that the Government has consented to forms of mixed sport from which further integration will flow.</block>

<p>Then comes the important sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have not altered our standpoint. As we behave ourselves in other countries, we expect that they will behave themselves here according to our customs, and I want to add to that: &#x201C;And everybody knows what they are.&#x201D;</block>

<p>&#x201C;We have not altered our standpoint&#x201D; he said. In other words, the composition of the 1960 team is still acceptable in South Africa. The composition of the 1949 team is still acceptable in South Africa. That is the clear standpoint of Dr. Verwoerd in this entire regard. Now I want to add to that that the present Prime Minister has stated his standpoint very clearly in his sport statement. He subscribes to the standpoint of Dr. Verwoerd. We have not changed our standpoint. Never before, from the beginning up to the present, has there been any interference in the choice of teams.</p>

<p>The present policy is very clear. It furnishes all the critics who maintain that I have contradicted my Prime Minister with a reply. It also furnishes a reply to the false story by Stanley Uys, in regard to this whole matter, which was spread some time ago. The standpoint of this party is: We will not play the role of selectors committee for any overseas team. They can choose whom they wish. This is also very clearly the policy of the Prime Minister. We do not play the role of a selectors committee. However, we impose three conditions on every team coming to South Africa. It makes no difference whether it is the M.C.C. or the All Blacks or anybody else for that matter. These three conditions are applicable to all. The conditions are [Hansard, Vol. 20, Col. 3994) &#x201C;that politicians must not intervene in the matter to impair relations between countries; that sport must not be dragged into politics in order to achieve some purpose or other; and that it must not create difficulties for me at home&#x201D;. Surely that policy is as clear as daylight. There is no doubt about it. That policy stands as plain as a pikestaff, precisely as it is. It is unshakable. The people select whom they wish to, and these criteria are applied. If one of these criteria are contravened the team is not allowed in. That is clear. That is our sport policy. Now I say this: When one hears this policy stated so clearly as it was stated by the Prime Minister here and if you have faith in your leader you do not append question marks to it. You accept it. The problem with those four members is that they have no faith. That is why they are coming forward with all kinds of strange things. This shows a lack of faith. That is the whole crux of the matter.

<p>That is precisely what I am saying here. Mr. Speaker, I come now to the next question, i.e. the links with African states, the beacons planted by Dr. Verwoerd in this connection and what we must do in that connection. The hon. member for Ermelo says that we must follow Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s beacons. I do so gladly. The standpoint of the United Party in this connection is that they want friendship and political relations, unlimited. with African states. It makes no difference where when or with whom this is done. They want to enter unrestrictedly into political relations. That is what is stated in their latest booklet. The Hertzog group states the case in regard to this specific matter in their &#x201C;call to congress&#x201D; thus:</p>

<block name="quote">At the same time we state that we are opposed to any policy which tries to gain the favour of neighbouring states by trying to persuade them with gifts of money and cheap loans to enter into relations which have to serve principally commercial interests. We are convinced that such a policy must inevitably lead to a sacrifice of principles. and already appears to be the case with the present outgoing policy of the Government. We do not believe that we can win over the affection of other nations, but we can gain their respect even if we do not have any formal ties with them.</block>

<p>That is the standpoint of that party. What is the beacon planted by Dr. Verwoerd in this connection? This is what he said (Hansard, Vol. 10, Col. 4900):</p>

<block name="quote">In dealing with this matter on previous occasions I went on to add what I had reinterated in interviews with various persons from time to time when they asked me whether this meant that we would be willing to have diplomatic relations with African states if they stopped uttering threats against us, if they stop expressing hostile sentiments, if they stopped their boycott movements, in other words, with countries which desired to have friendly relations with South Africa. My reply was &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That was the beacon planted by Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd in this connection. There is another beacon which was planted by a previous leader, Adv. Strydom. (Hansard, Vol. 94, Col. 5220):</p>

<block name="quote">It will have to come about that between us and particularly countries south of the <span class="col_313-314" refersTo="page_0169"/>Sahara &#x2026; with a view to economic and other matters, and even with a view to danger arising for Africa, there will have to be contact between us as Government, and that in the course of time there will have to be ordinary relations and even diplomatic relations.</block>

<p>That is what Hans Strydom said on 2nd May, 1957. Those are the beacons which had been planted by the National Party leaders.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hertzog">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HERTZOG</person>:</from>

<p>A diplomat and diplomatic relations are two different things. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Adv. Strydom knew his people. He knew that there were people such as those two members sitting there in the front benches. That is why even at that early stage, he warned them. (Hansard, Vol. 94, Col. 5220):</p>

<block name="quote">But having said that, I want to issue a word of warning that in this case we should not act over hastily either. We should bear in mind the fact that his is a new development and that we will have to act carefully. Our own white population in South Africa will have to learn to realize this, and that is not something which one can just do overnight. But eventually there will be no other course open.</block>

<p>Those hon. members have been learning to realize this for I do not know how long. They cannot learn to realize it. [Interjections.] Sir, this is the standpoint of Dr. Verwoerd. Now we have this story of gifts which will allegedly be given. This Government, under the present Prime Minister, has not yet given any Africa State any gift. The only gift which, as far as I am aware, had been given to an African State is the 100,000 bags of wheat which Dr. Verwoerd gave to Lesotho. This has been the only gift, and then that hon. member was a member of the Cabinet. Even to-day I still say that it was the correct thing and a good thing that this was done. It had a great deal to do with the attitude of that country to us. I am not condemning it but those hon. members must not bandy about Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s name and then eliminate everything for which he stood in this way. I want to go further. Were his discussions with Chief Jonathan four days prior to his death not a direct liaison with Africa States and the beginning of the course we are adopting? Of course it was, but those hon. members do not want any formal ties with them. In this regard I just want to make one further quotation. I want to quote again from the speech made by Dr. Verwoerd at Loskop Dam. It deals with the liaison with leaders on a high level. Dr. Verwoerd did not only discuss sport in his Loskop Dam speech. This section of his speech reads as follows (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">In this great world of many states these states should and must get along in economic as well as other spheres, and under these circumstances it is therefore also necessary for us to be able to negotiate with the leaders of these other states. Since they in their own sphere in their state&#x2014;this does not apply only to political leaders, it applies to economic and other leaders as well&#x2014;have as much right to prestige and recognition as we do, it means that in this process of meeting and negotiating together, one does so on an equal footing.</block>

<p>That is the beacon that was planted.</p>

<p>The leaders of Pakistan, the leaders of Ghana if it comes to that, the leaders of Red China and of Nationalist China, are all leaders of their countries. When it becomes necessary we will associate with them on an equal footing and that fact, whether it happens within our country or in other countries, may not bring people into confusion and may not cause them to think that in our country we can give way in the social sphere and think that everyone must now associate on an equal footing with the other groups in our own country.</p>

<p>Dr. Verwoerd foresaw the standpoint which that hon. member is now adopting. He foresaw that negotiations will be held on that level in our country or in other countries with leaders of Black States. This does not only apply to political leaders, but also to economic and other leaders. The proof is very clear. He himself invited people from Katanga to South Africa and in his time these two Ministers were entertained in South Africa. The hon. member for Ermelo was a member of the Cabinet at the time and he had no objection to that. [Interjections.] The hon. member is so twisted that he cannot even see when we are walking a straight course. I am sorry to say so, but that is his difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately my time is almost up. I still have before me an entire argument in regard to immigration and I undertake to deal with it fully during the Small Budget. I have an entire argument in regard to that matter, but I will not touch upon it now, because my time is almost up.</p>

<p>In the few minutes I have left to me I want to return to the little newspaper of those hon. members which had just been established. I think it is necessary for me to say a few words about that. The grin on the face of the hon. member for Innesdal indicates to me precisely how much he is enjoying himself and why he is enjoying himself. I want to begin by saying that it contains a story in connection with an aircraft factory in which I allegedly had an interest. I want to state categorically in the House to-day that every word in regard to that matter is a blatant lie. In my capacity as Member of Parliament for Randfontein I had one discussion, at the request of my city council with the entrepreneurs responsible for that factory in order to determine what possibility existed of having the factory established <span class="col_315-316" refersTo="page_0170"/>in my town. Apart from that I had nothing further to do with the entire matter. The unsavoury insinuations by that side wish to imply that the position was different. This was a report in a newspaper which is founded on the principles of truth and Calvinism. I think it is a disgrace. [Interjections.] I do not care what was contained in the photostatic copy, because I am furnishing the facts, and I do not know by whom it was made.</p>

<p>I come now to my second point in regard to that newspaper, they must completely underestimate the intelligence of our public. With great acclaim they published a little report under the title: &#x201C;Who is right: Dr. Mulder or Dr. De Wet?&#x201D; published in regard to a social welfare matter. Dr. De Wet said by way of a reply to a question at a meeting that in some cases under some circumstances a man could receive an additional pension of R10. This happened in some cases. A letter was then addressed to me in this connection and the person concerned received a letter from my Department in which it was stated that this was not applicable in his case. Now it is being asked with great acclaim who is correct: I or Dr. De Wet. The fact of the matter is that we are both correct, because this man does not comply with the requirements. He can only receive the additional R10 two years after he has reached the prescribed age and if he is sick and ailing and in need of care. Therefore we are both right, but they underestimate the intelligence of our people. The difference is that we thought that this newspaper would be a newspaper which could achieve something, but now it is simply an enlarged edition of <i>Veg,</i> and just as unsavoury. They all repudiated <i>Veg</i> and therefore they now repudiate their own little newspaper as well.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to ask the hon. member for Innesdal a question. If he was as faithful to the party as he said he was when he was kicked out 6th October, where did he get the 5,000 addresses with which he boasted when they invited people to their congress? One does not accumulate 5,000 addresses in ten days. I am asking him where he got them. Secondly, I want to ask him why he keeps the shorthand notes of a caucus meeting to boast with in public if one is a loyal member of the party. I am asking that in all earnest.</p>

<p>I now return to the standpoint with which I began. I said that in every party there must be restrictive forces and driving forces. I want to state that these hon. members are making a farce of conservatism and are turning it into something ridiculous. This party is conservative and will always be.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the House something. We have changed parties, but the difference between them and me is that it can never be proved that I have ever changed principles. This is not like the hon. the Prime Minister who rejected democracy and then accepted it again. On so many occasions I have challenged members on that side of the House by saying that if they could prove to me where I had abandoned one fundamental principle in politics in all the years I have been in politics, I would withdraw my candidature and they could have my seat. The difference between us is that I choose my party in accordance with my principles and those members allow their principles to be determined for them by the party to which they belong. This is the difference between us. This year we have the spectacle of two National Parties in this Parliament. Over there we have a small group calling themselves the Herstigte Party and here we have the people who have been offended <i>(ontstig</i>) by what has happened to them. At the moment we may call them the &#x201C;Offended Party&#x201D;. A game has now developed between the offended Party and the Herstigte Party. The game is that each of them want to couple the other to the United Party. However, what is the truth of the matter? The fact of the matter is that the Herstigte National Party is nothing but a child and a product of the party opposite. The Herstigte Party, as it is sitting over there, is a mirror-image of the politics of the National Party since 1948. Its accent on the Afrikaans sentiment and religion, its aggressiveness to people with a different colour of skin and the way in which it applies the label of liberalism to everybody who disagrees with it, bears testimony to this fact. Anybody who has been engaged in politics for the past 25 years, will concede that in that corner we are dealing with nothing but the living symbolization of the destructive and negative political attitudes which the National Party has cultivated over the past 25 years. It goes without saying that we on this side do not want to see any progress being made by the H.N.P., but in so far as it is a manifestation of what the governing party was and of what it still is to a large extent, it does have its value, i.e. that the Government has to face, even if it is only for a short while, the irresponsible products of its own politics. One can only hope <span class="col_317-318" refersTo="page_0171"/>that this will encourage the governing party to turn over a new leaf for good. But I want to add that this business of reproaches being flung to and fro between the two, is really a case of the pot calling the kettle black. The fact of the matter is that over the past few years the governing party has in fact moved closer to the political view of the United Party in quite a number of significant fields. There is no doubt about it whatsoever that in future this will be the position to an increasing extent. But in a certain sense the Herstigte Party is in the same boat. For many years the U.P. has been making a stand against legislation such as that in respect of B.O.S.S., against the curtailment of fundamental freedom, against the elimination of the right a citizen ought to have to appeal to a court, against political tapping of telephones and the use of the secret police for illicit party-political purposes. We have been fighting that battle for years. What do we find now? Now that section of the National Party comes along, i.e. the H.N.P., led by an ex-Minister, a person who has sat in the inner circles of the governing party for years, and on this point at least they endorse the whole gist of the criticism the United Party has expressed for years.</p>

<p>I am not interested in that in the least. Is the hon. the Minister prepared for us to have in South Africa a voting system whereby every voter&#x2019;s vote will have the same value, yes or no? [Interjections.] Oh, they are not in favour of that. But I want to tell him that I am in favour of it. The U.P. should have had at the last elections double the number of members it has now; and the only reason why that party can still throw out its chest and say that it will come into power, is that it can do so because of the distribution of seats. But it knows that if we were to have in South Africa a fair voting system whereby every man&#x2019;s vote had the same value, it would have had little hope of still being in Office after 22nd April.</p>

<p>All of us who have been in this Parliament for longer than 12 years, will on 22nd April experience the fourth general election in 12 years&#x2019; time. From the 1958 elections up to now, 1970, this will be our fourth general election. In other words, we no longer have a general election every five years. This so-called strong Government, so sure of itself, so stable, finds it necessary to call an election every three years. Since 1958 there has been, on an average, a general election every three years.</p>

<p>That is not the point, the point is, is this a sign of stability? Is this a sign of self-confidence in their policy. No! The <i>Vaderland</i> furnished the correct answer when it defended the fact that this election had to take place now. The reason it furnished was that the moment there was the slightest sign &#x201C;of a lack of confidence in itself&#x201D;, it was the duty of a government to call a general election. I think this was indeed the right reason.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite will agree with me that the three most important problems we have to contend with in South Africa, are the question of human relationships, the question of our relations with the people in the outside world, or, where we stand in the world, and the welfare of the population of our country. One cannot deal with all of these, but I want to refer briefly to the first two, and test the Government against the success it has had. Let us, in the first place, take the relationship between the Whites and the Bantu in South Africa. Six years ago the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs solemnly announced at U.N.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that our objective is the attainment of a commonwealth of South African states, politically independent and economically interdependent.</block>

<p>For 22 years they have been engaged in pursuing this objective and trying to carry it into effect. I am asking members opposite: Where is the commonwealth they want to establish? Where do we find as much as the framework, the outlines, of this commonwealth? Where does one ever hear anybody referring to the commonwealth? No, there is not even a reference to it in their speeches, this promise which was solemnly made to the world, this objective. Year after year we hear, and to-day we heard it once again, about the terrible &#x201C;sacrifices&#x201D; we shall have to make. They have already been in power for 22 years; 15, 16 years after the Tomlinson Report. What sacrifices have been made over these years? Perhaps a small measure of inconvenience here and there, but can they tell us what sacrifices we are to make? We hear about these sacrifices. Would the speakers on Bantu matters, who have not spoken as yet, rise and tell us what the sacrifices are which we are to make? When must we start making these sacrifices? What are they? These are all <span class="col_319-320" refersTo="page_0172"/>words hanging in mid air. We hear them time and again.</p>

<p>Look, if one has a policy, one must after all prepare the people by telling them, especially before an election, what is in store for them. The people are waiting, but they are getting nothing but words. I want to predict here to-day that during this Session we shall have nothing drastic from the Government as regards this whole business of grand territorial segregation in South Africa-of grand apartheid. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education said that he would then tell us about something dynamic. Nothing came of it. No drastic steps will be taken by the Government. Up to now it has done nothing drastic whatsoever. So far it has had nothing drastic to submit to us during this Session. In the meantime the position in South Africa is deteriorating day by day as regards the chances of getting anywhere at all.</p>

<p>I do not wish to say that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development is not a busy man. He is a very busy man. But he is also a person who builds a house but begins with the roof, whilst the foundations are lacking. He rushes from pillar to post. They are dishing out flags, anthems, staves of Office, symbols of authority and showy trifles.</p>

<p>These things are dished out on a very grand scale. They are on the roof. There is a very great deal of hammering on the roof, because the people must be fooled into thinking that something is happening. But all of this is a little pathetic, for if one looks down below one finds that beneath all these showy trifles the foundation is lacking, the foundation for making a success of their own policy. The cardinal requirement which is absent, is the economic development of the Bantu areas inside those areas themselves. Until such time as economic and industrial development on a large and dynamic scale takes place in those Bantu areas&#x2014;not the way it is being done at present, i.e. where we are in fact hampering it through the policy of border industries&#x2014;nothing will come of this policy. I want to tell the Government that its whole policy of territorial segregation is like a brimless hat of which the crown is missing. Last week-end the hon. member for Middelland said a sensible thing, and let me congratulate him on it.</p>

<block name="quote">It is obvious that political stability in Africa cannot be achieved without economic stability. In future we shall have to concentrate on rendering aid to the black states so that economic stability may be brought about in those countries. Only then can political stability be achieved.</block>

<p>For a change that hon. member said something sensible there. This is the crux of the whole trouble. With those words the hon. member criticized the policy of his own party. The excuse we hear is that the human element renders it impossible to develop the Bantu areas rapidly enough in all spheres, including the political sphere. But Britain already emancipated her three Bantu territories years ago.</p>

However, the Government is not getting anywhere. The Opposition is therefore entitled to saying that nothing is being done. The point is that Britain has emancipated her territories. Does the hon. the Minister want to tell me that the Xhosas, for instance, are weaker than the Swazis, the Malawis or the people of Madagascar? No, Sir, one merely has to drive through Swaziland to see the gaping differences between a territory such as Swaziland and our Bantu areas. The Government&#x2019;s approach is hopelessly wrong.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, unfortunately I do not have the time. Until such time as the Government adopts the policy of the Tomlinson Report, i.e. that large-scale dynamic development in the Bantu areas should take place through free capital, but with the protection of the land rights of the Bantu, as is the case in Lesotho and Swaziland, nothing will come of this policy of the Government. My point is that when one looks at the Bantu policy of the Government, one has to do with, as I have said, a brimless hat of which the crown is missing.</p>

<p>Let us now look at our relations with the Coloureds. I have just dealt with the Bantu, and I shall deal briefly with each population group.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Because the one territory is beyond the control of South Africa and because the Transkei finds itself in an entirely different historical position. However, I am now dealing with the policy of that side of the House. What progress has the Government made in regard to the relations between Whites and Coloureds? For generations the Coloureds had representation in this House. The form of that representation was not perfect, and new adaptations were necessary. However, the principle was there and was important. That principle was undone and in the place of it the Government gave the Coloureds a council which, as a whole, they could not elect themselves. Recently there was an election for part of that council. After the election the Government pulled a &#x201C;Jonathan&#x201D; on the Coloureds. The losers then became the winners, and the winners were declared to be the losers. And now we have to hear all of a sudden that all the losers had jointly obtained the majority. Since when is that principle being accepted in our politics? I want to ask hon. members opposite whether they are prepared to accept the same principle in respect of this Parliament, i.e. that the party obtaining the majority of the votes, should govern. I am prepared to accept it. It is a new principle. The Government has become converted. The basis of our parliamentary system is that the party obtaining the majority, forms the Government. However, a new principle is now being introduced. I sincerely hope that the Government will not profess a double standard, but that they will reach the stage where that new principle which they have now introduced into our politics will also be applicable to this Parliament.</p>

<p>I should now like to touch upon another matter. It is continually being said in this House that the Coloureds support the policy of the Government. On the other hand, I want to state that there is not a single Coloured party in South Africa which supports the policy of the Government in principle, nor is there a single Coloured leader who supports the policy of the Government in principle. The Federal Party of Mr. Tom Swartz has repeatedly emphasized that it is its inexorable policy that, except in the Coloured Council, the Coloureds should be represented by their own people here in this House. I want to ask the Minister whether this is supposed to be parallel development. And then the Government still says that the Coloureds support them. The hon. the Minister is deceiving himself when he says that there is an appreciable number of Coloureds supporting the policy of that side in principle. Basically the only thing the Federal Party is saying, is that a specific government is in power; they cannot change it, and as long as that Government is in power with the policy it has, that party will work within that framework in order to derive the maximum benefits from it for themselves. Eventually it will be possible for them to overthrow that policy in favour of full citizenship for the Coloureds. That is why I am also saying that as far as that matter is concerned, the Government cannot say that it has the support of the Coloured community. On the contrary, after 22 years we have to hear that the Coloureds &#x201C;have been placed on a road&#x201D;, but not one single speaker on that side of the House can tell us where that road leads to. I am glad the hon. member for Windhoek spoke to-day in the vein he did. What does one do with a party which claims that it has the answers, but which, when one asks it for those answers, cannot give them? The Prime Minister said, and we have also heard it in this House time and again, that it is the children lying in their shawls who will have to decide what is to be done with the Coloureds. In respect of the relationship with the Bantu and the Coloured there is, on the part of the Government, a <span class="col_323-324" refersTo="page_0174"/>lack of policy, an attitude of &#x201C;I do not know&#x201D;, confusion and uncertainty such as this country has never had from any Government before. As far as the Indians are concerned, the position is even more confusing, because as regards that matter the Government has no idea whatsoever as to what it wants to do with that section of the population.</p>

<p>Furthermore, let us consider our relations with the outside world which are just as important as our domestic relations between our people. Roughly four years ago we started hearing of the so-called outward policy of the Government, of the Prime Minister. The Press reacted enthusiastically. The impression was created that something great was going to happen. What has become of the outward policy after all these years? Where is this outward policy? During the past year we even had the strange case of the hon. the Leader of the House saying that the Prime Minister had in fact never used the word &#x201C;outward&#x201D;. <i>Die Burger</i> subsequently reminded him that the Prime Minister had in fact used the word. The Prime Minister then intimated that actually it was merely by chance that he had referred to an outward policy. There is another strange aspect to the matter. Have hon. members ever heard the hon. the Prime Minister speaking on his outward policy? In four years&#x2019; time I have never heard the Prime Minister refer to his great outward policy. No, year after year we have to hear from the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs that we are making a breakthrough to the outside world. Things will be better for us to-morrow, if not sooner. This reminds me so much of the Stock Exchange. For months we have been hearing of a breakthrough which is in the offing. However, all we hear is the dull thud of tumbling share prices. What has been achieved through this &#x201C;outward policy&#x201D; for South Africa over the past four years, particularly in respect of our relations with Africa? After four years we have one junior black diplomat in Pretoria. It was not so much as a result of the Government&#x2019;s outward policy that he came here; he came here as a result of the adroit outward policy of President Banda of Malawi. A Government member praised President Banda as the &#x201C;King Solomon of Africa&#x201D;. He is undoubtedly one of the most capable men amongst the leaders of Africa. He has become the forerunner of a new strategy in respect of South Africa, i.e. the strategy of association with us rather than isolation. This is a strategy which has been described by an observer as &#x201C;killing apartheid with kindness&#x201D;. It cannot be argued away that this man has indeed accomplished more than all the other African leaders have done with their aggressiveness. With his one junior black diplomat he has created in the governing party the greatest revolution we have experienced in the past 22 years. Perhaps I should add to that the possibility of one Maori. If one junior black diplomat and the possibility of one Maori can bring about such a revolution in the governing party, one asks oneself what is going to happen once the other African states take the policy of the Government seriously, once they begin to follow the strategy of Banda and send people to pursue the policy of association with South Africa rather than a policy of isolation? To me this simply proves very clearly how hopelessly inadequate the Government&#x2019;s policy is for the times in which we are living. We cannot even accommodate one black diplomat in South Africa without having such a crisis in the governing party that the Prime Minister has to hold an election. That is why I say that this policy cannot imply success for the future. The Government cannot be on normal friendly terms with non-White nations without there being internal crises such as we are experiencing now. I repeat that this proves the unsuitability of the policy the Government is pursuing. This is also the reason why they have never proceeded to extending official representation to our three immediate neighbouring states. These three neighbouring states know the true reason. What is the result? Lesotho is experiencing a serious crisis at present. And at the time of this serious crisis not a single South African representative was present in the capital. Numerous South Africans are working there and sent there by the Government. But when the moment of crisis arrived, they had to cross the border and take refuge in hotels. There is no South African representative in Lesotho. The representatives of all the other countries are staying there in order to advise the people. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke very generally. I am of the opinion that the hon. member has on numerous occasions been furnished with a full reply in this House by the various Ministers. The hon. member must consequently forgive me for not replying immediately to his speech and returning to the debate which was being conducted a moment ago in regard to the Herstigte National Party. [Interjections.] Yes, I expected a groan to go up for after all the United Party has to a certain extent now lost its position as principle Opposition; they are now a little jealous. But jealousy will get them nowhere. They will simply have to be satisfied with the fact that there is another party in the House and that it is essential for the National Party to try to discover what this little party wants to do and where it wants to go.</p>

<p>I should like to refer back very briefly to the sports policy which was raised by the hon. member for Innesdal. We have been hearing so much about Maoris in an All Black team. However, the hon. member for Innesdal must be fully aware of the fact that during the past three or four months, over the Christmas season, a famous Maori singer appeared in the Civic Centre in Johannesburg in the musical comedy &#x201C;South Pacific&#x201D;. No objection has ever been raised, not at any single meeting I know of, against that person who appeared <span class="col_325-326" refersTo="page_0175"/>every evening there. We heard no objection whatsoever from any member of the Herstigte National Party at any meeting. The question is, why was no objection raised in this case, but when it comes to sport vehement objections are raised? I want to suggest that the one and only purpose of this entire sports policy story of the Herstigte National Party is to try to catch a few votes. There is not a single principle involved. It is quite simply politicking of the first water. I want to tell hon. members why I think so. Let us now be very honest. I do not want to cast back to all the discussions on Maoris and the sport policy. I want to refer back to what the hon. member for Innesdal said in his speech. I do not want to cast back to all the discussions on Maoris and sport policy. I do not want to do what the other hon. members of the H.N.P. did by saying who said this, and when that and the other was said. I do not want to argue about who said what first, whether it was said in Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s time or whether it was said in Adv. Strydom&#x2019;s time, whether it was said here in caucus or whether it was said at a meeting, or whether an assurance was given here or whether an assurance was given there. I want to refer to the Transvaal congress where the Transvaal Leader rose and informed everyone that they would be afforded an opportunity of discussing the problems which worried them. Four points were presented for discussion. One of them was the sports policy. Do hon. members know what happened at that congress? It became necessary for the Transvaal Leader to rise and ask whether there was not going to be any discussion. He had to ask why the delegates were not speaking their minds while they were being afforded an opportunity of doing so. He then stated that we could not dispose of the matter without discussing it and said that the people should air their objections. Then the discussion began. Now I have to hear for the first time in this House this afternoon that the Leader of the Transvaal spoke about Maoris in an All Black team only at a subsequent meeting. It is being said that in that discussion there nothing was said about Maoris. I have the minutes of that meeting here. I should just like to read out from the minutes what took place there, when Mr. Schoeman spoke. Mr. Schoeman replied and <i>inter alia</i> said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And while Dr. Verwoerd was Prime Minister in 1966 a non-White cricket player came out here as a member of a team. Nobody said a word about that. Now I just want to say this and I said the same thing the other evening at another meeting: Do you think my friend, that if there is one Maori in a New Zealand team it is going to mean the end of white civilization in South Africa? It seems to me my people are losing their sense of values. They are losing their perspective. What is the ultimate purpose of our policy? It is to retain at all times the political authority of the Whites in South Africa. That is the essence of our policy. Tell me now that if one or two Maoris or persons with Maori blood come to South Africa in a New Zealand sports team, that this is going to mean the end of white civilization. Have you ever heard such rubbish?</block>

<p>These words were spoken during the debate which took place at that congress. In other words, the hon. members for Innesdal, Wonderboom and Ermelo were at the time aware of precisely what the position was. In fact, arising out of this discussion a certain Mr. Jurgens Smit put questions to the congress as well as to the hon. member for Innesdal. He associated himself with the questions. To me there was something very strange about that congress. One would have thought that now that the entire matter had been thoroughly thrashed out at a congress people would know precisely where they stood and that every person would be able to cast his vote for the opinion he adhered to. But do you know what happened? The hon. member for Wonderboom voted for the sports policy as elucidated by the Prime Minister on 11th April in this House. He voted &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. That was in the congress. After the hon. the Leader of the Transvaal had furnished the explanation, and after the points at issue had been ironed out so that everyone knew what the position was, the hon. member for Wonder-boom voted &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. In other words, he agreed with it.</p>

That was after the Leader of the Transvaal had elucidated the entire position for us there. The question was subsequently put to him as to why he abstained from voting. That was at a meeting. His reply at that meeting was: I restrained from voting because I relied on the assurance the Prime Minister had given me! During that congress it was stated very clearly there that those who were attending the congress should speak up so that we could have clarity in the party. It was said that we could not go on like this. The hon. member for Innesdal did not say a single word. He heard what the hon. the Leader of Transvaal had said. He accepted it and he knew what the position was. He turned round, sat on the fence 7-<b>A.H.</b></p>

<p><span class="col_327-328" refersTo="page_0176"/>and abstained from voting. If he had relied on the assurance of the Prime Minister I would have expected him to have voted &#x201C;yes&#x201D;.</p>

<p>As far as the Maori story is concerned there is no principle involved for this party. It is simply a question of catching votes. They made no objection to the Maori who performed in the Johannesburg Civic Centre for the simple reason that Afrikaners did not attend the musical comedy. They want to prey on a number of Afrikaner votes and since they know the Afrikaners are very fond of rugby they would find the biggest audience there. Now they are beginning to make political capital out of it. However, it now appears that they themselves are confused about the question of whether a Maori can be included in the team or not. When the hon. member for Wonderboom was questioned on this matter he stated that a Maori could come provided his colouring was such that he could pass for White. Then he could be included in the New Zealand team.</p>

<p>The hon. member is beginning to make interjections. He can reply to-morrow. He told me he was going to reply to-morrow. Let him therefore reply to-morrow. Now the hon. member for Innesdal is saying: No Maoris in the team. Now I put it to them: What is their policy? Now I want to put to them the essence of this entire question. We must not come forward here with a lot of deceits and mud-slinging and mete out insults to one another. I shall tell you what the facts in regard to the sports policy are. These hon. members must now furnish me with a reply. Are they in favour of our relations with the New Zealand rugby team remaining on the same basis as they have existed for the past 72 years, or do they want to destroy them completely?</p>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the question. Let me inform the hon. member for Innesdal that it was not for nothing that one of the young people in my constituency told me that they are a hypothetical party. As soon as you put a direct question to them they tell you: &#x201C;Yes, but if that happens, what are you going to do then; and if this is the case how should we then act? If I were married to my aunt I would have been my own uncle. However, this will avail them nothing. The actual question which rugby enthusiasts in South Africa are asking is whether they are going to prevent the New Zealand team from coming if they should ever come into power&#x2014;which will never happen&#x2014;or would they allow them to come out on the same basis as they have been doing for the past 72 years? Are they going to maintain the existing relations or are they going to tell them to stay away? They must furnish us with a reply before 22nd April because we have a great many people who are able to vote and who are very fond of rugby. We want to know whether these people are going to allow the New Zealanders to come out here or not.</p>

<p>I now want to say something that they know as well as I know it. We are continually being told that it is a fact that this is a delicate matter. It concerns sports relations, human relations and those between one country and another. Our people must not kick up a fuss about this because we are making it clear to those people that if they mix politics with sport they will not be able to come out to South Africa. Let us be very honest on this point. I want to level an accusation against them today. It is they who split this matter wide open. They abused their discretion. They split this matter wide open and kicked up a fuss about it. They made a platform of it and established a party because of it. And I now say to them that if the New Zealand team does not come to South Africa the people of South Africa will put the blame for it on the Herstigte National Party. The hon. member for Innesdal is laughing. Let him tell me&#x2014;he has never denied or disputed this&#x2014;whether he is in favour of the possibility of non-Whites and Whites going to an Olympaid? Is he in favour or opposed to this? He has always been in favour of it. He has never denied it and he must now tell this terribly conservative party of his whether he is in favour of the possibility of White and non-White South Africans participating in the Olympaid overseas under a South African flag. Let him tell us this. I am aware that both the hon. member for Innesdal and the hon. member for Wonderboom are in favour of this and would be satisfied, if a Davis Cup team were to come to South Africa with a non-White member in the team and the traditional relations we have were maintained, that they should be able to come and play here. We want to know whether this is still the case.</p>

<p>Recently the question was put to me, why is there difficulty among Afrikaans speaking people who have always belonged to one party? Are your differences not of such a nature that they can be eliminated? I want to state categorically to-day that there is a fundamental difference between the National Party and the Herstigte National Party which cannot be eradicated. As one party opposed to <span class="col_329-330" refersTo="page_0177"/>another, these disputes cannot be removed because there is a fundamental difference between the two. I am now going to try to indicate what this is.</p>

<p>Yes, that is fine, they agree with me. The first point of difference is that since the establishment of the National Party in 1912 equal treatment has been one of the cornerstones of the party. That is the only decent policy one can have in regard to English-speaking people. Let us now be very honest, there are many jingoes on the opposite side. I can mention the names of many jingoes to hon. members. There are jingoes among the English-speaking and there are jingoes among the Afrikaans-speaking people.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Worcester is one. I want to say that this mentality was to be found within the National Party, among people who were prepared to go back on their promises, their corner-stone policy that for 30, 40, 50, yes even 60 years, had been that of the National Party. They were prepared to go back on it. That is why there is a fundamental difference between us and them and this difference cannot be bridged before they have undergone a change of heart as far as these matters are concerned. I want to mention another fundamental difference. There is a fundamental difference in the approach in regard to South Africa&#x2019;s problems. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, what the approach of the Herstigte National Party is? It is a party which is afraid. That party is afraid of everything. Not only are they afraid of Maoris, they are afraid of everything. They are afraid of the English-speaking people because our Afrikaans people will allegedly become anglicized. They are afraid of liberalism. They are so afraid that the Afrikaner will become liberalized. That party is afraid of black people. They are terribly afraid that the White nation will intermix with the black races. They are afraid the Afrikaner will lose his identity. This party insults its own members with that approach of theirs. It is an insult for every Afrikaner in that party, because what is being implied is that the Afrikaner is unable to preserve his own identity. This party says the Afrikaner should be afraid, he should weave a cocoon about himself and never emerge. He must isolate himself completely, enclose himself completely in a jar, as it were, so that posterity can see what an H.N.P. member looks like. What is he going to look like? He is going to be a spineless crysallis. Surely we cannot live like that in the seventies? The H.N.P. wants to take us back not 100 years, but 300 and perhaps even further. This mentality is an absolute anachronism in South Africa, that is why young people came and said to me in my Office: &#x201C;Sir, I listened to the Herstigtes at their meetings; one of their members spoke for an hour and a half and we young people listened, but we want to tell you that the H. N.P. has no message for the young people of South Africa.&#x201D; The young people of South Africa find no message in that party because it is a scared party, a party which is too afraid to live. What is the National Party? The National Party has faith. The National Party has faith in itself. The National Party has faith in its members. It has faith in the future of South Africa, it has faith in the Afrikaans people being able to maintain their own identity and the English-speaking people theirs. It has faith in the Afrikaans-speaking people being able to develop their language further, and keep their culture pure and beautiful. It has faith in the English-speaking people in due course becoming so attached to this country that they will, with us, become Africa-orientated in South Africa, and being able to complete our God-given task in South Africa. This calling of ours is to leave the impress of Southern Africa on the whole of Africa so that other people who are less privileged than we can be uplifted towards a Western attitude, or if the hon. member prefers, a Christian National attitude.</p>

I came to this House for this month&#x2019;s sitting, a short little session, in the hope that everyone would avail themselves of the opportunity of informing South Africa what they would do with this country if they should come to power. What have we heard from the H.N.P.? We have been entertained with gossip, a lot of mud-slinging, a squabble, denials and admissions, and things like that. I had hoped that the various parties would come forward and state their policy here. I expected the parties to come forward and tell their voters that they should make their cross for what the party stood for. I waited in vain.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>20 cents. I quote the following from it (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the first time the Afrikaner is now getting a Christian National party.</block>

<p>A great deal has been said about these words in this Chamber, and I think there is still a great deal more that can be said. However, I do not want to drag Calvinism into this now; suffice it to say that I find this one of the most disgraceful statements I have ever seen in black <span class="col_331-332" refersTo="page_0178"/>ink on white paper. I shall tell hon. members why it is one of the most disgraceful statements. It is a direct insult to the late General Hertzog; it is a direct insult to Dr. Malan, to the late Advocate Strydom, to the late Dr. Verwoerd, and it is a direct insult to our present P.M. That is not all, however, for it is a direct insult to every Afrikaner within the H.N.P. Why do I say this? Those same people were formerly National Party members and in their heart of hearts they believed, and still believe, that that party is a Christian National Party. Now the leaders are telling them that this party is the first Christian National party. That is why I am saying it is a disgrace. I now want to come to a serious statement of policy. On page 3 of the policy booklet of the Herstigtes I read the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The parliamentary system enshrined in the Constitution is obsolete, not in accordance with our national character and unsuitable for the efficient administration of South Africa.</block>

<p>If a constitution is obsolete and contrary to one&#x2019;s national character, and in addition is quite unsuitable for efficient administration, it means that there is only one thing that could happen to it, that it be abolished. Now I want to say something to the hon. members in a very serious vein. I went through the war years when there is an upheaval amongst our people. I had believed that the struggle had burnt itself out. We accepted unequivocally that to vote was the democratic right of our people. We accepted it. We settled that matter among ourselves.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>What is your point?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall now make my point, only do not get a fright when I make the point! The point is this, that we decided to have a national debating chamber such as this, in which one elected your representatives according to the democratic right one had; once you have elected them you send them to Parliament, and there they have the right to state their policy and you have the right to attack their policy. The essence of this policy is that every four or five years the people have the right to decide whether you can return to Parliament. But in this booklet I read that this is obsolete, it is not in accordance with our national character and unsuitable for efficient administration. And now my point is this. The charge is that they want to establish a dictatorship in South Africa. [Interjections.] That is the serious side of the matter. I say that I have come to this conclusion that they want to abolish the democratic system, and establish a dictatorship, but do you know what the fielder side of this matter is? The dictator will be the hon. member for Ermelo, and the philosopher of the dictatorship will be the hon. member for Innesdal. Luckily, every serious matter also has its lighter side, its humorous side, and that is the lighter aspect of the matter. [Interjections.] The hon. member can get an opportunity to speak to-morrow. I say the third fundamental principle which is being violated, in my humble opinion, is to be found in this booklet, where it is stated that the English-speaking people will in actual fact become second-class citizens and that their language will in addition become a second-class language, and Afrikaans will come first, and this after the hon. member for Ermelo himself stated in this House, that the right of the English-speaking people was safe with the Herstigtes. Now he goes against that, and I want to say this. I have here an extract from a very interesting view on South Africanism which I should like to quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africanism means that both sections of the community must embrace one South African nationality. It means the two cultures inspired by a single South African ideal. It means creating South Africans who will share, understand, respect, assist with goodwill and recognize politically, intellectually, spiritually, the two cultures of South Africa. It means encouraging and consolidating active co-operation and political coherence between the two main European peoples of South Africa, with the ultimate object of obtaining national unity and political homogeneity.</block>

<p>And do you know, Sir, who wrote that? A person by the name of S. E. D. Brown in the <i>S.A. Observer</i> of January, 1970. And now I should like to put this question to Mr. Brown&#x2019;s friends: Are you going to continue opposing this idea of Mr. Brown&#x2019;s? Is your friendship with him a thing of the past? Have you abandoned him, because you do not need him any more? Is that what is happening now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It is difficult to believe that we are listening to the debate which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition introduced into this House on Monday. I do not think that, in the years I have been here, we have known a debate to degenerate so quickly from something fine and something constructive in the interests of the people of South Africa into a sordid squabble. What is most upsetting is that we are having a violent competition between Nationalist and Nationalist in calling each other names. I have had to sit here for hours listening to how the new, reconstituted Nationalist Party are walking around with deceit in their hearts, that their words cannot be trusted, and that they are political traitors to their cause. I have had to listen to the reconstituted Nationalist Party telling the disintegrating Nationalist Party that they have betrayed their leaders and their history and their traditions. But not in one speech made in the course of this unhappy dispute was there anything constructive for the people of South Africa. I have never in my life heard so many pots calling so many kettles black, so continuously. The result is that we on this side of the House are, frankly, getting bored, and I think the nation outside is getting bored, and tired of this nonsense. Why should the Nationalist Party make so much noise and be so undecorous in its departure from the seat of government in South Africa? Why cannot they leave quietly and know that they are <i>functus officio</i>? What do they make all this noise for and bring all this dissension and unpleasantness into the public life of South Africa? I have listened carefully and I must admit sometimes with a little of what we call in Afrikaans &#x201C;leedvermaak&#x201D;. I chuckled at times. I wonder why this fury? I can understand the sound, because they are trying to shout each other down in the political life of South Africa, but why this fury and hatred and this tremendous dislike of each other, especially on the part of the Nationalist Party? They have been telling the people outside that they see in the H.N.P. a still-born baby and they have told us that they would forfeit all their deposits in the election. But see the fight they are putting up against these babies, these still-born babies! What is the reason for the fury? I think I know, and I think any student of politics will understand why there is this fury. It is because they are looking at the legitimate offspring of the conditioned reflexes they created among many of their own supporters and followers. The reconstituted Nationalist Party wants to be and remain Nationalist as the Nationalist Party was before the hon. the present Prime Minister took over the leadership of the Nationalist Party. But now that the Nationalists are beginning timidly, with no real conviction, to move towards United Party policy, and they are reminded how they were a few years ago, they are horrified. They are like Dr. Jekyll who looks at Mr. Hyde and does not like his other personality. This is not in the interests of public life and of the people of South Africa. This is sickening.</p>

<p>Sir, look at the fight. Let us examine the fight to which we have been treated over the last three or four days. It all started at the Nationalist Party Congress in the Transvaal when the hon. the Minister of Transport demanded that all Nationalists had to subscribe to four points of policy. The first one was that they had to support the policy of national unity. I want to say at once that we on this side of the House rejoice in the lip service that comes from the Nationalist Party to the principle of national unity. We rejoice in it; it has been the warp and the woof of United Party policy since 1912. In our case it can be truthfully said that there is more rejoicing in Heaven over the conversion of one sinner than over 99 who are already saved. It is music to our ears to hear the Nationalist Party paying tribute to, and announcing their conversion to United Party policy. But I want to say what I have said before in this House, and I am still awaiting an answer: It is not enough to pay lip service to national unity. The people of South Africa who truly desire national unity are entitled to a deed, to an act. as proof of the conversion of hon. members opposite. I want to suggest that there is no party in South Africa that dare talk of national unity if they deny the children of South Africa the right and the privilege to be educated in schools together and to become South Africans together. I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that in this matter he must take the lead. If parents want single-medium schools, let them have them, but give those South African parents, who would like to believe the Prime Minister when he speaks of national unity, the right, if they so choose, to send their children to parellel-medium schools where in their most impressionable years they can develop common loyalties and a common love for the good things of South Africa. Until that happens, Sir, we do not believe that the conversion to the principle of national unity on the part of the present Nationalist Party is genuine. We can understand the bewilderment of the reconstituted Nationalist Party at this conversion of the Nationalist Party, unsupported by the only deed that will convince us that the conversion is genuine.</p>

<p>Then there was the question of immigration. I had the privilege to fight a former leader of the Nationalist Party in Alberton in 1948 when there was an immigration policy for South Africa, a fine immigration policy. A Nationalist said to me the other day: &#x201C;You know, Mr. Steyn, what is interesting is that nobody can show me an immigrant that General Smuts brought into South Africa up to 1948; they are all South Africans to-day.&#x201D; That is very interesting. Sir. I remember how we were fought in 1948. People were adjured <span class="col_335-336" refersTo="page_0180"/>to stop the Smuts immigration policy &#x201C;want by wil die Afrikaner onderploeg&#x201D;. We were told to stop immigration; that was the propaganda of the Nationalist Party, because by immigration Smuts wanted to take away homes from young married Afrikaner couples. They were told to stop the immigration because through immigration Smuts wanted to take the bread out of the mouth of Afrikaner children. And the hon. the Minister of Information was a party to it in his infancy; he said it is true. But after 13 wasted years, when we faced a crisis in South Africa, they had to come and admit that Smuts was right, and to-day they are trying to. carry out his policy. There is no difference in their policy except that they cannot get immigrants from the countries where our languages are spoken and where our parents came from; that is the only difference. I can understand that the hon. member for Ermelo and his reconstituted Nationalist Party must be bewildered at this complete change of face on the part of the Nationalist Party. Now, Sir, it does not-matter if young married Afrikaner couples do not get homes. Why this change? But that is not all.</p>

<p>Take the question of sport. I heard the long apology from the Minister of Information&#x2014;if ever there was a misnomer, Sir, it is that title&#x2014;on the sports policy. All I can remember is that on the 4th September, 1965, the late Dr. Verwoerd made a speech at Loskop. a speech which was not very clear, in which he indicated to everybody that Maoris would not be welcome in the All Black team that was to Visit South Africa in 1966. The Minister Of Information tells Us now that Dr. Verwoetd did not mean that Maoris could not be elected. But on the following Monday <i>Die Burger</i> came out with a banner headline, &#x201C;Einde van Maori-toer in 1966&#x201D;. Does he remember that? Does he remember that on Tuesday, the 7th September, <i>Die Transvaler</i> had an article which I am not going to read out because my time is limited, but which I will summarize to the House. <i>Die Transvaler</i> said that one of the greatest achievements of Afrikanerdom had been that we had prevented the bastardization of the white people in South Africa, and one of the great things that we had done to avoid miscegenation and bastardization was that we had not had mixed snorts; and that if Dr. Verwoerd weakened in his attitude that non-Whites could not come and play in South Africa, the result would be the end of the white man in South Africa through bastardization. Now sir all this does not matter. Now we are told by the Prime Minister by inference that <i>Die Transvaler</i> was talking nonsense, and I can understand that the reconstituted Nationalist Party is wondering now whether miscegenation no longer matters and whether mixed sport no longer weakens the colour sense (kleurgevoel) of the Afrikaner, as was said at that time. Sir, if what the hon. the Minister of Information told us to-day is the truth, that Dr. Verwoerd did not indicate that Maoris would not be welcome and if every Nationalist were to believe that, why did the All Black team not come to South Africa in 1966 and why did they not then publicly say that it was due to a misunderstanding? It was never said, Sir. I can understand the problems of the reconstituted Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, there is the outward policy, and I want to say &#x201C;thank you very much&#x201D; to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education&#x2014;the one who wrote the thesis&#x2014;that he has made it possible for me to check something that I thought was necessary to check. You see, Sir, we have an outward policy. I can remember Dr. Verwoerd speaking with great authority about the problems of having diplomats here; I can remember his suggestion that there should be roving ambassadors through Southern Africa. I remember his statement that much of our diplomatic work could be done by telephone, by trunk calls. Of course, that was before we had 82,0 people waiting for telephones. Then, Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister went to London and what did he say there? He made speeches elsewhere too but in London, in the course of an interview, he explained the outward policy.</p>

<p>Yes, that is perfectly correct; we can debate that too with the Prime Minister. But, Sir, the Prime Minister indicated that South Africa was not merely an appendix of Europe; we were part of Africa, and in our own enlightened interest we should co-operate with the other states of Africa, that were so disposed, and that we should have closer ties and even help them. I think that is a fair summary. He said that in the interests of South Africa it had become necessary and would be wise. Sir, I and I think the party on this side of the House, emphatically support the Prime Minister in this regard. But then I want to express my amazement that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education had the cheek to come here and read out the Black Manifesto of 1929 to us. He has forgotten his history, Sir. In January, 1929, General Smuts spoke at the Phoenix Hotel at Ermelo, and do you know what he said. Sir? He said: We were not an appendix of Europe; we were part of Africa, and if we wanted to survive as a state in Africa, we would have to co-operate especially with the other states under British rule in Africa, but we had to remember that we were part of Africa and should have to work with African states, even though they were colonies at the time. Then, Sir, the Nationalist Party seized on a wrong report which inferred that General Smuts had spoken of a dominion to stretch from the Cape to the Sudan &#x2026; [Interjections.] Wait a minute; let us get the truth once and for all. I have here before me a statement issued by General Smuts on 29th January, 1929, and I want you, Sir, to listen to <span class="col_337-338" refersTo="page_0181"/>the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s outward policy as stated by General Smuts in 1929. The paper said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Interviewed to-night, General Smuts made the following reply to the Manifesto.</block>

<p>This refers to the &#x201C;Swart Manifes&#x201D;, the most wicked document ever published in the politics of South Africa. The report said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Interviewed to-night, General Smuts made the following reply to the manifesto issued to-day by General Hertzog, Dr. Malan and Mr. Tielman Roos: &#x201C;Again this precious manifesto has discovered a mare&#x2019;s nest. It is only another desperate effort by the Nat Leaders (to-day he could have said the Reconstituted Nat Leaders) to get the Native question as their principle war cry for the coming election. The report was not a verbatim report but a free and in detail by no means accurate report of an after dinner speech.

<p>Of course he lost the election, and it was not the firs&#x2019; time that the United Party lost an election because the party opposite does not respect the truth. [Interjections.] This is what General Smuts said:</p>

<block name="quote">I never used the expression &#x201C;an African dominion throughout Africa&#x201D;, and expressly declared such a union or a federation of states out of the question.</block>

<p>Now listen to what he has to say:</p>

<block name="quote">I said that I did not expect to live to see the day, but it was sure to come, when the British States on the eastern side of Africa right up to the equator would cooperate in a friendly way in the general policies which concerned them in common and that it would be the task of my party to promote a spirit of friendliness and cooperation with these new states in the North where our sons were now pioneers and where thousands of them had fought under me.</block>

<p>Sir, apart from the reference to the war, that could be the Prime Minister speaking. I can understand that the Reconstituted Nationalist Party cannot understand how, in John Vorster, they see General Smuts <i>redivivus.</i> It does not seem natural, Sir, but let me say this: These are not the only examples of how our policy has been taken over. We can all remember the late Mr. Tom Bowker pleading year after year for the revival of the United Party&#x2019;s Orange River scheme. We can remember the scorn and the contempt thrown on it. We can remember the hon. member for Oudtshoorn talking about the unsuitability of the soil, the silting of the dams and the preposterousness of the suggestions of the United Party. Now they have the cheek to name one of the dams after him, Sir. I want to ask this question: Do these timid, unconvincing attempts to take over United Party policy in limited spheres mean that it is going to take the Government 40 years, as it did in the case of the outward policy, to appreciate that the United Party thinks ahead of them? Will it take them another 40 years to accept our policy, which is as right as General Smuts was in 1929 when he pleaded for co-operation and a spirit of friendlinesss with the other states of Africa? I want to be specific. I hope that the hon. the Prime Minister will take part in this debate and answer these two questions.</p>

<p>Good. Now will the hon. the Prime Minister please answer these two questions: Will it take the hon. the Prime Minister and the Nationalist Party 40 years to realize that the Government does not govern only for its own immediate supporters, but for the nation and for the ordinary people? Will he prove it by answering these two specific questions: Firstly, will it take the Government 40 years before it realizes that the old people of South Africa, as prosperous as the country is to-day, are not to be subjected to the humiliation of charity when it comes to receiving pensions, but that they should, as of right, receive pension from a contributory pension scheme, as happens in civilized countries? Will it take them 40 years to realize that that is as true and as just as the outward police of General Smuts was in 1929&#x2014;a policy which they are now taking over after 40 years? Secondly, Sir, will it take the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Government 40 years before they realize that the ordinary middle-class family in South Africa is entitled to the assistance they deserve, as good citizens, to meet the high cost of medical treatment in times of illness to-day? I am not talking of the very poor. They are helped. I am not talking of the ultra rich. They do not need help, not even Land Bank loans. Medicine has become complex. The practice of medicine has become expensive. Doctors are entitled to a proper remuneration. There are thousands of South Africans who are not covered by medical aid schemes, and who suffer financially for years when they are ill. There are thousands of South Africans who cannot afford the contributions they have to make to private medical aid schemes. When, Sir, will the State accept its responsibility and give us a medical aid scheme for all the people, to which employers, employees and the State will contribute?</p>

<p>Will it take this Government 40 years to see the justice of the United Party&#x2019;s thinking? Will we have to wait as long for this as we <span class="col_339-340" refersTo="page_0182"/>had to wait for this Prime Minister to accept the outward thinking of General Smuts as he stated it in 1929? What sort of Government have we? What sort of Government have we that on the eve of an election can entertain the people of South Africa to this ludicrous exhibition of intolerance of one Nationalist to the other when the people demand attention to their real needs? What have we come to? I have come to the moment of truth for the hon. the Prime Minister. He must get up after me as he has promised and he must tell us what we want to know. He must get away from that reconstituted Nationalist Party. They will die a premature death. I assure him of that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>They wall die a premature death. Let the hon. the Prime Minister forget about them. Let him stand up as the man who temporarily is the Prime Minister of South Africa and let him tell us what this Government is going to do for the common man in South Africa. Let him give specific replies to the two questions I have asked him and let them be reasoned replies. Let him ell the people of South Africa why our old people cannot have a pension as a right. The Social and Economic Planning Council of General Smuts calculated that when our national income had risen to R2,000 million per year it would be possible to have a contributory pension scheme without a means test. Our income now is almost R9,000 million a ear. What <b>excuse</b> has the Prime Minister for denying this to the veteran citizens of South Africa? Let him give us a reasoned answer why in this modern world where even capitalist America has instituted a medical care scheme, the middle class of South Africa, Who are excellent people, should be deprived of a privilege to which every civilized citizen of every civilized country throughout the world is entitled? I think that that is what the Prime Minister owed the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>I am glad and I feel that it is a great privilege that I have the opportunity to invite the Prime Minister in a very friendly spirit in the interests of the people of South Africa to deal with these two questions when he answers, and to leave the reconstituted Nationalist Party. We are not interested in the caucus secrets of the Nationalist Party. We are not interested in who promised whom what in private conclave. We are interested in the future of the people of South Africa and let the Prime Minister speak to us about that. Let the Prime Minister tell us something more about the interesting speeches we had from the hon. Minister of Labour and the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. The hon. Minister of Labour told us that there is no real labour shortage or labour crisis in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister of Finance spoke as recently as November of last year of a manpower crisis in South Africa, but the hon. Minister of Labour told us there are enough people to do the essential work of South Africa. I want to deal with the hon. Minister of Labour, who then paid great tribute to the border industry policy of the Nationalist Party but he did not tell us that that policy was a subterfuge to get round the manpower crisis, because on the borders of the reserves Bantu and other non-Whites are employed in jobs normally occupied by white men at wages below those received by white men in factories in the white areas of South Africa. Why did he not give us the relevant figures to show us how the Government are circumventing the problem? This is the nonsense the hon. Minister of Labour spoke in this House about job reservation. What does it help to reserve jobs in Johannesburg or Cape Town, and to give those jobs to Blacks. Although I have no objection to that, I do object to their being paid lower wages than those which the white man can earn. What does that help? I have seen this happen. The hon. Minister of Bantu Administration told us that in a city like Johannesburg there are two black workers for every white worker but he boasted that near or in the reserves the position was different. There the ratio was 18 to one. They do not develop the reserves. There is no economic separation. Who was it that spoke of economic separation? It was one of the hon. members opposite, the hon. Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, who spoke of this. Where is the economic separation on the borders of the reserves when you simply shift the present situation in Johannesburg from there to eight miles from Pretoria? Where is there development genuinely on the borders of the reserves? All this development is in suburbs of white cities. Rosslyn is a suburb of Pretoria. Hammanskraal is a suburb of Pretoria. Let us be honest about it. This is the great solution. Where is the border development on the border of the Transkei? Name me one factory there? The hon. member for Middelland told <i>Dagbreek</i> that one must be very cautious not to let political advancement outstrip economic advancement. We heard today from the hon. the Minister that the political development of the Transkei has gone so far that it cannot be reversed. That is nonsense, but it is what they say. But how far has the economic development of the Transkei gone? How many industries have been established on the borders of the Transkei to stimulate the economic development of the territory? I will tell hon. members. Not one! There are none, because there are not big cities like Pretoria in whose suburbs the pretence of border industry development can be undertaken at the expense of the existing industrial areas of South Africa, which are bound and limited by the unreasonable application of the Physical Planning Act.</p>

<p>Job reservation is unnecessary, because the conventions of South Africa have looked after that for years. Those conventions will remain.

<p>Even the Prime Minister should be ashamed of his ignorance. I said we will repeal section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act in so far as job reservation is concerned. Does the hon. the Prime Minister not know that job reservation is contained in section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act? Why does the Prime Minister take part in a discussion of a subject of which he knows nothing? And he is the Prime Minister of South Africa! Such colossal ignorance from a gentleman in his position! I will not be surprised if he cannot answer my two questions. I do not think he has the knowledge to do it. I do not think he has the concern for the people of South Africa to do it satisfactorily.</p>

<p>We have been told that the hon. the Prime Minister and his party are trying to hang the incubus of the reconstituted Nationalist Party around our necks. That is an unnatural act from the Prime Minister. He is the father of these people. His thinking, his philosophy, his attitude during and after the war procreated them. They are his legitimate, intellectual and moral offspring. Why does he want the United Party to accept the illegitimate parentship of his children? What sort of father is that? When we want allies, we will say so openly. We will acknowledge them openly. We will not do such things as the hon. Minister of Transport alleged so irresponsibly yesterday.

<p>Mr. Speaker, on 22nd April we shall have an election. After 22nd April the members coming to this House will be quite different from the members who are here to-day. I am not politicizing now; I am going to do so in a moment. On this occasion, since this may be the last opportunity I shall have, I want to thank those members on both sides of the House who have either decided not to seek re-election or will no longer be members of the House owing to other circumstances, for the years of public service they have rendered to South Africa, each according to his convictions. We are here because we like being here. We are here because we believe that we have a task to fulfil. We are here because we believe and are keen to render public service. It is a hard and difficult life, but naturally it also has its compensations. Seen as a whole it doss, however, require a great deal from a man to come to this House and, in some cases, to spend many years of his life here. The public outside does not always realize what is being required of a member of the House of Assembly. That is why I am uttering these words and that is why I am expressing my thanks to hon. members who have for many years, no matter in what capacity, rendered service here according to their convictions.</p>

<p>As I have said, there will be an election on 22nd April. Until that election takes place, a great deal will be said and written. There will be reports in those newspapers supporting my party, and there will also be reports in those newspapers supporting the three Opposition parties. On a certain occasion years ago, in describing the English Press here, I likened it to a she-goat with one teat and two kids. At that time these were the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and Dr. Jan Steytler. At present that she-goat&#x2019;s task is appreciably more difficult, since another kid has been added, i.e. the hon. member for Ermelo. In the months ahead I shall find it amusing to see how the <i>Cape Times</i> and the <i>Sunday Times</i> and others make out. I shall find it amusing to see the day the <i>Cape Times</i> refers to-the hop. member <span class="col_343-344" refersTo="page_0184"/>for Innesdal as &#x201C;Oom Jaap&#x201D;. That day will come, and we as politicians will revel in them. But, as I have said, an election is at hand. My hon. friend the Leader of the Opposition has. as he did in the past, once again gone &#x201C;White&#x201D; before the election. He did so in 1966 and on all the previous occasions on which elections were in the offing. I can well imagine that when my grand-children one day ask me, &#x201C;Grandpa, what kind of election did you have in 1970?&#x201D; I shall tell them, &#x201C;My boys, it was really the election of Snow White and four dwarfs. In the course of time at my disposal I shall deal with that and with related matters. I shall also deal with the matters mentioned to me by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat.</p>

He claims that we have now taken over their policy because we are saying that we are of Africa. But could the hon. member tell me why they struggled so, why they fought and carried on so much when we wanted to sever the ties with Mother England one by one? Could the hon. member tell me why they did not even want to abolish the appeal to the Privy Council, why they made such a great fuss when we took their British citizenship away from them? Could the hon. member tell me why he and others made such a fuss when we wanted to make South Africa a republic which is from Africa and of Africa alone? Could the hon. member tell me why even threats were heard from their side?</p>

<p>I want to give the hon. member for Yeoville a reply to that at once. He had a great deal to say here about a contributory pension scheme.

Why does he not tell us that?</p>

<p>No, he rejected the principle of the matter as far back as 1942. This story by the United Party that they would have accepted it if our national income had been a certain amount, was spread solely for the purpose of putting it off indefinitely because they did not have the courage to tell the people that they rejected it.</p>

<p>In the few minutes I have at my disposal before seven o&#x2019;clock, I want to deal with the hon. member for Innesdal. I am dealing with him in this regard solely because for the sake of South Africa and for the sake of the security of South Africa I want to correct at once the wrong impression he created in this House. I am now referring to the hon. member for Innesdal&#x2019;s reference to monitoring (<i>meeluistering).</i> I now want to tell the hon. member that monitoring has nothing to do with a telephone at all. but does the hon. member realize how. precisely because I now have to furnish him with this explanation, he is helping the enemies of South Africa by his actions? Does he realize that I am now obliged to reveal secrets here which could help the terrorists against the sons of South Africa? Mr. Speaker, I want to make it very clear to you that I am not breaching the privilege of the House in issuing this warning to the hon. member for Innesdal. I want to tell that hon. member that if he interferes with military secrets, or if his actions are such that he jeopardizes the security of South Africa, steps will be taken against him. Let him have no doubts whatsoever about that. For the sake of a little cheap publicity the hon. member came forwad here and reffered to a document. The hon. member will have to explain to this House how that document came info his possession. I want to tell the hon. member that I do not accept the explanation he furnished in his speech.</p>

<p>When the division into the Bureau for State Security, the Military Intelligence Service and the Police Intelligence Service was effected, a decision was taken as to the division of functions. All those functions were under discussion. One of those functions is monitoring. What does &#x201C;monitoring&#x201D; mean? It means the acquisition of intelligence from enemy sources. That is what it means. This is done with the aid of very delicate apparatus which is in the possession of the Navy, the Air Force and the Army. Very often the acquisition of that intelligence in so far as the terrorists are concerned, means the difference between life and death for a Portuguese soldier, a Rhodesian soldier or a South African policeman. I want to tell the hon. member that he knows this is <span class="col_345-346" refersTo="page_0185"/>the position, for in his ranks there are people who can tell him what it is. The position is either that he did not take the elementary trouble to find out what that term means or what it refers to, or that they furnished him with the information. These are the only conclusions one can draw. I want to assume that the person who gave him the document, must have informed him about its significance. Therefore I want to level the accusation that if he did not give it to him the hon. member must have asked for it. I think I am entitled to say that I believe the hon. member knew what its significance is. He thought he would embarrass this side of the House, the Government, by presenting it here as though it had something to do with telephones and the tapping of conversations. All he has succeeded in doing, is to oblige me to say in this House that we have at our disposal apparatus revealing to us the movements of terrorists.</p>

<p>With a great deal of bravado the hon. member for Innesdal asked this question across the floor of the House: why did the Prime Minister of New Zealand say that Maoris would come to South Africa? I want to tell the hon. member that he need not obtain that information the way he obtained military documents. He merely has to ask the leader of his party why the Prime Minister of New Zealand said this. After all, he can ask his leader, because, surely, as deputy leader of the party he may speak to him. That hon. member would then inform him that in March, 1966, our representative in New Zealand, Mr. Oxley, acting upon the instructions of the late Dr. Verwoerd, called on the Prime Minister of New Zealand after he had had talks with the then Prime Minister during his home leave in February, 1966. He was officially instructed to tell the Prime Minister of New Zealand that if the All Blacks came to South Africa, inquiries would not be made about their genealogy. The hon. member for Ermelo knows this, and he would be able to tell this to the hon. member for Innesdal.</p>

<p>Since I do not wish to proceed to the other matters now as I shall discuss them to-morrow, I wish, in the limited time at my disposal, to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. It has been a built-in part of our Election Law all these years that there would be loading and de-loading of constituencies. This has always been the case. But, what is more, traditionally it has been the position here that all changes to our Electoral Law are to be preceded by the discussion thereof by the various parties so that an agreed measure may be brought before this House. I took cognizance of what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said here this afternoon. This is not the first time that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has said it; he has done so on previous occasions as well. However, to my knowledge this is the first time he referred to this matter in the House. When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition replies, I want him to tell me whether it is the policy of the United Party to change the loading and the de-loading of constituencies if they should come into power one day, the day pigs learn to fly. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition cannot merely leave it at that. A front-bencher of his delivered a whole tirade about this matter this afternoon. The rural voters of the Republic are entitled to learn from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether it is his policy, if he should come into power one day, to abolish the deloading of the rural areas. It is no use the hon. member for Yeoville looking at me like that; the hon. member for Bezuidenhout advocated this here to-day. If the hon. member for Yeoville wants to advise his leader on this matter, he can do so to-night, because to-morrow he must reply to it. I am raising this matter because it has formed part of our Electoral Law all these years and because it is of cardinal importance to the rural areas to know whether or not the United Party has something like this up its sleeve. I believe that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition owes this House a reply, and explanation.</p>

<from>The MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION:</from>

<p>Ever since private schools came into being in South Africa, the right of admission thereto has vested in the governing bodies of such schools. Furthermore, private schools for Whites fall under the Provinces, and the tuition of pupils under Standard 10 does not come within the jurisdiction of the Minister of National Education. I am not, therefore, in a position to reply to the question, but as far as I have been able to ascertain, the schools still function exactly the same as was the case when the hon. member was a member of the National Party and his leader served as a member of the Government.</p>

<li>(1) No&#x2014;only in connection with the establishment of a by-product depot at Skukuza for the processing of game carcasses into biltong, blood-and bone meal. The enterprise was undertaken for the following reasons:

<li>(i) From the viewpoint of nature conservation viz. to reduce the numbers of certain species of game which became too abundant in certain parts, thus threatening the continued existence of the park.</li>

<li>(ii) The laws regulating Veterinary Services prohibit the export from the Park of live or unprocessed game, with the exception of Quagga which are sold to farmers.</li>

<li>(6) whether any precautions have been taken to prevent the hijacking of aircraft of South African Airways on both domestic and international flights; if not. why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#webber">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) There was no &#x201C;Amsterdam Conference on hijacking of Aircraft&#x201D;. South African Airways were, however, represented by two officials at the Annual General Meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) which took place in Amsterdam during 1969. At this meeting the question of hijacking formed an agenda item and a resolution was adopted which IATA communicated to my Department and which called upon States to take all measures necessary to end any further unlawful interference with aircraft in public air transport service and to support any action already taken or which may be taken by the United Nations or the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).</li>

<li>(2) No. Although consideration has and is being given to the Republic of South Africa becoming a party to the Tokyo Convention, no decision has been reached. It is generally accepted that the present provisions of the Tokyo Convention has certain shortcomings, especially as regards hijacking of aircraft. In 1969 the council of ICAO established a &#x201C;special committee on unlawful interference with civil aviation and its facilities&#x201D;. During December, 1969, ICAO announced that a special draft treaty dealing solely with unlawful seizure of aircraft had been developed. After this draft had been considered by the ICAO Legal Committee in March, 1970, the draft treaty would be presented for adoption by a diplomatic conference later during 1970. Further consideration will be given to the question when the results of the March, 1970, meeting of the ICAO Legal Committee is known.</li>

<li>(3) No. I am not aware of any other agreements except the Tokyo Convention. The question, however, is confusing and if the honourable member is referring to extradition agreements, then it is not a matter to be dealt with by my Department.</li>

<li>(4)

<ol>

<li>(a) The Republic has bilateral agreements with the following States: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Botswana. Denmark. Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Malawi. Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden. Switzerland, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America.</li>

<li>(b) It is assumed that in this context the term &#x201C;multilateral air agreement&#x201D; means a convention dealing with aviation. If so, the Republic is a party to&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) Convention for the unification of certain rules relating to international carriage by Air (Warschau, 1929) as amended by the Hague Protocol (1955).</li>

<li><span class="col_377-378" refersTo="page_0201"/>(ii) Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago, 1944).</li>

<li>(iii) International Air Services Transit Agreement (Chicago, 1944).</li>

</ol></li>

</ol></li>

<li>(5) No. The bilateral agreements deal with traffic rights and matters pertaining thereto and as far as I know, such agreements between other countries do not contain provisions concerning hijacking.</li>

<li>(6) I am of the opinion that it is not in the public interest to disclose the information called for.</li>

<answer by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) and (b) Such steps were not taken from South Africa&#x2019;s side. In the case of telecommunications traffic between the Republic and certain countries in South America, use is made of circuits in the Trans-Atlantic cable between South Africa and Spain, from where transit facilities in the form of satellite circuits via the Spanish ground station and the South Atlantic satellite are provided to and from the countries of destination by the private company in charge of Spain&#x2019;s telecommunications affairs. The satellite circuits in question are the sole responsibility of that company. At this stage the possibility exists that a similar service may be introduced between the Republic and the United States of America only.</li>

<li>(2) The establishment of a ground station in South Africa and the use of direct satellite communications are not contemplated at present for the reasons set out in my statement of 13th May, 1969.</li>

<p>asked the Minister of Health:</p>

<p>Whether, in the light of the tests under taken by the South African Bureau of <span class="col_413-414" refersTo="page_0219"/>Standards in connection with pesticide residue hazards, mentioned in the 24th Annual Report of the Bureau, he will make a statement indicating (a) the extent of the contamination of crops, produce and water supplies, (b) whether such contamination is in a concentration sufficient to endanger the health of human and animal life and (c) the steps to be taken to prevent or minimize such effects.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_health" to="#wood">

<from>The MINISTER OF HEALTH:</from>

<ol>

<li>(a) and (b) No routine tests for pesticidal residues in crops, produce or water supplies are undertaken by the South African Bureau of Standards. The pesticidal tests to which the hon. member refers were undertaken by the Bureau for registration purposes at the request of applicant manufacturers and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Suitability, effectiveness and poison tolerance are amongst others, prerequisites for the registration of any agricultural remedy and it was for this purpose that the tests concerned were carried out by the Bureau of Standards and not directly in connection with general consumers food or water. It can be expected, however, that agricultural products which were treated with pesticides would for a prescribed safety period have undesirable residues, but if the products are not marketed before the expiry of this period, no hazards will arise therefrom. The sampling of foodstuffs and domestic water supplies is the responsibility of local authorities. No instance of excessive pesticidal residues in food or domestic water has been brought to the notice of the Department. Moreover no dangerous quantities of pesticidal residues were found in any of the samples sent to departmental laboratories for analysis.</li>

<li>(b) Only recently I have approved of the withdrawal of a Government Notice which, as early as 1951, declared insecticidal poisoning as a notifiable disease, and the substitution thereof by a new notice which will shortly be published and whereby poisoning in any form by insecticides and pesticides will be declared a notifiable disease in the whole of the Republic.</li>

<p>Information thus obtained will enable the Department of Health to take the steps which may be required to combat the danger.</p>

<from>Mrs. H. SUZMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Transport:</p>

<p>Whether steps have been taken to prevent a repetition of the conditions which led to the loss of livestock through thirst, starvation and overcrowding at Johannesburg railway sidings during January, 1970; if so, what steps, if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<p>Presumably the hon. member refers to the circumstances which resulted from the congestion at the Newtown Abattoir during January, 1970.</p>

<p>The difficulties experienced were brought about by the inadequate kraal facilities provided by the Johannesburg Municipality and the consequent inability of consignees to take delivery of all livestock. The Railways Administration cannot, therefore, accept responsibility for the conditions which existed at the time.</p>

<p>The re-introduction of the quota system by the Livestock and Meat Industry Control Board should prevent a recurrence of similar conditions in the future.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the start I wish to move, as a further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House reaffirms its full confidence in the National Party and the manner in which it governs South Africa and in which it deals with the internal and external problems of the country&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Yesterday evening I had the opportunity to refer briefly to certain urgent matters. Of course, I was asked by my hon. friend the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to reply to the charge sheet which he brought in against me, my Government and the National Party when he moved this motion of no confidence. Among other things, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled the customary reproach at me that I am a weak leader. Let me tell the hon. the Leader that if he glances at Hansard, he will see that he levelled the same reproach at my predecessors. They were better men than I; how much the more, then, would he not level this reproach at me? The question of whether I am a weak leader or whether the hon. member is a good leader is not really something the hon. member and I can settle between ourselves. It is a matter which only the electorate of South Africa can decide. As for me, I want to say that it is with great confidence that I leave this matter entirely in the hands of the electorate. In the meantime, I do not have the impression that the voters outside like the hon. member more than they like me, since he has now placed this matter on a personal level. I do not know how things are going with the hon. member&#x2019;s meetings, but I am quite satisfied with the way in which the public are attending my meetings to hear my standpoint and that of my party. I was particularly struck by this when I went to Durban to address a public meeting in the city hall there. I drove from the Louis Botha Airport to the city hall. On a number of poles there were two placards, one above the other&#x2014;the one announcing the hon. member&#x2019;s meeting at the top, and the other announcing my meeting below it. It amused me so much that I asked a friend to take a photograph of them for me. The placard announcing my meeting read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Stadsaal: Openbare vergadering.</block>

<block name="quote">City Hall: Public Meeting.</block>

<block name="quote">22 September/September 22nd, 8 nm./p.m.</block>

<p>In addition there was the customary photograph fitting to the occasion. That was all. The hon. member&#x2019;s placard was extremely interesting. The customary photograph was on a television screen. All that Stood underneath it was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Div</block>

<block name="quote">Montclair Hall/Saal</block>

<block name="quote">Band, Bar, Braai</block>

<p>[Laughter.] I shall gladly send it to my hon. friend for perusal. I just want to say, Sir, seeing that the hon. member has now made a personal attack on me, that it has never been necessary for me to try to ensure a full attendance at my meetings by getting a-&#x201C;band&#x201D;. It has never been necessary for me to have a &#x201C;bar&#x201D;, and it has never been necessary for me to be &#x201C;braai-ed&#x201D;. I just want to say in passing, since the hon. member has now thrown matters onto the basis of our respective personalities, that I find this surprisingly interesting.</p>

<p>But then the hon. member went further and stated that I had called this election because I was afraid. It was a panic reaction on my part. But, Sir, there is nothing new in this. The hon. member is not only accusing me now; he accused my worthy predecessor, the late Dr. Verwoerd, in precisely the same words. I shall quote to the hon. member from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 1st October, 1961. He then reacted to the then election announcement by Dr. Verwoerd as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir De Villiers described the election on 18th October as &#x201C;the frightened election&#x201D;, because of the Government&#x2019;s fear that it would not be returned to power if it held the election on the normal date in 1963. Dr. Verwoerd knew that he could not sustain the bluff of apartheid much longer.</block>

<p>Then we punished him more severely in that election than Graeme Pollock punishes a cricket ball, and then we punished him again in 1966. But after all those things the hon. member is now making precisely the same accusation. It might interest the hon. member for Yeoville to know that in that same speech in 1961 the hon. the Leader of the Opposition put precisely the same two questions to Dr. Verwoerd which he has now put to me, i.e. in regard to the &#x201C;contributory pension scheme&#x201D; and the &#x201C;sound family health scheme&#x201D;, as well as in regard to &#x201C;better education and increased security&#x201D;. I shall deal with this later, as may be opportune.</p>

<p>The hon. member will of course understand now that I cannot devote all my time to him, for a new leader has appeared in this House. I must devote my time to him as well. Indeed, Sir, I must take notice of the new leader, the hon. member for Ermelo, for this is not an everyday leader. This is a leader with a distinction. This is a leader with two testimonials, a requested testimonial from an unnamed minister of religion, and another testimonial from a well-known Judge. Consequently, I must also devote attention to this hon. member. But I shall deal first with the less important accusations the hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled at me.</p>

<p>The hon. member accused me of changing the terms of reference of the Judge who was entrusted with the inquiry into the security position. I would be pleased if the hon. member for Yeoville would allow the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to give me his attention. <span class="col_435-436" refersTo="page_0230"/>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition accused me of having wrongly changed the terms of reference. On what grounds does the hon. member base his charge? There are no legal grounds for it, nor did the hon. member advance any grounds for his charge. But what did we have here now? I would be pleased if the hon. member would furnish me with a reply to that question. Here we had a commission which had to institute an inquiry into the security set-up, the composition and everything related to that, because, and I also stated this in public, I was concerned that South Africa should have only the best security set-up. We who are intimately concerned with this matter, cannot form an objective opinion as to whether there are not better methods to ensure the security of South Africa. It is not only South Africa that has taken such a step. Many countries, Australia, for example, have taken the step of appointing a Judge to perform precisely the same task. While this Judge was engaged on his task, the hon. member for Ermelo made accusations to the effect that the amount which had been made available was not the R4 million for which provision had been made on the Estimates, but that it was closer to R50 million. What other deduction could anyone have made from that, but that the hon. member for Ermelo was blazing it abroad that large-scale deception was being practised here; not only deception of the public, but also deception of Parliament. It means that the Prime Minister and Parliament were giving out that only R4 million was being appropriated, but that the amount in fact came to R50 million. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition expect me to have left it at that? Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition expect me, taking into consideration our security position, and taking into consideration how delicate these matter are. to have simply dismissed it with a shrug of the shoulders? Here a responsible &#x2026;, no, I may not use the word, here an hon. member comes along, who previously served in the Cabinet for many years, and makes this allegation. I had every right to refer it to a Judge. I want to state here now that if the same circumstances were to repeat themselves, I would again refer allegations of this nature to a Judge. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, in the same way as I and any other member, is concerned that there should be no corruption or any trace of corruption. If such charges are levelled, they must therefore be investigated. I am astonished that the hon. Leader of the Opposition is levelling a reproach at me because of this. For what did I do? By advising the State President, I had that charge investigated in public by a Judge, and the witnesses were called. It is part of history now that the brave member for Ermelo was not prepared to substantiate under oath his statement in which he had uttered an untruth in public. In passing, I just want to draw attention to the Judge&#x2019;s remark, i.e. that there is not an atom of truth in the allegations. That was the language of the court. The ordinary person would say that the hon. member for Ermelo had told a lie.</p>

<p>I should also like to point out in passing that the court stated that in so far as the hon. member for Ermelo had said that he had heard it from others, it was very clear, even from the finding of the court, that the court doubted very much whether he could have heard it from another person. I do not know of any one outside an asylum from whom he could have heard it. I think, and I charge the hon. member for Ermelo with having done this, that he either sucked it out of his thumb or sucked it out of his deputy leader&#x2019;s thumb. I therefore reject the accusation made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition because I had had that matter investigated. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware of the fact that various complaints have been made against the Bureau for State Security. If the hon. the Leader is not satisfied with that aspect in regard to which the hon. member for Durban (North) has just informed him, he can put questions to me. I shall place myself at his disposal. The hon. the Leader is aware of the kind of gossip about this Bureau which is being bruited abroad. I want to refer to two of these stories, because I should like to have this placed on record. The staff of this Bureau, from its head all the way down, have no powers of arrest. Nor do they have any powers of detention whatsoever. Its task is the collection of information. In that regard section 29 was inserted. It would be as well and fitting that I should say a few words about section 29 on this occasion. In terms of our common law any head of a State Department, even a subordinate head, had the right to issue a certificate which provided that evidence in regard to a certain matter could not be given, and to present this certificate to the court. During my period of Office as Minister of Justice I myself once issued such a certificate. I want to illustrate the case to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The facts of the case were that a person had written a letter to the Department in which he had made certain charges against a messenger of the court. The messenger of the court came to hear about this. He demanded that the letter be produced. In fact, my private secretary was summonsed to come and produce that letter in court, for this man wanted to bring a libel action against that member of the public as a result of what he had heard. I issued a certificate to the effect that it was not in the interests of the public that the contents of that letter be disclosed. I did so for the simple reason that it is the elementary right of members of the public to complain about officials. If letters in which members of the public complain about officials can be produced, then you are depriving the public of the feeling of liberty or the right to complain about officials. This is also as I stated it to the court. The hon. member for Durban (North) is aware of that Transvaal case. The Transvaal court acknowledged that I was right. However, as time went by, different court decisions were given. What it <span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0231"/>boiled down to eventually was that one set of court decisions stated that the Minister and the head of a department had the power to withhold evidence, while the other set of decisions stated that it was the courts that could decide on the matter, and not the Minister or the head of a department. Then that clash arose in an Appeal Court case. Normally it went to the Department of Justice and normally the Department of Justice settled the case by means of section 29. But section 29 has nothing whatsoever to do with the Bureau for State Security as such. It was not introduced as a result of the establishment of that Bureau and it has nothing to do with it. It was a question of lack of clarity which arose as a result of decisions by Supreme Courts in regard to what the common law position in this connection should be.</p>

<p>No. Unfortunately the Calitz case which came before the Appeal Court gave a decisive ruling in regard to that particular case only. The cardinal principle remained undecided.

<p>He dare not look one in the eyes. He made another attack at Witbank, which in essence amounted to this, that I could now take that R4 million for myself and nobody would even know about it. It is such a dirty insinuation that no decent person would take any notice of it. I want to go further and say that no decent person would make such an allegation on a public platform.</p>

<p>As I have said, that commission was appointed because I was desirous of giving South Africa only the best in that sphere.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, the second charge the hon. member made against me was that I had allegedly stated in 1969 that all the members of my party at the time subscribed to the policy of my party. Now the facts have shown that I was wrong. I want to make the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a gift of this argument. I was wrong and he is right in this connection. I was wrong for the simple reason that I believed at the time that I could rely on the honesty and integrity of certain people. That is why I gave that assurance. To-day I am painfully aware of the fact that I cannot rely on honesty and integrity as far as some gentlemen in this House are concerned. I gave my country and my people that assurance at the time because all the matters in regard to which disputes subsequently arose had continually been discussed in party bodies and because votes had often been taken on these matters at congresses and other party occasions. At the 1966 congress the hon. member for Ermelo declared that I would never have to look behind me to see where he stood. On that occasion he thanked me and said that he would always be behind me.</p>

<p>All the hon. member for Ermelo had omitted to say was what he would have in his hand when he was behind me. At the 1967 congress those matters were discussed and resolutions were taken in regard to them. At the 1968 congress votes were also taken on these matters, and I now come to the 1969 congress. I relied upon the honesty and integrity of people who had voted for all these things on various occasions. I relied on the integrity of the hon. member for Ermelo. After I had spoken for an hour and a half in stating the National Party&#x2019;s policy in regard to the English and Afrikaans speaking people, he rose from his bench and stated that no man inside or outside this House could state it better than I had stated it that day. This stands recorded in Hansard.</p>

<p>But surely we are not playing children&#x2019;s games now; we are <span class="col_439-440" refersTo="page_0232"/>dealing with very serious matters. That speech dealt with co-operation between Afrikaans and English speaking people and I do not want to reiterate it here to-day. It is recorded in Hansard. What did the hon. member do then? He issued a pamphlet and attacked the hon. member for Umlazi, Mr. Lewis, by name and Professor Horwood here in this House. What kind of manliness is this if the hon. member for Ermelo had the opportunity of saying that Mr. Lewis should not be admitted to the party? I gave him the opportunity of voting on this matter, of voting &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;No&#x201D; on this matter. Why did he not have the courage to vote &#x201C;No&#x201D;? Why did he not have the courage to say, &#x201C;No&#x201D;? Why does he now bicker in the House of Assembly and outside about this matter, while he had had a full say and while he knew that if one single man had voted against Mr. Lewis&#x2019;s admission in the caucus, as I put it, he would not have been admitted to the National Party? Why did he not have the courage to get to his feet on that occasion? Nor did he have the courage to say a word to indicate that he did not agree with this at any party occasion where policy was discussed. I am asking the hon. member what conclusion I must arrive at from his actions. Was there nothing wrong, or did he know that it was wrong but did not have the courage to say a word against it? In plain Afrikaans we have a word for a man who does not have the courage to do something. I am not going to use it here, because it is unparliamentary, but the word has four letters and begins with an &#x201C;m&#x201D;. I want to make the statement here, and we shall still face each other across the floor of this House, to the hon. member for Ermelo that on no party occasion, either in private or in public, did he utter a single word to me as Leader of the party to the effect that there was any item of policy of the party or application of the policy with which he was not in agreement. What he did in fact say was directed against the Press. On that score he had a great deal to say and covered a wide field, but since he established his party he no longer has anything to say about it, for then he would have to offend his mouthpiece, the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Since that date the hon. member has had nothing to say, but that was the smokescreen he threw up at the time. But the hon. member did not say a single word on any occasion about policy or the application of policy. And if the hon. member now disputes this, then this is his opportunity to put a question to me in this regard, and I am readily available to reply to that question.</p>

<p>But let us examine the question of co-operation on account of which the hon. member found it necessary to establish a party. It was under discussion at the Transvaal congress and the hon. member voted for it, together with everybody else. The question of diplomats was discussed there and the hon. member was in agreement on that, together with the hon. members for Wonderboom and Innesdal. Since they now disagree with the Government, I am asking the hon. member for Ermelo: When did you disagree, at the Transvaal congress or only subsequently? When did you discover that you disagreed with the National Party? Surely that is a fair question. I will not place you under oath. I am simply asking the question, and I will not place you under oath. You can simply tell me whether you knew at the Transvaal congress already or whether it was only afterwards that you knew, for if the hon. member already knew this at the Transvaal congress, why did he not speak up when this matter was being discussed and he had been specifically invited by the Leader in the Transvaal to do so?</p>

<p>The same applies to immigration. Is it possible for one to be so ridiculous as the hon. member for Wonderboom? The motion on immigration was before the Transvaal congress, and the hon. member for Wonderboom stated: If you accept the amendment I have moved, I shall vote for this. And we accepted the amendment, and the hon. member became angry about the amendment and went and established a party because of it. Can one be so ridiculous?</p>

<p>Then there was the question of sport, and this we have debated here. I want to make this accusation again, and in order to set the mind of the hon. member for Ermelo at ease I want to repeat that I will not place him under oath and ask him to take an oath, because the hon. member is allergic to that. I just want to ask him why, since it is apparently one of the main planks in the platform of his new party, did he not raise this matter with me or with other leaders of the party on one single party occasion? When did the hon. member find out about Maoris, before or after he established his party?</p>

<p>I want to go further. Our party leaders discussed this matter fully in all its full consequences where the hon. member for Ermelo was present. He sat there when the party leaders&#x2014;because the Cabinet does not discuss State matters only; the Cabinet also meets as party leaders&#x2014;formulated this policy. The hon. member helped to formulate it, and he agreed that it should be raised by me here in parliament, even after it had been discussed for days in the caucus. But the hon. member never once opened his mouth to utter one single objection against it. This was the case from 1967 till to-day. But now the hon. member comes along and establishes a party and states that he has established that party because he wants to follow the course adopted by the late Dr. Verwoerd. Mr. Strydom and Dr. Malan. I want to tell the hon. member that this is the kind of member he is: If I should die tomorrow or the day after, he would stand by me. There is no doubt at all about that. But, Sir, let us consider for a moment this member&#x2019;s party and let us consider some of his candidates and the statements made by them. They telephone me and tell me for the sake of interest that his mouthpiece on the East Rand, the <i>Brakpan Herald</i>, has announced that a certain Mr. Joos du Plessis has been put up as <span class="col_441-442" refersTo="page_0233"/>my opposing candidate by the member for Ermelo. The four previous candidates put up by him have disappeared, and now he has come forward with Mr. Joos du Plessis. This is the man who took a beating at the referendum in 1960 because he wanted Bantu and Coloured persons to vote in the referendum as well. In 1966 he was to have been the candidate of the Van der Merwes against me, but he only reached the door of the nomination room and then he did not know how one nominated someone and turned away. He has now been nominated by the member. These are the kind of people they are now bringing forward to be their candidate.</p>

<p>No. we do not even mention Paul Marais. Let us just see now &#x2014;for the public outside is concerned with this &#x2014;whether there is any substance in the assertion that the National Party, as it is sitting on this side of the House, has deviated from the policy of former National Party leaders. Sir, the candidate of the Hertzog Party in Boks-burg is a Mr. Pretorius. In regard to this Mr. Pretorius the publication of the member for Ermelo. i.e. <i>Die Afrikaner,</i> to-day writes the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Public Service officials like Mr. Pik Botha, the Vorster candidate in Wonderboom, and Mr. Nothnagel, the provincial candidate, are being granted special leave to participate openly in politics. H.N.P. supporters like Mr. S. G. Pretorius, a candidate of the H.N.P. in Boksburg, are being kicked out.</block>

<p>The statement is made in this H.N.P. publication, which has now appeared upon the scene to tell the truth&#x2014;and the hon. member for Ermelo is the great man of truth&#x2014;that this Mr. Pretorius, who is a member of the Public Service, has been kicked out: Why does the hon. member for Ermelo allow Mr. Willie Lubbe to tell such a public lie? Surely it is not Calvinistic; it is not even honourable to allow such a lie to be told, because Pretorius has in fact not been kicked out. In the same way as Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Nothnagel gave notice that they were resigning from the Public Ser vice, so Mr. Pretorius gave notice of his resignation, and he resigned with effect from 1st February. And now the great man of truth comes along and states, through the medium of his newspaper, that this Mr. Pretorius was kicked out. But let us see who this Mr. Pretorius is. Sir, I am not going to tell you what I say Mr. Pretorius is; I shall let Mr. Pretorius speak for himself, and I am quoting verbatim what he said at the meeting held in Brakpan by the member for Ermelo and the member for Innesdal. There this Mr. Pretorius appeared on the platform. This is what he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I resigned from the National Party in 1963 because I realized then already that the National Party was betraying us.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal, according to what I have been told, applauded loudly. [Interjections.] Yes, and in the transcript of this it is stated: &#x201C;Booing and cheering.&#x201D;</p>

Why are you making him a candidate in Boksburg? But Mr. Pretorius went on.

<p>This candidate of the Herstigte Nasionale Party, Mr. Beetge, held a meeting. I was not aware of it, nor did I see any statement in regard to the meeting until I received a report on it from the general secretary of the South African Iron and Steel and Related Industries Union. It is not necessary to relate what Mr. Beetge said, but it is necessary to read what the Steelworkers and Related Industries Union wrote in regard to this matter, under a covering letter from Mr. L. J. van den Bergh, the general secretary. This is what Mr. Van den Bergh wrote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir, In consequence of a report in the <i>Pretoria News</i> of 28th January, 1970, in which an account is given of a speech made in Hercules the previous evening by Mr. G. A. Beetge, my committee has instructed me to inform you that Mr. Beetge was speaking on his own behalf and not on behalf of the right-wing trade union movement. My committee does not agree with him that work reservation is political deceit.</block>

<p>That is apparently what Mr. Beetge had said. The letter continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the contrary, my committee is satisfied that work reservation determinations have in fact prevented certain industries from becoming completely Black.</block>

<p>He then goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My committee is also extremely unhappy about Mr. Beetge&#x2019;s interpretation of the events concerning Republic Day. Mr. Fouch&#x00E9; and Mr. Ferreira, who were also members of the deputation who came to see you, do not agree that he has presented the factual position, and my committee feels extremely unhappy that a matter which can be regarded as having been closed, is now being dragged into party politics. The assertion that you replied to the letter of the Co-ordinating Council because the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union threatened to strike, is also rejected by my committee with contempt. My head committee has instructed me to convey to you its sincere thanks for the assurance you have already given the Coordinating Council deputation, i.e. that the Cabinet will during 1971 give favourable consideration to declaring Republic Day to be a paid holiday with effect from 1972.</block>

<p>Let us just see how loyal these people are who take truth as their foundation-stone. I have here an extract from a letter written on 16th September, 1969, to the general secretary of the National Party, Mr. Steyl, by the candidate in Vereeniging, a certain Mr. Mills. On 16th September he wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to make it clear here that I have absolute confidence in the leadership of Adv. Vorster. I know that as long as he is Prime Minister there will be no complications and that he will solve all problems effectively in the interests of South Africa,</block>

<p>Now he is establishing a party to protest against me, while on 16th September he was oozing loyalty. Let us now consider for a moment the origin of the Herstigte Nasionale Party. I think the story must now be told. It had its origin in the establishment of certain conservative study groups in Pretoria which were established around the hon. member for Ermelo and the hon. member for Innesdal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we shall find out in a moment whether I am talking nonsense. Hon: members established that conservative study group and out of it this party was born. I shall present him with proof of this across the floor of this House in a moment. According to Mr. Robert van Tonder, in his booklet <i>Die stryd duur voort,</i> that conservative study group decided to put up one candidate in 1966. That was the candidate in Prinshof, a certain Mr. Botha, whom they went to fetch in Waterberg. The conservative study group adopted the attitude that they were the Strydom men and that one must return to Strydom. That is also the reason why they published the booklet entitled <i>Die stryd duur voort.</i> Robert van Tonder states that they chose that constituency deliberately. This is interesting if one looks at the 1966 election. All the constituencies in Pretoria, all of which the National Party opposed, were opposed by either the United Party or the Van der Merwe party. In the case of Prinshof it was the Conservative National Party candidate, and there was only one unopposed constituency in the whole of Pretoria, and that was Innesdal.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us now go further and take a look at this Mr. Van Ton-der. He played a particularly important part in the Herstigte Nasionale Party, for at their congress he gave them R1,000 and he was led on to the stage. He is a prominent member of the H.N.P. I want to charge the Leader with their standpoint in regard to immigration having been prescribed by Robert van Tonder, because Robert van Tonder had already written the following against Dr. Verwoerd on page 90 of his booklet which was written in 1966 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the commencement of his regime Mr. Vorster had the sympathy of all Afrikaners. It was realized that he was not responsible for the immigration dilemma and that he had inherited it from Dr. Verwoerd.</block>

<p>This is a man who is a prominent member and who eventually will probably become a candidate of theirs as well. But listen further. The reproach is now being levelled at me that I have suddenly become like General Botha, according to those members. This is not the first time that this reproach has been levelled at me. This reproach was levelled at me on page 139 of Robert Van Tonder&#x2019;s book. Just listen to this. He wrote, with the approval of the hon. member for Innesdal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The truth of the matter is, however, that our leaders are no longer on the road followed by President Steyn, President Kruger, Dr. Malan and Adv. Strydom.</block>

<p>Soon he will probably be adding Albert Hertzog and Jaap Marais as well.</p>

<p>They are on the road followed by Thomas Francois Burger, Piet Joubert, Louis Botha, Jan Smuts, the Hertzog of the Coalition years and the post-1961 Dr. Verword.</p>

<p>But now we come to the language question, and then I will have finished dealing with these hon. members. It is worthy of note, and we are all aware of this, that they had before their congress a constitution which was not written in one language only; at that stage they still adhered to the National Party&#x2019;s standpoint of having two official languages. The man who rose to his feet there and suggested that they should reconsider this matter, was none other than this Robert van Tonder. He moved the motion. It was stated at that congress&#x2014;I think by the hon. member for Innesdal or by Jan Jooste&#x2014;that their head committee would consider this matter. They did consider the matter. Then they adopted the attitude that there should be only one official language. Mr. Van Tonder was able to exercise that influence because this booklet of his was financed and published by the Conservative Study Group since they were in collusion in regard to this matter and because, it is not unfair to deduce, the hon. member for Ermelo could afford the printing cost of this booklet, for Robert van Tonder did not have the money. This is what he wrote on page 146&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The preservation of the Afrikaner people can only be guaranteed by forceful political action. South Africa will have one language, and possibly much sooner than we think. But it will be a hard struggle, and provided the National Party bethinks itself in time, a titanic struggle between Afrikaner and Afrikaner.</block>

<p>This Robert van Tonder wrote as far back as 1966. That is why he was able to exercise this influence of which there is evidence here. Since I am now discussing how these gentlemen made their about-face in respect of immigration, how they made their about-face in respect of all the policies of the National Party, I just want to say the following in passing to the hon. member for Ermelo. In the months which lie ahead he is going to discover one thing: It is one thing to intrigue in the dark, but it is a different matter to fight out in the open.</p>

<p>But since we have now mentioned immigration, I should like to reply to the accusation made by the hon. member for Yeoville in that connection and to the questions he put to me. This is of course an old story of the United Party and their allies. They support each other very staunchly now as far as this story is concerned. We have allegedly taken over the United Party&#x2019;s policy. Again it is an accusation which the hon. member does not level at me alone. That accusation was levelled at my predecessors, as the hon. member will recall. Could he perhaps inform me how many times he has done so already?</p>

<p>Very well then, we are coming to that. But the hon. member put certain questions to me in regard to immigration. I should just like to read to the hon. member what was said in this Parliament on 5th February, 1965 (Hansard, column 622) by <span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0236"/>the late Dr. Verwoerd when the same point was raised. Dr. Verwoerd then said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I said that at a time when there was no economic growth it would be foolish to have large-scale immigration because the available housing, food production and opportunities for employment did not allow of it.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Still absolute nonsense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us go back to 1948. Then there was no food and no houses either. Does the hon. member for Yeoville not recall how he and I had to sift will through silk stockings <b>in</b> order to make white bread? After all, the hon. member knows this. Dr. Verwoerd also said at the time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I said that, but I said it at the correct time when it had to be said. But I also said something further. I emphasized that it would be wrong for a country to allow immigrants to enter whilst there were sharp political clashes in the country between those who wanted to maintain imperialism and those, on the other hand, who wanted to bring about a republic. The immigrants would then have joined the one group or the other and would have played their part in the struggle of the country to become independent. That would have been harmful to the country as well as to themselves. I therefore said at the time that the time for extensive immigration would come only when South Africa was a republic, because then the immigrants could be absorbed into one nation with one allegiance and one fatherland only. I said that, and I was correct in saying so. When we became a republic, and when we left the Commonwealth, so that the idea of being swamped could not be realized any longer, and when the wave of prosperity was approaching, so that we knew there would no longer be unemployment but a need for workers, and when our food production in the meantime had caught up with the shortages because of our agricultural development, we said: Now is the time to accelerate the pace; now is the time when immigrants will be able to make a living and can be absorbed and become part of the nation.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo would do well to listen to this sentence, i.e. that immigrants should become part of the nation. After all, it is this hon. member who makes unjust and unfair attacks on immigrants who cannot speak for themselves. These are people who are coming to South Africa in the hour of its need to stand by the Whites here. I shall read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was a consistent immigration policy which kept pace with changing circumstances. I am not ashamed of having said all this previously. It was at all times the correct application of this same policy of bringing skilled people into the country to contribute towards the increasing prosperity. No other test in regard to immigration is wise or sound in any country. I can therefore tell hon. members opposite that that is the yardstick by which we should be tested, viz. whether the Government at every stage knew what was the right thing to do then in regard to that aspect of our population problem.</block>

<p>To-day that is still my reply to the hon. member for Yeoville. Yesterday evening I also gave my reply to the hon. member in regard to the pension scheme. I then told the hon. member that his side of the House did not see their way clear to accepting it. In addition I want to tell the hon. member that when I was Deputy Minister of Social Welfare an official who was particularly sympathetic towards this idea was sent abroad by us to institute a thorough investigation. This person, who was sympathetic towards this idea when he left here, returned and told us, after he had examined the systems overseas, that that system would not be suitable for South Africa. I still believe that to-day.</p>

<p>I now want to discuss a related matter. We must not make reckless promises. I realize that if one does not have a policy one has to make promises. I am human enough to understand that. However, we must not make reckless promises which we cannot keep. We must not undermine the spirit and morale of our people. We must not set foot on the road to a welfare state, something which has already been introduced in Britain and other countries. Let us please at all times refrain from damaging the self-respect of our people. Let us rather encourage it. Reference was also made here to a medical scheme. The Minister charged with that matter explained the circumstances very clearly to that hon. member the other day. Either he was not present in the House, or he did not listen. The hon. the Minister told him that the number of beneficiaries at present totalled 2,156,000. After all, those are the lines along which we have developed, which we should encourage. Those are the lines along which we should develop. However, the United Party have never on any occasion even made a study or a test of what the costs would be in respect of those matters if the State were to undertake them. They have never gone into the question of whether the necessary manpower will be available. But what is more, they have never yet given one iota of attention to what this will do to the spirit of our people. These are aspects one should take into consideration before making reckless promises in this connection.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the next charge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled at the Government and which he has given as a reason why there should not be any confidence in us. The hon. the Leader stated accusingly <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0237"/>that it was no longer possible to go along with this Government because it had become high-handed, because it had become arrogant. I should like to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Surely he was acquainted with his former Government, not so? Can his tell me whether he knows of any government which is more accessible to all sectors of the public and to all people than this Government and its Ministers. I can speak from experience. I have been in this position for many years. A man who has a case is never too unimportant or his position too humble to request an interview with one of us and to consult us on the matter; but what is more, we mingle with our people, we live together with our people. In that lies the strength of the National Party. That is why we are sitting here. I now want to link up the attack by the hon. member for Newton Park on the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs with this. Because I am mindful of these matters and must take note of them, I now want to address a specific question across the floor of this House to the hon. member for Newton Park and ask him whether he wants to allege, directly or by insinuation, that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has done anything immoral or irregular, or that he was guilty of improper conduct</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that I have received a reply now, because now I can state my own case. We need not argue about whether it was wise or whether it was unwise to do so. That is not the point at issue. However, I want to make it very clear that there was nothing irregular and nothing unworthy in the conduct of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. The Land Bank is a business institution to which all farmers can turn for long-term mortgage financing and longterm loan financing. Many farmers avail themselves of its services. In all fairness and for the sake of the record I must say that Ministers of previous governments made use of those facilities just as Mr. Haak made use of them in this case. And all those Ministers who made use of those facilities were honourable men. I am not making any insinuations against them; there was nothing wrong in what they did. Sitting in this House, probably on both sides, are members who have Land Bank mortgages. I know of members on the opposite side of the House who have obtained such mortgages. There is nothing dishonourable in connection with that. I do not want to bandy those hon. member&#x2019;s names across the floor of the House. It is not in my nature to do so. I am simply mentioning the fact and saying in addition that there is nothing dishonourable in connection with that. What is the position now? The position is that Minister Haak purchased a farm. He did not purchase it for himself, but for his minor son, who is at present an agricultural student and who intends to farm on it. That farm would have been registered in his name, because it is not possible to have it registered in a minor&#x2019;s name. But one cannot have a mortgage registered in a minor&#x2019;s name. And if it had not been for that fact the farm would have been registered in the name of Minister Haak&#x2019;s son, an agricultural student. He obtained the loan as the hon. member stated here, in the same way as members of the House of Assembly sitting on that side of the House have obtained loans from the Land Bank and in the same way as any farmer is free to apply to the Land Bank with a view to subsidies on dams, etc. There is nothing dishonourable whatsoever in connection with that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether he cannot recall that my point was that a loan of R118,000 had been granted here on the purchase price of R149,000. while the Land Bank Act stipulates very clearly that it should be the fair value of that land. How is it possible in this case that the fair value corresponds with the purchase price of R149,000?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can answer that question very easily for the hon. member. The <span class="col_451-452" refersTo="page_0238"/>valuation which the Land Bank made of that property, gave the value as R150,000. On that R150,000 they were entitled to grant the Minister a bond of R120,000. However, they gave him less, i.e. R118,000. Those are the facts of the case. Surely the hon. member knows that the amount is determined according to the value of the property as determined by the Land Bank. I have been informed by the Land Bank that, with due observance of their stated policy and principles, no bond has been refused during recent years owing to a lack of money, not in cases where the conditions of the Land Bank and its policy were complied with. The hon. member knows this, and he is in agreement with it. The reason why the hon. member raised this matter here was in order to start a gossip campaign against the Minister.</p>

<p>There we get the insinuation from the hon. member, in spite of the explanation I have furnished here. That is typical of him. He will still go and exploit this matter. I want to make it very clear now that, as far as the Minister of Economic Affairs is concerned, I have every confidence in him, not only as an able Minister, as far as handling his portfolio is concerned, but also in his integrity. I have every confidence that he was not a party to anything unworthy, and I have confidence that he was not a party to anything improper. If he had been a party to anything of this nature, I would not have hesitated for a moment to terminate his membership of this Cabinet. Let us understand one another very clearly in regard to this matter. I find it reprehensible that such a matter was dealt with in this manner. I have discussed the matter with the Minister. Regardless of how difficult it may now be for him, in view of the fact that hon. members on that side of the House will exploit this matter recklessly for their own miserable political gain in order to catch a few votes in this way, he now feels that he must endeavour in the coming months to make other arrangements in this connection and to redeem the bond so that this gossiping can come to an end. He is doing this because he, in the same way as I am, is concerned at the level to which our public life is descending. I now want to say to some members of the Opposition, not all&#x2014;I want to say this at once&#x2014; and also to all four members of the Hertzog Party that as far as I am concerned, if there is one matter on which we are fighting this election, we are fighting it on political decency in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. member hurled eggs and tomatoes in the days when it still suited him to do so. As far as this aspect is concerned, I want to conclude by informing the hon. members that I find nothing dishonourable and nothing irregular in connection with the conduct of the hon. the Minister. I appreciate the fact that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has taken that decision which I have conveyed to you.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with this point. I just want to furnish hon. members with some information in regard to the Land Bank. At the end of last year the Land Bank had mortgages on farm properties to the value of R228 million. Long-term loans to farmers to the value of R8.4 million were outstanding. Long-term loans to co-operative societies for the purpose of helping farmers, amounted to R55.5 million. The total, therefore, is R292 million. These are funds which the Land Bank found and which the government made available to it for the purpose of helping the farmers of South Africa. But I want to tell hon. members that the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of finance&#x2014;these two in particular&#x2014;other Cabinet members and I are mindful of the fact that we are entering a phase where more has to be done in this regard than this amount of R292 million which we have already made available, and that is why I want to make this announcement to-day. Deeply conscious of the growing dimensions of the need of the agricultural industry for adapted financing owing to oppressive drought conditions on the one hand and, on the other hand, fluctuating economic factors, the government is giving consideration to the appropriation of sufficient loan funds to the Land Bank from the Treasury in the course of the next few years so as to enable the bank to expand its financing programme to such an extent that all the reasonable needs of the farmer in respect of long-term mortgages on farms at a reasonable rate of interest may be met according to the merits of the circumstances of each case. This is the policy for the future. This is an aspect of policy which I discussed <span class="col_453-454" refersTo="page_0239"/>the year before last and especially last year with agricultural leaders and, in particular, with the Ministers of Agriculture and Finance.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member has asked me the customary questions in regard to the Bantu policy. I want to tell the hon. member at once that the questions he asked me on the economic development of the Bantu areas and related matters, are questions to which I furnished full replies last year, just as my predecessors had furnished full replies. My colleague the Minister of Bantu Administration furnished full replies this year. But if this is not enough for the hon. member, I want to tell him that recently two excellent papers by highly capable officials, i.e. Dr. Rieckert and Dr. Rautenbach, were read on this matter, and I shall furnish the hon. the Leader of the Opposition with copies of those papers.</p>

But I say that in so far as it is pertinent he has in this debate received his full reply from the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. The hon. the Leader only made one mistake, i.e. he proceeded on the false premise that in the year 2000 the number of Bantu would be between 36 and 40 million.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to tell you that the highest responsible estimate which was made in that regard and which I have been able to find, was that there would be 7 million Whites, 5 million Coloureds, 1 million Asiatics and 27 million Bantu. [Interjections.] I am not involved in the argument between you and the Deputy Minister. I am merely furnishing the facts of the matter as I have been able to ascertain them.</p>

<p>I now want to debate with the hon. member for the umpteenth time. I now want to argue the question of political representation with the hon. member for the umpteenth time. We have discussed it in this House before. For the purposes of my argument I now want to accept that the United Party&#x2019;s policy is to introduce white representation for the Bantu and for the Indians. I want to accept that <i>in toto,</i> and then I first just want to point out in passing that in that regard the hon. member immediately dragged in the matter of Lesotho to warn against our development of independent Bantu states which will eventually come into being. He tried to scare the electorate with the development that has occurred in Lesotho. He has already received the answer, but I am merely touching on it here. In the first place, it is after all a fact that we are preparing our black people much better than the British prepared theirs for becoming independent. In the second place, we did not throw away the old and introduce something new. We retained the good features in the old and incorporated them in the constitution, i.e. the system of chiefs. In the third place&#x2014;and this is very important in view of what has happened in Lesotho&#x2014;we stamped out communism, not only in our territory, but also in theirs. We shall to an increasing extent be prepared for it and stamp it out, wherever it may rear its head, and this is something the Britons did not do in Lesotho or in any of their other territories. Now this question has arisen, i.e. what is our relationship with Lesotho? I want to tell you, Sir, that our relationship with Lesotho is exactly the same as it is with Rhodesia. We are simply carrying on as though nothing has happened. Lesotho is a neighbouring state of ours. We do not interfere with them. We do not dictate to them. We have no hand in their decisions. But it is a neighbouring state with which we have to negotiate, and as far as we are concerned, Chief Jonathan is in effective control of that neighbouring state and we shall continue our negotiations with him as if in fact nothing has happened in Lesotho.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>That is official recognition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Official recognition or not. official recognition simply plays no part, just as little as it did in regard to Rhodesia. It is merely a question of our continuing as if nothing has happened. We have our specific relations with them and we are continuing with those specific relations. And as far as his state of emergency is concerned, he has furnished his reasons for that, i.e. that it was on account of communist subversion that he had to take this step. And that is his business. What I know about the B.C.P., compels me to agree with Chief Jonathan that it is a communist, subversive influence, for the Leader of the Opposition was a Peking communist, and this has been proved time and again in the past.</p>

<p>I say we are now coming to the cardinal point, the difference between the United Party&#x2019;s policy on the one hand and our policy on the other, its policy of introducing into this Parliament the friction factor of colour representation, <span class="col_455-456" refersTo="page_0240"/>and my policy of eliminating that level of friction. Was it not specifically on that very point that the hon. member for Umlazi felt called upon to join the National Party? And to-day, on the eve of the election, I want to put this to the hon. member once again&#x2014; and I also want to argue this matter with the hon. member for Yeoville. Their standpoint and their policy of introducing that colour factor into this Parliament will lead to friction for which we shall pay very dearly in South Africa. But I also want to tell him this. I want to argue that it is dangerous to introduce into this Parliament the representation of Bantu by Bantu. I take it that the hon. member agrees with me that it is dangerous to introduce them here. [Interjections.] I do not want to ask the hon. member a catch question; I merely want to argue this point. Is it dangerous to introduce them, yes or no?</p>

Let us accept that we have at last succeeded in making him say that it is undesirable. But if it is undesirable, then, surely, it is folly to act in such a way that it may become possible; surely, then it would be extreme folly to create machinery which is going to make for precisely that undesirable state of affairs. Why then create the machinery which would make it possible for that undesirable state of affairs to occur? This is not a question of what I say. I am now going to quote hon. members on that side in order to prove that they themselves are saying that this undesirable state of affairs is in fact going to occur. I am not going to argue about it with the hon. member, but I am merely quoting for the sake of the record what he said on the B.B.C.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our Leader, Sir De Villiers Graaff, stated very clearly that whereas on our election we will give the black people of this country representation in Parliament by white people, he accepts and we all accept that that is not a permanent situation, that it will change and that future Parliaments will allow black people to come into Parliament.</block>

<p>In principle they are bringing about that undesirable state of affairs which they do not want, for they are saying to the Bantu: &#x201C;You are entitled to being represented here in principle; you can come here.&#x201D; Surely, then the next step would be that he would tell you. &#x201C;I want to be represented by my own people,&#x201D; and by implication you are conceding that this is exactly what will happen. On a subsequent occasion&#x2014;and I want to place this on record as well&#x2014;this matter was argued with you once again. At that time you joined issue with the Deputy Minister and you said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He alleged that I had said that if we should come into power, the Bantu would be represented in Parliament by Whites, and subsequent to that I said in reply to a specific question that I accepted that in the course of time Parliament would allow Bantu to be represented in Parliament by Bantu. This is the gist of it. Sir, I said that and I believe that it will happen.</block>

<p>This is what you are holding up to us for the future; you believe that this will happen, but you are not merely resigning yourself to the belief that it will happen; you are opening the door so that it may in fact happen. This is what you are doing to South Africa. You now admit that it is undesirable to do this. I shall go further than that; I say that it is dangerous to do so, but you are opening the door to what you admit is undesirable. But, surely, you yourselves know&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also said this&#x2014;that Bantu will be represented here by Bantu, and he says he said it because he was under pressure at the time. After all, we had that argument here across the floor of the House. The greater the pressure, the blacker the representation becomes; we have had that admission from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition. But, Sir, we need not stop at them only.</p>

He has not yet issued a statement to the effect that I have the right to do so, but I am going to appropriate that right to myself. On 14th November, 1969, the hon. member for Durban (North) had a question-and-answer interview with the <i>Natal Mercury.</i> Questions were put to the hon. member in regard to these matters.

<block name="quote">There are barriers which the white manual labourers are trying to maintain at work and in the social and political spheres. The majority of them approve of job reservation.</block>

<p>This is the finding he arrived at after making a scientific study of the matter. But let us now look at the kind of Bantu policy pursued by the hon. member for Hillbrow, who is the candidates committee in the Transvaal at present. This is the committee which ousted the hon. member for Kensington in order to bring the political correspondent of the Progressives into this House. I find it interesting that it should in fact be George Oliver who has been made a candidate by the hon. member for Hillbrow, because the member for Hillbrow is searching for allies who share his views. I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the hon. member for Hillbrow does not endorse his policy. This is an interesting book. I do not know who of you have had the time to read this little book. This member made a penetrating study of politics in South Africa before becoming a member of this House.

<block name="quote">What we &#x2026;</block>

<p>The &#x201C;we&#x201D; refers to the authors, but now it also refers to the United Party, of which he forms part. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What we therefore envisage is a third chamber in the system of government in South Africa, a chamber in which the Natives will have direct representation by their own representatives. After all is said and done, there is a good South African precedent for such a body. Did President <b>Kruger</b> not create a second legislative assembly; <b><i>(Volksraad)</i> under circumstances which did</b> not differ much from the present ones?</block>

<p>I shall now skip two paragraphs, and then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is the way it can work: a third legislative chamber, a second House or Bunga for the Bantu, or whatever it may be called, ought to be created. This will become a Parliament for the Natives living outside the autonomous Bantu homelands, and they will elect their own representatives in that body.</block>

Botha was the Minister, and they have continued to improve after Mr. Marais Viljoen took over from him. I am very grateful for that. We established the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. We provided the Coloureds with business enterprises in their own areas and made it possible for them to develop.

<p>Yes, I know that. In this connection, discussions were held between the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and myself. We went into this matter. In this connection, discussions were also held by me with the Leader of the Cape Province and with the Executive Committee of the Cape Province. I think it would be much better if I submitted the letters I received in this connection, arising from those discussions, to hon. members so that they may deduce precisely from that what the standpoint is and what is going to happen in the future. I want to say immediately that it has a negative aspect on the one hand, but on the other hand&#x2014;and this is the side which carries the most weight&#x2014;it has an exceptionally positive aspect which holds great benefit for the Coloured population, not only of the Cape Province, but of the other provinces as well. After the interviews in his connection, the Administrator wrote to me as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am writing with reference to the discussion which four members of the Executive Committee had with you on 30th January, but which I unfortunately could not attend, and the previous discussions about the question of mixed local authorities which Mr. F. J. Conradie, M.E.C., held with the Cabinet members concerned. The Executive Committee has now thoroughly considered the matter of accelerating the progress in the Coloured people in the field of local government and together with this the switch-over to the parliamentary voters&#x2019; roll for the election of councillors of all white local authorities, and has decided to accord its full support to the Government&#x2019;s approach concerning such accelerated progress, as well as to the proposed investigation in connection with it. The Executive Committee accepts the principle of switching over to the parliamentary voters&#x2019; roll for the election of white local authorities, with suitable adjustments in the light of the Cape Province&#x2019;s special circumstances as discussed by you with the members of the Executive Committee. I have now also requested the Director of Local Government to submit my proposals in this connection to the Executive Committee as soon as possible for their consideration. As the switch-over to the parliamentary voters&#x2019; roll will, <i>inter alia,</i> result in the disfranchisement of the non-White voters, its implementation will have to be coupled with the introduction of a positive role for the non-Whites, and the Coloureds in particular, in the field of local government. Because it is not regarded as desirable that a general election should again take place on the basis of a mixed voters&#x2019; roll, the Executive Committee has furthermore decided that immediate steps be taken for legislation in terms of which the general election due to be held in September, 1970, under the existing ordinance will be postponed to September, 1970, to be introduced in the Provincial Council at the earliest opportunity.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is no bomb, but a consistent application of our policy. I want to read the letter which I received from the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council to the House (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council Act, Act No. 49 of 1964, makes provision in section 17 for, <i>inter alia,</i> the administration of local government matters in respect of the Coloured areas by the <span class="col_463-464" refersTo="page_0244"/>Executive Committee. As you know, local government powers are at present in the hands of white local authorities, who perform their functions in terms of various provincial ordinances under the control of the Provincial Administration. In 1963 legislation was in fact passed by all four provincial councils to make provision for the establishment of consulting and management committees for Coloured group areas as a preparatory step and at a later stage, for full-fledged local authorities. A number of such committees have already been established throughout the Republic, but owing to a variety of reasons autonomous local authorities have not yet been established for Coloured group areas. The control and administration of Coloured areas is therefore still in the hands of white local authorities, while the Coloured people&#x2019;s share therein is insignificant. The fact that Coloured persons in the Cape Province do have limited voting powers in municipal and divisional council elections is an impediment rather than an advantage in our endeavour to lead Coloured areas to independence. As a matter of fact, this causes so much friction and enmity on the part of both the white and the Coloured groups that it is in the common interest to terminate this doubtful privilege with the least delay. In view of the policy of the Government to create all possible opportunities for the parallel development of the Coloured population group into independent communities, <i>inter alia,</i> in the field of local government, and particularly in view of the objectives which the former Prime Minister, the late Dr. Verwoerd, announced in his speech to the Union Coloured Council in 1959, i.e. that within 10 years the Coloured people would have full control over their towns and cities, I wish to appeal to you humbly and yet in all seriousness to apply this policy consistently on the local government level as well. This would of course mean that the control of local government would be directly integrated with the functions and activities of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and its executive committee. I am convinced that the existing dual control is obsolete and that it is in the interest of all sections of the community that the creation of the necessary machinery for these powers to be taken over by the Coloured Council and the implementation of this plan should take place with the least delay.</block>

<block name="quote">Your kind attention to this request will be highly appreciated.</block>

<p>This letter comes from the chairman. Mr. Tom Swartz. Discussions have been held by me. I have informed myself in this connection. The hon. member sitting over there knows that in Kimberley and other places that friction is building up. It is building up and it is leading to unpleasantness. It is leading to disturbances in race relations which should not be there. I am very grateful that all parties concerned in this matter &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member is not aware of it, it is time he sensed it or that he asked the hon. member for Kimberley, who is well informed in this regard, about it. This friction must be eliminated. The Coloured people themselves admit that there is friction. The Whites know that it is there. I am doing this not only, and I want to repeat it now, to eliminate an additional level of friction, but I want to do it because it is consistent policy to do it in this way. I want to do it because in terms of the policy of separate development it will create chances and opportunities for the Coloured people which they have not had before. From this it becomes clear what the future planning in this connection will be. I said on a previous occasion that I was busy laying foundations. I want to repeat: I do not know what the final solution will be and where the road will end, but I am constantly indicating the road, that the Coloured people should proceed along their own course and the Whites along their own course and that they can confer to and fro with one another on a friendly basis on their respective courses.</p>

<p>The National Party, and I shall conclude with this, has governed South Africa for 21 years. The Leader of the Opposition adopts the attitude that he has no confidence in this party. I wish to make the assertion that this party, after 21 years, after problems of boycotts and undermining, after it has had to deal with enmity and misunderstanding such as no other party has ever had to deal with, has led South Africa to great heights. South Africa to-day stands as a healthy state for everyone to see. We are envied by many other countries in the world because we can display South Africa like this, as it really is. Just look how it has grown. If one looks at the growth rate over the decades, one will see that there was an average growth of 4 per cent from 1917 to 1937. As a result of the circumstances which arose later, it dropped to below 4 per cent during the decade from 1937 to 1947. But from 1950 it started rising. In that decade the growth rate was 5 per cent, and in the decade of the sixties it was 6 per cent. Look at the growth rate of other countries. One need not even look at comparable countries. One may look at countries which in other respects were in a better position than South Africa. Sir, we have built up a strong South Africa under difficult circumstances in the years which have passed. We have built up a South Africa in which there is peace in the field of labour. To-day we have a Republic in which racial peace prevails. We have a Republic with a standard of living which ranks among the highest in the world. We have a Republic which is growing as no other country is growing. But what is more, in the midst of all <span class="col_465-466" refersTo="page_0245"/>the enmity existing in the world we have a Republic which, thanks to the course of action we have followed, is safe. The time of spectacular events in the political life of South Africa is past. All that lies ahead for us is hard work. The matter of race relations is one of the most delicate which South Africa will ever have to deal with, on account of the numerical ratios which I mentioned here to-day. I appeal to the old guard Who established the Republic and I appeal to the young people who ask &#x201C;What must we live for?&#x2019; and I say that there is nothing more challenging, more beautiful and liner than working for the preservation of the Republic of South Africa. I call upon the young people of this nation, and also the people who established this Republic; to support and protect it. I want to conclude by saying that the Republic of South Africa and its interests are safe only in the hands of the National Party.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the whole course of this debate, I think, he, made it perfectly clear that there is only one real reason for this election, namely because of the difficulties that have arisen between the hon. the Prime Minister and certain of his former colleagues. It has shown quite clearly that this election has been called to settle those differences and it has shown quite clearly that the machinery of State is in fact to be used to wash and iron the dirty linen of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>It is difficult to sum up this debate, because so much of it has been devoted to action between the hon. the Prime Minister and his former followers. I can only say that if I had been the referee in the fight I think I would have disqualified them both. I think I would have recommended that the Nationalist Party, because of its former record of resorting to tomatoes and eggs at public meetings, should be suspended for the future. It is no aid to an intelligent solution to the problems of South Africa. In so far as one has been able to follow this dispute it has been an unsavoury and unpleasant fight, which I do not believe has advanced the prestige of Parliament or the interests of the people of South Africa. Having listened to it all in the course of these five days, all I can say is: A plague on both the houses of the two parties concerned. The arguments on both sides seem to me to be singularly unimpressive and notable for their ferocity and invective rather than for their logic. In some respects the Herstigte Nasionale Party seemed to be left behind in the thinking of the Nationalist Party. In others they seem to show a very much keener appreciation of the dangers with which South Africa is faced under the policies of this Government. They certainly have a very real appreciation of the dangers of the application of what is known as the B O.S.S. clauses and also a very much keener appreciation of the dangers involved in the dictatorial ideas of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>We have had the usual sanctimonious protestations on national unity from the Nationalist Party and we have had them thrown in the face of the Herstigte Nasionale Party. We have had the Leader of the Herstigte Nasionale Party reminded of his own difficulties with his own father. The one thing that was never mentioned during the course of this debate was the manner in which this Nationalist Party treated the late General Hertzog himself on this very subject of national unity. There are some of us who remember why this hon. gentleman left the Free State Congress of the Nationalist Party during the war years. We remember with what contempt the late Dr. Verwoerd wrote in the <i>Transvaler</i> that he had left the congress over the rights of the English, and saying he could hardly understand it. One remembers how it was over the dispute as to whether they should guarantee the political rights or also the language rights of the English-speaking people in South Africa. I am not surprised to find there are people in the Herstigte Nasionale Party who still have the ideas the Nationalist Party had in those days. They cannot deny it. That was their policy. They have come a long way since then. I am very glad to see it. However, they have still not come far enough to be able to say that they are achieving anything like real national unity in South Africa. I have said before and I say again what they stand for is co-operation on terms, not real national unity. I have said before too it does not surprise me that their terms tend to prove more and more unacceptable to English-speaking people who have had any experience inside the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>It seems to me there are similar contradictions and obscurities in their setting out of the story in respect of their sports policy. This directive which was given to Mr. Orchard, our representative in New Zealand when he was here on leave before the All Black rugby team was due to come to South Africa, is something that we are hearing about since this dispute started for the first time. One wonders whether that mandate to Mr. Orchard embraced a full-blooded Maori or only people with Maori blood. One wonders that if it did embrace a full-blooded Maori, why it was that the tour was cancelled?</p>

<p>Oh yes. If there is this confusion of which the hon. the Prime Minister talks why was there no clear statement at the time setting out the position? It seems to me without any doubt that the Government would be better advised to admit that they were wrong in their policy and that they have changed this policy. What possible harm could it do to South Africa for that admission to be made? It would certainly create a better impression inside South Africa and especially outside South Africa. It could make this policy of real value for South Africa. It would make the position so much easier, for members like the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) who spoke so strongly against Maoris being allowed to come to South Africa in a touring team. Now that he finds his seat is in danger, he is finding himself in support of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>From this discussion two points emerge which I think are of national importance. These are points which I want to put pertinently to the Prime Minister. The first is that in the course of this debate this dispute between the Prime Minister and his former colleagues, the hon. member for Innesdal produced either an original document or a copy of an original document which appeared to have been top secret. The authenticity of that document has in no way been denied.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. Minister does not make it difficult for me to argue because there is hardly a civilized country in the world where it is not taking place in some form or other under some control or other. The hon. the Prime Minister knows it.</p>

<p>When I introduced this motion I raised six main issues. The first of these was the failure of the Bantu policy of the present Government. I want to say that when I dealt with that matter, I placed certain figures before this House, figures as to what I expected the number of Bantu to be which will have to be moved from year to year if the policy were to achieve any sort of success. The first contradiction has come in respect of those figures. It has come from the hon. the Prime Minister. I may say that I find it difficult to accept that he does not know of other figures published in newspapers of which Ministers in his Cabinet are directors. I find it difficult to accept that he does not know of the forecasts which were apparently made by the hon. the Deputy Minister in which he accepts very much higher figures. Accepting the hon. Prime Minister is right, there still is to be such a movement of Bantu from the white areas to the homelands if anything like the success they hope to achieve, is to be achieved that the whole policy is entirely impracticable. I want to say to the hon. gentleman and all members on that side of the House that if you have a policy of which the central element is to reduce and not to limit the number of Bantu in the white areas and it is manifest for everybody to see that you are failing despite all the possible and impossible steps which were outlined by the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the time has come not to find an excuse for the failure of your implementation of the policy, but to look into the practicability of the policy itself. When that is done, when one tests the claims in the direction of success by Ministers on the Government side, then the figures given by the hon. Deputy Minister are too pathetic even to worry about. These claims are pathetic in the light of estimates by trained economists of what will have to be done by way of job opportunities in the reserves. They come here and say that they are making real progress. They base this on the hope that in the next five years they will provide jobs in the reserves for 5,000 Bantu. In the light of the vast numbers involved, this is so laughable that it is not even worthwhile having regard to it. Nothing, absolutely nothing the hon. Minister has said has shown that this policy is practicable or can ever be made practicable. I want to say to the hon. gentlemen opposite that it is reprehensible enough to mislead the public as they have done with this policy, but when they mislead themselves as they are doing at the moment with their belief of possible success for this policy, then they are heading for a crash, a crisis which can be disastrous to South Africa. When you have a policy which has failed, you have to start looking for a practicable alternative. The Minister suggests that the only practicable alternative is complete integration. He says that he knows of no middle course. It is most significant: While they say when you deal with the Bantu there is no middle course at all, there can only be complete segregation or complete integration, they suddenly find there is a middle course, namely parallel development, when it comes to the Coloured people. They know they put the Coloureds on the first step of the ladder in that direction, but they do not know where it is going or where it is going to end, but they concede it is a different policy. I want to suggest to the hon. the Prime Minister that it is high time he came down off his ivory tower and that he got down to the realities of the situation and tried to find a practical solution. I want to say that if he cannot find a practical solution, the sooner he makes way for people who have a practical solution the better for South Africa. After all, what is his policy doing? His policy is slowing up development all over South Africa; it is slowing down the rate of growth. It is acting as a clog on efficiency and it is endangering the whole <span class="col_471-472" refersTo="page_0248"/>future of Western civilization and the future of the white race in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration has issued a challenge to us as to how we shall limit the number of Bantu in the White areas. Sir, why should he challenge me to carry out his policy? It is his policy, with the impracticable ideal of limiting the number of Bantu in the white areas. He is the man who is going to carry it out; he is going to reduce the number. I have told him categorically that we would retain influx control and that there would be development inside the reserves with private white capital and white initiative and skills. I told him I believed that development would be faster than under his Government, and I believe it will be cheaper for the people of South Africa. Not only will it be cheaper and faster, but I believe it will be economically more advantageous to South Africa that we should develop those areas as part of one economic whole, the economy of the whole of South Africa, and not as seven or eight independent little economies which will probably be vying with each other before long.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister still says numbers are not decisive; they do not really matter, but what matters is the basis on which the Bantu are in the white areas. Well, if they are right, then numbers do not matter as far as our policy is concerned, as long as political control is in the hands of the Whites, in civilized hands. Then why should not we withstand the pressure of numbers, if they can withstand the pressure of numbers? The argument cuts both ways.</p>

<p>But there is a dangerous development we have seen in this debate, and that is that the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration is already suggesting that they have gone so far with homeland development that they can never turn back. Nobody can ever turn them back, and sovereign independence is now inevitable.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister seems to be getting a little excited. May I say to him quite categorically that the position then must be worse than I thought it was, and the people of South Africa must be warned that this is the position envisaged by the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Now the hon. gentleman has made great play of the differences between our policy and his policy, and he has made great play of the differences between the British colonial policy and the policy of South Africa in respect of sovereign independent Bantu states. I want to say to him to-day that if he believes that in that way he can avoid the dangers of those sovereign i independent Bantu states, then he is living under a delusion. Then he is not aware of what is happening in the rest of Africa. I listened in the other night to &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; on Radio South Africa, something which to my knowledge is never favourable to my party, but seems to come out with quite a lot that is favourable to the Government. What did I hear? Of something like 30 African states which have gained independence since 1959, in not one has power changed hands peacefully. That was not British colonial policy alone. That was the colonial policy of the metropolitan powers which have been in Africa over the years. Does the hon. gentleman think he is going to avoid that state of affairs? Sir, he is <span class="col_473-474" refersTo="page_0249"/>deluding himself and misleading the people of South Africa. Then he believes that his policy offers greater security for South Africa than the policy of this side of the House, because there is to be representation of non-Whites in this House. But he knows very well that there has been representation of non-Whites in this House before, and the clock did not stop and we did not have a revolution. He also knows that there is no reason whatever why the extent of that representation should not be controlled. The hon. gentleman is trying to suggest that the inevitable result of the policy of this side of the House will not only be Bantu representing Bantu, but greater numbers of Bantu in this House. I want to get it quite clear with the hon. gentleman. It has never been the policy of this side of the House that Bantu be represented by Bantu in this House. It has never been the policy of this side of the House and it is not the policy of this side of the House, and it cannot ever become policy unless a majority of the white voters in South Africa seek it. and I do not believe that they will seek it. The position is perfectly clear. We are giving representation to the Bantu by white people in this House and there will be no change in that policy without a referendum or an election in which that is the issue and it gets the support of the majority of the white voters of South Africa. But the suggestion is continually made by the hon. gentleman that we would change in the light of pressure. That comes ill from that hon. gentleman when his predecessor stated here in Parliament that the policy he is following to-day is not a policy that they would like to follow, that it is not a policy that they wanted to follow but a policy that was inevitably being forced upon them by outside pressure.</p>

Sir, I believe that there is no doubt whatever, when one compares the policies of the two sides, that the policy of this side of the House offers more security for Western civilization here, more security for the future of the white race and more security for good relations between White and non-White in South Africa than this impossible pipe dream of which the hon. the Prime Minister is always talking and which is being proved more and more to be impracticable and impossible of fulfilment. Sir, the hon. gentleman tried to cause further confusion by quoting something that had been written in a book by the hon. member for Hillbrow. I want to ask him whether he is going to take the responsibility for everything that has been said and written by Senator Horwood?</p>

<p>Let me now deal, Sir, with the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister in regard to the Cape Coloured people. He said that the position between Furopean and Coloured was improving and that he disagreed with the hon. member for Peninsula in respect of the relations between Coloured and European. I want to say with tagret that I believe the hon. the Prime Minister is wrong. My own experience is a different one. It seems to me inconceivable that the hon. gentleman can be unaware of the bitterness that has been built up as a result of the actions of his Government, particularly the action of his Minister in the appointments he made to the Coloured Representative Council. But, Sir, the hon. gentleman has gone <span class="col_475-476" refersTo="page_0250"/>further. He has now taken another step which I fear may lead to further friction and further bitterness and that is the decision that in future parliamentary franchise will be applied for municipal and local body elections in South Africa. I am in difficulty at the moment because I do not have clearly from the hon. gentleman what the alternative is that has been placed before these people, and I would like to study those letters before I comment on this any further. But it does seem to me that this holds in it the seeds of further friction and further bitterness between the Coloureds and Europeans of South Africa. It is also quite clear from what the hon. gentleman says that he still has no idea of the end of the road in so far as the Coloured people are concerned.</p>

<p>Sir, the second issue I raised was the question of this Government&#x2019;s failure to deal with the manpower shortage in South Africa. What reply have we had? We had a reply from the Minister of Labour suggesting that the entire manpower shortage was exaggerated and need not really be taken seriously. Sir, I believe he was given authorities by the hon. member for Hillbrow which, to say the least of it, should make him think again. I would say that if the hon. gentleman says there is no manpower shortage in South Africa, he is whistling in the dark and running away from the realities of the situation.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. gentleman will because he knows very well that job reservation has two aspects. One aspect is what is known as the conventional colour bar in South Africa. This in practice amounts to a tacit agreement and some-tines an express agreement between employers and employees that certain spheres of work will be reserved for white workers. That is the South African convention and that is one which we do not propose to abolish and, as I shall show, we will take measures to protect any group of workers against any transgression against the spirit of that convention. The other use of the term &#x201C;work reservation&#x201D; is in respect of the rigid statutory colour bar contained in clause 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act as it has been used by this Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 77 is the clause that gives the Minister the power to reserve occupations either completely or on a percentage basis for Whites or any other race group. It has been operative for about 15 years and it has been proved a farce. Nobody knows that better than the Minister. There have been a few orders reserving various occupations. They affect about 2 per cent of the total labour force in South Africa. Some of these orders, Sir, are quite ridiculous. I do not believe lam wrong when I say that there is one that lays down that only white men can drive the vehicles that remove the night soil of certain races in Durban. Most of these orders have been rendered more or less useless by masses of exemptions granted by the Minister. In practice they have no relation to-day to the reservations originally granted. This clause is seldom used, and when used, it is vitiated by <span class="col_477-478" refersTo="page_0251"/>exemptions until only the shell of prejudice remains. Yet it remains on the Statute Book. It remains a disgrace to South Africa because of the impression it creates in the world outside, namely that we are selfish, intolerant and oppressive. As far as we are concerned, the provisions of clause 77 can and should be repealed.</p>

</speech>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, do not run away. The hon. gentleman knows that I accepted the trade unions as they were before this legislation was introduced. I have never accepted black trade unions for Bantu. The hon. gentleman knows that. The matter is so important that I want to mention a few more thoughts in this regard. The first is that I think we have to face the basic fact that our prosperity, that is our comfort and our way of life, depends on White and non-White working and working together in the interests of South Africa But we have to accept as another basic fact that the Whites are outnumbered by the other racial groups, who are often prepared to accept lower wages in competition with Whites. The danger is there, although one has every sympathy with employers who cannot get Black labour. Their problem is in fact our problem, since our prosperity depends on the success of their business enterprises. We on this side of the House believe that steps must be taken to prevent the abuse of labour, whether it be White or non-White. I am completely confident that businessmen can be assured of all the labour they need, while at the same time the white workers can be properly protected in South Africa. I believe that, with the growth of South Africa, white labour, and particularly trained white labour, can become a very scarce commodity and that we should make the best possible use of the labour force available to us. I believe that that is going to come to pass, provided that this Government accepts our proposals for equipping every white child for the responsibilities of leadership, and for giving every white worker the opportunity to educate and re-educate himself for better jobs. I do not believe that white workers are going to get better jobs or income security by keeping non-Whites out of industry. If he does, he is going to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Black workers get jobs because there are not enough Whites to do the work. When they get those jobs, it very often means that there are better jobs available for the white men, and usually a better type of job as well.</p>

<p>Already the Handelsinstituut is saying that our educational system is 25 years behind the times. Already it is being said that this Government will have to double the amount of money that is being spent on education. Already it is becoming obvious that this Government will have to lend its assistance so that all able white children can be educated to the maximum of their ability, even at universities and institutions of higher learning, whether their parents can afford it or not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask you a question in that regard? Are you aware of the fact that, whereas in 1947 only 17 per cent of Std. VI pupils reach Matric, it is as high as 51 per cent to-day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister is making the suggestion that he has improved the educational system. Yet the Handelsinstituut says that we are still 25 years behind the time. Those may be the facts, but they still reveal the highly unsatisfactory position in South Africa. They still reveal the fact that 49 per cent of those who have passed Std. 6 do not get Matric, and I wonder what percentage gets Std. 6? These are figures that can be put before the public, and be very misleading. I believe that our White population in South Africa is not getting an adequate education. I believe that that is supported by almost every educationist of any knowledge in this country. I believe that it is supported by the Federated Chamber of Industries, by the trade unions and by all the experts. I feel that the time has come for something to be done about it, as proposed by us on this side of the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Tragically, despite compulsory education, we do not have 100 per cent of pupils really passing Std. 6 at the moment. I know that they are supposed to. The hon. gentleman has been a schoolmaster. He has told us how he taught history. I would not be surprised if his class did not pass. [Interjections.] Not only do we want to see provision for the re-education of those workers to take better jobs, but we want to see provision for them for temporary housing if they have to move into different areas. We want to see the encouragement of industrial business expansion in every way by proper protection for economically sound business enterprises, by means of tax policies applied by the government.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, how would we protect the white worker? We believe that, first of all, what should be done by the White man and what should be done by the non-White are things that should be agreed upon between the trade union and the employers&#x2019; organizations. We believe that if there are difficulties, there should be an appeal to an industrial tribunal. We believe that where there is competition between White and non-White, the rate for the job must apply. We believe for those Whites who are less well educated and cannot compete, there must be a guaranteed minimum wage at real wages, which have regard to the value of money, and that it should be guaranteed them for a period of years while they are being reeducated. May I say that it is a part of our policy that increases in the cost of living should be taken into consideration and that there should be an adjustment of wages in accordance with the ordinary determinations so that the worker can share in the prosperity of South Africa. I believe not only that that would give a great deal of protection to these people, but also that it would enable us to have a far better type of job available for the Eruopean worker in South Africa, with complete security. Now I know that I am going to be asked how I can reconcile a minimum wage with the rate for the job. The answer is tint the rate for the job applies above the minimum wage. If Whites cannot get jobs at the minimum wage, they will have to be cared for by way of sheltered employment and special employment provided by the government. That is something we believe should be looked at. We are faced with a series of figures that were given us by the hon. the Minister of Labour indie-ting the extent to which the number of Bantu workers in the white industrial areas had grown. I may say that the figures he gave us are challenged to-day by one of the leading trade union officials in South Africa. From those figures it appears that whereas the hon. the Minister gave us the figure of 644,000 Bantu employed in industry in the white areas in 1968, the figure given by this gentleman is 722,800. These figures apparently come from the Bureau of Statistics. It appears that the number of African industrial workers as a proportion of all workers in industry in white areas rose from 55.5 per cent in 1965 to 55.6 per cent in 1968 while the percentage of Whites decreased. That is the opposite of what the hon. the Minister has told us. The suggestion is that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s figures do not conform with the official figures put out by the Bureau of Statistics. I fear that this is one of the troubles with which we are faced. The hon. gentleman is not facing this problem. He is not coping with it and he is slowing up the development of South Africa. He is limiting the prosperity of every section of the population because he does not have the courage to come out and tackle this problem in a way that will give better opportunities to Whites and raise the standard of living of all sections of the population.</p>

<p>I raised a third issue, namely the neglect of the ordinary man in the street by this Government. I referred particularly to the lot of the civil servant. The reply I got from the Minister of Economic Affairs was that there had been rises in wages in 1968 and that that had not been before an election. On 15th August last year, Dr. Enslin, chairman of their association, complained that a crisis was developing in the Civil Service because of a shortage of manpower and he ascribed it to the wage conditions in the Service. This matter has been drawn to the attention of hon. Ministers before but we have not had one satisfactory reply from the Government in this regard. I say without hesitation that my case is made as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>Then there was raised the question of old age pensions and a national contributory pension scheme. We were told by the hon. the Prime Minister that the matter had been investigated when he was a Deputy Minister and that as far as he was concerned, those who had started out in favour of it ended up against it. He was not prepared to support it because after all we should have some national self-respect and engender self-respect in the individuals concerned.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Just like the situation at present; at least we will have had a big improvement.</p>

<p>Then I pointed out that the Government had overtaxed the people of South Africa over the last 20 years and that that overtaxation had become even more serious with the imposition of a purchase tax last year. I pointed out our objections to that purchase tax. I also pointed out how we had foretold that far more would be collected than was forecast by the Government. We have been proved to be completely correct as far as this is concerned. The Minister has now taken action which has shown that we were completely correct. I am still sure that when the Budget is presented we will see once more to what extent the ordinary man in the street has been overtaxed once more. This is my reply to the hon. the Prime Minister about the cost of social services. I believe that the money is there; that it is available. We have been overtaxed to the extent of nearly R1,250 million since 1948 and in addition to that the Government has salted away approximately R341 million which it has sterilized to take it out of circulation. That could be used for the needs of the ordinary people. I want to suggest that the replies of the hon. Prime Minister both in respect of a national contributory pension scheme and a State assisted medical aid scheme are utterly unsatisfactory and do not deserve the support of the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>I also raised the question of housing and we got a reply from the hon. Minister of Community Development. I want to say that I believe that that hon. Minister was really quite wise to confine himself in his reply largely to housing as it relates to Indians and Coloured persons who required housing in many cases as a result of removals under the Group Areas Act. The charge we make and the charge which remains unanswered is that he has not applied himself to the housing needs of our expanding white population. He has not applied himself to the increased prices of land, to the increased building costs and the problems they create for young couples and he has not applied himself to the increasing incidence of high density living conditions for young couples with young children. I want to say that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we charge this Minister with complete ineptitude.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Why then is there no overall planning for housing requirements? Why is the Government unable to tell us accurately what the position is or to assess the housing requirements and shortages? Why has the Government not stepped in to reduce the delays in respect of the approval of townships? Why has transfer duty not been reduced in respect of small houses? Why has there been no system of tax relief granted to employers providing housing for their own employees? There is only one answer and that is that this Government is indifferent to the lot of the ordinary man in the street in South Africa. That is another reason why they should be ignored by the electorate in this election.</p>

<p>The fourth matter raised was the question of agriculture and the failure of the Government to play its proper part in combating the problems of the agricultural community. Under the present drought conditions there are farmers who feel very bitterly throughout South Africa, particularly here in the South Western and North Western Cape at the present time. The trouble with the price policy of this Government is that the Ministers of Agriculture cannot defend themselves of their price policy. They talk of what they have done in terms of a long-term policy. Why was the Marais Commission appointed to work out a long-term policy for agriculture in South Africa? Hon. gentlemen will remember the dispute in this House when I raised the question of the lot of the agriculturalist in South Africa under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s vote when I was told by members on that side of the House that I should raise it under the vote of the Ministers of Agriculture and that only matters of national importance should be raised under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. What could be of greater national importance than the lot of the agriculturalist in South Africa? That hon. gentleman will remember the plans put before this House and the motion which came from the hon. member for Gardens for a commission to investigate the long-term planning of South African agriculture. That was voted down by that side of the House. What happened then?</p>

<p>When the then Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, went to his own congresses he ran into so much trouble from his own people that he was forced to appoint the Marais Commission. What have we had since then? We have only had a few interim reports recommending very largely United Party policy. Now at last we had the hon. the Prime Minister announcing to-day that vast sums are going to be made available to meet the capital needs of farmers in difficult conditions to assist them a little further. How long have we not asked for more money to be made available? For how long have we not asked for the subsidization of rates of interest? For how long have we not asked for another price policy from this Government? Now members on the other side of the House turn round and ask us how we work out the costs of production. For how long have control boards not been working out the costs of production in South Africa? Why must they suddenly find that they can no longer do this because we propose that they should do it? Is it not one of the principles underlying the Marketing Act that the farmer should receive his production costs as well as a reasonable profit?</p>

<p>When that Act was established, it was de <span class="col_483-484" refersTo="page_0254"/>signed not only for orderly marketing of the farmers&#x2019; products, but also that price stability be ensured and to provide the farmer with a reasonable profit. It is this Minister of Agriculture who has departed from the principles of the Marketing Act. He is the Minister who has talked about supply and demand. At times when production costs had risen, he has nevertheless reduced the price of the commodity to the farmer concerned, as he did with white mealies a year or two ago, despite the recommendations of the Maize Control Board. If he is not prepared to follow a policy which will ensure production costs, a reasonable profit to the farmer and the recognition of the risk factor, what then is he in favour of in fixing prices for the farmers? The hon. gentleman will find the farmers will not be prepared to produce under those circumstances. That is one of the reasons why he is losing large numbers of farmers in South Africa. He quotes from a synopsis of our policy statement. He knows very well that our policy has been debated in this House on many occasions. He knows that we put proposals before this House to suggest that the instability of farming income should as far as possible be eliminated. How is the risk factor to be eliminated?</p>

<p>We have suggested that there should be the implementation of a general State-aided crop and stock insurance scheme, which will ensure that the farmer would at least get his production costs during unfavourable times, like drought, hail, frost and circumstances of that sort. He put the question of how he would work out production costs. I have said that the Marketing Board has been doing that for years. I know that those products which are normally exported provide problems, but if they are an important part of the industry which has been built up over the years, with big capital investment that is worthwhile saving, then I believe that the Government has to be prepared to subsidize where necessary in order to assist those people to remain on their feet. In cases of temporary surpluses and the possibility of the difficulty of disposing of these surpluses, I believe it is right that the Government should spend money to increase local demand, that it should be something borne by the whole community and not just the farming community. I want to say that these election promises by the Government are going to do very little to restore the confidence of the farming community in the Government after the way they have been treated over the years. This is merely an attempt to distract their attention from their difficulties because of the coming of the election. Why was this not done years ago, over the five, six years of drought we have had in various parts of this country? How many good farmers have not gone under because of the lack of help of the kind that the Prime Minister is suggesting he is going to offer to-day with an election around the corner?</p>

<p>Then there is a sixth issue which I believe should be placed before the public of South</p>

<p>Africa, namely the alarming development of authoritarian tendencies in this Government. It was very interesting to note that there was no attempt at defence so far as that was concerned from the other side of the House. Not a single Minister stood up and dealt with the subject.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman contends that the common law empowers the head of State to issue a certificate which was final in respect of matters affecting the security of the State. He says that he himself gave such a certificate, backed by a Transvaal court, and that there were conflicting decisions that caused the Department of Justice to come forward with section 29 to clarify the position. I raised with the hon. gentleman the question whether the case of Van der Linde and Calitz did not clarify the position and state it finally, since it was an Appeal Court decision. The hon. gentleman said that Calitz&#x2019; case dealt only with particular circumstances, a particular case, and had no general application. Now, Sir, the headnote of Calitz&#x2019; case is so general that it is difficult for me to accept that interpretation.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says he will argue it with me in the next debate, but I want to point something else out. Not only is that headnote of general application, but the interpretation which we on this side of the House have given to this section, has apparently been accepted by the Bar Councils of every Bar in South Africa. It has apparently also been accepted by every Law Society. There have come protests from teachers of law at a large number of our big universities, universities like the Rand Afrikaans University, Potchefstroom University, the University of South Africa and many other of our great teaching universities. I have that headnote here. I have their judgment here. I should like to place it before the hon. the Prime Minister, because it seems to me that the hon. gentleman either does not understand what is the implication of this section, or he has been misled by the people who should have advised him. There is no doubt whatever that the vast mass of legal opinion in South Africa is to the effect that that clause goes far too far and that the explanations so far given by the hon. the Prime Minister and by his Deputy Minister in this House did not meet the situation. The hon. the Deputy Minister apparently did not know that this case has gone on appeal. He did not realize that the case he quoted in respect of English law has been overruled by the House of Lords. The hon. the Prime Minister has made statements in this regard before his own congresses which, to put it mildly, leaves one with the impression that he has not had an opportunity of studying them and doing his homework on the subject.</p>

<speech by="#villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister put it to me and I must reply. It looks as if I am getting it all my own way too. It looks to me as if the hon. gentleman is not briefed even now. But what has this to do with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s action in respect of the hon. member for Ermelo? It has nothing to do with it whatsoever and I want to say that I stand by my criticism in that respect.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has told us in lighter vein that he never needed advertisements about bars to get the public to his public meetings. I wonder if he remembers the meeting at Malmesbury on the 21st March and I wonder if he paid any attention to the advertisement advertising the meeting, namely &#x201C;a big braai and a substantial bar&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In saying that we have no confidence in this Government and asking the public to show their confidence in us, I cannot but recall how often we have been right and the Government has been wrong. There was the question of the purchase tax, the question of immigration and that of the Orange River scheme. There has also been the difficulty in regard to national unity which has now been revealed by the split between the Prime Minister and his friends in his own party. There have been questions in connection with the farmers&#x2019; income tax, the bulge in taxation, the taxation of married women and also a large number of <span class="col_487-488" refersTo="page_0256"/>other matters. One of the difficulties with this Government at the present time is that they make promises and statements and one is beginning to have difficulty in knowing exactly what one can accept. I have one example in respect of the hon. the Minister of Transport. He attacked the hon. member for Ermelo and his group at a meeting in Potchefstroom which was reported in <i>Die Burger</i> of the 18th October, 1969. He was reported as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Minister Schoeman het ges&#x00EA; as dit dan in sonde is om af te wyk van in beleidsverklaring van &#x2019;n vorige Eerste Minister, wil hy vra waarom hierdie mense nie ook vir mnr. Vorster beskuldig het van afwyking van dr. Verwoerd se beleid toe die Regering besluit het dat die blanke Kleurlingverteenwoordigers in hierdie Parlement verwyder moes word nie. Minister Schoeman het dr. Verwoerd se woorde op 23 Januarie 1962 in die Volksraad aangehaal waar hy ges&#x00EA; het dat hy geen plan hoegenaamd het om die Kleurlingverteenwoordigers te verwyder, seifs nie nadat die Kleurlinge hulle eie Parlement het nie.</block>

<p>My point is quite simple. The hon. the Minister said why did these people not accuse the Government of departing from Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy. The hon. the Minister knows very well that the present Minister of Defence told us in this House that when that policy statement was made in this House Dr. Verwoerd and he had already decided that they were going to remove the Coloureds&#x2019; representatives.</p>

<p>They deny everything, but the public will decide in due course who was right.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I have here the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s exact words which I would like to read out to him. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we were to succeed in solving the problem of marketing gold and if we could obtain the foreign exchange and by doing so relax our exchange rate control and send more money to countries abroad I am convinced that share prices on the Exchange will show a downward trend. Once share prices on the Exchange show a downward trend people will be more inclined to invest money in fixed interest-bearing securities which include building societies.</block>

<p>Later on the same day he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If I can foresee the possibility of a solution to our gold marketing problem being found, a solution that will make it possible for us to sell our gold more freely and in that way to earn more foreign exchange, and to export more money out of the country which would inevitably lead to the Exchange showing a downward trend as well, it would be my duty to sound a note of warning. I did not say that I was sure that it would come. What I did in fact say was that I expected, hoped and trusted that we should find a solution to the problem shortly perhaps before the end of this year. What I did in fact deny was when I was asked whether I expected this to happen shortly, to-morrow, the day after or next week.</block>

<p>Yes, mainly luxury and durable goods. But what happened? Lip service to the promise, lip service to the statements and every kind of goods were taxed. We are faced with an election. I believe that the replies of this Government to our criticisms have been wholly unsatisfactory. I believe that we have spent a large part of these five days in washing the dirty linen of the Nationalist Party in this House. It seems that the hon. the Prime Minister and many members on his side of the House attach more importance to that fight than to the future problems of South Africa. I want to say that so far as we are concerned, this is merely another reason for having no confidence in the present Government. I want to say that what we offer to the people of South Africa is the maintenance of white leadership in South Africa over the whole of South Africa; and that we will live in peace and harmony with all races in South Africa, in one State with one central Government, but with the various races governing themselves in matters of more intimate concern to themselves. We will give them a measure of self-government in their own communities. We will recognize the special position of the reserves. We believe that we can ensure that peace and harmony through a federation of communities with defined representation for each community in the central Parliament on separate rolls. We will guarantee no change will come in the parliamentary representation of any of the non-White groups without the approval of the white electorate in a special election or referendum for that purpose. We believe that we can deal with the day-to-day problems of living and making a living in South Africa by maintaining separate social and residential amenities. We will provide sufficient properly-trained labour to meet the demands of an increasingly prosperous economy with the proviso that white workers will be protected against unfair competition. There will be protected employment at minimum rates of pay for those Whites who through no fault of their own are in need of such protection. There will be better facilities for the training and re-training of workers so that no white worker will fall by the wayside because he is not properly trained to take a better job.</p>

He cannot do it; he is kicking over the traces by breaking the Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of his own non-Whites on the Railways every day of the week. He knows it, but he is not prepared to have the private industrialist given the same relaxation. I want to say something else to that hon. gentleman. I want to say that we will uphold the rule of law in South Africa. We will secure South Africa against both internal and external attacks. We will guarantee every man&#x2019;s right of access to independent courts of law in South Africa. We believe we can build up better living standards for all race groups. We will guarantee those social services which the hon. the Prime Minister is refusing to guarantee. We will guarantee to provide more houses especially for young couples anxious to start their own families. I believe we can, as I have said before, ensure that we will provide television as well.

I believe there has been so many failures, so many broken promises, so many statements which have not been accurate that the people no longer believe in them or have any right to believe in them.

<heading>RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS PART APPROPRIATION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill now before the House makes provision for expenditure in the amount of R650 million, which will be sufficient for approximately seven months of the financial year 1970-&#x2019;71. R550 million is required to cover expenditure to be defrayed from revenue funds in respect of the maintenance and operation of all services, and R100 million to enable the Administration to proceed with its programme of capital and betterment works until such time as the budget for the financial year has been approved.</p>

<p>I shall now give the House a brief review of the year&#x2019;s working in so far as the following revenue services are concerned:</p>

<p><i>Passengers</i></p>

<p>Passenger earnings for the first eight months of the financial year reflected an increase on the figure for the corresponding period of 1968-&#x2019;69.</p>

<p><i>Goods</i></p>

<p>As a result of the suspension of maize exports, traffic from the agricultural sector up to the end of November, 1969 showed a decline on the previous year&#x2019;s figure. Highrated goods, however, more than compensated for the shortfall as a result of a rise in imports. It is anticipated that the current level of high-rated goods traffic will be maintained during the remaining months of the financial year. Regarding low-rated goods, the Maize Control Board has authorized some 23 shipments of yellow maize during the latter part of the year.</p>

<p><i>Road transport</i></p>

<p>Road transport earnings have maintained a high level throughout the year with a consistent increase in third class passengers and goods tonnage.</p>

<p><i>Harbours</i></p>

<p>At the harbours the tonnage of general merchandise has exceeded the 1968 figures, but the considerable gain on the import figures for the previous year is due largely to crude petroleum.</p>

<p><i>Airways</i></p>

<p>Revenue for the first four months of the year did not come up to expectations, but by the end of November the estimate had been exceeded, freight earnings being particularly high.</p>

<p><i>Pipelines</i></p>

<p>The earnings from white products reflected an improvement whilst revenue from crude petroleum showed a marked increase due mainly to the introduction into service of the new pipeline between Durban and Ogies in June, 1969.</p>

<p><i>New Works Programme</i></p>

<p>Whilst completion of some of the new lines at present under construction has been delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, satisfactory progress was maintained with nearly all new works in hand during the year.</p>

<p>Work on the Empangeni-Richard&#x2019;s Bay single line is more than three quarters complete, but the target date for completion has unfortunately had to be put forward owing to subsidence problems in swamp areas.</p>

<p>Work on the Metsi-Kaapmuiden new line is about 50 per cent complete whilst work on the Vryheid-Empangeni line is expected to be completed by March, 1975.</p>

<p>The proposed new line from Natalspruit to Midway, the construction of which was authorized by Act No. 49 of 1957, will now no longer be constructed. This line would have joined up with the Midway-Bank-Klerksdorp route and would also have been used to serve the proposed new municipal power station at Liefde en Vrede. This scheme has, however, been abandoned by the Johannesburg City Council, and the occurrence of sinkholes between Bank and Oberholzer also made it necessary to reconsider the matter.</p>

<p>The partial doubling of an installation of Centralized Traffic Control on the Klerksdorp-Fourteen Streams line, at a cost of some R18 million, will commence as soon as the preliminary survey work in connection with the awarding of tenders is completed, whilst the doubling, electrification and installation of C.T.C. on the Hercules-De Wildt line for serving decentralized industry, is expected to be completed in March. 1972. Plans are at present in an advanced stage of preparation for the installation of C.T.C. on the Queenstown-Burgersdorp and Booth-Cato Ridge lines. The doubling of the Cambridge-Blaney line is almost complete, and the deviation of portion of the East London-Springfontein line at Bethulie, due to the construction of the Verwoerd Dam, is already more than 80 per cent complete.</p>

<p>The electrification schemes on the Kamfersdam-Postmasburg line (including the Macfarlane-Fields View connecting line) and the Glencoe-Hlobane section have been completed. Electrification of the Kroonstad-Harrismith section is expected to be completed in December, 1970, and the section Harrismith-Bethlehem is already in use.</p>

<p>Construction of the goods depot at Bayhead, Durban, is progressing well, and with the cooperation <span class="col_495-496" refersTo="page_0260"/>of the contractors, work on certain stages of the project is being expedited so as to provide alternate facilities to compensate for the loss of the Cato Creek goods sheds destroyed by fire on 20th October, 1969.</p>

<p>In this connection, I regret to inform hon. members that the fire totally destroyed some 280,0 square feet of shed accommodation, including all the shed equipment, whilst a large quantity of rolling-stock, cartage vehicles and equipment was destroyed and damaged. It is also estimated that some 2,700 tons of general merchandise was destroyed. It was at first anticipated that the loss of this important link would cause considerable disruption in goods services, not only locally but over a wide area. The steps which were taken immediately after the fire were so effective that an embargo that was placed on all but the most urgent consignments could be lifted two days later. The fact that activities returned to normal so soon, speaks volumes for the positive manner in which all the staff concerned faced the challenge of this disaster. I should like to pay a special tribute to those members of the staff and the public who, at great personal risk, assisted with the combating of the fire and the removal of vehicles from the sheds.</p>

<p>The construction of all quay walls for Pier No. 1 and the cross berth at Salisbury Island, Durban, has been completed, and dredging work in connection with the construction of Pier No. 2 has commenced.</p>

<p><i>Rolling-stock</i></p>

<p>Rolling-stock on order or authorized comprises 250 electric locomotives, 190 diesel locomotives, 594 main-line passenger coaches, 196 suburban electric motor coaches, 482 trailing coaches, 10,650 goods vehicles as well as 140 narrow-gauge vehicles and 16 narrow-gauge guards&#x2019; vans.</p>

<p>Tenders will shortly be invited for the supply, between August and November, 1971, of two train sets for the conveyance of motor cars, at an estimated overall cost of R727,000.</p>

<p><i>Housing</i></p>

<p>During the year an amount of R9.6 million was available for housing loan purposes and this enabled the Administration to make some 1,200 loans available to the staff for the acquisition of houses.</p>

<p>An amount of R3 million was allocated for departmental quarters and the latest available figures indicate that almost 450 houses have either been completed or are in the course of erection.</p>

<p><i>Staff</i></p>

<p>The overall staff position deteriorated still further during the year. This is attributed to the keen competition in the labour market as a result of the sustained economic growth of the country and the continued state of full employment. In my last budget speech I referred to the solution being sought by introducing schemes and procedures whereby it would be possible to step up production with the available staff, and I am pleased to say that this campaign is bearing fruit.</p>

<p>Concessions granted to specific grades of staff during the period under review totalled some R12 million. This amount included more than R9 million in respect of an increased holiday bonus paid to the staff at the end of November, 1969.</p>

<p>THE PAST TWENTY-ONE YEARS INRETROSPECT</p>

<p>Hon. members are aware of the important role played by the South African Railways in the economic life of the country and that the Department&#x2019;s working results are in many ways a reflection of the country&#x2019;s economic growth and achievements.</p>

<p>A comparison between 1948 and 1969 reflects an increase in the total tonnage of goods transported by rail from 52.6 million to 118.5 million, or 125 per cent. Revenue-earning goods ton miles rose from 7,400 million to 24,900 million, or by approximately 237 per cent; passenger rail journeys from 244 million to 493 million, or by 102 per cent, and cargo handled at our harbours by 271 per cent from 10.7 million to 39.7 million tons.</p>

<p>In order to achieve these results it was, of course, necessary to spend large sums of money. The total capital invested in the Railways increased from R473 million in 1948 to R2,477 million at the end of March, 1969. This money was spent on essential development and on commodities without which the Railways would not have been able to fulfil its task. Track mileage, for instance, increased by approximately 20 per cent; truckage by 121 per cent; coaching stock by 55 per cent; and tractive power by 62 per cent. In addition, South African Airways has been modernized to become one of the finest in the world. Cargo-handling capacity at harbours has also been stepped up considerably, whilst the two pipelines provided are operating successfully.</p>

<p>Although it could reasonably be expected that an increase in traffic and expansion of this magnitude would normally entail a corresponding increase in staff, it is significant that the actual increase amounts to a mere 15 per cent.</p>

<p>In considering this transformation of the Railways, hon. members will appreciate that most of the improvements to which I have referred had to be effected amidst the everyday operation of the various services and to meet the demands of the virile growth of our national economy, which, in turn, depends so much on the ability of the Railways to offer efficient transport. Confidence, ingenuity and bold planning were, therefore, required on the part of the Railway Administration to cope with the traffic offering during each stage of the country&#x2019;s development.</p>

<p>Methods and means were at the same time being devised whereby existing working and <span class="col_497-498" refersTo="page_0261"/>operating procedures could be improved and adapted to modern trends, whilst the possible application of modern management techniques and mechanical and other aids to increase efficiency, received special attention in the light of the persistent staff shortage.</p>

<p>I shall now deal in greater detail with the growth of certain branches of the Railway organization since 1948.</p>

<p>CAPITAL WORKS</p>

<p>During the past two decades, an amount of approximately R800 million was incurred on new civil engineering works and improvements to facilities. This amount was allocated to projects such as the provision of new railway lines, electrification, doubling and quadrupling of lines, deviations, new marshalling yards, goods depots, locomotive depots, workshops, administrative buildings, mechanization of shunting yards, and improved facilities for the staff.</p>

<p>SIGNALLING</p>

<p>Train control and signalling, which not only determine line capacity but also form the basis of safe trains working, have been extensively changed and modernized since 1948. This was necessary in view of the faster and more intensive train service that was required. Electrical signalling offered a good solution, and even in the days of the exclusive use of steam traction, electrical equipment was installed to improve line capacity. A further improvement was the introduction of Centralized Traffic Control, whereby the running of trains over sections of up to 120 miles is presently controlled from a single control Office without any operating officials at intermediate station.</p>

<p>Apart from the obvious advantages which Centralized Traffic Control have for the Railways, its introduction has led to the establishment of a new local signalling industry, which manufactures 75 per cent of our requirements of highly sophisticated electronic equipment.</p>

<p>ELECTRIFICATION AND DIESELIZA-TION</p>

<p>Since 1948 the electrification network has been extended by more than 4,000 single track miles. The electrified mileage at present approximates 28 per cent of the total railway network and, compared with 204 electric locomotives in service in 1948 with a tractive force of 4.5 million lb., the Railways now has 1,112 units with a total tractive force of 33.8 million lb.</p>

<p>Whilst in 1948 available diesel traction consisted of only two small diesels used on a limited scale for shunting, the present diesel establishment consists of 367 locomotives with a further 12 still to be delivered.</p>

<p>ROLLING-STOCK</p>

<p>The number of passenger coaches in service has since 1948 been increased by 2,914, and the capital value thereof by R159 million. Goods vehicles in service were increased from 67,0 to 147,000 providing an increased carrying capacity of 2.8 million tons, whilst the capital value increased by R436 million.</p>

<p>Goods vehicles have received particular attention and in recent years various special types of trucks and tank wagons were developed by the Administration&#x2019;s engineers and the plans presented to local industry for construction.</p>

<p>In the past year, only R8 million of the Railway purchases, which exceeded R212 million, were made overseas as against R19 million out of R67&#x00BD; million in the year 1948-&#x2019;49.</p>

<p>PIPELINES</p>

<p>The 12-inch pipeline constructed over a distance of 446 miles, for the conveyance of petroleum products between Durban and Johannesburg via Sasolburg, was commissioned on 1st November, 1965. Traffic conveyed by this pipeline is steadily increasing and, on the average, approximately 500 million gallons are conveyed annually. Teething troubles experienced, particularly in the field of electrolytic corrosion, have been overcome.</p>

<p>Early in 1967, it was decided to build a second pipeline of 18-inch diameter to convey crude oil. This 511 mile long pipeline between Durban and Kendal via Empangeni and Sasolburg will ultimately serve the Natref Refinery which is expected to be commissioned during this year. The section between Sasolburg and Kendal went on stream in mid-March, 1969, whilst that between Durban and Sasolburg was brought into use on 9th June, 1969.</p>

<p>AIRWAYS</p>

<p>Of all the transport services, perhaps the most spectacular expansion during the past two decades has taken place in air services.</p>

<p>Air passengers increased by more than 1,0 per cent whereas the demand for freight carriage by air was practically non-existent in 1948. Some 14,000 tons of freight were conveyed last year.</p>

<p>The fleet, which in 1948 consisted of 41 aircraft comprising Skymasters, Vickers Vikings, Dakotas, Lodestars and Doves, with a seating capacity of only 845, has been modernized, and by the end of 1969 comprised 29 aircraft, viz. eight Boeing 707s, seven 727s, three 737s, seven Viscounts and four Dakotas, with a seating capacity of no less than 2,616.</p>

<p>The present fleet enables South African Airways to convey 23,500 passengers per week on its internal flights whilst 2,224 seats are available per week on the Springbok route to and from London, 1,390 to and from Europe (Athens, Rome and Vienna), 278 to and from <span class="col_499-500" refersTo="page_0262"/>the Americas, and 278 on the Wallaby Service. A further three 737s and three 747s are on order.</p>

<p>Although we can be proud of these achievements it is only fitting that reference should again be made to one of the outstanding features in the history of South African Airways, namely the smooth change-over in August, 1963, from the East African route to the one along the West coast.</p>

<p>Hon. members will no doubt be interested to know how it came about that the changeover could take place within 24 hours of receiving notice that overflying rights in North Africa had been refused.</p>

<p>In 1959 I became convinced that, firstly, landing rights and, thereafter, overflying rights would be refused by African states to S.A.A. I knew only too well that these people did not concern themselves with international conventions, which guaranteed overflying rights to all commercial airlines.</p>

<p>As a first step, I decided that the main runway at Jan Smuts must be lengthened by 4,0 ft. to enable a fully loaded Boeing aircraft to take off comfortably. This was completed by my Department with the assistance of the Provincial Administration in the record time of three months instead of the 18 months which it would have taken under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>Secondly, I sent officials of the Department of Transport and S.A.A. on an exploratory mission in a Skymaster to find a new route round the bulge of Africa.</p>

<p>On their return they reported that Luanda airport had not been completed, the runway at Sal in the Cape Verde Islands was too short for a fully-loaded Boeing to take off, but that Las Palmas was suitable.</p>

<p>Negotiations were immediately entered into with the Portuguese authorities to obtain landing rights at Luanda, Sal and Lisbon, and for the runway at Sal to be lengthened.</p>

<p>On 21st August, 1963, a message was received that Libya had refused S.A.A. overflying rights. We immediately sent ground equipment to Luanda for the handling of S.A.A. Boeings at that airport. We also obtained permission from the Spanish authorities for S.A.A. to land at Las Palmas for technical purposes only. At present, of course, S.A.A. has full traffic rights at Las Palmas.</p>

<p>Without one flight being delayed we switched over to the new route. It was an effort which inspired world-wide admiration and I cannot refrain from again paying the highest tribute to my flying crews and officials who were primarily responsible for the smooth change-over.</p>

<p>STAFF</p>

<p>A feature of personnel administration in the South African Railways, is the cordial relationship which has, through the years, existed between the Administration and its staff. This relationship is based on mutual respect and confidence and a consequent responsible approach to problems. Hon. members are aware of the fact that I have always been prepared to assist the staff in every possible way, but that I have at the same time consistently refused to consider concessions when railway finances were not favourable.</p>

<p>It is true that differences have arisen from time to time, but I am pleased to say that the understanding between us is such that neither I nor the staff have the slightest hesitation of using the existing conciliatory machinery.</p>

<p>Whilst the volume of traffic has increased more than twofold during the past two decades, only 15 per cent more staff were employed. This indeed represents a significant contribution on the part of the staff, which sometimes was made under rather trying circumstances. I naturally share the country&#x2019;s appreciation in this connection, and hon. members will be pleased to note that these sustained efforts have not gone unrewarded, but that during the past 20 years an amount of more than R235 million was expended on improved emoluments.</p>

<p>Although the housing of staff is an expensive undertaking, it has always been my considered opinion that favourable housing conditions have an important bearing on productivity and that the Administration should, as far as practicable, assist the staff in this regard. Despite the periodical dearth of capital, a sum of over R118 million has been made available since 1948 to enable railway-men to purchase their own homes, in consequence of which more than 28,000 properties have been acquired.</p>

<p>In addition, the Administration has during the same period, provided almost 13,500 departmental houses at a cost of over R85 million, which brings the total number of departmental houses presently let to railway servants to 23,000. It is worthy of note that these departmental houses are being let to railway servants at a loss of some R10 million per annum. The benefits are, however, considered to be in excess of the actual monetary loss sustained and are accordingly fully justified.</p>

<p>There are, of course, numerous other fringe benefits enjoyed by the staff, but I shall not burden the House with details thereof.</p>

<p>I do, however, also wish to say something about railway pension benefits. Since this Government came into power much has been done to improve the lot of railway pensioners and their dependants. Notwithstanding improved pension benefits resulting from higher salaries and wages in favour of the staff, and the fact that the various allowances payable to pensioners have been increased from time to time, actual pension benefits have also been improved. For instance, a scheme whereby widows of deceased railway servants qualified for the payment of annuities came into effect during July, 1951, whilst the benefits payable <span class="col_501-502" refersTo="page_0263"/>to widows and dependants have since been improved.</p>

<p>Hon. members will no doubt recall that I mentioned in my Budget speech last year that an investigation by a committee specially appointed for the purpose had shown conclusively that improvements in the benefits provided by the pension funds were fully justified. Hon. members will also recall that legislation was passed last year in terms of which the annuities of all persons who went on pension before 1st April, 1968, were increased by 10 per cent whilst those who retired on or after that date received an increase of 5 per cent.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in order to offset increases in the cost of living, basic pensions were enhanced by 2 per cent, compounded annually, for each completed year of pension up to a maximum of 20 years. At the same time the terminal period on which pensions are calculated was reduced to three years and the factors used for converting portion of annuities into lump sum payments were also raised.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although the Railways has not failed the country in meeting its transport requirements, the industrial development of the country over the past two decades has steadily intensified the competition between employers for the available manpower. In the main the Railways can, for obvious reasons, not compete on an equal basis with the private sector as far as remuneration is concerned, in consequence of which it has continuously been faced with shortages in its labour force. In a labour market where only a few white men and women are registered as unemployed, this situation will no doubt continue. The Administration has, therefore, considered various means whereby efficiency and productivity could be increased in order to provide the necessary service with a smaller staff. Through the introduction of improved training, working methods and facilities, mechanization and automation of certain procedures, it has largely succeeded in achieving this objective.</p>

<p>Before concluding I wish to refer to the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Co-ordination of Transport in South Africa, which was tabled last year. The findings and recommendations of the Commission are still being studied by my Departments and I am awaiting their comments. However, in regard to those recommendations pertaining to the separation of Railways, Harbours and Airways, I can inform the House that I have rejected these recommendations as I am convinced that it is not in the interests of the country; I have decided to give the reasons for my rejection in the form of a White Paper, which I now lay upon the Table.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Government can claim without fear of contradiction that it has guided the administration of the South African Railways along positive and economically sound lines, and I have no hesitation in requesting this House to provide the necessary funds for which I have asked, to enable the Railways to meet its commitments until Parliament considers the main Railway Budget later this year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are grateful to the hon. the Minister for this interesting interim review of the situation on the South African Railways and Harbours. We look forward to the debate that will ensue from this statement. We were interested that the Minister should refer, very inadequately, I think, in view of the circumstances, to the continuing staff shortage on the South African Railways. I think the whole country, and particularly the railwaymen, would like to know what is being done in order to overcome what has really developed into a very, very serious situation indeed.</p>

<p>The Minister has given us some indication of what is being done by way of mechanization and organization to try and minimize the effects of the staff shortage. But ultimately, Sir, any organization of the magnitude of the South African Railways must depend upon human beings for its work. Computers cannot programme themselves. Machines cannot anticipate emergencies. Machines cannot plan. Ultimately we shall have to find a way of getting the people, the bodies, to do the work on the South African Railways. I do think it was remiss of the Minister to skate around this very important issue in the manner that he did to-day. We shall have to discuss this further when it comes to the debate.</p>

<p>We were looking forward to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply to the hon. member for Salt River&#x2019;s request for information about the Marais Commission on the co-ordination of transport in this speech. All we heard was that the Minister and the Administration had not yet made up their minds, except for one negative decision, namely not to accept the policy of the United Party that there should be separation under the Minister of Transport of the Departments of Railways, of Harbours and of Airways. There I sympathize with the Minister. They have taken over so much of the United Party&#x2019;s policy that they have in this particular instance on the eve of the election to give the impression that they are not taking over more of our policy. But they will, Sir. They will in this matter take over our policy, too. It may take 60 or 40 years, as we have seen in other instances. The logic is so unanswerable that inevitably they will bring about this separation in due course. I have not had a chance to study the White Paper, but I can remember, for example, that the Minister of Water Affairs had reasons as good why they could not construct the Orange River Scheme. I think that the history of the White Paper we shall read quite soon will be similar to the protestations against the Orange River Scheme that we had from another Minister. It is inevitable, Sir. It will happen and we are confident that it will.</p>

<p>It fascinated me to listen to the Minister, this hon. Minister whom we nearly lost. I felt quite sad when I read in the papers that the <span class="col_503-504" refersTo="page_0264"/>hon. the Minister of Transport was going to resign because of advancing years. But in view of the new fluidity in the Nationalist Party, and the uncertainty, he has decided to give it another go. I want to say that we welcome it. We can only hope that his continued presence in the Cabinet for another two months will help to bring greater stability in the very weak government that South Africa has to-day. But in the circumstances, as he probably considered the speech when he still thought of retiring, we can forgive him for the theme of his speech, which was: &#x201C;What a good boy am I!&#x201D; We can understand this. It was intended as a swan song for the hon. the Minister and we sympathize and understand. But, of course, it will be our task to complete the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s life&#x2019;s story. He has written his autobiography and we shall help to complete a balanced biography for the hon. the Minister. We shall also look at the past 20 years and we shall tell a story of excessive overtime, because of a lack of staff, and a story of excessive fatigue because of the tremendous demands being made on the Railway personnel. We shall also tell stories of more derailments and more accidents, of higher fares, of periodic inadequacy; and we shall complete the history of the hon. the Minister which he forgot to tell us. He forgot to tell us how this Government landed the South African Railways in an utter crisis after they came into power in 1948, because they did not accept the judgment of the United Party Government and that of Mr. Sturrock. This Government then tried to curtail our plans for expansion and they brought the Railways to the verge of ruin. It is strange how forgetful this hon. Minister has become. It is, of course, human that when one considers one&#x2019;s own past, one remembers the favourable and tends to forget the unfavourable. I think we shall have an interesting debate and I am grateful to the hon. the Minister for the manner in which he introduced it&#x2014;especially for the openings he gave a constructive Opposition to expose the weaknesses of the Administration.</p>

<heading>POST OFFICE PART APPROPRIATION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill before the House makes provision for the appropriation of a total amount of R174 million for the service of the Post Office after the expiry of the current financial year until such time as the Main Estimates for the Post Office for 1970-&#x2019;71 have been considered and approved later this year. An amount of R116 million is being requested for operating expenses, and an amount of R58 million for the purpose of enabling the Post Office to proceed with its programme of capital works.</p>

<p>I think that on this occasion it would be fitting merely to furnish the House with a brief summary of Post Office activities.</p>

<p>POSTAL SERVICES</p>

<p>The volume of mail handled by the Post Office is increasing all the time, and with a view to the shortage of experienced staff the emphasis is increasingly being placed on the mechanization of the handling processes and the utilization of ways and means of speeding up the conveyance and delivery of mail in all stages and rendering this service more effective.</p>

<p>From observation the letter-sorting machine installed in Pretoria appears to hold many advantages in that more mail matter can be sorted with much less staff than was the case with the ordinary method of sorting by hand. Tests and analyses of the practical results of this machine are being continued. Eleven facer/canceller machines which were ordered for six of the largest sorting Offices&#x2014;those in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Pretoria, Port Elizabeth, and Pietermaritzburg&#x2014;have arrived in the Republic and are being installed at present. A few of them are already being used.</p>

<p>Experiments with the use of power-driven cycles for the delivery of mail in Johannesburg and Pretoria have been so successful that the Department intends to use this method also in the other major centres where local circumstances permit.</p>

<p>TELECOMMUNICATION</p>

<p>During the part of the new financial year under review, approximately R44 million will be needed for telecommunication capital works. This spending rate is appreciably higher than that of the current financial year, mainly because of an acceleration in the rate at which automatic exchange equipment and cables are being supplied and, to a certain extent, because of rising costs as well.</p>

<p><i>Telephones</i></p>

<p>It is being expected that the number of telephones in the Republic and South West Africa will reach a total of nearly 1,500,000 by the end of the current financial year, 1969-&#x2019;70, as compared to nearly 1,312,000 at the end of the previous financial year. This represents an increase of 188,000 telephones in 1969-&#x2019;70, but this increase includes 85,861 telephones which were taken over from the Durban Corporation during April last year, as well as 30,813 telephones which had been in commission in South West Africa when, also in April last year, the control of those telephones was taken over by Post Office of the Republic. The anticipated net increase for the financial year <span class="col_505-506" refersTo="page_0265"/>1969-&#x2019;70 will therefore be approximately 72,000.</p>

<p>It is expected that the number of deferred applications for telephones will amount to approximately 89,000 by the end of March, 1970. It is estimated that the total number of new applications received for telephones during the financial year 1969-&#x2019;70, will be 246,600, and that the number of telephones provided during the financial year will amount to approximately 219,400. Over the first six months of the financial year&#x2014;i.e. from April to the end of September, 1969&#x2014;114,305 telephone services were provided. In spite of this high rate at which telephones are being provided, there has nevertheless been a moderate increase in the number of names on the waiting list because of the sustained increase in the number of new applications received.</p>

<p><i>Direct long-distance dialling</i></p>

<p>The system of direct long-distance dialling which enables telephone subscribers in automatic exchange areas throughout the country to dial subscribers in other automatic exchange areas and many manual exchanges directly, has been extended considerably during the financial year 1969-&#x2019;70. The most significant extensions of this system were those of subscribers in the areas of Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand; East London, Queenstown and King William&#x2019;s Town; the Vereeniging area; the Klerksdorp area; Pietersburg and other large towns in the Transvaal.</p>

<p><i>Telephone exchanges</i></p>

<p>During the financial year 1969-&#x2019;70 the manually operated telephone exchanges at Bethal, Despatch, Leeudoringstad and the Strand were replaced by automatic exchanges. The manual exchanges at Ermelo and Rustenburg will be replaced by automatic exchanges on 7th March.</p>

<p>A new automatic exchange was put into operation at Montclair on 14th June, 1969, and on 29th November the existing automatic exchange at Paarl was replaced by a new automatic exchange with a larger capacity. During the period 1st April to 30th November, 1969, the capacity of 16 automatic exchanges was enlarged by a total of 7,660 additional lines. A further 4,800 additional lines will have been made available at four other automatic exchanges by the end of March, 1970.</p>

<p>During the financial year 1970-&#x2019;71 new automatic exchanges with a total of 16,459 lines will be installed at 17 centres, and another 8 temporary automatic exchanges with 388 lines each will be installed so as to relieve congestion where relief is most urgently needed and can be brought about in this manner.</p>

<p><i>Telex service</i></p>

<p>For quite some time telex subscribers in the Republic and South West Africa have been enjoying the advantages of a fully automatic domestic telex service. The popularity of this type of service has been proved very clearly by the fact that 830 new services were pro vided during the seven-month period from April to October, 1969.</p>

<p>MAJOR CONSTRUCTION WORKS</p>

<p>The increasing demand by the public for more and better post Office services has required the major construction works programme to be extended considerably. During the financial year 1969-&#x2019;70 four new post Offices, two combined post Office and automatic telephone exchange buildings were completed. In addition two post Offices and four automatic telephone exchange buildings were enlarged. These works cost R2.2 million.</p>

<p>At the moment 47 building projects at a total cost of roughly R19.3 million are under construction, and it is expected that 39 major construction projects will be completed during the financial year 1970-&#x2019;71.</p>

<p>HOUSING</p>

<p>During the period April, 1969, to January, 1970, negotiations were concluded for the purchase or construction of 108 dwellings for allocation to officials as official accommodation. Sixty-eight of these dwellings have already been occupied.</p>

<p>Special steps were taken to provide housing by means of pre-constructed buildings for members of staff left homeless by the earthquakes in the Western Province.</p>

<p>STAFF</p>

<p>Owing to the general manpower shortage as a result of the tremendous development taking place in South Africa, the Post Office, just as is the case with other Departments and organizations, is also experiencing a shortage of trained staff. This applies to the professional and technical groups in particular. However, there are clear indications that the increased starting salaries and numerous improved service benefits effected in the course of 1969, will enable us to obtain a better share of the available resources in this sphere. In the clerical and other sections the shortages are no longer serious and the position is improving.</p>

<p>The Department realizes that the best way to cope with the ever-increasing demand for more and better services, lies in the more effective utilization of available manpower, and we are engaged in several schemes, such as work simplification and incentive bonus schemes, in order to enhance productivity. Success has already been achieved in this sphere, and in certain cases productivity has been pushed up by as much as 30 per cent per worker. We are engaged in extending these methods to every possible sphere of work, and even at this early stage there is evidence of considerable improvement in the provision of service.</p>

<p>In addition, the new salary structure which was introduced for the technical staff on 1st April, 1969, is aimed not only at improving the remuneration of technicians in the employ <span class="col_507-508" refersTo="page_0266"/>of the Post Office, but also at drawing back qualified former Post Office technicians. In this respect we have already succeeded in getting back for the Department quite a number of former employees. Attempts have also been made at strengthening the technical staff by means of a recruitment campaign in the United Kingdom in order to obtain the services of trained cable joiners. The results are encouraging and a further recruitment team is on its way to countries abroad for the purpose of recruiting trained technicians and telephone mechanics. We hope that considerable success will be achieved in this field as well.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that under its new dispensation the Post Office has continued to take every possible and reasonable step to make up existing backlogs as soon as possible and to improve its services to the public all the time. I want to give the House the assurance that there will be no slackening in this regard, and to the Postmaster-General and the staff of the Post Office I express my appreciation for the way in which they are meeting the challenge presented by steadily increasing demands for Port Office services.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are four factors which I think will make this debate of more than usual interest in so far as it refers to the Post Office. The first is&#x2014;and I think I will have the support of a great section of hon. members of parliament on the other side as well as this side of the House&#x2014;the dismal and abject failure of this Government to meet the ever growing telephone shortage, a shortage which, we have been shocked to hear this afternoon, has now reached the huge figure of 89,0 in this country. The second point of more than passing interest in this debate are certain allegations which have been made in regard to telephone tapping. I trust that we shall hear more about that from the hon. the Minister and also from his predecessor, or whoever is speaking on behalf of his predecessor&#x2019;s party this afternoon. The third point is the appointment by the hon. the Minister, both belatedly and in a most unsatisfactory form, of the television commission. Fourthly I want to refer to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, the previous Minister of Posts and Telegraphs who it is true is only here in the form of Banquo&#x2019;s ghost at the moment. He is now Leader of a small Opposition party and will have to face up to certain allegations which have been made against him by members on that side of the House.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I want to move the following amendment:</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Post Office Part Appropriation Bill because the Government has failed, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) to create a satisfied postal staff, sufficient in numbers and with proper working conditions;</li>

<li>(b) to give the public efficient postal and telephone services;</li>

<li>(c) to provide an unbiased radio service; and </li>

<li>(d) to take active steps to introduce a nationwide television service&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>I shall give the hon. the Minister a copy of this amendment. First of all I want to refer to the last point I have made, namely the predecessor of the hon. present Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Hon. members will admit that we on this side of the House have been consistent in our condemnation of Dr. Hertzog, his predecessor, as having been largely responsible through his policies, which represented the whole policy of the other side of the House, for all the evils we have in the Post Office system and for all the shortages we have in the telephone services and in the postal services.</p>

<p>I am glad that I have the attention of the hon. Minister of Transport because there seems to be some difference of opinion on that side of the House as to whether the hon. member for Ermelo was responsible for what has happened in the Post Office. I wonder whether the hon. Minister of Transport can remember how he went along to Ermelo in 1968, shortly after the hon. member for Ermelo was dismissed from his portfolio, and replied to Dr. Albert Hertzog&#x2019;s welcoming speech. Does the hon. Minister remember that he has said the following: (I quote from <i>Die Burger</i>)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Minister Schoeman het ges&#x00EA; dr. Hertzog was as vorige Minister van Posen Telegraafwese bekwaam in sy werk.&#x201D;</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The words of the hon. Minister of Transport are in strange contrast with the words of the hon. Minister of Planning. The hon. Minister of Transport told us that Dr. Hertzog was an excellent Minister and that there was nothing wrong with his administration. We find, however, that the hon. Minister of Planning, in addressing the district committee of the Johannesburg West constituency, said the following. I quote.</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Hertzog has been put out of the Cabinet because he was so incompetent &#x2026; The Post Office could bear witness to his incompetence.</block>

<p>In analysing what went wrong in the Post Office, we should hear from these hon. Ministers why there is this clash in their respective points of view. We, on the other hand, have been consistent in that we have never claimed any virtues for the hon. member for Ermelo. But the hon. the Minister of Transport has, while the hon. Minister of Planning said that Dr. Hertzog was an inefficient Minister, that he was incompetent. What I do find strange is that this admission on the part of the hon. the Minister of Planning came after the hon. member for Ermelo had been in the Cabinet for 10 years. The hon. the Minister himself was, therefore, partly responsible for what the hon. member for Ermelo did, as was the entire Cabinet. Yet now we have an admission from a front bencher, from a member of the Cabinet, that all along the hon. member was inefficient. Why did it take them 10 years to discover this? Why was the country allowed to continue suffering under Dr. Hertzog as Minister? Why was a change for the better not made? How often have I not stood up in this House and moved a reduction in the salary of Dr. Hertzog as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs? And how often was he praised to high heaven by hon. members on that side, by his colleagues in the Cabinet including the hon. Prime Minister himself? I wonder what the attitude of the present Minister of Posts and Telegraphs is. Does he agree that his predecessor was incompetent? Or does he agree with the hon. the Minister of Transport that there was nothing at all wrong with his predecessor, that in fact he was an excellent Minister? I shall await his reply.</p>

<p>I come to another instance of what I can only call the &#x201C;credibility gap&#x201D; in the Cabinet, in the Government. This concerns this vexed question of telephone tapping. I had a reply from the present Minister to a question of mine on this matter the other day. As far as I am concerned, that reply was extremely weak. He said that his department was not listening in to conversations without the permission of the subscriber. However, he added that with modern electronic gadgets available it was technically possible to-day to listen in to telephone conversations without the persons conducting the conversation being aware of it. Against this, he added, it was impossible to take steps. What a weak-kneed reply, Sir! What an admission of failure! Surely a great deal can be done about it? Is he not aware of the special commission in the United States of America working out at the present moment possibilities of avoiding, or at least reducing, the evil of telephone tapping? Does he not realize that adequate legislation can be introduced into this House to make control effective and to make penalties extremely high on any person found guilty of telephone tapping? The hon. the Prime Minister also denied that there was telephone tapping. However, a colleague of mine, the hon. member for Umbilo, will later produce evidence of telephone tapping actually admitted by this Government.</p>

<p>I think we are entitled to demand that steps be taken to ensure that tapping only takes place when it is absolutely necessary for combating serious crime, including terrorism, and that there be a full investigation into the allegations made so far in regard to this question of telephone tapping. Furthermore, legislation should be brought in to make telephone tapping, unauthorized telephone tapping, subject to the most severe penalties.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, there was a categoric statement by the present Minister&#x2019;s predecessor when he spoke at Nylstroom. I am sorry the hon. member for Ermelo is not present in the Chamber but I trust that he will come forward and state his evidence. Although I will not necessarily accept it I should nevertheless like to hear what his evidence is. I have here a newspaper report of a speech the hon. member made in Nylstroom on the 15th November, 1969. According to this report Dr. Hertzog told a big crowd in the Nylstroom Town Hall that the telephones of very many persons were being tapped, either on order of the Government or with its consent. He told the packed hall that information thus obtained was being used against them. When a previous Minister of Posts and Telegraphs makes such a damning admission, then I submit it is of more than passing interest and that it deserves further enquiry. I trust the hon. member for Ermelo will come into this debate some time or other, or another member of his party, to explain what exactly he meant when he made that statement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>You should know; after all, he is your ally.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that I and the hon. member for Ermelo are allies. Well, let me state categorically that if ever there was a person whom I would regard as the last person whom I would ever want as an ally that person is Dr. Albert Hertzog. And I am also sure that I would be the very last person the hon. member for Ermelo would want as an ally. Why, hon. members on the other side, blame me for his being kicked out of the Cabinet! If that is so, how can he be an ally of mine? The truth, Sir, is that the hon. <span class="col_511-512" refersTo="page_0268"/>member made a very stupid remark, a remark which one should take no notice of.</p>

<p>I subscribe fully to the words of the hon. the Minister when he praised the staff for the work they were doing. We know that they are working under adverse conditions. The past year has been one of experiment. But still there are signs, growing signs as I see it, of a feeling that expectations derived from the new control of the Post Office have not been fulfilled. There appears to me to be signs of a disillusionment amongst members of the staff. It is for that reason that we stress in our amendment the question of lack of numbers in the postal staff and refer to the fact that working conditions can be further improved.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, the time has come for us to ask the hon. the Minister some questions in regard to the staff. I am not, of course, necessarily making accusations in these respects. Firstly, what is he doing about the extensive overtime the staff have been compelled to work in the past? I am not talking about the payment for overtime because that has been adjusted. I am making reference to the fact that it was admitted about a year ago that about 10 million hours were being worked overtime per year. The second question is, what about the big turnover of staff in the Post Office? What about the large number that is lost? According to the latest report, in one year no less than 12,700 out of a total staff of 50,000 was lost. Of course, one realizes that some have resigned in order to get married, others for special reasons and others due to illness, but even taking into account these factors, a loss of more than 12,000 out of a total of 50,000 is alarmingly high. Thirdly, what has happened to the small chance for promotion for members of the staff to which I have referred to often? The chances for promotion at the present moment are I believe one in six in comparison with one in 2.7 for the rest of the Public Service.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister what is being done about the long working hours in the Post Office. When he became Minister I got the impression that he did not even realize that large numbers of the staff were working more than 40 hours a week. However, I got the figures out of him later by means of a Question, and it is now revealed that more than half of the staff of 50,000, namely 29,500, worked 44 to 48 hours per week. Sir, even if it is technically not possible to have a 40-hour week throughout the Post Office, then at least recognition through higher pay can be given for any additional hours worked over 40 or 42 hours. Is the hon. the Minister going to do something about this?</p>

<p>Next I would like to know what he is doing about the growing shortage of technical and trained staff. The hon. the Minister did make some reference to it in his speech, but I am not satisfied with his reply. Mr. Louis Rive, who is now chairman of the Post Office Staff Board, when addressing the executive council of the Federated Chamber of Industry, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was unfortunate for the Post Office that this shortage was particularly keenly felt in the technological field because it was there that the biggest challenge lay and that the staff position was anything but reassuring. The shortage of skilled and technical men at present exceeded 2,000.</block>

<p>Sir, a shortage of 2,000 in the ranks of the skilled and technical men means either that the Minister is not doing enough to make a career in the Post Office attractive or wages are not high enough or there is something seriously wrong with his administration of the department.</p>

<p>Sir, I was rather concerned about a statement which I read in the Posts and Telegraphs journal of November the other day, and I think I should read this out to the hon. the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<p>Will you give me the reference?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The <i>Postal and Telegraph Herald</i> of November, 1969, page 139. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can explain this to us. In a leading article the paper says that after Mr. Rive had given details of salary concessions to representatives of the Staff Association, he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Would you like to know more about the matter?</block>

<p>That is to say, the details of salary concessions and so forth&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We regret that we have to disappoint you. According to agreement, details of salaries will no longer be published as it is not in the interests of the Service to give publicity to them.</block>

<p>Surely, Sir, this is an entirely new principle; why is this being done? Why should a person in the employ of the Post Office not know what his fellow-worker in the Post Office is getting? Why has it to be hidden? Is there something to be ashamed of in this connection? We as the sovereign Parliament surely have the right to know what is being paid to the different grades and the different groups, if not necessarily what is being paid to particular individuals. If this report is true, I regard this as a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to deal now with the postal and telecommunication service. I have not much to say about the external services. I believe they are being conducted reasonably well. I am glad to see that the Post Office and the hon. the Minister realize the importance of co-operation with the rest of the world and that we shall continue to work as a partner in the International Postal Union. In that regard I wish to assure the Government that as far as the official Opposition is concerned, we shall support the Government wherever it is attacked through the agency of the United Nations or through other agencies at conferences of <span class="col_513-514" refersTo="page_0269"/>the International Postal Union, of which our membership is so vital. I would like to express our recognition of the dignity and the restraint in the highest traditions of the Government Service, of the Postmaster-General and of his team who went to Tokyo and who had to suffer humiliation on more than one occasion. We trust that when they do go back their efforts will be more successful and that the rest of the world and particularly those countries who have been attacking us, will realize how essential South Africa&#x2019;s assistance is in promoting international co-operation.</p>

<p>But when I come to the state of affairs in regard to telecommunications internally, the picture changes and it has to be admitted that it is to-day in an entirely chaotic state. There are two aspects, firstly the aspect of the shortages and, secondly, the aspect of the kind of service rendered. I was going to tell the House that the shortage was the highest since 1951, when there was also a Nationalist Party Government in power, namely 82,297, at the end of December, 1969, but the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s figures have trumped mine. He said that at the end of March it was expected that there would be a shortage of 89,000, or 7,000 more. I wonder whether he realizes how this telephone shortage is becoming worse and worse. In December, 1967, shortly before the hon. member for Ermelo was asked to resign from the Cabinet, the shortage of telephones was 54,800.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Now it is 89,000, an increase in these three years of more than 50 per cent. Will the day come when we will have to ask the hon. the Prime Minister to take the hon. member for Ermelo back into his Cabinet as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, because he did not seem to be doing quite as badly as the hon. the present Minister. The sad thing is that this position can only get worse before it improves, by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own admission at Bloemfontein in September last year, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the problems facing my department is that requests for new services are coming in at a greater rate than the backlog can be reduced. As a result, the backlog is becoming steadily greater.</block>

<p>Instead of the backlog being reduced, it is becoming steadily greater, by the Minister&#x2019;s own admission. The last figures we have had about the number of exchanges that have been closed were that 82 were closed last year. We wonder how many are closed at the present moment because they cannot take more lines. We heard this afternoon about the new direct dialling services being instituted. There are &#x00BC; million people in Cape Town who would very much like to dial directly to Johannesburg, but we heard here that they still have to wait for some time. But on the other hand they have the one great compensation that they can dial directly to Du Toit&#x2019;s Kloof. Anyone who wants to ring the distinguished hon. Minister who has a telephone in Du Toit&#x2019;s Kloof can do so directly. That is a wonderful compensation for the lack of direct dialling to Johannesburg.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister cannot complain that we did not vote him sufficient money for this year for telecommunications and for buildings, but as far as I can judge from the figures I have, which go till November last year, and which were published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> he is spending less than the average that he should or could spend for telecommunication services, and also much less than the average per month for buildings. The hon. the Minister is looking at me suspiciously. I am basing my figures on the first eight months of the year up to November, and I am basing them on the Estimates and on what actually has been spent. But if he has been spending more in fact, and if he has actually been using his allocation for buildings and using his allocation for telecommunication services, I should be happy to hear that from him.</p>

<p>I am afraid I cannot congratulate the hon. the Minister on the figures I have up to the end of November. I shall not burden the House with reading them out, but will send them along to the Minister if he wants them. He should know what they are.</p>

<p>The second aspect in regard to telecommunication services is the utterly disastrous state of the service itself. If you are lucky enough to have a telephone in this country, you still have one of the worst services in the world. The chairman of the Federated Chamber of Industries said that it was one of the worst services in any developed country in the world. But, Sir, let me quote other people, who are closely allied with the Government. I have here the report of a statement made by Dr. M. D. Marais. Dr. Marais, as we all know, is a member of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own Economic Advisory Council. He is a director of Volkskas, and he is chairman of a number of companies. He sists in the inner circles of this Government. The report on what he said about the telephone shortage reads, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Marais said that the telephone problem was only one side of a rather sad story. South Africa has a dynamic economy, and in such an economy it is most important that the infrastructure, power, communications and transport, should keep pace with the economic development of the country. Telephones are a vital link in our communications and I think a really desperate effort will have to be made soon to catch up with the backlog and improve the service generally.</block>

<p><span class="col_515-516" refersTo="page_0270"/>Sir, I see little sign of a desperate effort being made. Then Dr. Marais added:</p>

<block name="quote">Until this happens, the country must be prepared to lose millions and millions of rands every year because of the inefficiency and inadequacy of the telephone services.</block>

<p>These are the words of a member of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own Economic Advisory Council. Does this not convince the hon. the Minister that the services are bad?</p>

However, if the hon. member is not satisfied with that quotation, let me give him another. I suppose he knows a gentleman called Dr. Tom Muller, the chairman of the Chamber of Mines, and a director of Voortrekkerpers and <i>Die Transvaler,</i> their chief organ in the Transvaal. This is what Dr. Muller says:</p>

<block name="quote">Openbare dienste soos paaie, telefone, krag en watervoorsiening hou nie tred met die ontwikkeling nie.</block>

<p>Those are the words of the chairman of the Chamber of Mines, the brother of the hon. the Minister of foreign Affairs. One can communicate with Peru, and not with Putsonderwater. One can communicate with Du Toit&#x2019;s Kloof, but not communicate with Johannesburg.</p>

<p>I believe that the state of affairs on the Witwatersrand is particularly deplorable. I have a list here in this connection, but I do not have the time to read it to the House. I hope that I shall have the time to do so later, and to point out at least 22 different things that can go wrong with a telephone when one tries to make a call. There are six things that can go wrong after you have picked up the telephone and before you dial. For instance, you can get a no-dialling tone, a number engaged tone, a number unobtainable tone, or crossed lines, or you get a variation in the intensity of the dialling tone, or otherwise the dialling tone stops suddenly. Then there are four different faults one finds while one is dialling. Then there are nine different faults after one has dialled a number. The tenth thing that happens, of course, is that you get through the first time!</p>

<p>Sir, as you know, there are several legs to my amendment. There are certain issues I would have liked to discuss further. These issues will be discussed later by other hon. members on this side. There are particularly the issues relating to television and the S.A.B.C. I have taken it upon myself to deal mainly with the Post Office and its inadequacies at the moment, as a result of the policies of the hon. the Minister. I do believe that the country is disappointed with the results that have been achieved, even after what we on this side of the House have done to get legislation through to make the Post Office a business undertaking. But, Sir, you cannot have a business undertaking unless you have a good chairman of the board or a good managing director. I am afraid that the hon. the Minister is not such a person, and that he will have to bear the brunt of what is happening in the Post Office to-day. Sir, by agreement, I only have half an hour, and therefore I should like to move my amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was fairly pleasantly surprised to see the hon. member for Orange Grove in such a subdued mood at this stage of the discussion of this Bill.

<p>A windmill would break if it were to copy the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2019;s actions. The content of his speech was almost the same as the content of all his previous speeches in this debate, and I want to make it my task to react to two points of his amendment.</p>

<p>Before coming to those few ideas of his. I want to comment upon a statement which the hon. member made in connection with the previous Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. It is unnecessary for me to say that the Opposition made it their aim to discredit that hon. Minister. The peculiar transformation is that he is now being extolled to the skies. So much so that I am reminded of the day of the opening of Parliament when the hon. member for Yeoville left his bench in great haste and embraced the hon. member for Ermelo here in fine fashion. It made me think how typical this was of the Opposition, and how typical it is of the attitude adopted here to-day.</p>

<p>In answer to the hon. member, I want to say that we have at least remained consistent. The hon. member will <span class="col_517-518" refersTo="page_0271"/>apparently not have the chance to take part in this debate. It surprises me that the hon. member for Orange Grove finds it difficult to make a proper summing-up of the present situation in respect of the hon. member for Ermelo. Does he not know from personal experience what the position is, having trodden the right path and having seen certain light beacons for years as editor of the <i>Kruithoring.</i> Then suddenly his lights were extinguished and he stumbled away in the dark. The hon. member for Orange Grove is not the only one to whom this could happen. It seems to me as if there are more members of this hon. House who could very easily experience that extinguishing of their headlights on their road through life. The hon. member should simply think of his own past, and he need not be at all astonished at what happened just opposite us here recently. I leave the matter there.</p>

<p>Now I come back to this Bill. I want to point out that since the independence of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, under the present Minister, there has been a sound level of development and sustained growth. This is remarkable by comparison with previous times. The number of employees has increased, and when one gives attention to the statement made by that hon. member, one must apply certain criteria. One must make comparisons. In the first place, it is just and reasonable to make a comparison between the present number of employees and the number of two or three years ago. I have before me a report in that connection. On 31st March, 1968, there were 40,479 persons on the approved record of service. At that time the actual staff, White and non-White, temporary and permanent, totalled 39,338. The casual workmen numbered 9,124 at that time. But on 31st March, 1969, the number on the approved record of service was no longer, 40,479, but 41,903. The actual staff, White and non-White, temporary and permanent, totalled 40,583. How can that hon. member now claim here that our staff position has deteriorated to such an extent? I believe it to be a provable fact that resignations have not increased. On the contrary, I think that there is a gradual inflow of employees, to such a degree that the hon. the Minister referred to the fact that in certain categories there was not an acute shortage. There are indeed shortage. There are, for example, shortages in respect of the technical staff. But we experience this everywhere, not only as far as the Public Service is concerned but also in the private sector. We recently saw what the Economic Research Bureau said in connection with that. There one also finds reduced employment as a result of a manpower shortage. Therefore the present employee figures do not indicate any decline whatsoever. The fact of the matter is that more and more services are being demanded. On cannot maintain the rate of full employment at the proper level. But that is not the fault of the hon. the Minister, the Department or the Government. It is as a result of the phenomenal development we are experiencing.</p>

<p>Reference was made here to the salary scales. It was claimed that the salaries were inadequate. That was stated as a reason why there was a staff shortage. My question to the hon. member is, why is there then also a staff shortage in the private sector, which is not dependent upon taxation and so on for budgeting purposes, but which can arbitrarily increase the salaries of employers and staff by cutting down on their profits? Why is there then also a staff shortage in that sphere? I now want to put a question to the hon. member, since he already gave evidence of this in a previous debate. He would probably very much like that staff shortage to be supplemented by Coloureds and Bantu, in those advanced categories as well. He would want to do that because he is opposed to job reservation, is he not? That is probably one of the solutions he is suggesting. I should like to have a reply to that question from the hon. member. [Interjections.] I know I shall not get a reply. I am therefore not waiting for one.</p>

<p>In the past year there were two salary increases, from 1st April and again from 1st October. This afforded great satisfaction. We must admit that even if the salaries were to be increased further, the staff would still not be altogether satisfied. This is not humanly possible, because there are always people here and there who are not satisfied for one reason or another, frequently also as a result of their own actions, but definitely not as a result of, the actions of the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in respect of this Department. With a view to determining whether there was and is progress, prevailing conditions must be compared with those of the past. This is a just criterion. In the first place I mentioned the mail delivery service and the handling of mail. The position has never been acute. There is still a reasonably good flow. The hon. the Minister also referred to the automation of that service, which will make it even more efficient. There are no extensive complaints about mail delivery services in our country. There is a bottleneck here and there. Even over the Christmas season there were no extensive complaints in connection with mail deliveries. That hon. member must admit that he himself probably has no complaints in connection with that service either. The hon. the Minister has pointed out how the telephone facilities are being extended. It was rightly stated that there was a large shortage of 82,0 contact points. There is a backlog in the telephone service. Since the time of the United Party it was recognized that there was a shortage, and this was stated to be the case. In a previous debate we quoted figures to prove that in other countries, older countries than South Africa, with no such phenomenal growth and development, there are also shortages in respect of telephone services. Hon. members cannot deny this statement. Let us look at the anticipated telephone shortage of 89,0. The Durban telephone service was taken over. This telephone service was not controlled by the hon. the Minister, but by <span class="col_519-520" refersTo="page_0272"/>people who are very well-disposed to the United Party and who are perhaps also members of that party, i.e. the Durban City Council. In Durban there were 13,325 names on the telephone waiting list, while to-day there are 82,0 in the entire country. What is now the percentage relationship? In Durban there were 15 per cent of the people on the contact point waiting list, while in the Republic it is 5.4 per cent. I believe that the rate of development in the entire country is much greater than the development in Durban alone. Therefore, even this argument of the hon. member, i.e. that of the fantastic telephone shortage, does not hold water. This backlog is, in fact, acknowledged, and the hon. the Minister has also stated as much here. We are not afraid to acknowledge it. We would like to see a shortage of telephone contact points in South Africa rather than a surplus. When a surplus develops in a service of this kind, it is irrefutable proof of stagnation or decline.</p>

<p>A depression.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, also a depression. How much would hon. members opposite not like to see such a situation developing before the election. However, it is too late for them because the development will continue for much longer than from now until 22nd April. To make up this backlog the provision of telephones and circuits is not all that is needed. Buildings are also necessary, and buildings for our Post Office and telephone services are no longer merely ordinary buildings. Such buildings must comply with the demands set for the accommodation of whatever is necessary for the supplying of those services. Accommodation must also be provided for staff if the necessary staff can be obtained. What plan could the hon. Opposition suggest for immediate compliance with these demands and for the provision of these services? We may really treat such statements for what they are worth. What can be done is being done by this hon. Minister and his department in order to supply these services. A moment ago I said that there were also the same problems in the days of the United Party. One of the criteria I want to apply to see what is being done in connection with all these shortages and bottlenecks is the increase in trunk lines. Over a period of four years there was an increase of 6,261. Is that not progress? Between the important cities the number increased from 236 trunk lines to 1,620. Is that stagnation or is it progress? It is definitely progress. The hon. the Minister referred to a few items, and I should also like to do so to prove my statement that that hon. member&#x2019;s argument holds no water. The 13 additional automatic telephone exchanges with a total of 33,082 lines are now available, and this will shortly also be available for Cape Town, an aspect about which the hon. member grumbled a moment ago. This will probably be available for Cape Town within a year or so. Other large centres already have it. The 35 manual exchanges with a total of 43,000 lines have been converted to automatic working and 72 have been enlarged so that an additional 53,379 lines have been made available. The five automatic telegraph exchanges were erected at Bloemfontein, Durban, Kimberley, East London and Port Elizabeth. Six automatic telex exchanges were also erected. Prior to 1965 there were only two lines available for the transmission of data. Now, however, there are 208 lines available for this purpose. I now ask that hon. member once more if there is justification for saying that our services are not expanding; that we are not trying to keep pace with development. His utterances were very unreasonable and unjustified. There are no facts in support of their statements. That is why I reject them. I could likewise mention various figures. However, I do not want to engage the House for too long a time with statistics. I am just saying that the aforementioned figures are sufficient proof that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is not deteriorating in respect of the services which should be and which are being provided. Progress is definitely being made and efficient service is being provided.</p>

<p>There is also a greater degree of satisfaction among the staff and a great deal of affection for the hon. the Minister and senior officials concerned in that department. Previously the cries of dissatisfaction were very much greater than now. Now one may go along and talk to officials. Apart from a few exceptions there is, in general, a very great degree of satisfaction prevailing among the staff. The officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have every confidence in the hon. the Minister and his senior officials to look to their interests. Because he is a member of the Cabinet of the National Government they are easy in their minds about their future. They would not have been easy in their minds had the hon. the Minister been sitting on that side of the House. But because they are aware of how their interests were served in the past, and of what the present position is, particularly since the hon. Minister Van Rensburg took over the reins, there is even more confidence and more hope. Hence the fact that our staff numbers, as I indicated, are no longer decreasing, but increasing. It is an untruth and a blunder for any one to claim that the situation has deteriorated. It has definitely improved.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Harrismith has obviously had the benefit of seeing a copy of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech. Therefore he was able to quote certain figures that were not available to us on this side of the House. I do not know what the hon. member&#x2019;s occupation is in private life when he is not in Parliament. However, if I were to hazard a guess I would say that he was an artist because his role as deputy to the hon. the Minister in matters of Posts and Telegraphs seems always to be to paint the brightest possible picture. He has performed very creditably as an artist again today. He has asked us what we would do on <span class="col_521-522" refersTo="page_0273"/>this side of the House. Before I have finished speaking I shall deal in some detail with how we would approach the problems of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as a government, as we will do after the 22nd April.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting things that has occurred during the last couple of years has been the apparent anxiety of the present Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and also the member for Harrismith to dissociate himself and the Department from all former activities of the same department and of his predecessor, the former Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. It is most marked that in every speech the hon. the Minister makes he refers to the &#x201C;agterstand&#x201D;, and he refers to difficulties that existed in the past which still have to be overcome. He also refers to &#x201C;the new start&#x201D; that will be made in the affairs of the Post Office. It seems to me that he and the hon. member for Harrismith are perpetually running away from the sad history of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the last 20 years. I should point out to the hon. the Minister that he must accept responsibility. The party to which he belongs must accept responsibility for the shocking state of affairs which existed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs under the former Minister. He belonged to the same party. He belonged to the same Cabinet and he must accept the same joint responsibility.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the staff. In spite of &#x201C;the new start&#x201D; that has been made, according to this Minister we find&#x2014;and I quote from one of his speeches made at the end of 1968&#x2014; that &#x201C;in most of the postal services the volume of work has increased three or four times, but the staff has only doubled&#x201D;. It seems to me that the Minister when he goes on to say that this is evidence of a high degree of efficiency among his staff, places a very heavy burden on the shoulders of the staff which is in fact very much overworked. The staff is overworked and yet he claims that if that overworked staff is able to produce treble or four times the amount of work that it would normally have to do, it is performing an excellent service. We on this side of the House would to-day pay tribute to the high standard of efficiency among the very hard-worked staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</p>

<p>Now there is the question of staff salaries. The improvements that have been given to the staff are welcomed by this side of the House. We have pleaded for better salaries for the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for many, many years. What to me is very surprising is the Minister&#x2019;s attitude and also the apparent attitude of Mr. Rive in regard to the question of the salaries of the staff. For example I asked the question on Friday last week: How many white employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs received a basic salary of less than R200. I believe that that is a fair question and I believe that this side of the House is entitled to the answer. But the Minister&#x2019;s reply was: The relative statistics are not readily available and compilation thereof will require a large amount of time and labour which cannot unfortunately be justified. I wonder if I put that question to the Minister after the election, if his side of the House were to be successful, whether he would also be unable to provide me with that information. Why the secrecy now? Then there is the question of the commencing salaries of the staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I believe the hon. the Minister can tell us how these compare with the commencing salaries in other government departments. I shall be much obliged to him for that information when it comes to the Third Reading of this debate. I should also like to ask him for the number of resignations, the number of dismissals and the number of retirements in the Post Office during the first nine months of this financial year. Lastly, I should like to ask him what the present staff shortage is in the department. For our information I should like him to deal in the Third Reading, if possible, with the home-ownership scheme to which he referred in his first Budget speech last year. He said at that time that there was R2&#x00BD; million available for a home-ownership scheme. The details of that scheme were still to be worked out. So far I have not seen anywhere in the Press details given of that scheme If he could possibly make them available it will be appreciated. I should like to know how many people have joined that scheme and the terms and conditions attaching to that scheme.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to-day to 108 houses that were being provided for the department. I take it he refers to departmental housing. The amount that he had available for this purpose to which he referred in his Budget speech last year, was R1,050,000 of which R300,000 was available for use in South West Africa. I should like to ask him how much has been used. From what the hon. the Minister said, I judge that 68 houses have actually been errected of the 108 being built</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also referred in his Budget speech last year to official residences. He said there were 810 official residences. I should like to ask him what additional official residences, if any, have been provided during the first nine months of this financial year. In this connection I should like to refer him to the question of an official residence for the postmaster at Simonstown. At Simonstown, as the hon. the Minister will know, a new post Office is being built but the postmaster has no accommodation in that building. In view of the importance of that post Office, the size of the post Office, and the obvious importance of the naval base concerned, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could give consideration to the provision of an official residence for the postmaster in Simonstown, either by way of a flat attached to the existing building or perhaps the acquisition of an official residence elsewhere in the town. Now I want to refer to the working conditions in the department. At the end of 1968 Mr. Liebenberg said that <span class="col_523-524" refersTo="page_0274"/>a serious situation had been reached in the department. I quote from <i>Die Burger:</i></p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister what improvements have since been made in regard to the facilities referred to by Mr. Liebenberg.</p>

<p>In regard to the provision of tele-communications the hon. Minister said in his speech last year in this House and also at the Free State Congress towards the end of last year that there was a backlog and that every effort was being made to meet the tele-communication shortage. At the end of his speech at the Free State Congress he said that he is very sensitive to public criticism. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">Ek het vroe&#x00EB;r vanjaar ook in die Volksraad verduidelik dat die Poskantoor se agterstand oor jare opgebou het en dat die probleme nie oornag opgelos kan word nie.

<p>When are we going to get some results in this provision of a better tele-communication service? At the end of 1968 there was a shortage of nearly 60,000 telephones and to-day we have heard that this shortage has increased to 89,000 telephones. Last year Parliament provided R39.5 million for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. That was an increase of R9.5 million over the previous year and yet we still have a telephone shortage of 89,000.</p>

<p>Is this also a case of &#x201C;Numbers do not matter,&#x201D; as the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has said? What was the increase in the number of telephone calls during the past nine months? It was pointed out with great acclaim by the hon. the Minister last year that in the previous three years there had been an increase of 4.3 per cent in the number of telephone calls which had been made. Reference has been made to-day to the number of telephones which have been provided during the past nine months and I would like to ask what the increase in telephone calls has been during the same period. My reason for asking that is because so often when we complain on behalf of our constituents about an inadequate or a bad service, we are told it is because of overloading. If overloading is the reason, it means that there must be more telephones than before. It also means that more telephone calls are being made daily than before. I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a matter I mentioned before in the first speech that I made in the Posts and Telegraphs debate when I first came to this House. I dealt with the number of wrong numbers which were obtained, the buzzing that took place on telephones, the crossed lines, the overhearing of other people&#x2019;s conversations and the fact that there are sometimes no dialling tones. One often dials a digit but one has to start all over again because the dialling tone recurs. I remember from that first speech I made on these matters that members on that side of the House got up and said that the Opposition was such a weak Opposition that all it can do is to complain about buzzing on telephones and getting the wrong numbers.

<p>The Minister said last year that the telecommunication system cannot be expanded and improved at short notice. But surely we are entitled on this side of the House, more particularly in the light of the fact that an election is to be held shortly, to ask whether 22 years&#x2019; notice is not sufficiently long notice to any government to provide an adequate telecommunication service. We have pleaded on this side of the House for the assistance of private enterprise to be enlisted in the provision of a better service. At the end of 1968 the hon. the Minister was reported to have said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Om die agterstand op telekommunikasie-gebied gouer uit te wis en meer telefoon-dienste gouer te verskaf, is besluit om die installering van sekere outomatiese telefoon-sentrales deur die amptelike lewenransiers van telekommunikasie-uitrusting op kontrak te laat doen.</block>

<p><span class="col_525-526" refersTo="page_0275"/>Could the hon. the Minister please tell us to what extent private enterprise has now been brought into the picture and with what success? Sir, everyone of us on this side of the House and, I am sure, hon. members on that side of the House are besieged weekly by numbers of people wanting a telephone service. I have here in my file letters from several police reservists in my constituency who require telephone services. I have elderly widows and young businessmen in my constituency who required to use the telephone after business hours and who cannot get a telephone. This also applies to young couples who have moved into new housing estates. I can think of two brand new housing estates established either by the Department or by companies with Government subsidies, where there are no telephone services at all, neither of a private nature nor of a public nature. I can think of Coloured communities who have been moved under the Group Areas Act from areas where there were public telephone boxes to areas where there is only one public telephone box or none at all. As far as direct dialling is concerned, Sir, it seems that Cape Town has to wait for direct dialling until the end of this year, and I wonder how long it will be before Durban and Pietermaritzburg get direct dialling.</p>

<p>Sir, I think my time is running out. I said that we on this side of the House should say how we feel the affairs of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be handled. First of all, we believe that in general the Post Office should be run on business lines. That does not mean that profit making should be the primary object but implies that the Post Office should be able to balance its own budget, conduct its administration on business lines, and be able to apply any surpluses towards improving services to the public as well as the working conditions of its employees. We believe that the Post Office should control its own funds through a Post Office Fund, which should be subject to the annual scrutiny of the Controller and Auditor-General and the Select Committee on Public Accounts. As to the staff of the Department, we believe that it should be a primary aim of the Department to ensure proper working conditions as well as fair wages, salaries and pensions for all employees. We believe that there should be a Post Office staff board, independent of the Public Service. This board has to a certain extent come into being in the last year as a result of the endeavours and the pleas of so many members on this side of the House. The Post Office should have its own post and salary structure adapted to its own specific needs, and cognizance should be taken of the views of the recognized staff associations. The present manpower shortage in the Post Office we will meet by proper and adequate wage and salary structures, improved recruitment of staff, including the greater use of married women, and particularly by paying special attention to the need for the training of qualified technicians. We believe that there should be a greater and more realistic use of the country&#x2019;s manpower resources while recognizing (1) the importance of the traditional divisions of labour as it exists in the Public Service and (2) the necessity for consultation with all staff associations that are involved in any such changes. Sir, as regards postal services to the public, our aim is an efficient and a speedy postal service, both urban and rural, using the most modern methods of collection and sorting and delivering. We believe in far greater use of automation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, my time is limited. We believe that the building programme should be far better planned and speeded up. We believe, in so far as mail is concerned, that the Post Office should not have the right to censor mail on its own initiative. As to tariff changes, we believe that they should only be made as the result of recognized financial measures passed by Parliament. As regards telecommunication services, we believe that the provision of an efficient, modern, speedy and comprehensive telephone, telegraph and telex service should be the primary consideration of the Post Office. High priority should be given to the elimination of the massive shortage, which has accumulated under this Government, by greater enlistment of the services of private enterprise. We believe that more call boxes should be made readily available to the public, and direct dialling and trunk services and overseas services should receive far greater attention from the Minister and his Department than they do at present. As regards the printing of directories, we believe that contracts for the printing of telephone directories should be investigated with a view to ensuring that they are more comprehensive, up to date and free from errors. As regards telephone tapping, we believe that this should be investigated with a view to ensuring the elimination of abuse and the infringement of privacy. Lastly, Sir, we believe that any changes in the telephone tariff should only be made as the result of recognized financial measures also approved by Parliament.</p>

<p>That is right. He merely made a lot of promises; he made no positive suggestion. Sir, the United Party is constantly thinking only about the telephone backlog, and in this connection they state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Telephone backlog: The United Party will work to eliminate the backlog in the supply of telephones by: (1) making more capital available for this purpose; (2) removing unnecessary restrictions on imports by manufacturers of cables and telephone equipment in South Africa; (3) making use, while the emergency exists, of private enterprise in co-operation with the Post Office for the installation of telephones.</block>

<p>Sir, that is what the Opposition is telling the country. They say it is their policy; that is how they are going to administer the Post Office. In a moment I am going to give a r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; of the history of the Post Office in recent years and I am then going to indicate what the National Party Government has done, and under what circumstances it has provided this excellent service to the public of South Africa in collaboration with our competent officials who made their contributions for South Africa under difficult circumstances. At a later stage I shall say something about the United Party&#x2019;s first point, i.e. the question of capital. I first want to say a few words about the United Party&#x2019;s statement in connection with unnecessary restrictions on the importing of requisites. They want to imply that unnecessary restrictions are being placed on the importing of components. Sir, it is this Government&#x2019;s policy, as in the case of the manufacturing of motor vehicles, that Post Office requisites, such as exchanges, etc., should also contain a certain percentage of locally manufactured material. Because it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to work in local material, there are certain restrictions; there are no unnecessary restrictions. What is more, we import from overseas, but the overseas manufacturers cannot always make deliveries. Orders are placed and those people cannot execute them for several months. But the Opposition does not also tell the House that there is a tremendous telephone shortage overseas, and that those people must first look to their own supplies before they can export to South Africa. Do you want to dispute this?</p>

What is more, the hon. member must realize that we cannot bring in private initiative from outside to install exchanges if the persons concerned do not have the technical knowledge with which to do so. Another point is that the Post Office staff must continually maintain this service so that it does not collapse, as it would have collapsed had the United Party been in power.</p>

<speech by="#zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is not so. I think South Africa can boast of its telephone service. Half the telephones in Africa are here in the Republic, this small country with only 5 per cent of Africa&#x2019;s surface area, where we have a mere 3.5 million Whites who must care <span class="col_529-530" refersTo="page_0277"/>for the large non-White community, a white nation which carries far more than its quota as a white nation, more than any other nation in the world. You cannot name me any nation in the world that has to carry as much as the Whites in South Africa do. And then the Opposition does not always give the Government its full support in what the Government is doing.</p>

<p>But I want to speak about a few other matters. The Opposition is always thinking only in terms of three things, and now they think that the public does the same. These three points are, firstly, whether I have a telephone, secondly, whether the operator puts me through immediately when I am making a trunk call and, thirdly, whether the postman has delivered my letter. This is all these people think of, and they think the public does the same. But let us give a little thought to the powerful organization, this Post Office with its magnitude and its problems, and let us also think of the good service it renders to the people of South Africa and also to the outside world, something I shall come to at a later stage. On 1st April, 1968, the Post Office became an independent business undertaking which could stand on its own feet, and I find it extremely ironic that the hon. member for Orange Grove said that the Opposition had been struggling for years to achieve this. Surely that is a lie.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, but the hon. member must read Hansard. When this Bill No. 67 of 1968 was before this House we indicated that, in 1958 in the Senate, the previous hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Hertzog, stated it as future policy that the Post Office should become independent, but this was opposed in the Senate, and I personally quoted all the relevant passages to indicate how the Opposition opposed it to a man. [Interjections.] Do hon. members now honestly want to say that Hansard lies? I have, incidentally, not got the quotations here, but next time I shall quote them for the benefit of the hon. member and he will have to swallow the statement about their people having pleaded for it in the past. The hon. member surely knows that he and his people have always opposed the independence of the Post Office, and that this Government was in favour of it. Even the hon. member for Umlazi, who is now sitting here, was one of those who spoke against it at the time, as did other hon. members who are now no longer in this House. They spoke against it and in the Senate they fought against it. The members of the United Party would not let the Post Office stand on its own feet; they wanted to keep it where it was.</p>

<p>When we think of this Post Office with its great magnitude, there are actually four facets we must bear in mind. The first is the human material, the professional men and the clerks who must do the work. No undertaking can be maintained or expanded if one does not have this, and I shall also say something about that at a later stage. Secondly, there is the capital and, thirdly, the administration, such as the Post Office staff. In addition there is, of course, the Minister at its head, the one who determines policy&#x2014;in other words, actually the National Party Government.</p>

<p>In concluding just now I shall say something about the services rendered. In bringing the three things together, the human material, the capital and the administration, one must look at the fine services which have resulted from this in the Post Office. Instead of saying thank you to-day to the officials and to the National Party for what they did, the Opposition merely creates a fuss about the shortage of a few telephones. Let us now look at this honestly.</p>

<p>I want to take a quick look at the human material. On 31st December of last year the approved posts totalled 45,831, Whites and non-Whites, 35,050 for Whites and 6,881 for non-Whites being filled, a total of 41,931. There were, therefore, about 3,000 posts that were not filled. But if 3,000 posts out of a possible 50,000 were not filled, is the fact that that staff has maintained the service and extended it further, as they have done, not something to take one&#x2019;s hat off to? The people outside have themselves cited this, notwithstanding what the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Harrismith said here about what has been done, but this is belittled by you. Those who deserve thanks do not receive it. We do not want to sidestep something we are guilty of; we do not want to run away from our responsibilities. That is why the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs immediately said that by 31st March&#x2014;that is still far away; that hon. member need not put another question onto the Order Paper about it because the Minister has already given his answer&#x2014;he expected that there would still be a shortage of 89,000; I shall also say something about that at a later stage.</p>

<p>Let us look at the staff and at what the Government has done in respect of salaries. The National Party does not merely come along now and then to give its people bribes; this Government looks after its officials. And so has the Post Office staff been cared for throughout the years. We know that there were staff requests that they be treated differently to other Public Servants. But unfortunately for the Post Office, while it was not independent the Government could not deviate from what it had done in the past in respect of salaries, because the Post Office formed a part of the Public Service and the staff had to be treated on an equal footing with the other Public Servants. There the Public Service Commission was in charge and not the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. But improvements were brought about in the past year. On 1st April, 1969, a 6 per cent pensionable allowance was granted, and from 1st April, 1970, <span class="col_531-532" refersTo="page_0278"/>this will be increased to 10 per cent. In this past year, apart from the normal increases, R12 million was given to these people by way of the allowance of 6 per cent, adjustments, etc., in respect of salary improvements alone. Sir, is this now not a Government that cares for its officials? These salaries, together with all the incentive bonuses, etc., are aimed at getting the best out of the worst clerk. It is this Government&#x2019;s motto, to see what it can get out of an official. The Government wants to get the best out of the worst man, and not the worst out of the best man, as the Opposition always does.</p>

<p>Sir, what happened in connection with our housing subsidy scheme for white officials? This scheme was approved on 13th June last year by the hon. the Minister. It is now being ensured that these officials pay a lower interest rate on their housing loans. We know that to-day building societies ask for 8J per cent on their mortgages, but according to the subsidy scheme which was instituted, the interest an official will have to pay on his housing loan will not exceed 4 per cent when his salary is less than R3,000. When his salary is between R3,000 and R9,000 the subsidy is such that he will not pay more than 5 per cent interest. Now I ask, Sir: Is this not this present Government&#x2019;s achievement? Can it still be said that this Government does not do something for its officials to make them happy and to satisfy them, in order to get only the best from them? That is why these officials give only best service to South Africa and to the Government. They do so because they are properly taken care of. We must see to it that those people have a roof over their heads. Without a roof over their heads they cannot be happy. There is now a housing loan scheme even for the man who does not have the deposit, so that he too may obtain a proper loan to enable him to acquire a house.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we do not yet have the full Estimates before us, only the Part Appropriation, but let us look at last year&#x2019;s Estimates. It is now being said by those hon. members that insufficient capital was made available, and that they would do more. If we look at last year&#x2019;s figures in connection with postal services, we notice that there was a total expenditure of R53,466,000 as against R42 million the previous year. This is an increase of 27 per cent. Could we now make an increase greater than 27 per cent available for Posts in one year? Apart from the fact that the Government must first find that money, it also has another task, i.e. to ensure that inflation does not set in.</p>

<p>Let us now take into account the position in connection with telecommunications. R1014 million was made available for this, which represents an increase of 39 per cent on the previous year. Then hon. members say that under their party more capital would be made available. No government could do more, because then again other things would be disrupted. That hon. member who is looking so askance at me will probably say again one day that the Government has spent too much, and that the Government did not combat inflation. In order to help the necessary infra-structure along and to supply the basic services, for which the Government is responsible, there must be proper spending. However, one cannot go beyond a certain notch. Last year the average increase in capital expenditure above that of the previous year was 34.5 per cent. If we are making so much more capital available, what are then the complaints and grievances of the Opposition? We also have a certain responsibility to the public to see where the money must come from. On 1st January, 1967, when the costs of telephone calls were increased from 2&#x00BD; cents to 3&#x00BD; cents, those hon. members grumbled a great deal about it.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to tell you that the service did not deteriorate. Had the Post Office not been so progressive the backlog in telephones would have been 182,0. This Government has kept pace with the expansion of our economy. The fact remains that since 1960 this National Party has rehashed South Africa&#x2019;s economy and many industries developed. We must bear in mind that our industries to-day furnish almost 30 per cent of our national revenue by comparison with 8 or 9 per cent in earlier years under the United Party administration. These are all people who must have telephones. To-day a telephone is no longer a luxury article. One just has to look at the tremendously large Offices with which any small business to-day begins. There is not only one telephone in that Office, but a whole series of them. To-day a telephone is no longer a luxury article for beginners. The present day university student has his motor car, his radiogram and his telephone. The hon. member spoke of capital. I want to mention a few figures in that connection. In 1946-&#x2019;47 approximately R20 million was spent, i.e. R8.4 per white person. What is the present-day position? In 1968-&#x2019;69 R143 million was spent, i.e. R48.1 per white person. Where they spent R8, we are spending R48 per white person. That is what this Government is doing to establish postal services, telecommunications services, etc. I know that hon. members of the Opposition are always saying that we must not only take money all the time. I am surprised that they have not already told <span class="col_533-534" refersTo="page_0279"/>me we should finance the undertaking with loans. This Opposition wants to live on loans. To-morrow&#x2019;s generation must pay, because today they want to live well and to flourish.</p>

<p>Let us look at what this Government has done over the past few years in respect of capital and loans. Since 1958 we have provided about R23 million annually from loans. In 1968-69 this figure shot up to R35 million. As the hon. member knows, the figure for the past financial year is R88 million, R18 million of which was spent on the take-over of the Durban Corporation and on South West Africa which has now been included. It is, of course, unrealistic for the figure to have shot up to such an extent, but I want to say that postal services, telecommunication services, etc., cannot be established in one day. Among other things, buildings must be erected, and the telephone exchange itself cost almost six times as much as a building. It takes time to erect a telephone exchange. In recent years we, as Government, have also had to take certain factors into consideration. One of these factors was the problem of getting the economy going after the 1960 decline. The available capital had to be used to get the economy going at that stage. Good progress has been made in that respect, but then the matter got out of hand once more and the Government had to curtail certain expenditure in order not to encourage inflation. Had the National Party not done something to combat inflation and simply made telephones available, we would to-day have had a surplus, as the hon. member for Harrismith said, but it was not necessary. Through the years we have ensured proper service.</p>

<p>Speaking about service, I want to tell the hon. member for Orange Grove something. He fortunately made a very fine gesture here, and I want to thank him for it by saying that he is going to support the National Party in every respect in the face of overseas attacks on our post Office officials, whatever the nature of the attacks may be. To-day I want to tell the House that this Government has ensured that our communications system with the outside world is as good as it can be. One of the tasks we undertook was to ensure that our communications system with the outside world was a good one. Rather let some domestic aspect be wrong, but let all overseas aspects of the system be in good order. That is also why R10.790,000 was estimated for the 1969&#x2019;70 financial year for the overseas service. I am also thinking of the R50 million which was spent on the overseas cable, with its 360 channels, which makes it a simple matter for us to-day to speak to any country within the space of a second. That is why Mr. Tom Muller said that one gets through to Peru more quickly than to Putsonderwater. That is because our overseas service is such a fine one. There are only 18 countries in the world that have more telephones than South Africa, and these include America, England, France and the other great powers.</p>

It is this Government&#x2019;s function and task to ensure the expansion of our overseas exports. It is this Government which must find overseas markets. It is this Government which must ensure that our maize does not lie here and rot, as the Opposition wished it would in 1960 with the referendum. That is why we must be able to make contact with the outside world, so that our business men may negotiate with them. Our overseas service is of the very greatest importance. I say that for me it is of greater importance than this small backlog of telephones which have not been installed.</p>

<p>The survey &#x201C;The World&#x2019;s Telephones&#x201D; by the &#x201C;American Telephone and Telegraph Company of the United States of America&#x201D; gives the number of telephones in America in 1965-&#x2019;66. The improvement from 1965 to 1966 was 5.5 per cent. South Africa&#x2019;s was 5.7 per cent. South Africa beats even America as far as that is concerned. Not only in respect of that one year. The survey also gives the percentage growth in the 10 years from 1956 to 1966. South Africa&#x2019;s service improved by 68 per cent as against 66.5 per cent for the U.S.A. I could similarly quote an entire table for hon. members. The highest percentage is that in respect of the Netherlands, i.e. 9.3 per cent, but I could quote a whole series of countries that are beaten by South Africa, among others the U.S.A. Sweden and Denmark, all developed countries. In this sphere South Africa is far ahead of them.</p>

<p>I also think that, over the past number of years since 1948, the National Party Government has considerably improved the postal services in South Africa. On 22nd April the electorate will also honestly declare their gratitude by placing their crosses behind the names of all the National Party candidates.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very unusual for me to participate in a debate on telephone and telegraph matters. I have no sympathy with the hon. member who has just sat down, who has continually tried to bring a question of staff into this debate. The reason why I do not usually participate in this Vote, is because, being a subscriber in Natal and in a rural area as well to various telephones, I am keenly aware of the difficulties which the staff have to contend with in trying to cope with the situation which has developed in South Africa because of the phenomenal <span class="col_535-536" refersTo="page_0280"/>growth which has taken place over the last number of years. What I was waiting for the hon. member to say, was that we had a first class telephone system in South Africa. I wanted him to nail his colours to the mast and to say that this was a first-class telephone system that we have. The reason why I come into the debate in particular to-day, is because I want to deal with the Durban telephone system that was taken over last year by the Minister&#x2019;s department.</p>

<p>In the past while our telephone system, which was privately owned by the Durban Municipality, was under the immediate control of the City Council, there were complaints which I suppose are inevitable in any telephone system, telephones being what they are. But I want to say that since the telephone system in Durban has been taken over by the Post Office I have never seen a more disgraceful change in any public system of any kind whatsoever, including telephones, railway, roads or posts.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klip River is apparently identifying himself with the take-over because he says: Durban was bad before we took it over. Is he one of those who took it over? Is he one of the people responsible for the take-over? [Interjections.] I want the hon. member for Klip River to answer. You see, Sir, that when I put the question to him point-blank he refuses to answer and does not admit it. He knows perfectly well that he does not dare admit that he is one of those responsible for the Durban telephone exchange take-over and having it in the position it is to-day. The hon. member comes from Natal and knows perfectly what the position of the Durban telephone exchange is. It is an absolute and utter disgrace for the hon. the Minister and for the Government. It has been said by those who carefully keep tabs on their calls that if an instrument in Durban gives you a wrong number after you have dialled the right one and you are cut off and have to dial again, you are charged with that call which has been wasted. Will the hon. the Minister say if that is so? In the absence of a reply to a perfectly simple question I gather that either the hon. the Minister does not know or he is afraid to admit that it is so and that one is charged for the wasted call. If those wasted calls are charged up against the subscriber this is scandalous. It is getting near to sharp practice. Before, when there was a manual exchange and the operator gave you a wrong number, you went back to the operator who gave you the right number without charging for having given you a wrong number.</p>

<p>Do you want to go back to a manual exchange?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to go back to a reasonable interjection, if there is to be one at all from a grown-up man instead of this childish chatter we get from hon. members opposite. They are like a lot of juveniles who cannot control their tongues. They are nearly as bad as the Durban telephone exchange in giving you wrong replies. They are even more wooden-headed about it and do not even appreciate it any more than the Durban telephone exchange appreciates it. The position in so far as those wasted telephone calls are concerned is as follows. One can dial four times in a row without getting the right number. Those calls are then charged against you as a subscriber. What moral right has the Government to collect that revenue? This is not a question of staff, but a question of the breakdown of the machine, of the organization. That is the position to-day. The Government took over the Durban telephone system after all these years and the least one could have expected was that it was going to remain at the level of efficiency at which it was when it was taken over. I lay this entirely at the door of the hon. the Minister. About two years ago, if my memory serves me correctly, the ex-Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, the hon. member for Ermelo, sent a circular to us telling us that the charges were being raised so as to accumulate capital for the purpose of extending our telephone services. The basic reason given in the circular was that the charges were being raised to accumulate capital. They were short of capital and charges were being increased so that money would be accumulated to help them to catch up on the backlog. Since then we have heard nothing more about that. But I hope the hon. the Minister will not say anything to us about shortage of capital, because the Minister of finance has already salted away about, if I remember correctly, R360 million, but no doubt when the time comes he will be presenting another budget here showing another tremendous surplus. When this money is collected from the taxpayer of South Africa like this, it should be used for the taxpayers of South Africa, whatever the services may be. This is a new departure to have a separate Budget for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. That is in order. However, when we are so woefully served as we are at the present time, if it is capital that is necessary, the capital <span class="col_537-538" refersTo="page_0281"/>should be found from the overflowing coffers of the Government at the present moment. The money is there, if that is what is necessary. However, I submit that it is not the money that is lacking. What is lacking is the know-how and the capacity to plan ahead of the Minister. Because the fault may not only lie with the present Minister. Perhaps he is only a little worse than the previous Minister and not a great deal worse. I do not know. There is a lack of planning, a lack of capacity to look ahead, a lack of faith in South Africa, a failure to have the faith and the trust in our ability to forge ahead in the way that we have been doing over the last three or four decades. That is what is lacking. There is a lack of trust in South Africa, in its development and in its people. The head of the department, the man who is responsible to Parliament, the Minister, has failed hopelessly to keep up with the times and keep abreast of the development that was coming.</p>

<p>I want to come back to this question of the break-down in Durban. This breakdown was technical. The Minister is now talking about trying to get recruits elsewhere. But it is not after everything is sinking and falling to pieces that you start looking for recruits. Why was this not done long ago? Why were there not special training facilities provided if necessary, so that those people could be available? If it was going to take years to train them, the answer is that years ago it was quite obvious what was coming to us in South Africa in regard to the whole telephone system. Two years ago the ex-Minister of Posts and Telegraphs indicated quite clearly that he was aware of what was happening. He wanted the extra money to take the steps to provide for it. However, the people have not been trained and they are not there. When one sees how the electricians, not only on the Durban system, but also out in the rural areas, have to work morning, noon and night, are called out over week-ends, called out in all kinds of weather, called out at any time during the 24 hours to go and assist and to try to give us anything like a reasonable service and one notices how overworked they are, it is no wonder that the machine is breaking down. The human machine is breaking down. Flesh and blood cannot stand the way in which these people have to work at the present time. I lay this all at the door of the hon. the Minister and the Government for lack of foresight and inability to plan and to foresee what they were going to be called upon to deliver in the way of an efficient telephone service to us.</p>

<p>Another point in connection with the telephone system that I should like to refer to in passing is the applications for telephones. Like other members, I suppose, I receive scores and scores of applications for telephones and requests for help. Elderly folk living away from any neighbour want a telephone because they suffer from some or other ailment which requires a doctor perhaps at short call. They need a telephone to help them. We come across numbers of that kind of case. Recently I had a case where eventually the appropriate telephone authority, in reply to my enquiry, told me that there were so many applications and in regard to this particular application I was in error in regard to the date of the application. He told me that it had been received at a date some two years previously but it had been cancelled. So I went back to the man and told him he should not do this to me; when he cancels his application he should let me know. He replied that he never cancelled it. So there was a bit of a barney. I went back to the postal authority and was informed that the man concerned did not cancel the application. They cancelled it because they did not have enough cables. When an application comes in to an Office like theirs and there are not sufficient cables, the application is cancelled. What is this? When therefore I want to know how many applications there are, what the backlog is in regard to some of these post Offices and I am told that the backlog is so many, I do not want to find out that applications have been cancelled because there were not enough cables. I do not think that is good enough. I want to know how many applications there are. Let us see the full picture. In regard to the figure of 89,000 mentioned by the hon. the Minister to-day, I should like to know how many applications they themselves cancelled on account of a shortage of cables.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>It may be another 89,000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>It may be another 89,0. I do not know. This kind of consideration casts doubt on the effectiveness of the figures that the hon. the Minister has given us this afternoon and on their reality. It may be that they are continually wiping off a whole bunch of long standing applications on the grounds that they were cancelled as a result of the shortage of cables. Therefore you have to start all over again and make a fresh application. It is only the fresh applications apparently that are to be counted. It would be interesting to know from the hon. the Minister when he replies how many cancellations he has had, say, over the last 12 months. I refer to those cancelled by his department.</p>

<p>There is another point with which I should like to deal. If I may go back for a moment, I hope that when the time comes, the hon. the Minister is going to tell us about these faulty calls that are continually coming through and which build up our telephone accounts. I am not referring to the calls we do not get, but the calls which we get to the wrong number and have to cancel and start all over again. I do not know whether it is possible to calculate the amount of revenue involved in those figures. In so far as the City of Durban is concerned, it must run into a fantastic amount every year. I think a fantastic amount of money is involved in those wasted calls. I hope the hon. the Minister is going to tell us what he is going to do about it because he has no <span class="col_539-540" refersTo="page_0282"/>moral right or claim whatsoever to hold onto the money he is getting through a wasted call where the machine itself lets one down like that, no more than if you were to put a penny in the slot of a stamp machine, and, instead of getting the stamp, you find that the machine is empty with no means at all of getting your penny back. In the past they stopped all that because they were continually finding that they could not give you your penny back. The whole thing was closed off. That was a penny in a slot machine. This, however, is a much more expensive pastime than that. I hope the hon. the Minister is going to tell us what he is going to do on moral grounds to see that people are not called upon to pay for these wasted calls because of a breakdown of machines. I have had a case myself only recently. Because of certain domestic matters I had to get calls through to Durban. I put a call through one afternoon from here to people in Durban. After waiting and calling and so forth, I was told eventually that there was no reply. I said that that was absolutely wrong and asked to be put through to the supervisor. I knew there were people there waiting for this call to come through. They did their best and subsequently they said that there was no reply. I said: Look, I am sorry, I am not accepting this. Will you please check again. I said that I had to have the call and that the people were there. I asked whether the line was down and was told no but that there was no reply. They told me a third time that there was no reply. Two days later when I went to Durban I saw this relative and asked what happened. She then said that there was one ring on the telephone, that she picked up the receiver immediately which gave her the engaged signal. Every time she picked the receiver up for several hours after that, she got the engaged signal. She then went to a neighbour and got through to the faults people. After these people checked up they said in reply to her query: We are sorry, a switch was left on by mistake. Well, I know nothing about that, but I do not believe that a switch was left on by mistake. That is the one thing I do not believe about that. This is the kind of thing that is happening under the telephone system that we have at Durban under this Minister at the present time.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I should like to deal with another matter. I do not wish to talk about Current Affairs and all the rest of this clap-trap that we get over the S.A.B.C. at the present time. I want to speak about the ordinary use of English by the S.A.B.C. in its broadcasts. I doubt whether you get one out of three&#x2014;you may get one in three&#x2014;of the ordinary news broadcasts over the S.A.B.C. which does not make some grave mistake in English grammar. This morning. I think it was during the 8 o&#x2019;clock news, when they were referring to a breakdown or a derailment of trains it was said that the passengers were taken across this gap and they were taken to trains which were waiting on either side of the derailment. Of course, they were not waiting on either side of the derailment. They were not, you know. There were no trains on either side. There were trains on both sides of the derailment.</p>

<p>I will not worry about what that hon. Minister is saying. I think it is time the S.A.B.C. should get an English-speaking person to do the proof reading before the news is broadcast. This should be done because other people may be listening to the S.A.B.C.&#x2019;s broadcast. Just imagine what a person living in Lesotho must think of this shocking misuse of the English language. They would think it is terrible. Imagine a person living at Stegi in Swaziland who is monitoring our broadcasts, having to comment about this misuse of the English language? These are the things which, as far as I am concerned, condemn the S.A.B.C., without such nonsense as &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; even being taken into account. They cannot even put across a broadcast in decent English to such an extent that it is becoming scandalous. I wonder whether our Afrikaans-speaking people would permit Afrikaans to be misused in such a way as English is being misused by the S.A.B.C. Perhaps some hon. member on that side of the House can tell us.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for South Coast let off steam here at the beginning of his speech, but as a result of this, however, he increased his blood pressure unnecessarily. He let off steam about the Durban telephone system. He raised many complaints in connection with the state of affairs after the take-over of the exchanges of the Durban Corporation by the Department. I tried to listen to what the hon. member had to say, but since I do not know too much about the conditions there, I cannot reply to it. The hon. member will probably discuss the aspects which he mentioned. However I listened to what the hon. member had to say, but I did <span class="col_541-542" refersTo="page_0283"/>not hear a specific complaint against the Minister&#x2019;s Department. All the complaints which he raised in this connection, are in the air.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to something which the hon. member for Simonstown had to say here. The hon. member expressed his thanks in connection with the increase in the salaries of post Office staff. We all agree with it. However, he did not omit to say that they, the Opposition party, had pleaded for it. He is now trying to convince the world that these salary increases and the improvements in the postal structure took place as a result of the pleading of the United Party. That is nonsense, of course.</p>

<p>Throughout this debate we have heard the hon. members on that side of the House talking about the shortage of telephones. Everyone raised it. We have a very honest Minister and he did not deny that there is a shortage of telephones. He mentioned that there would be a waiting list for 89,000 telephones at the end of March. These statistics were not raised at all by the hon. members on that side of the House; on the contrary, these statistics were furnished by the Department who were honest enough to say that there would be a waiting list of approximately 89,000 at the end of March. We know that this shortage presents one of the greatest challenges to the Minister and his Department because we really expect from this planning division of the Department a kind of intuitive vision or an anticipatory feeling for places where development of townships and the establishment of industries is going to take place. Because as soon as that development has taken place, the public immediately expects telephones to be made available, on request. We must accept that the telecommunications system cannot be extended so considerably at short notice. We cannot expect new buildings and new exchanges to be made available at short notice. The necessary planning must take place long before the time. If I remember correctly&#x2014;and I do not think that my memory will leave me in the lurch in this connection&#x2014;the hon. the Minister said in 1968 when he accepted the post that he expected the shortage of telephones to increase and that the position would remain the same for the next five years, but that the shortage would decrease after three years, that is by 1971, because the planning would then begin to bear fruit. Sir, I believe this and I want to accept it as such. Therefore we should not criticize in season and out; we should wait until the planning which the Minister and his Department have done ahead, begins to bear fruit.</p>

<p>Sir, there have been many complaints about the provision of telephones, however, I should like to thank the hon. the Minister. In my constituency, which comprises one of the major growth areas on the eastern side of Pretoria, there was also a great demand for telephone services as a result of new township development. I presented these requests for telephones to the Minister and his Department and I want to tell you that the Minister and his Department showed great willingness. Every time I put forward a request for telephone services to the Department, I was satisfied that the matter had been investigated very thoroughly. The result was that many of those people have in fact received telephones. The prospects in my constituency, as a result of the establishment of an automatic exchange on the border of my constituency, are that a great number of the persons whose names still appear on my waiting list, will also be provided with telephones in the near future. Sir, it is as a result of the harmonious co-operation which exists between the Minister and his staff that these requests can be met. In this connection I just want to mention that the hon. the Minister receives thanks and recognition from his staff for what he does. He can therefore rely on their loyal support. In this connection I should like to quote from a newspaper which has often been quoted here. For example, the hon. member for Orange Grove quoted from it last year, and did so again a moment ago. I refer to <i>The Postal and Telegraph Herald,</i> the official magazine of the Posts and Telegraphs Society of South Africa. I quote what the editor wrote in the edition of September 1969 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During his short term as Minister the hon. Mr. Van Rensburg by his purposeful actions and the way in which he negotiated with the staff societies &#x2026;</block>

<p>And remember, Sir, that the editor of this magazine knows more about what is going on in the Post Office than the hon. members of the Opposition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; proved his good faith because when it was justified, he always had a sympathetic ear. It undoubtedly made a deep impression on us and his earnestness to reach his goal, to make a success of an &#x201C;Independent Post Office&#x201D; by means of a happy staff, has already been confirmed on different occasions by his actions. It is a special privilege for us to state what a high regard we have for Minister Van Rensburg and that we are thankful for what he has already achieved in his effort to achieve a noble goal. We should like to assure him that the Society is right behind him in this effort because we know what kind of person he is.</block>

<p>Sir, I should like to underline those few thoughts: We have a happy staff under this Minister and &#x201C;the Society is right behind him because we know what kind of person he is&#x201D;. Here we have a fine testimonial for the hon. the Minister from the editor of this newspaper, but we have another testimonial for the Minister from Mr. J. M. Liebenberg, the president of the Posts and Telegraph Society, in his Christmas and New Year message (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a society we first express our thanks to the hon. Minister Van Rensburg; we are conscious of the fact that he has done his <span class="col_543-544" refersTo="page_0284"/>very best for the staff of the Post Office. You have already done a great deal to achieve the ideal of a satisfied and happy staff and we wish to assure you of our loyalty and our appreciation.</block>

<p>In this message we have another reference to &#x201C;a happy staff&#x201D;. This is totally in conflict with what the hon. members of the Opposition tried to make us believe here in the debate. Sir, these people do not merely express thanks to the hon. the Minister; they also express their thanks and acknowledgment to the Government in respect of the salary increases which they received. It is already known, and has been said here repeatedly, that the staff receives a 6 per cent pensionable allowance as from 1st April, 1969, and an added allowance of 4 per cent as from 1st October, 1969, the determined allowance of 10 per cent was consolidated in the basic salary scales as from 1st October, 1969. The staff then expressed their gratitude to the Government for these salary increases, and in the September edition of this same newspaper from which I have just quoted, the following appears in the article &#x201C;News from Elsewhere&#x201D;. This news comes from Pretoria, from where we are constantly hearing rumours of strife (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is Tuesday, 12th August, 1969, and here is the news&#x2014;The Big News&#x2014;announced by the honourable, our own Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, that the Post Office officials&#x2019; 4 per cent allowance, with consolidation of the salaries, which would only have been applicable next April, has been back-dated by six months and will thus take effect as from 1st October, 1969. Say &#x201C;thank you&#x201D;, to the authorities and the Union&#x2014; this is the best piece of news since the moon landing.</block>

<p>Our team&#x2019;s fine performance in the cricket test was of course not known at that time! The president of the Posts and Telegraph Society had the following remarks to make (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More history was made this year by the greatest number of promotions we have ever had. To all of you who did so well, my heartiest congratulations.</block>

<p>Note: &#x201C;The greatest number of promotions&#x201D; in the history of the Post Office. Never before have so many benefits and salary improvements swamped the post Office staff in one year. Sir, these are grateful people; they are loyal people; they deserved it, and we know that they stand loyally behind the Minister, who is, after all, the go-between between them and the Government. The hon. member who spoke first, the hon. member for Orange Grove, asked in his amendment, as was expected, that positive steps be taken to introduce a television service for the whole country. I am sorry the hon. member for Orange Grove did not talk about television. In the past we have often argued about that matter.</p>

<p>I should just like to express a few thoughts about the matter. The Opposition has always exaggerated the so-called advantages of television. I remember how they said what a good educational aid it would be, etc., and I, amongst others, stated as an ex-teacher, that the teacher could never disappear from the classroom and that television could only be an expedient. In the meanwhile we know that universities and many other places have been provided with closed-circuit television. The question as to whether South Africa should introduce television, will be investigated very thoroughly and be answered by the commission of inquiry which the Government appointed in December, 1969. This commission will be able to examine the pros and cons of the whole matter. The Government gives the commission, which consists of experts, the opportunity to hear evidence and then to report on this means of communication. The purpose of the commission is to investigate and report on the desirability or undesirability of the introduction of a television service, and if desirable, to investigate the nature of the television service in South Africa, taking certain factors properly into account. The factors which must be taken into account with a view to the possible introduction, are very clearly defined in the terms of reference, but I should just like to refer to two which seem important to me. The first is the necessity for taking into account the heterogeneous population of South Africa, and the particular needs which arise from this. There are great differences in the composition of the population of the Republic, and we have, and still are following a policy of differentiation, and we have been and still are particularly wary of the process of equalization. Should television be introduced, it must be done in such a way that we do not expose ourselves to the forces which may destroy or break down our national identity.</p>

<p>A second factor which must be taken into account, is the possible detrimental effect which such a service could have on the morals and the customs of the people, and especially on the youth. For this reason I also emphasized this in the past in speeches here. It is of the utmost importance that it be taken into account. Personally, I would welcome this aspect being mentioned plainly and specifically in the terms of reference of the commission. It is vitally important to me. When the late Dr. Verwoerd spoke in the Assembly about television on 9th March, 1960, he said amongst other things (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not only the destruction of man&#x2019;s body, but also the destruction of man&#x2019;s spirit which demands the attention of the government &#x2026; In this case the attitude which can be adopted when a new discovery contains danger, is that one should rather be careful and not import that discovery <span class="col_545-546" refersTo="page_0285"/>before knowledge about the modern instrument is available to avert wrong consequences.</block>

<p>This was in 1960, ten years ago, and it can rightly be said that the moral standards of the world have not improved since then, but other countries have in fact gained more experience of television. We can learn from their experience, and that knowledge will also be available to the commission. But Dr. Verwoerd also stated on 9th March, 1960, Hansard column 3002, that the government adheres to certain principles in regard to television, and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first principle is this: No Government can or will lightly say that it is going to keep any invention permanently out of its borders, nor have we ever done so &#x2026; Television cannot be kept out permanently, but its introduction must wait until we are able to counter any of the possible evils which are being experienced elsewhere.</block>

<p>What has happened now, although there is criticism from the side of the Opposition and other persons, about the appointment of this commission of enquiry, and the prescribing of definite factors which must be taken into account, is precisely in accordance with what Dr. Verwoerd had already laid down in 1960.</p>

<p>The implications of the conditions which were entrenched clearly in the terms of reference of the commission, are far-reaching. We must not lose sight of two matters. The first is that the commission will not and need not necessarily recommend the introduction of television, but on the other hand the introduction of such a service would depend on its recommendations. But in addition with the appointment of the commission the government has not bound itself in advance to introduce television, as many people try to deduce. If this does happen, and if we decide to introduce such a service, something special could be created within the framework of the guiding lines which were laid down, to suit the conditions in the country and which can reject the disadvantageous factors which are present in the overseas television services. It could therefore be possible that the Republic will be able to benefit from the advantages of television without being saddled with the disadvantages.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort has behaved quite predictably this afternoon. He has thanked the Minister. That is the routine that we have come to expect from that side of the House. The previous speakers in the debate this afternoon from that side of the House have been trying to justify the indefensible and the unjustifiable, but I want to put just one thought to hon. members opposite. If the question were put to the electorate on the basis of a referendum instead of a general election: &#x201C;Are you or are you not satisfied with the telephone services in South Africa?&#x201D;, the result would be an overwhelming</p>

<p>&#x201C;No&#x201D;, which even the &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; vote from Du Toit&#x2019;s Kloof exchange would not influence in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>I want to revert to the question of staff. A great deal has been said about the shortage of staff and I am indebted to the hon. the Minister for a complete reply to a question I tabled for answer on Friday. There are certain very disturbing aspects in regard to the figures supplied by the hon. the Minister, because they showed that of an authorized establishment of 45,800, there are over 9,000 temporary members of the staff, which represents 20 per cent, and the actual vacancies represent 3,900, or 8&#x00BD; of the total. In short, Sir, in the case of 27 per cent of the authorized establishment of the Post Office, we find temporary staff, or else the situations are vacant. Now the Minister has indicated that various echelons of staff are in training, but I submit that even when these positions are filled, they will only influence the backlog which exists at the moment.</p>

<p>Sir, we have to examine the shortage of staff in the light of the efficiency of the actual services provided by the Post Office. Here I want to associate myself with the remarks made on both sides of the House, paying tribute to the staff of the Post Office and the postal services, particularly the senior staff. I believe that they find themselves in a very difficult position. They carry out their duties in a dedicated manner, but they are hamstrung by the ideological and outmoded ideas of this department in regard to the use of labour. One also wonders whether this shortage of labour, particularly skilled technical labour, would have existed to-day had the National Party not discontinued our former immigration policy. If this had not been done, I could visualize that many trained, technical people, so urgently needed in South Africa, would to-day be naturalized citizens of South Africa.</p>

<p>Then one can ask: What are the affects of this shortage of staff? I would say that it affects most of the echelons of postal activity. I would say that it causes the telephone backlog. It results in an inadequate postal delivery service, and it also results in the infrequent clearance of post-office boxes.</p>

<p>As far as the telephone backlog is concerned, figures which have been quoted this afternoon appear to show a disparity with the figures which were given to me in reply to my question on the number of vacancies for technical staff. I believe that one of the log-jams exists because of this shortage of technical staff. I want to refer to the overall figure of outstanding telephone applications, namely 89,000, which was given to the House this afternoon, and compare it with the figure which represents the shortage in the Durban complex alone. The shortage in the Durban complex alone, as given to me by the hon. the Minister, is 14,500. This shows that in that particular area, the shortage in proportion is even greater than in many other parts in South Africa. The complaints from members of the public, which <span class="col_547-548" refersTo="page_0286"/>were referred to by the hon. member for South Coast, become more and more difficult to deal with and to understand. I find it absolutely shocking to have to receive a telephone call from a person saying: &#x201C;I am sorry to worry you as a member of parliament. My telephone has been out of order for a month. I have reported this on numerous occasions. I have finally written officially, but I have received no reply. I have had the same telephone for 30 years. I live alone with my sister. A telephone is necessary.&#x201D; A telephone call, as a public representative, to a courteous official resulted in that telephone service being restored the same day. But, Mr. Speaker, it should not be necessary for public representatives to have to become involved at that level, because the department is unable to carry out its function. When it comes to the moving of a subscriber&#x2019;s telephone from one zone to another, this is almost worse than moving from one country to another, because if one moves to America, I believe that one is generally provided with a telephone within 24 hours. Here, after having had a telephone service for many many years, persons who move find that they can be given no certainty as to when a telephone can be supplied to them, even in cases of illness. The hon. member for Simonstown referred to the people in new housing areas. My heart bleeds for these people. Many of them are newlyweds who have saved up and bought a house in a growing suburb. They then want a telephone, but, due to the planning, which seems to have been so badly overlooked for so many years, no hope is held out for these people. When they ask when they can expect a telephone, the answer is usually a vague one. When they advance reasons why they should receive sympathetic consideration, the facilities are just not available. The &#x201C;stork&#x201D; telephone for women who have a pregnancy which may involve complications, is almost unobtainable to-day, even with a doctor&#x2019;s certificate. The shared line facility is also something which is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. I know, because there is a large new residential area in my constituency. I know the frustrations these people have to put up with. I say this with great concern because they feel that there is something wrong in the manner in which telephones are being allocated.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the question of the inadequate postal delivery service. Here again I quote a local case. I was speaking to a person in my constituency who resides four miles from the post Office. She had a parliamentary matter she wanted to discuss with me. I said that I would send her a copy of the reply I had received. She said that it would be much quicker for her to collect it personally, as it would take my letter four days to reach her in Mayville, four miles away. That is one mile per day, Sir. Before the war, well over 20 years ago, in the business area of Durban, there were three deliveries a day, and in the suburbs there were two deliveries a day. Now, for many years during this Government&#x2019;s term of Office, the number of deliveries in the city area has been cut down to two. The suburban areas, which border on Berea, are privileged to have one delivery a day. What is the result of this, Sir? We now have Boeings, speeding between the various cities in the Republic, covering the distance in a matter of hours, and yet a letter can be delayed in delivery to the recipient for a period in excess of 24 hours, simply because there is one delivery a day. If a letter arrives after a postman has gone on his beat, it has to wait until the next day. I believe that this is shocking.</p>

<p>This problem can be overcome so easily in certain areas. It is no use saying that there is a shortage of postmen, because as far as Natal, and particularly Durban, is concerned, there is a ready reservoir of labour. The postal delivery service in Durban is already employing more Indian postmen than white postmen. I have never heard a single complaint against any of these Indian postmen, who carry out their duties with extreme courtesy and with great efficiency. I want to suggest to the Minister that the time has come for these people to be given a greater opportunity to give the public the service to which they are entitled. I know that there is no lack of applicants for postmen jobs amongst the members of the Indian community. In fact, some of the applicants have matric certificates. They are unable to find other positions, and are prepared to work as postmen with matric certificates. I am told that, as soon as it becomes known in the postal department, that these people have matric certificates, they are allocated to other positions, but the fact remains that there is a ready reservoir which could be used to give the public the services they deserve.</p>

<p>In so far as infrequent clearances of letterboxes are concerned, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can give some indication as to whether any standard pattern exists in the various heavily built-up areas. I have before me a copy of a letter addressed to an irate citizen, who complained that the discs which are normally put on the post boxes and which indicate the time of the next collection did not appear to be changed in the area in which he lived. He mentioned several post boxes in his vicinity. The postal authorities in Durban were quick to apologize and to indicate that in future, instructions would be given that the discs should indicate the time of the next collection. My query is this: The letter reveals that as far as some letter-boxes are concerned, they are cleared from Mondays to Fridays once a day at 12.30 p.m., but they are cleared twice on Saturdays, and once a day, at 6.00 a.m. on Sundays and public holidays.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could indicate whether there is some standard arrangement in this regard because I doubt whether members of the public are aware that when they post a letter at a post box it may not be cleared for another 12 hours, if it is only cleared once in every 24 hours. I believe that the public are misled because they are under the impression that their letters are <span class="col_549-550" refersTo="page_0287"/>being cleared fairly regularly. I do know that the post boxes outside actual post Offices are cleared more regularly, but people who do not have ready access to those post Offices are left with a post box which offers one collection service in 24 hours. I believe we have advanced beyond the stage where that is adequate for the public of South Africa. Then I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether this low frequency of collection from post boxes is due to the labour shortage and, if so, what steps have been taken and what steps he intends to take to overcome the labour shortage. If it is a question of drivers for postal vehicles, I also believe that a ready reservoir of drivers exists who could work efficiently in that capacity.</p>

<p>Then I want to reiterate an appeal which I made to the hon. the Minister in a debate last year. When I said that I had a constructive suggestion to make I noticed that the hon. the Minister who was sitting opposite me at the time perked up considerably. I thought that he might take this into consideration but apparently he does not feel that it is worthwhile. We have heard this afternoon of the congestion that exists in our telephone service and of the frustration that is experienced by people who have to go on dialling numbers that are engaged or who are unable to get the number required because of a busy exchange. I want to ask the hon. the Minister seriously whether he will not give consideration to my repeated suggestion. I notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> that advertising space is taken to suggest to readers that they should do certain things to ensure a satisfactory telephone service. It says that you should read about the special services offered, avoid long conversations, be sure of the number you want before making a call, answer your telephone promptly and speak distinctly. May I ask the hon. the Minister to make one addition to those four remarks, that is to suggest to subscribers that they give instructions to their young children and their servants not to answer the telephone unless they are capable of giving or taking messages efficiently. I think it is a most frustrating, time-consuming and unnecessarily expensive experience, to ring numbers time after time only to be told by a servant or a young child: &#x201C;Mummy is not here&#x201D; or &#x201C;madam is out&#x201D;, when the telephone is answered by a person who is unable to give the information which is sought. I believe that this is something which could be put across to the public. I think that their co-operation would help to make an inefficient telephone service a little more efficient.</p>

<speech by="#engelbrecht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (Berea) really came out with a few ridiculous ideas here. If he thinks the hon. the Minister and his Department must prevent children and servants from answering telephones, then I really do not know what he will ask for next. If the hon. member wants to hold a referendum on telephones I am afraid he will lose by a big margin. The people who have telephones will all vote for the Government and the few who still do not have telephones will be greatly in the minority. South Africa can boast of a very good communications system, both as far as postal and telephone services are concerned, if one takes into consideration the tremendous development which has taken place in this country over the past decade. We can boast of a very good telephone system and postal service and yet hon. members on the opposite side make use of this opportunity year after year to turn this venerable place into a wailing wall as far as this subject is concerned. The lamentations one has to listen to here are simply heart-rending; to listen to those hon. members one would think our entire communications system was in a deplorable condition. The hon. member complained that temporary staff and vacancies comprised approximately 27 per cent of the staff complement of the Department. This is nothing unusual in our country with its tremendous manpower shortage.</p>

<p>The hon. member stated; &#x201C;It is hamstrung by ideological ideas in connection with labour.&#x201D; I do not know what he means by that. It is absolute nonsense. I should also like to refer to the rapid progress and the efficient service which has been rendered by this Department since the Department of Posts and Telegraphs became independent. The staff is happy and satisfied, and progress is being made in every sphere. If one takes into consideration the fact that a major part of the work of the Post Office is in fact of a highly technical nature, and one also takes into consideration the fact that technicians are extremely scarce, not only in our country but throughout the world and that it takes years to train a technician, then I find it astonishing that it has been possible to make this progress over the past few years. In the Estimates for 1968-&#x2019;69 R35.5 million was requested, and in spite of the shortage of manpower it was possible to utilize that amount in full. In the ensuing year a far greater amount of R52 million was requested, and as far as I can ascertain that mount will also be spent in full during the course of this year. This is a great achievement; it indicates that these essential services are keeping pace as far as it is humanly possible, with the extremely rapid development of our country in various fields. If it was possible during the past two years to spend the vast amount of R88 million when the work which had to be done was to a large extent of a technical nature then one must really congratulate the Minister and his officials very sincerely on what has been achieved.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the last part of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Orange Grove, i.e. the question of television. I should also like to refer to the political capital which both the official Opposition and the Hertzog group are trying to make out of the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry to investigate television. The Hertzog <span class="col_551-552" refersTo="page_0288"/>group is now proclaiming that the Government has allegedly accepted United Party policy and that the people will now be overburdened with liberalistic television programmes. That is of course absolute nonsense. It has always been envisaged that television could not be kept out of this country. As the hon. member for Koedoespoort remarked, this was stated very clearly in this House as long ago as 1960 by the then Prime Minister, the late Dr. Verwoerd. Dr. Verwoerd stated (Hansard of 9th March, 1960, Col. 3002)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let me state certain principles to which the Government subscribes in respect of this matter. The first principle is this: No government can or will likely say that it is going to keep any invention permanently out of its borders, nor have we ever done so &#x2026; This standpoint also has bearing on the way in which television will have to be introduced when that time comes. This is the first principle: Television cannot be kept out permanently, but its introduction must wait until we are able to counter any of the possible evils which are being experienced elsewhere.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister also stated last year in the Senate that technical and scientific development might make it essential for the Government to decide to introduce television. Now it would be very short-sighted of a Government and a Minister to say suddenly, which is what the hon. member for Orange Grove and other hon. members on the opposite side want, &#x201C;we are now going to get television, and we are now going to enjoy ourselves&#x201D;. That would be irresponsible. It has not yet been decided that television will be introduced, but as in the case of any important matter, if it must come, one must at least be very well prepared for it. This is an extremely important matter.</p>

<p>I should like to indicate briefly why I think that such a commission of inquiry is essential. When the stage is reached when the Government has to introduce television one expects the Government to be conversant with the various aspects and be prepared for them. Being prepared would, in my opinion, <i>inter alia,</i> presuppose that the Government would in the first place be conversant with the financial implications for the State of the introduction of television. In his speech on 9th March, 1960, Dr. Verwoerd, <i>inter alia,</i> stated that it was estimated that a nation-wide television service would cost approximately R20 million and that the current annual maintenance cost would be approximately R9 million. This was perhaps a very modest estimate, because the cost of living has increased since, salaries have increased since, and materials are probably much more expensive to-day. In 1960 it was estimated that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation required R42 million per annum for their television system. It will therefore make a big dent, whatever the amount is. If it is to be a colour television service then anything up to R300 million would be required. There is also the question of the campaign against inflation. Television is a luxury article and could possibly be conducive to further inflation. All these factors must be studied very thoroughly. The Government cannot introduce a television service in an irresponsible way. The hon. members who are now bandying this about in order to catch a few political flies, regardless of in what direction, are, I think being highly irresponsible.</p>

<p>Not only must the financial implications for the State be taken into consideration, but also those for the general public. Hon. members on the opposite side are concerned about the general public. Here, without a thorough investigation having been made, they want to burden the general public with what will probably add quite a few hundred additional rand per year to their account. The cost of a television set is probably quite a few hundred rand. These are articles which become obsolete from time to time and which have to be replaced. There is also the question of licence fees which will be considerably higher than our present radio licences.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. As far as the effect of television advertisements and the price of advertised goods is concerned, it is calculated that on some articles, because the advertisements on television are very expensive, the price has increased by 25 per cent in America as a result of this kind of advertising. All these factors entail serious implications for the ordinary citizen and delve deeply into his pocket. When those hon. members want to come along and fight an election with the promise of introducing television without further ado and try to win the votes of the voters in this way, they do not always realize what implications this implies for those voters. That is why this Government, a responsible Government, first wants to determine precisely what the implications are before taking such a decision.</p>

<p>But the concept &#x201C;preparedness&#x201D; also implies that we should know what the effect of television on our social and educational life would be. Television has a tremendous influence on the social and the educational life of every nation. In a book &#x201C;Radio and Television Broadcasting on the European Continent&#x201D; by Burton Paulu the writer says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is fundamental that radio and television be regarded as an integral part of the countries they serve, since they cannot be understood without reference to their historical, political, economic, social, religious, educational and cultural settings. Unfortunately, much that is said about broadcasting overlooks its dependence on environment. People often mistake foreign broadcasting as though it were taking place in their own country.</block>

<p><span class="col_553-554" refersTo="page_0289"/>I am pointing out that television broadcasts have trmendous implications for the ordinary citizen. It is said that in the first five years husband, wife and child become so addicted to television that homework, schoolwork and family relations are all prejudicially influenced. These are matters which have to be studied and in regard to which a thorough knowledge has to be gained. In addition it is said that the average American spends 20 hours per week in front of his television set. It will therefore make tremendous inroads on our sporting and cultural life if this addiction were to occur in this country as well. Here we have German philosopher, Dr. C. F. Weisz&#x00E4;ker who states: &#x201C;The atom bomb kills the body, but television destroys the soul&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I am in favour of a thorough investigation. That is why a commission has been appointed.</p>

<p>In the sphere of education it could make a very important and positive contribution to schools and universities. Television can, in the same way as other scientific aids to-day, be applied very positively and can be a major contributory factor to the development of knowledge and the facilitation of the learning process.</p>

<p>But is also true, and this cannot be argued away, that it can also have an extremely negative influence on the educational process. It has been proved that it can promote juvenile delinquency. For example, a South African writer, Stuart Cloete, has said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Television in America can be termed a school of crime. Not only are crimes committed, but the <i>modus operandi</i> is also demonstrated.</block>

<p>Dr. Himmelweit, a German scientist, has found that television slowly but surely changes a child&#x2019;s sense of values and his outlook on life. Children read less, spend less time listening to the radio, and remain awake late at night. In addition he also found that children who have grown up with television are less ambitious and leave school at an earlier age. These are all problems which will have to be studied thoroughly in our country, taking into consideration our manpower shortage.</p>

<speech by="#engelbrecht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>This speech will in any case be at the disposal of the commission of inquiry. Then, too, children for the most part watch programmes intended for adults. The result of this is that children are forced into a premature adulthood. This is characterized by spiritual confusion and a lack of confidence in adulthood, as well as a superficial approach to the problems of adults and even an unwillingness to become an adult. There is indisputable proof that it promotes juvenile delinquency. This all indicates that an effort to investigate this matter is necessary as far as our social life and educational requirements are concerned. One cannot rashly introduce a new commodity which might cause dangerous tendencies; nor without first having investigated the way in which this commodity can be applied in order to have the most positive effect on the lives of our people and the education of our children. I also want to say something in regard to the nature and control of programmes. In 1960 it was clearly indicated by Dr. Verwoerd that it would not be possible to present these programmes without control. I am quoting what he said at the time (Hansard, volume 104, column 3008)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The third principle adopted by the Government which I am now going to discuss, is one which I am mentioning as a warning against the false speculation which is eminent and to counteract the creation of unnecessary pressure groups. The warning is this: When television is introduced, it will not be placed in the hands of private companies, but will either be controlled by the existing Broadcasting Corporation or by a similar special utility company. Which it will be can best be judged at the appropriate time.</block>

<p>Hon. members on the opposite side will realize that the number of subjects which they will be able to discuss in future will become fewer. I am referring in particular to the hon. member for Orange Grove, for within the next few years the telephone shortage will have been eliminated. The postal delivery service will also in due course have been improved, if there is any room for improvement. Then hon. members will not know what to talk about, particularly if television has also been introduced. Perhaps the fact that television will not have been unleashed in an uncontrolled manner on the people, but will be properly controlled will at least be a subject of discussion for the hon. member. Apart from the knowledge which we need to introduce television, to which I have already referred, there are also the technical problems. In recent years many experiments have been conducted in various countries in regard to television. At present there are four black and white systems in use in Europe. In America there are also four systems, as well as two colour systems. Science and technology develop very rapidly and we need not, when the Government should decide to introduce television, make the same mistakes other countries have made. The spending of millions of rands can be eliminated for the ordinary tax payer and for the State by drawing from the knowledge and experience of countries which already have this commodity. If those hon. members were in power one would have expected <span class="col_555-556" refersTo="page_0290"/>them, in their irresponsibility, to have introduced television quite a number of years ago. We would then, together with the other countries, have had to bear the tremendous losses which pay for these experiments. At present, however, we can derive benefit from all the various developments. We must also establish what would be best for our country and its circumstances, i.e. whether it should be a black and white or a colour system, or whether it should be only for certain areas or for the entire country, and many other considerations. Careful and well thought out steps will therefore have to be taken.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on previous occasions the hon. member for Algoa has made speeches violently attacking television and to-day when he stood up to address the House one anticipated that he would adopt the same attitude. His attitude has only altered very slightly by virtue of the fact that a commission has been appointed and one&#x2019;s difficulty is to ascertain whether the hon. member intends giving evidence before this commission to put forward his views which he claims to be authoritative views. If the hon. member does intend to give evidence will he still be consistent with the attitude he adopted in the past when he condemned television? The hon. member also believed that it was necessary to appoint a commission of inquiry although television has been in existence for something like 40 years. We on this side of the House believe that television can and should be introduced.</p>

<p>This afternoon I intend to address certain remarks to the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in regard to telephone tapping. Last week we again heard denials from various hon. Ministers concerning telephone tapping. I refer to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s remarks last week when he categorically denied that telephone tapping was taking place. The former Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, the hon. member for Ermelo, has denied in this House in reply to questions that telephone tapping was taking place. Yet only recently he made a statement that telephone tapping was indeed taking place. We have also heard from the hon. the Minister of Justice that telephone tapping has not taken place. In spite of these denials I submit that telephone tapping has taken place under the Government of the Nationalist Party. I believe there is sufficient evidence to prove that it has taken place. We do not necessarily mean that the tapping of telephones might not be required in times of extreme urgency and emergency should the security of the State be at stake. However, it is a matter which I believe the hon. Ministers responsible should state quite clearly in this House and give a guarantee that it is not abused. I refer particularly to the conditions pertaining in Durban at the beginning of 1960 and in 1961. We know that the telephone service in Durban was administered and belonged to the Durban Municipality. We also know that since then the Government has taken over this telephone service. Whilst this telephone system was still the property of the Durban Corporation it was necessary for the Police in tapping telephones to obtain permission from the Durban telephone authorities. This they did. It was during 1960 that the Police approached the Durban Municipality for the tapping of certain telephones and this permission was granted. It was granted on two conditions, the one being that only the telephones of non-Europeans organizations believed to be subversive and persons connected with those organizations would be tapped and, secondly, that the tapping of such telephones would not be continued longer than was absolutely necessary. I am Quoting from a minute of the Town Clerk of Durban, namely No. 34, which was circulated to all councillors and which has since been made public. Here the evidence shows that a meeting took place and it is clearly stated in this minute that an approach was made by the Special Branch of the South African Police to tap certain telephones in the municipal system of Durban. The Town Clerk thereupon arranged a meeting with the Chairman of the Trading Undertakings Committee and the Deputy Mavor, the Mayor being overseas at that time. That meeting took place in the Mavor&#x2019;s Office during the afternoon of 22nd February, 1960. The Officer-in-charge of the Special Branch of the S.A. Police and another Government official were also present.</p>

<p>I have mentioned earlier that there might be cases where telephone tapping might be necessary, for instance in cases of emergency. I am not denying that fact. The point is that hon. Ministers on that side of the House categorically deny it every time a question in this regard is put to them. Surely we can expect the hon. the Minister to be frank and state the position clearly. We on this side of the House are only asking a guarantee that this method of obtaining information is not being abused. That is what we ask for. However, instead of that, we receive categorical denials from the Prime Minister downwards saying that no telephone tapping is taking place under the Nationalist Government. My point is that there is proof that telephone tapping has taken place under the Nationalist Party Government. I am quoting these figures and this information for the information of this House to show that in fact this has existed. The position is of course that a state of emergency did exist. For that reason the Deputy Mayor gave permission to the Special Branch of the Police to tap certain telephones. I have mentioned the two undertakings which were also given to the Municipality. Now comes another important point which perhaps the hon. member for Umhlatuzana would be interested in, namely that after the state of emergency no longer existed, the South African Police in the meantime had moved to new premises. They had moved from Wentworth to premises in the centre of the town. So what happened? They then approached the Durban Municipality for facilities to be made available for the tapping of telephones. The state of emergency no longer existed.</p>

<p>When was that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>This was in November, 1960. I want to quote from the minute of the Town Clerk of Durban which states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; A further request by the Special Branch of the S.A. Police was made for similar facilities to be given in new Offices to which Police Headquarters had been transferred. In the changed circumstances this was refused by the Town Clerk. Subsequently the request was made that the new premises occupied by the police should be wired but not connected, so that the facilities in question could be given without delay if circumstances changed to a degree which make it possible for such facilities to be again given. The Mayor was consulted in this connection, and the S.A. Police were informed that this could not be done. The facilities given in February, 1960, were at the same time withdrawn, at the request of the Mayor.</block>

<p>The point is that the police after having moved to new premises asked that these premises be specially connected so that they could continue with telephone tapping. The only reason why this came to light is due to the fact that this is a telephone service that at the time belonged to the Durban Municipality. Surely any reasonable person can only assume that telephone tapping certainly must have taken place with the telephones that were under the control of the government. One must also remember the following point for the information of the hon. member for Harrismith who referred earlier to backlogs and telephones and so on, which were inherited by the government from the Durban Municipality. There are large areas of Durban where government phones are available, and not Durban municipal phones. It does not cover the whole area of Durban. So consequently, if it was necessary for them to obtain this permission from the Durban Municipality, it can only be assumed that the tapping of telephones was also undertaken in Durban as well where telephones were under the Government service at that time. Indeed, it is in those areas where the biggest shortage of telephones exists, incidentally. However, to continue with this point in regard to the tapping of telephones, as far as this important aspect is concerned, I believe that the people of South Africa should call upon the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to give a frank statement in regard to this very important infringement of the individual&#x2019;s rights. This is not a matter which can just be brushed aside casually, and denied. This is not a parochial matter. It is a matter affecting every single person in South Africa when it comes to the use of these means of obtaining information. It must be done with the greatest degree of circumspection and we must have the assurance that it is not being abused in any way whatsoever.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs replied to a question last week by the hon. member for Orange Grove referring to the possibility that conversations might be listened into by other means. I should like to refer to a position also existing in Durban in February. 1961 where the Manager of the Telephone Department was asked to comment in regard to the possibility of tapping of telephones. The assurance was given to the Town Clerk by the Telephone Manager as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">In answer to your inquiry this afternoon I give a categorical assurance that no Durban corporation subscribers&#x2019; telephone lines are &#x201C;tapped&#x201D; for any purpose whatsoever.</block>

<p>In order to observe or &#x201C;tap&#x201D; subscribers&#x2019; telephone lines, special wiring and cabling has to be provided between the subscribers&#x2019; cables circuit, the exchange equipment and an observation suite. Again I give my categorical assurance that no such special wiring, cabling or equipment is operating in any of <span class="col_559-560" refersTo="page_0292"/>the Durban corporation telephone exchanges. Further, it would be impossible for this to be done without my knowledge.</p>

<p>Now my question to the hon. the Minister is whether the hon. the Minister can give an assurance that tapping of telephones cannot be done without it being brought to the knowledge of his technicians? His reply last week seemed to indicate that telephone tapping could be done by unauthorized persons perhaps who had some other latest means or device of listening in to telephone conversations. According to the information which was provided by the Manager of the Telephone Department in Durban, it would be impossible for this to be done without his knowledge because it required special wiring and equipment and an observation suite. According to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s recent reply it would appear that there is now a new device whereby the listening in of conversations can be undertaken. We on this side of the House believe that this is of vital importance. We believe that it is time that the House was fully informed as to whether this method of obtaining information has been used or is being used and to what degree one can be assured that there are guarantees that it is not being abused.</p>

<p>There are two other matters which I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister which are not in connection with telephone tapping. However, they are certainly in connection with the shortage of telephones. Since the hon. the Minister spoke this afternoon and informed the House that there are some 89,000 names on the waiting-list for telephones, it becomes increasingly obvious that those people who do not have telephones must rely on public telephone booths. There are certain new residential areas in various cities in the metropolitan areas of the country where there has evidently been no planning. The cable work is a long way behind. These people have been informed that they must wait two to three years for a telephone. It therefore becomes important that these people should have at least a public telephone booth within reasonable access of their residence or where they might live. I know that there are areas where a person has to travel sometimes two miles to get to a public telephone booth. I know of cases where an extreme emergency existed. The person went to the first public telephone booth which was some distance from his home. He found it out of order. He then had to travel another mile and a half to another telephone booth. He found that telephone out of order too. In exasperation he went and knocked on the door of a private home at one o&#x2019;clock in the morning. Fortunately these people allowed him to use their phone where this phone call was required as a matter of urgency for medical reasons. I believe that the hon. the Minister must take steps to ensure that there are a greater number of public telephone booths available. These telephone booths should be constructed in such a manner that they will be able to withstand to a degree vandalism which undoubtedly does exist. This is a problem the hon. the Minister has to contend with. Perhaps there could be co-operation with the police and greater fines imposed where people are found to have damaged or destroyed in some cases the telephone equipment in a telephone booth. We hope that the hon. the Minister can give an indication if there is to be an increase in the number of telephone booths that will be made available in the various areas or in fairly close proximity to areas where there is a particularly long waiting-list for telephones. It is also important that provision be made for regular inspections of these telephone booths so as to ensure that when they are out of order as a result of vandalism, they be repaired as expeditiously as possible. It is known that there are some telephone booths which have remained out of order for a considerable period of time. They were only repaired after the matter had been reported. But surely this should be one of the tasks of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department to make regular inspections of these telephone booths to see that they are kept in working order. We believe that the question of the provision of telephones is a vital one. We know that South Africa is growing and developing rapidly. It is a country with vast potential and great resources. Obviously it must develop. It is a great pity that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has not been able to plan ahead so as to meet this demand. We have heard of a lot of planning by this Government but surely this is an indictment of them that at the present time, instead of reducing the back-log of the number of telephones that are required, the back-log seems to be growing and the list seems to be increasing all along the line. We hone that the hon. the Minister will give this House some assurance that this matter is receiving his attention particularly in regard to future planning, particularly in residential and industrial areas where telephones are an absolute necessity. We hope that the hon. the Minister can give this assurance to this House, because the people who are on the waiting-list are certainly looking for some encouragement as to whether or not they will be getting a telephone within the next three or four years.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo to-day took up where the hon. member for Innesdal left off last week, i.e. sowing suspicion and mistrust against this Government which is allegedly making large-scale inroads into the freedom and the rights of the individual by tapping telephones. The hon. member knows as well as I do that this is a technique in operation throughout the entire Western world, as well as in the Communistic world, to acquire of information in regard to saboteurs, people who undermine the State and so on, by tapping telephones. I am not saying that this takes place on a large scale in South Africa. The hon. member must not adopt a holier-than-thou pose here and pretend that this has never happened in South Africa. It is general knowledge that when they were in <span class="col_561-562" refersTo="page_0293"/>power during the war years, telephone tapping took place regularly every week. Information obtained in that way was codified and sent to the chief secretary of the United Party, Mr. Louis Esselen. The latter in turn supplied his provincial secretary with all these conversations each week. <i>Inter alia,</i> the telephone conversations of Ossewabrandwag members were tapped. The telephone conversations of the Greyshirt movement also listened-in to. That hon. member must not come and pretend here now that when there are people in this country who want to undermine the security of the State, saboteurs and communists, they should be allowed to plot their intrigues freely over the telephone while this Government does nothing about it. The reason why that hon. member, in alliance with the Hertzog Party, is making these accusations against the Government is once again to send a poor image of this Government, i.e. that we are developing into a police and a Nazi state, abroad. What other reason can there be for doing so? One would have expected that the Opposition would at least display the patriotism and common sense and would have realized that if telephone tapping does in fact take place in this country, it is only done because there is a threat to the security of the State. One would not expect them to ask the hon. the Minister across the floor of this House to disclose his secrets and techniques which are applied throughout the Western world to ferret out saboteurs and communists. I accuse them of unpatriotic conduct by trying to create this impression that the Government is a police state and is making use of Nazi methods.</p>

<p>I should briefly like to say something about that part of the motion of the hon. member for Orange Grove that deals with the introduction of television. I make no secret of this, and it is known that I am an advocate of the principle that television should be introduced into this country. However, I have always said it should be State controlled. I want to add at once now that this Government has acted correctly and precisely as I felt it should act, which is that this matter should first be given some thought by a commission of inquiry before television is introduced into this country. For that reason I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs for having made the terms of reference of this commission of inquiry so comprehensive. One cannot introduce a serious commodity like television without first having all the particulars. As long ago as I960&#x2014;as quoted by previous speakers&#x2014;Dr. Verwoerd raised quite a number of matters which would first have to be investigated properly, <i>inter alia,</i> what progress the question of colour television had made in the world. It must be established whether it is possible to introduce television into South Africa with its vast expanses. I also want to point out at once that this Opposition comes forward with a half-baked proposal in their booklet &#x201C;You want it&#x2014;we have it&#x201D;, from which we have already quoted such a great deal. They say they will introduce a &#x201C;nation-wide television service&#x201D;, but they do not say how they will do it. The hon. member for Orange Grove would do much better if he told us how it was possible to introduce a nationwide television service in a mountainous and expansive country such as South Africa. It is this kind of technical information which the commission of inquiry must assemble, apart from the fact that they must determine whether or not television will in fact have a prejudicial moral effect on the youth and the people which is what is being alleged will happen.</p>

<p>I have been a member of this House for four years, and I can safely say that this is easily the tamest debate on Posts I have ever heard. I do not know whether it is because the hon. member for Orange Grove is cooing to the electorate that he has behaved himself to such an extent to-day that he did not even, as he usually does, become emotional or excited. I think it is more likely to be because the Opposition have no grounds for an attack on this hon. Minister. Since he took over the management of Posts in this country, during the past few years, he has administered his Department so efficiently that the attacks from the Opposition side have been steadily dwindling. What hon. members forget in regard to the point they want to make about telephone shortages, is that the Post Office until two years ago had always fallen under the Treasury as far as its finances were concerned. But since the Department was removed, the hon. the Minister immediately showed that he was even prepared to double the expenditure on the communications system of our country. This shows what thorough work he has been doing since the Post Office Department became independent. The hon. member for Orange Grove said that South Africa had one of the finest telephone services in the world and that, on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, we also have one of the greatest shortages in the world. But does he not know that in France, for example, there are almost a half a million Frenchmen on the waiting-list for telephones and that those half a million Frenchmen will, according to calculations only receive their telephones in ten years&#x2019; time! The dissatisfaction of the French is so drastic that they have even appointed a pressure group in the French Parliament to exert pressure on the counterpart of the hon. the Minister here to solve the problem of the telephone shortage more rapidly there.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>It is not necessary in South Africa, because this hon. Minister is doing everything humanly possible to eliminate the telephone shortage. I believe that, as he predicted, the telephone shortage in South Africa will have been eliminated entirely within five years. There was also a complaint to the effect that the telephone services in South Africa were allegedly very poor. My personal opinion is that one of the reasons why the <span class="col_563-564" refersTo="page_0294"/>telephone service is so poor is because so many housewives monopolize the telephone during the day and overload the lines. In addition there are the young fellows and their girl friends who are continually courting over the telephone. The United Party would do better to make an appeal to the housewives of South Africa to have less to say over the telephone and to be less garrulous than to try to level this kind of accusation against the hon. the Minister. The latest gossip is related over the telephone, the new baby is discussed and recipes are even read out aloud over the telephone. If the telephone were actually used for the purpose for which it was introduced, i.e. to communicate rapidly and in a businesslike way with one&#x2019;s fellow-man, then the telephone services in South Africa will not be overloaded to such an extent. I want to make an appeal to-day to the housewives of South Africa to make fewer telephone calls, of shorter duration.</p>

<p>A further aspect which I should like to bring to the attention of this House is the question of township developers who commence the development of townships before they have been assured of the fact that there will be adequate telephone services for that township. I have a case in my constituency where a new township was proclaimed and building operations commenced, but where it will only be possible to supply telephone services in two years&#x2019; time. I feel that developers should not be allowed to develop townships before they have received assurance to the effect that it will be possible to supply telephone services.</p>

<p>I want to say that I think the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in South Africa is on the verge of an unprecedented period of expansion and growth in the future under this hon. Minister. His Budget speech here this afternoon was only a short one. but it radiated optimism. What I found particularly striking is this fact: What the hon. the Minister mentioned, i.e. that the Post Office was going to become more and more modernized and mechanized. What I find a great comfort is the fact that the sorting machines which the Department installed in Pretoria as an experiment have yielded such good results. Since it has yielded such good results. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider installing a similar sorting machine in Johannesburg. In Johannesburg the question of letter sorting is beginning to become simply impossible as a result of the population explosion. I do not know whether hon. members have seen this machine yet. but I went to have a look at the machine in Pretoria, and I can inform the hon. members who have not seen it yet, that it is simply a miracle. I foresee the day arriving in this country when &#x201C;postal factories&#x201D; will arise outside the cities as a result of these sorting machines. At such &#x201C;postal factories&#x201D; the post will simply be offloaded outside the town or city where it will be sorted much more rapidly by means of sorting machines and by means of codification, without being touched by hand, I have been told that this can be done at a tremendous rate. It has been proved abroad that such a sorting machine is capable of sorting up to 107,000 postal articles per hour. That is about 40 per cent faster than existing methods. I also want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not consider this, and as soon as it is financially possible to build all the requested post Offices, introduce a system of self-service post Offices in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before the House adjourned. I was asking the Minister about the possibility of investigating the introduction of self-service post Offices in South Africa. I did so particularly with a view to the fact that people cannot find urgent postal facilities when the post Offices are closed. What I have in mind now is not the type of vending machine where one buys postage stamps, but hon. members know that we are living in the days of self-service. I think that such self-service post Offices, situated at strategic places, could contribute a great deal towards serving the public, particularly if we take into consideration the great manpower shortage we are experiencing in South Africa to-day. This type of _ self-service post Office could for example weigh packets itself, determine the amount of postage to be paid on a package and also sell postal and money orders to the public at night. I am leaving this idea with the hon. the Minister and his Department for consideration.</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I just want to say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made accusations here this afternoon to the effect that dissatisfaction still existed among the various branches of the post Office staff. I cannot speak on behalf of all the branches, but I can mention that the secretary of the South African Postal Union, the Union which deals with postmen, lives in my constituency. I have learned that the concessions made by the hon. the Minister to postmen in his previous budget, such as making motorized scooters available, and the incentive bonuses, has contributed greatly to attracting more white postmen to the profession. One of our major concerns was that more and more non-Whites were being appointed on a temporary bas&#x2019;s as postmen owing to the shortage of white postmen. It is therefore a great comfort to me to hear that the situation has in fact improved. Arising out of the improved conditions of service. I am looking forward to the day when we will again eventually be able to make use of the services of white postmen only.</p>

<p>I also want to ask the hon. the Minister whether a five-day delivery week could not in due course be introduced. In the major cities of South Africa most businesss undertakings are closed on Saturdays. As a result of this most mail is posted on Friday afternoons. The <span class="col_565-566" refersTo="page_0295"/>result is that the postmen have to deliver a tremendous amount of post on Saturdays, while the business undertakings are not open in any case. I am submitting this to the hon. the Minister so that he can consider the matter.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to make further concessions in regard to radio licences with a view to the sound position of the post Office finances. These concessions can be made to social pensioners, the aged, invalids, students and so on, to mention only certain categories. The hon. the Minister must consider whether the time has not come for these concessions to be made. We do not yet have television in our country, and for many of those people the only source of entertainment is listening to the radio. However, they often find it difficult to get together the money necessary for a radio licence.</p>

<p>Is that the bad telephone service he talks about? But, Sir, there is a far more serious aspect to the remarks of the hon. member for Turffontein. He first of all misstated what my colleague, the hon. member for Umbilo, had said in the course of his speech this afternoon. The hon. member for Umbilo stated clearly and specifically that the United Party recognized that in the interests of the security of the State, at a time of emergency and in order to combat serious crime or threats to South Africa, telephone tapping was necessary and acceptable. But he made the point specifically that what we were concerned about in the United Party was that such tapping should be properly controlled, should not be abused and should only be resorted to when it was absolutely essential to combat serious crime or in the interests of the safety of South Africa. The hon. member over there then got up and accused this side of the House of being prepared to allow terrorism and other threats to South Africa without resorting to tapping, if necessary.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to deal with two aspects of this immediately. The first is that on 19th June, 1962, in this House the hon. member for Umbilo put certain questions to the then Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. The first question was: &#x201C;Whether the tapping of telephone lines is prohibited by legislation; if so, what legislation and, if not, whether the Government has considered introducing legislation?&#x201D; The answer was specific: &#x201C;Yes, the Post Office Act, 1958 and the common law.&#x201D; In other words, telephone tapping is illegal in South Africa. That is the first point. But the second point is that last week in this House my hon. Leader challenged the hon. the Prime Minister to state whether telephone tapping took place in South Africa. He challenged him four times in all and the hon. the Prime Minister was evasive.</p>

Minister and the word of the hon. the Prime Minister. That is one of the standards of democratic government; one of the standards of civilized society is that you can accept a categorical assurance at its face value. The hon. member for Umbilo this afternoon quoted chapter and verse to show that this Government, <span class="col_567-568" refersTo="page_0296"/>when it did not control the Durban telephone exchange, applied for and received permission to tap telephone lines.</p>

<p>I do not know the exact date of the Rivonia trial.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am flapping about the fact that we are told in unequivocal words that something does not happen, and by his questions and interjections that hon. member accepts that it does happen and we have proved that it happens. In other words, he supports a Government which says one thing when he in fact, by his interjections, indicates that he accepts that the opposite has been happening. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana has indicated that he accepts and agrees, as we agree, that telephone tapping can and should take place during a period of crisis or at a time of threat. Yet now b is denied by the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. I say that South Africa is entitled to take note of the value which can be placed on assurances given to the country by our leaders.</p>

<p>Your Government allowed it,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Of course we did. When Post Offices were being blown up, when rail way lines were being blown up and the lives of South Africans were being threatened we used it against the then supporters of the policy for which that hon. member stood then. We used this power and we did not deny it. We did not say that it was not happening. We said that the security of South Africa demanded strong action and we took that action. We were not afraid to take action against traitors to South Africa; we were not afraid to take action against the fifth column; we were not afraid to take action against sabotage, and when we sit on the Government benches we will act again.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to move on to other aspects of this debate. We expected that when the Government granted autonomy to the Post Office something would happen; that things would start to move; that they would have the money. They had already raised telephone charges so as to raise the necessary capital, and we were entitled to expect a radical change in the situation. But what happened? Just a &#x201C;happening&#x201D;, and the &#x201C;happening&#x201D; was to the telephone services of South Africa. I am not going to repeat what the hon. member for South Coast and other members on this side of the House have said, but I do want to confirm and substantiate that the effect of the Government&#x2019;s taking over the telephone system in Durban has been to turn an efficient system into a shambles. Sir, it is a fact that if you applied to the Durban Corporation for a telephone for business or private purposes and you stated the date on which you wanted it, you got it on that day.</p>

<p>I have moved my Office twice in Durban, as the result of rebuilding, from one building to another, and I can quote hundreds of cases to support my statement that where a business moved or applied for a telephone, they got it on the day they asked for it.

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am talking about the administration of the telephone system in Durban.</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Answer the question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I will answer it. What happened was that during the year of negotiations with the Government over the takeover, no exchanges were built except the Stamford Hill exchange, but in the vast bulk of the Durban areas, you could get a telephone immediately for business purposes, for medical purposes or for any authorized reason. The provision of an ordinary household telephone without special reason, could take time. Sir, the hon. member talks about a waiting <span class="col_569-570" refersTo="page_0297"/>list of 4,000 against a waiting list of 89,000 under this Government. To-day, Sir, if you apply for a telephone in Durban you are told that it will take six weeks to investigate and it will take anything up to two months before you can expect to get that telephone, and then when you do get it, it is only half a service. Sir, when you pick up your telephone, on one out of three occasions, you will have to wait anything up to half a minute or a minute before you get a dialling tone. When you have dialled your first three numbers you get the engaged sign. Not the number you are ringing but the whole system is engaged, and the hon. member for Turffontein says that that is because the women talk too much. Tests and checks have been made to confirm that up to 33 per cent of the numbers dialled are wrong numbers. I myself on one occasion dialled Pietermaritzburg and after the first wrong number I called a witness. I dialled Pietermaritzburg seven times and I got five wrong numbers, and I had two witnesses watching to see that I was dialling correctly. When I reported it to Complaints they checked and accepted that it had happened. I gave them the numbers I had got and they cancelled those five calls. Sir, I am not like the Nationalist Party who cannot even dial. They are so used to nails looking like corkscrews that when they dial anything a number looking like a corkscrew comes out. Sir, I want this evening in the name of the Opposition to demand of the hon. the Minister of Post and Telegraphs that he grant a 25 per cent reduction on telephone accounts in the Durban, the Rand and other over-overloaded areas to compensate for the wrong numbers which people get when they dial.</p>

<p>In Cape Town too.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am being conservative; I could ask for more, but I say that there is at least a 25 per cent wastage, and I say that in the name of fair play and honest business dealing the Post Office should grant a 25 per cent discount on every telephone account for dialled calls until they are able to provide a service which works. Mr. Speaker, that is the right of the telephone subscriber of South Africa. I am not talking of the privileged user. I want to place it on record that I have received nothing but courtesy from the officials of the Department to whom I have gone from time to time with problems. But courtesy does not give you service. They do their best but they have to say to you, &#x201C;the systems are overloaded; we can do nothing about it&#x201D;. I demand that the Government announce in this debate that they are prepared to compensate for this shocking service from automatic telephones, particularly when you are dialling trunk calls, by 25 per cent discount on every account until the overload is removed.</p>

<p>Now I want to move on to another aspect of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department, and that is the question of the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation, which is a wing of the information service of the Nationalist Party. {Interjections.] I say it is a wing of the information service of the Nationalist Party. On 20th November last year the General Secretary of the United Party wrote, by authority of the Central Executive of the party, to the Director of Programs of the S.A.B.C., asking for radio time for political parties to broadcast during the election. He received a reply on 5th December stating that it was not the policy of the Board, but if political parties could agree between them on time then they would reconsider granting to the parties time for poli<b>tical</b> broadcasts during the election campaign. It is a two-page letter and I do not want to quote it in full, but the last paragraph, signed by Mr. Douglas Fuchs, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board directed me to say that should the political parties reach agreement among themselves on the allocation of broadcasting time, it will be happy to consider the matter afresh.</block>

<p>The United Party then wrote on 19th December acknowledging the letter, and wrote on the same day to the chief information Officer of the Nationalist Party, the hon. member for Stellenbosch. It stated the view of the S.A.B.C. and asked him to liaise with us with a view to reaching agreement on time for the political parties. On 9th January we had still not received a reply and the General Secretary, Senator Horak, wrote again and reminded him of the letter and asked for an answer. It was not until last week, Sir, that the hon. member for Stellenbosch, as information Officer, advised that the Nationalist Party was not prepared to co-operate. I say here to the people of South Africa that that Government is afraid of the truth. [Interjections.] They are afraid to put their case against ours. They will force the S.A.B.C. to put over slanted Government views while they refuse to the Opposition, who represent 42 per cent of the voters, the opportunity to put our case across. They hide behind the news services which they put across. Now, anyone who listens to those news services knows how much time we get on them. We have tried to buy time in the commercial radio, but that has been forbidden us. We cannot even get our message across on the commercial service, and I say to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and the Government that they are scared to face us on the air before the people of South Africa. They are afraid that our message will reach too many people, and I challenge the hon. the Minister and the whole Cabinet, man for man, to debate against the United Party. If they refuse that challenge, there can be only one conclusion reached by the people of South Africa, i.e. that they are not prepared to face us openly, man to man, policy against policy and party against party, through the medium of the monopoly which they have over the air of South Africa. I was going to suggest that we should have the broadcasts in both <span class="col_571-572" refersTo="page_0298"/>languages. The hon. the Minister of Sports and Recreation could broadcast in neither. That could give us a good start. He could tell us about sport and Maoris; they could tell us about the Stock Exchange and about pensions. Just think of the things the Government could tell the people of South Africa. But we could answer them. That is the difference. We could tell them&#x2014;we could tell the people of South Africa&#x2014;about the purchase tax, the consumer tax, the tax on soap, the tax on women&#x2019;s cosmetics, the tax on all the things that form part of normal living. They cannot afford to tell the people that and they are hoping vainly that we will not get our message across. I say again that a Government which has a monopoly over the air of South Africa and refuses to grant the same facilities to the Opposition to state their case is a frightened Government, and how much more frightened would they be if we had television! Then they would not have taken two months to answer our request. We could have got it by telegram; that would only have taken three days, or by letter, which would have taken two or three weeks. No, they would not even be prepared to test their postal services on the radio. The Minister knows that the service is overloaded and that they are overworked.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with this issue of television. You, Sir, took exception this afternoon to a comment I made to the hon. member for Algoa, but I was absolutely serious. When an hon. member stands up in the 20th century, in the year 1970, and he talks as that hon. member talked about television, then you truly wonder whether he believes that the motor-car is an evil, and that there should be a man with a red flag walking in front of it. He is that much out of date with the 20th century, and that is why I asked him whether he believed that motor-cars were an evil, because his approach apparently should be the approach of a forked stick and a tom-tom, as the communications system of South Africa, Sir, if you are going to regard television in the light in which that hon. member referred to it this afternoon, it shows that the Government is not able to keep pace with the century in which we live and with the challenge of that century. But even that hon. member could have watched the moon-landing, the most historic scientific event of the age, one of the most fantastic events in the history of man. Little tinpot republics were all able to watch it, but not us. And if the Transkei had its independence you would have been able to watch it in the Transkei, but not in South Africa. The Government is not prepared to keep pace with the challenge of the century in which we live, so what do they do? They appoint a commission under the chairmanship of Dr. P. J. Meyer, Chairman of the Broederbond and Chairman of the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C., the very S.A.B.C. which refuses to allow us to broadcast to the voters of South Africa in an election, and he is going to give an impartial decision, an impartial judgment. On what? On whether the modern amenity of television, which the whole world accepts as an everyday thing, is an evil for South Africa. But he is going to do other things. He and his team are going to decide whether the Nationalist Press will be harmed by the advertising they will lose to television. That is the crux of the matter. It is one of the terms of reference of the commission, to gauge the effect of television on advertising. <i>Dagbreek</i> is already squealing.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I will draw a picture for the hon. member for Maitland which he might be able to understand. I say that this television commission is nothing but an election bluff. It is an attempt to walk the tightrope between the verkramptes like the hon. member for Algoa and the hon. member for Sunnyside who have spoken against television time and again and those who, like the hon. member for Turffontein, are trying to move into the 20th century. They are taking slow, wobbling steps, but even so they are trying to get into the 20th century; and the government, in order to hold the balance between the 18th century; views of many of its members and the 20th century views of one or two who have broken away from the shackles of yesterday, has appointed a commission to stall this issue over the election, until the 22nd April. I want to say that if the government has any courage, it will say that it will decide, and not a commission which is being asked to find out all this nonsense that they are being asked to sift out. Let it decide as a government and commit itself to a policy. Then they can talk of a &#x201C;kragdadige&#x201D; government, but as long as they go on as they are, they are not a &#x201C;kragdadige&#x201D; government. A government prepared to monopolize the air and to withhold from the people of South Africa free debate over the air, is a government not prepared to use its power to face reality and facts. I say that this hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs has failed to meet the challenge which was set to him when he took over this portfolio. He was given it on a silver plate, with a new Act and new powers and unlimited capital, and what has he done with that wonderful opportunity? He has appointed a commission to investigate these matters. The shortage of telephones has increased, and I conclude by repeating two challenges to the Minister: Reduce the telephone accounts of automatic subscribers by 25 per cent to compensate for their wasted calls, and face us over the air on the S.A.B.C.</p>

[Interjection.] The hon. member will surely not begrudge me a few introductory remarks. The hon. member spoke very broadly about opportunities for the Opposition to put their case to the electorate over the radio, and he spoke about tapping and listening-in and monitoring. I shall come to that later. The hon. member for Durban (Point) must just exercise his patience. He also spoke about the information service of the National Party, but before dealing with the hon. member for Durban (Point) any further, I should like to revert to the hon. member for Umbilo. He made a very serious allegation before dinner. He said that the government was abusing its powers and that it affected every citizen of the country who possesses a telephone.</p>

I want to tell the hon. member for Umbilo that I had experience of tapping under the United Party. Can that hon. member mention to me one single case, since the Nationalist Party came into power in 1948, where evidence gained as a result of tapping was used in any court against any member of the public? He can mention no case to me. But I can mention cases to him where, under the regime of his party, people were put into camps without a hearing or without any recourse to the court as a result of tapping. This Government has never even charged one single citizen of this country in court as a result of tapping. Their party concedes that tapping may be resorted to in an emergency.</p>

<p>I have the facts, Sir. I worked in the Post Office, where they tapped conversations. I can mention a specific case. A former member of their party, who is now in the Senate, Dr. Jack Loock, regularly received the transcripts of tapped conversations from Mr. Louis Esselen during the war years. I have his permission to use his name here. He was a member of that party at the time, and they regularly listened here. I saw them.</p>

<p>A war is being waged to-day as well. Those hon. members want to represent themselves as people who never contravene any rules, but we saw them contravening the rules. Innocent people were landed in trouble and they were never afforded an opportunity to put their case. This Government has never jeopardized the existence of any citizen of this country as a result of this. It may happen that two lines become crossed. Then one hears another voice, and then you imagine that someone is listening in. We have heard about monitoring, etc. The hon. the Prime Minister has already replied to this at length. That party, with all its eloquence, cannot point a finger at this side of the House. We saw enough of their regime. The hon. member for Durban (Point) complained about the fact that they cannot have a turn to put their case to the electorate over the radio, but can they remember what happened in 1960? Just before the referendum in that year, the leaders of all the parties had turns to speak over the radio. Those hon. members will remember that their leader addressed the people over the radio. Our late hon. leader also addressed the people over the radio. They know what the result of the referendum was. Sir, they can be thankful that our information Officer is not prepared to co-operate with them, because the more the public finds out about them, and the more the public knows about them, the fewer of them will be left after 22nd April.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to leave them and their negative attitude at that. They spoke very extensively about the staff and the conditions under which they work. In my time, I stood on cement floors in the Post Office and sorted letters.</p>

<speech by="#van_tonder">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN TONDER</person>:</from>

<p>Some of my former colleagues are sitting in those benches to your left, Mr. Speaker. From the way they carried on this afternoon, one gets the impression that the hon. the Minister is the man who must put through every telephone call for them; he is the man who must sort every letter for them. They do not understand the connection between the hon. the Minister and his department. When they criticize him, they are indirectly criticizing the department, the departmental heads, every staff member and every postman, because he does not do their work. He is at the head of the organization. They are the people who back him up. They are the people who backed up his hon. predecessor. And then hon. members blame the Minister. Surely that is wrong. I know that the Post Office staff and the hon. the Minister have a tremendous problem which they must overcome. We cannot argue away the shortage of telephones, but steps are being taken to face those problems and overcome them. Not one of those hon. members produced any positive ideas in this connection. They did not have a single word of appreciation for what has been done in the field of telecommunications under very difficult circumstances in this country. Two decades ago the growth rate in South <span class="col_575-576" refersTo="page_0300"/>Africa was approximately 4 per cent. To-day it is 6 per cent. Therefore, the growth rate is 50 per cent faster than what it was at that time. Tremendous growth has taken place in South Africa. The Post Office has to compete with many other undertakings to obtain staff, but in spite of that competition it has seen to it that there are communication services in South Africa of which we in South Africa, as well as the whole of Africa and the world, can be proud. About a year ago the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture telephoned his farm in Groblersdal from my house. There were 14 farm-line subscribers, his foremen, to whom he spoke. He spoke to them one after the other without experiencing any delay. Talking about farms, Sir, I can tell you that, since April, 1966, the number of farm-line telephone services increased by 12,465, to bring the total to 104,404 on 30th September, 1969. I am only a layman where farming is concerned, but I think the Opposition said that there were 110,000 farmers when they were in power, while we now have only 90,000. This means that there is more than one telephone per farmer. I am referring only to farm lines now. They have no appreciation for that. They only use negative arguments all the time.</p>

<p>Modern trunk call services and microwave radio communications have expanded considerably. To-day all the main cities in the Republic are connected with one another by means of this system. In their time nothing like that existed. They did not know about it. This Government provided it. We are using the most modem techniques and aids available in the field of telecommunications. Sir, if you dial Cape Town from Johannesburg to-day, you are connected within a second.</p>

[Interjections.] It is an excellent service, but we have not heard one word of appreciation for it. In the 20 years since 1949 the total number of postal articles handled rose from 665 million to 1,285 million. It has doubled. The Minister and his department have bought modern, highly complicated sorting machines. You can regard me as a human sorting machine which can sort 2,000 letters in half an hour, but those machines sort ten times as fast. These are all modern aids for which we get no appreciation.</p>

On behalf of this side of the House I should like to tell the hon. the Minister and his staff, all his officials, including the humblest and the least important in that department, that we have the fullest confidence in him and his department, in spite of problems being experienced by the department, which we shall overcome and master.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the speech just made by the hon. member for Germiston District. It surprises me that the hon. member should support his Ministers when they deny that there is tapping of telephone lines. They are missing the point. The argument is this. We maintain that the lines are being tapped while the Ministers whom he supports deny this. We maintain that in a time of emergency, or even when a country finds itself at war, the Government is quite entitled to tap telephone lines but to-day we are supposed to be at peace, perfect peace. Here we are now being humiliated by the tapping of telephone lines. What worries us is that hon. members on that side of the House deny this accusation. Quite frankly, I would be surprised if the hon. member who has just sat down finds that he is again nominated for the constituency of Germiston District because his stories fluctuate. He is not consistent in his appraisement of the Ministers. Here is a credibility gap. When one sees what he said in a similar debate on Posts and Telegraphs on the 1st May, 1967 (Hansard column 5182) when another Minister held this portfolio, Dr. Albert Hertzog, from Ermelo, one finds that he had this to say about the then Minister of Posts and Telegraphs:</p>

<block name="quote">In my opinion they are deliberately creating a distorted image of the hon. the Minister because they have no other way of getting at him. Since the Post Office is in contact with each member of the public almost every day, I can tell you that they are very fortunate to have in the hon. the Minister a person who is the very paragon of courtesy, politeness, ability and efficiency. To the staff the hon. the Minister is an example worthy of being emulated.</block>

<p><span class="col_577-578" refersTo="page_0301"/>He then goes further:</p>

<block name="quote">It creates confidence in them; it creates in them a desire to do their work to the best of their ability. The Post Office officials know that they are in safe hands and that they have nothing to fear in spite of all the hollow accusations which we have heard in this House.</block>

<p>Now on the eve of an election, he comes here to say &#x201C;dankie&#x201D; to another Minister! Basically the problem facing this department is a shortage of staff. There is undeniably a crisis in the country as far as the supply of skilled technicians to the Post Office is concerned. There is a grave shortage of technicians and this is the main reason why this department and the Minister are in trouble to-day. The present shortage is due mainly to the service not being made attractive to the people. There is the housing problem. Very little is being done about the housing problem relating to these civil servants. There are furthermore inadequate wages and salaries and last but not least there is the objection to the way in which promotions are taking place. This objection comes from many people who supposedly supported that side of the House. These people are very dissatisfied; there is a large measure of discontent in this regard. We know that young and even inefficient officials are being promoted over the heads of older, experienced and very efficient men, and there is great dissatisfaction in this regard. To-day the hon. the Minister asked us to support him in his request for a vote of R172 million. While we are discussing this part appropriation, let me remind hon. members of what the hon. the Minister said last year when he asked us for an additional R13 million. I want to quote from a report which appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i> in this regard:</p>

<block name="quote">A five-point programme to wipe out the backlog in telecommunication services was outlined by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. M. C. van Rensburg) when he replied to the Second Reading debate on the Post Office Appropriation Bill in the Senate yesterday.</block>

<block name="quote">He said the main points of the programme were to make available funds to finance the programme, to provide the necessary apparatus, to make manpower available, to ensure efficient control and management of the Post Office and to provide for efficient planning.</block>

<block name="quote">The Post Office Budget which he has introduced was a reply to those who had complained about the shortcomings of the telecommunication services. This year&#x2019;s Budget for the improvement and expansion of telecommunication services was R13 million more than last year&#x2019;s figure, then the largest in Post Office history.</block>

<p>Last year an additional R13 million was voted and we find to-day that the position has deteriorated. To-day we are being asked to vote another R172 million while the position is getting worse and worse. The number of telephones outstanding is no longer the same as that of the year before. Now no less than 89,000 telephones are outstanding according to the hon. the Minister. There is a backlog of no less than 89,000 telephones. When I asked for telephones for people in my own area, I was told that the shortage of telephones is not due to a shortage of instruments, the telephones, but more often than not there are not enough leads in the new blocks of flats being erected. The reason given for the lack of telephones is always that there are not enough leads. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, why, when these new blocks of flats and other buildings are being erected, his department cannot see to it that sufficient leads are provided within the structure of the building so that they need not have to wait until the building has been completed and then tell us that there are not sufficient leads? I say this because it is very difficult and expensive to install leads once a building has been erected.</p>

<p>I now come to the tapping of telephones. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana admitted this afternoon that telephones were being tapped in Durban. I regret that he is not in his seat at the moment but will hon. members deny that telephones are being tapped in East London and the border areas of the Eastern Cane? Will they deny this? I have reason to believe that my telephone is being tapped all the time. Heaven alone knows why. My phones are tapped when I am on my farms in Molteno and my telephone is tapped when I am on my farm in East London, and when I am in my flat in East London my telephone again is tapped, and this is how it is being done. Every time a new telephone directory is published, I find my number duplicated, with somebody else&#x2019;s number. Here I have the directory for hon. members to see, and this has happened more than once. Here is the new telephone directory. My number is 24513. In the last directory my number was 4096. Then it was duplicated with someone else, too. What happens, Sir. is that when people want me on the telephone, they dial my number, but they do not get me direct. The exchange answers and asks, &#x201C;Who do you want to sneak to?&#x201D; When people reply &#x201C;I want to speak to Mr. Wainwright&#x201D;. they say, &#x201C;Well, hold on. we will nut you through.&#x201D; Then the call is put through to me. There is nothing secret about this, and then I hear radios playing, I hear fowls crowing, and heaven alone knows what I do not hear going on while I am speaking to the voter. I might mention in passing that I have complained about this. I am assured that something will be done when a new directory is published and that this will not happen again. But believe me. it does happen again.</p>

<p>Now we come to the S.A.B.C. and the disgraceful programme, &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;, which <span class="col_579-580" refersTo="page_0302"/>people have to bear with whenever they switch the radio on. There are three essentials in all countries, particularly South Africa, with our large lines of communications, and where people very often are not privileged to enjoy watching a good game of sport or other entertainment. Number one is a good telephone service. The second essential is a good broadcasting corporation service. The third is a good television service. All three can be switched off if we do not want to listen to them. We all support the radio. No one on this side of the House condemns the S.A.B.C., the fact that it is there. Very often when I do not want to listen to the tripe they dish up, I switch it off. This can happen with television as well. Surely, hon. members need not be burdened if they are not interested in the programme on our future television. It is easy enough to switch it off. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has done anything about the assurance he gave us last year when we debated his Budget, the assurance that he would deal with any biased political talks on the radio. Here I have a cutting from <i>Die Beeld</i> of 23rd March, 1969. The caption reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Basie &#x2019;n hele entjie and er as Albert.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister said, according to <i>Die Beeld</i>:</p>

<block name="quote">Minister Van Rensburg het &#x2019;n duidelike waarskuwing aan die S.A.U.K. gerig dat die radio hom uit die partypolitiek moet hou, and ers sal hy as Minister nie huiwer om op te tree nie.</block>

<p>Then he went on. [Interjections.] This is the hon. Minister&#x2019;s newspaper. I quote again:</p>

<block name="quote">As die S.A.U.K. hom in enige opsig hieraan sou skuldig maak, dan wil ek graag die versekering gee dat ek nie sal huiwer om op te tree nie.</block>

<p>This &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; broadcast is being made through the medium which belongs to every subscriber in South Africa. It does not belong to the Minister or the department, much less to those high officials who seem to have been appointed merely because they happen to be good Nationalists or good &#x201C;broeders&#x201D;. These broadcasts are becoming absolutely nauseating to us who have to bear with it every night or second night. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, what has he done in this regard&#x2014;Did he act accordingly and so strictly&#x2014;We should like to have the answer from the hon. the Minister, because when he was appointed Minister last year, we were expecting possibly too much, but he gave us the assurance that he would not tolerate any biased political addresses on current affairs programmes or any other programmes. I am not sorry for this Government for what is taking place. This is merely damaging their own image, i.e.: if there is anything left to be damaged. But I feel sorry for all the subscribers who have to put up with this unadulterated tripe. These actions are the acts of cowards. Where else does one find people attacking others, when they know that those who are being attacked, cannot defend themselves? This is nauseating, and annoying the public. But let them carry on! They are damaging their own image. I can assure them that the public are sick of it. During this coming election we will see what the public think about these broadcasts. We are looking forward to the election. I know for a fact that some Nationalists do not listen to the broadcasts either because they no more believe in what is being said, than I do.</p>

<p>If a Minister happens to say something, then he gets all the publicity. What he said, where he said it and when, is published and broadcast and is possibly corrected. But if anyone dare criticize this Government, then it is not news. It is not good for public consumption at all. This is how biased the whole programme is at the moment. I have no hesitation in saying now, that this is one of the reasons why this Government is going to suffer some heavy defeats on the 22nd April.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bodenstein">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>The instincts of the hon member for East London North, even if he does not have a sound judgment, are extremely blunted as far as the 22nd April is concerned. What will remain of that Opposition will be very little. This debate ought to be an important one. This Part Appropriation has been very clearly and succinctly elucidated by the hon. the Minister. I find it striking, and tragic as well, that the Opposition&#x2014;this we all know&#x2014;always opposed the idea to detach the Post Office from the Public Service. Despite the fact that this legislation was piloted through the House of Assembly, debated and discussed fully, they know absolutely nothing about this legislation. The hon. member for Orange Grove who is supposed to be an authority in this field, knows nothing whatsoever about it.</p>

<p>This shortage of telephones is not a serious one if seen in relation to the overall set-up of the postal services. I said this last year and I am going to reiterate that in 1948, in the days of the United Party, the shortage was 25 per cent. Now it is between 4 and 5 per cent, in spite of this tremendous growth in South Africa. But what is the actual position in regard to this new identity which the Post Office now has, with its Postmaster-General, three deputy postmasters-general and seven regional heads? It is a pity that the hon. member for Durban (Point) is leaving the House. I am eager to get to grips with him! They talk about the terrible shortage of telephones. Why do they not make a study of the various documents which are put at their disposal? They will then find that we are expanding the microwave and cable systems in order to increase the capacity for supplying telephone services. The work is making excellent progress, as is also indicated by the figures. Last year R35 million was spent on capital <span class="col_581-582" refersTo="page_0303"/>works. This is the highest figure since 1910. This year R52 million has been spent. Do hon. members on the opposite side not use the little sense they ought to have to ponder about what is happening to this R52 million? The trivialities they have come forward with tonight are shocking. What I found striking was what the hon. member for South Coast said. That hon. member knows very little about telephones, and I simply could not believe that the leader of that party in Natal would try to make political capital out of the take-over of the Durban Corporation Service by the Central Government. The hon. member for South Coast knows that the service they received before the take-over caused great problems. The hon. member for Berea as well as the hon. member for Durban (Point) came forward here with diatribes against the poor service which is now being rendered. They complained about the number of public telephone booths and confinement problems. The hon. member for Berea is a pharmacist and I doubt whether he knows much about confinements. I find it tragic that hon. members on the opposite side should come forward here in this House with trivialities, and that they do not do their homework. I have never found it necessary to approach the Minister to complain about a person who wants a telephone. I want to make it very clear that my constituency is one of the growth points of the Republic and that there is a very great shortage of telephones. However, I made use of the correct channels, i.e. the Department, the Postmaster-General and the Parliamentary Officers. I did not wail here in the House like a scalded cat. It is tragic that hon. members on the opposite side think that they are going to persuade the voting public prior to an election and convince them with this argument in regard to a shortage of telephones. What is unfair towards the present hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs is that he took this House into his confidence and stated that the position would become aggravated up to and including 1971 in order to get the large capacity structure into operation first so that the shortage could then disappear. Now this matter is, however, being exploited for political reasons. I have the yellow booklet of the United Party in front of me. They are also a yellow party. They say it is orange, but the booklet is not the colour of an orange at all; it is yellow. Because my time is limited I just want to confine myself to item 2 in this booklet. If one were to glance at the <i>Sunday Times</i> of the past three years, one will see that the hon. member for Orange Grove has been given a great deal of publicity, on the front page, the back page, with minis and without minis. And what is dished up in this propaganda organ by the United Party? Virtually nothing is said, except in item 2 which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To lift unnecessary restrictions on the importation of requirements for the manufacturers of cables and telephone equipment.</block>

<p>Do you know what they are doing here, Mr. Speaker? In South Africa we are developing a telephone equipment industry which will supply the needs of our country, and which I predict will become an export industry in the years which lie ahead. Just as in the case of Iscor, however, hon. members opposite are opposing it. They are again using the same <i>modus operandi</i>, i.e. that nothing which is done and manufactured in South Africa is good enough. They are trying in their pamphlets to bring this wonderful industry which we are developing to a standstill. By the way, I just want to mention for the sake of the record that the <i>Sunday Times</i> is kicking up a row about listening-in. The United Party now has another ally as far as kicking up a row about listening-in is concerned, namely this new newspaper, <i>Die Afrikaner.</i> If hon. members do not have anything on their conscience and if they have not done anything which they should not have done, what difference does it make who or what is listening in? I find this debating back and forth on listening-in ridiculous. I do not care who listens in to my telephone conversations. It does not worry me at all. What do I have to hide from the world, or what clandestine or underhand deeds am I committing that this should worry me? This is a ridiculous approach and I am convinced of this and have the confidence in this Government to believe that if there should be any listening-in it will be in the interests of public security and only then and not on any other basis. The hon. member for East London (North) came forward here with a ridiculous complaint to the effect that his name and that of another person appears under the same number in the telephone directory and that he hears a noise when he makes a call. I do not think the hon. member for East London (North) is so important that the ladies on the manual exchange, who work hard, will waste their time listening to his conversations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown professes to be conservative, but when he appears in the rural areas, however, he is worse than any verkrampte. When I asked that member in a courteous manner this afternoon whether I could put a question to him, he told me he did not have the time. Where I have ten minutes at my disposal, that hon. member had half an hour, but he did not have the time to reply to me. However, I now want to put a question to the hon. member. The hon. member said that a new classification of post Office employees should be introduced. I want to ask the hon. member whether it is his idea that as far as exchanges are concerned, the persons who have to work there, whether on the automatic or the manual exchanges, should not be subject to the colour bar? Is that the idea the hon. member wants to leave in our midst, arising out of the request by certain commercial organizations? I want to know from the hon. member for Simonstown whether he would defend the hon. the Minister if he should decide to make use of non-Whites in <span class="col_583-584" refersTo="page_0304"/>exchanges. Why does the hon. member not say anything? This is also the argument of the Leader of his party in the Transvaal, i.e. the hon. member for Hillbrow, who will probably become the leader of the few members of that party who will remain. I want to inform hon. members on the opposite side that it will never happen under this hon. Minister that the colour bar is relinquished. The hon. members on the opposite side complain about the telephone shortage, but in 1966, when I came to this House for the first time, they complained about overspending in regard to Government Departments. Each time the hon. member for Durban (Point) as well as the hon. member for Hillbrow rose, there were complaints about overspending. Now, however, those hon. members are saying that an insufficient amount is being spent. In politics one must be able to use one&#x2019;s judgment, and one must be able to act with political honesty.</p>

<p>Money is being taken and it is being scientifically utilized to make the entire posts system in South Africa an excellent one. If the hon. member for Durban (Point) is insinuating that the money is being taken for other purposes, it is deplorable. It is merely a further reflection on the employees in the Post Office. The hon. member for Durban (Point) must not make statements in this House against officials who cannot defend themselves. Hon. members on the opposite side also came forward with stories to the effect that the workers were unhappy. [Interjections.] I am prepared to take this matter up with the hon member for Durban (Point). He says: &#x201C;You are taking the money, but what are you doing with it&#x201D;. That was a reflection on every official in the Department of Posts. That is the tragedy of those people. They have no contact any more with the ordinary citizen. They have no feeling for the general public. Now they are coming forward here with a political courtship shortly prior to an election. But after the election they will return like an old widower who did not make the grade. The hon. member for South Coast is so concerned about Natal that he deemed it necessary to-day, while participating in the debate, to make political capital out of the question of the shortage of telephones. It was an extremely poor show. By way of repetition I just want to say&#x2014;and I want to let that suffice&#x2014;that the 22nd April will show that the shortage of telephones has nothing to do with this matter. It is a struggle between one principle and another and the National Party will be victorious.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) tried to create the impression here this evening that the Government was not prepared to face them in a debate on the radio. He accused me of informing them only last week that we were not prepared to do it. This aspect has two sides. I first want to deal with the hon. Point in regard to the statement which he made in this connection. After that I will discuss the merits of the case.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. Point? The hon. member gave an account here in connection with a letter which had been addressed to me by the general secretary of the United Party. That is correct. Two letters arrived at my Office simultaneously. They were dated 19th December and 9th January, respectively. It is, however, an acknowledged custom in South Africa that we have a political truce over Christmas and New Year. When I arrived back at my Office and there found these two letters which they had written to me during the Christmas holidays to negotiate about matters of this kind, I immediately telephoned Senator Horak. At the third attempt I managed to get in touch with him. I then told him that I would submit the matter when the relevant party body met at the end of January. I did that. After that I informed Senator Horak that the decision was in the negative.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>When, last week?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but surely last week was the week after the end of the month. That hon. member&#x2019;s general secretary did not even take the trouble to make any suggestion as to the basis on which he wanted a broadcast of this nature to take place. I took the trouble to tell my party body to which I submitted the proposal that if one envisaged something like that it should be done on this or that basis. With reference to what the hon. member said in the House to-night, I now want to ask him to tell his general secretary that if this is the way in which they want to set about matters, they must not come to me with such requests again, because I will not be prepared to negotiate with them.</p>

<p>There is, however, another aspect which I want to mention in this connection. Why does that hon. member, who, together with his colleagues, maintains that the radio broadcasts are loaded with politics, want to use the radio at election time? As one who years ago pleaded in this House that we should use the radio for this purpose as well, I want to say that it is now becoming clear to me that those hon. members are seeking platforms by means of the radio which they are unable to obtain under their own steam. We now see what the motive of the hon. member for Point is. He realizes his complete inability to attract people, to inspire them with enthusiasm, to impress them and to make any headway, and now he wants to use the radio to present his case. I want to make the prediction this evening that after 22nd April, when the radio starts announcing the results, when we hear that peep-peep-peep sound, that hon. member for Point will again come to this House with a big grudge in his <span class="col_585-586" refersTo="page_0305"/>heart against the hon. the Minister and the radio. He will say that the radio did his party an injustice. I also want to predict that, no matter what the radio does, it will be obliged to tell the story of the downfall of that hon. member and his party. Suffice it to say that the attempt which the hon. member made here this evening, is clear proof to me that he and his party do not have a case.</p>

<p>I think we are in fact protecting him. If I call to mind the hon. member for Yeoville, who on occasion appeared on television, and the embarrassment he caused his party by his performance on television, I can visualize what embarrassment the hon. member for Durban (Point) would cause his party if he should speak over the radio at this election. Therefore I think that the hon. member must be grateful to me, my party and the hon. the Minister that at this election, as before, he will have to plead his case at his own miserable meetings.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rustenburg, talking about listening in, says what difference does it make who listens in: if there is tapping, it will be done in the interests of South Africa. Naturally, we expect tapping to be done in the interests of South Africa.

<p>I only want the hon. the Minister to admit or deny. If he admits he will be contradicting the hon. the Prime Minister. I should like to see whether he has the courage to get up and tell the truth and deny what his Prime Minister has said. The hon. member for Rustenburg, talking about the hon. member for East London North&#x2019;s difficulty in getting a line to himself and his complaints about all sorts of interjections that he can hear, says what does it matter who is listening to the conversations that the hon. member for East London (North) is having. I tried to telephone the hon. member for East London (North). He has a shared line. On three occasions just before coming down for this Parliamentary session I had to give up trying to contact him because the Post Office kept on putting me through on the wrong line. I want to know why the hon. member for East London (North) should have to battle like this to get a line when the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs can have an exchange to himself?</p>

<p>I should now like to come back to the hon. member for Stellenbosch. He said that he received a letter from the Secretary of the United Party during the holidays. And on the 9th of January, 20 days later, a reminder was sent to him. He said he then phoned Senator Horak, that they could not agree to it, because we did not make any suggestions as to how the broadcast should be arranged.

They turned it down because of their experience in 1953. These members want to know why we should want to get on the air? We want to get on the air so that we can also have an opportunity of putting our case over the air and not only have the prejudiced biased broadcasts that we get over the air. That is why we want to get on the air. That is why the hon. member, the propaganda secretary, would not agree to it. That is why the Government would not agree to give the United Party an opportunity of putting their case across the air because they are afraid.</p>

<p>No, I only have another two minutes.</p>

<p>I lay at the door of this hon. Minister that he is as bad as any other Minister in neglecting his servants. I want to refer particularly to his servants in the Transkei. In the Transkei his servants are discriminated against. Other civil servants who are seconded receive special allowances. They receive housing allowances and territorial allowances. This applies to married and single civil servants. There is great exception taken to this fact. The Post Office officials feel aggrieved and rightly so. These people are not only in the big towns. They are also in the villages. That is where they have to carry out their duties. They find that the White people are moving out of the Transkei, moving out of the villages, moving out of the trading stations. His servants are being left alone in those tiny villages without social contact, without amenities and without educational <span class="col_587-588" refersTo="page_0306"/>facilities for their children. I lay it at their door that they are not looking after these servants. They should encourage these servants; they should repay them for the service they are rendering to South Africa in carrying out those duties in the villages and country districts of the Transkei. They are fulfilling a very serious need of the Transkei and those areas.</p>

I would like him to go and sit in a village where everybody else is leaving and sit there alone with his wife and children for whom he will have to find schooling, without getting any compensation. The other civil servants are getting allowances. Why must they get allowances and not those of this Minister? He does not care for them. He does not worry about them. I am glad to see that at last he is going to build some houses for them in Umtata. It is taking him quite a long time to get those houses going. Unless he builds those houses quickly he will not have any servants. The hon. the Minister cannot deny that he is experiencing difficulties in finding servants to go to the Transkei for his postal services. He is finding difficulty in staffing the Umtata Office. He will not get the staff. He will have to do what the Cape Province is doing in regard to their teachers. They are giving them houses. They are giving them allowances because they realize it is difficult to get people to go there. This hon. Minister, I suggest, should do the same thing.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin at once with the hon. member for Turffontein who raised an important matter here in regard to the social pensioners. In this regard I briefly want to make the following statement.</p>

<p>When the amendments to the Radio Act and the Broadcasting Act were dealt with during the previous session last year, I said in this House and in the Other Place as well that in regard to radio licence fees attention would be given to making concessions to the aged and other groups where justified by circumstances. In addition I undertook to give attention to cases where parents had children at boarding school or university. Concessions in this regard were held in prospect in view of the anticipated higher revenue which could be obtained from a more effective system of control over licences which could be rendered possible by amendments to the Radio Act and the Broadcasting Act. In accordance with this undertaking these matters were thoroughly investigated, and I can now inform the House that it has been decided to make, after the end of the current listener&#x2019;s licence year on 30th September, 1970, the following general concessions: (a) from 1st October, 1970, listeners&#x2019; licences at R2 each will be issued to all recipients, White as well as non-White, of old-age pensions, war veteran&#x2019;s pensions, disability grants and family allowances.</p>

<p>At the moment there is a relatively small number of social pensioners who, because of their particular neediness and other circumstances, are receiving licences at R1 each. The old tariff remains applicable even to those people receiving licences at this tariff at present; (b) children in school hostels, and full-time students who have enrolled at higher educational institutions and who are dependent upon their parents, will no longer have to take out separate licences after 1st October, 1970, but will be covered by those of the heads of the families of which they are members.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that all existing licences expiring before 30th September, must be renewed for the remaining part of the current listener&#x2019;s licence year. The fees payable upon the renewal of such licences, are calculated on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the reaction we obtained from the three Opposition parties in this country when the television commission of enquiry was announced, is an interesting one. Each of the three parties attached its own interpretation to the object the Government had in view in taking this step. The Progressive Party wanted to suggest that the Government had yielded to the pressure which was being brought to bear upon it to introduce a television service. Of course, it suits the Progressives to attach this interpretation to it, because they would like to create the impression in South Africa and in the outside world that we have a government which is yielding to the pressure they are bringing to bear upon it. The United Party in turn describe it as a transparent attempt by the Government to remove from the election contest television as a controversial political issue. It also suits the United Party to attach this interpretation to the investigations of the commission. The United Party would very much like the electorate to believe that the Government will never introduce a television service in South Africa and that the United Party alone will introduce that television service. The reaction of the Herstigte Party was quite contradictory to that of the United Party. Admittedly, they also said that the appointment of a commission was merely eyewash, but they believe that the Government has already decided to introduce a television service, and that the appointment of a commission of enquiry was merely an excuse seized upon by the Government. It also suits them to attach such an interpretation to the appointment of this commission. The Herstigte Party would like the electorate to believe that the Government is going to introduce a television service in order that they may use it as a further bogey to make the electorate afraid of the Government.</p>

<from><span class="col_589-590" refersTo="page_0307"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Both of these views, that of the United Party and that of the Herstigte Party, cannot be true. Both of these views are wrong. The Government referred the matter to a commission of enquiry because in regard to this matter the Government sincerely wanted an exhaustive enquiry into the desirability or otherwise of such a service. The only decision the Government has therefore taken, is that the time has arrived, that it has become essential to have an enquiry into the desirability or undesirability of such a service. I notice that the hon. member for Yeoville is about to leave the House. Of course, the hon. member cannot bear this decision. I want to tell him that this decision has nothing to do with the election a* all. [Laughter.] Hon. members may laugh just as much as they please. In fact, this matter was under consideration long before the Government decided to advance the date of the election. Why would the Government attempt to keep this matter out of the election? Why would the Government be afraid of this matter being made a controversial issue in the election contest? They have been making this a controversial issue ever since 1958, and at every election since that date they were rejected television and all. Did they perhaps think that the establishment of the Herstigte Party, which we know to be the arch-enemies of a television service, would deter us from doing what is to be done in the true interests of South Africa? That little party will not deter us from doing the right thing in the interests of South Africa at the right time.</p>

<p>The accusation has been levelled against the Government that it is trying to shift its responsibility on to a commission of enquiry. This accusation has been levelled by both sides, by the Herstigte Party as well as the United Party. Of course, the fact that both of them have done so, does not make the accusation true. But I do not find this strange either, because they will to an increasing extent find themselves in fraternization in each other&#x2019;s company. Although the Government has referred this matter to a commission of enquiry, it definitely does not mean that the commission will now give the ruling in regard to the introduction of a television service in South Africa. In the final analysis it still remains the Government&#x2019;s responsibility to decide about it, and this Government has never tried to evade or shirk that responsibility. I said that I found the reaction of the Opposition parties very interesting. In some respects it is also very amusing. In his fervour to tell the electorate that the Government is not at all serious about the introduction of a television service, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition went out of his way to explain how long it would take the Government to introduce a television service in South Africa. He said that this commission of enquiry which we had now appointed, would take 2&#x00BD; years before it would complete its report.</p>

<p>He said that this would give the Government a breather to decide on this matter by the next elections in 1975, and should they take a decision before the elections, it would take another five to six years before television would be introduced.

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which means that TV will not come before 1981.</block>

<p>What did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition try to suggest by that and what did he try to tell the country? He never even gave it any thought. Here we have a Leader of an Opposition who does not take the 22nd April into account and does not even have a hope of winning an election in 1975; he does not even have a hope of winning an election in 1980. What a Leader of an Opposition do we have in this country!</p>

<p>This question can now quite rightly be asked &#x2014;and I shall not take it amiss of anybody&#x2014; why did the Government decide to appoint a commission of enquiry into this matter at this stage? In 1960 Dr. Verwoerd very clearly stated the National Party standpoint in regard to television in this House.</p>

<p>Why does the hon. member judge before he has listened to what I have to say in regard to this matter? The least the hon. member can do, is to have the courtesy of showing respect to me while I am replying to him. In 1960 the late Dr. Verwoerd said the following, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The conclusion to which we have therefore come is that at this point the State must decide against the introduction of television at this stage. It is not a question of condemning this new technique. It is not a question of being old-fashioned. We are adopting this attitude, <i>inter alia,</i> because of a realistic approach towards the cost problem, and our attitude takes into account the fact that in the meantime the country without suffering any harm, can get along very well without television. In reality television provides very little which the cinema, the radio and the Press together do not provide. Consequently: The time is not ripe for the introduction of <span class="col_591-592" refersTo="page_0308"/>television, whether from a scientific, economic or socio-educational point of view.</block>

<p>This quotation is taken from column 3008 of the Hansard of 1960. Hon. members should note that the then Prime Minister placed the emphasis on the fact that the State could not decide in favour of television at that stage. Secondly, he emphasized that the time was not ripe for the introduction of television, neither in the scientific, the economic or the socio-educational sphere.</p>

<p>That was 10 years ago. Much time has passed since then. Both in the scientific sphere and the economic sphere the picture as regards television is no longer the same as it was then. The development of scientific techniques over the past 10 years has been tremendous. A possible television service which can be introduced now, is a service of much higher quality with much better technical possibilities than the type of service which could be introduced 10 years ago. A factor which could also have entered the picture since 1960, is the fact that the possibility of inter-state television broadcasts by means of satellites has arisen. This is an important technological development to which we cannot keep our eyes closed. We still have to take expert advice on the effects it may have, but we cannot ignore it.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that economically a possible television service to-day is quite a different proposition from what it was in 1960. Dr. Verwoerd also referred to this in 1960, when he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is a second principle, i.e. that no government, especially not in a small country, would introduce a new invention which renders a non-essential service before other countries have borne the experimental costs.</block>

<p>Because of the development that has taken place since then, it may be accepted that a TV service for South Africa would be a very much cheaper service to-day than would have been the case in 1960. I do not want to discuss a television service in the general economic set-up of the country. This is a matter which will be investigated by the commission of enquiry. I want to refrain from interfering in their investigations or anticipating their findings.</p>

<p>However, I want to call attention to another development which has since taken place in the economic sphere and in respect of which a change has occurred. This is the existence and the cost of television channels required for a country-wide television service. These television channels am expensive and specialized. One such channel must have a capacity equivalent to a channel capable of carrying approximately a thousand telephone conversations at the same time. This has to be provided by the communications department of the country, i.e. the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The possibility that in view of the great distances in South Africa the possibility that a television organization can be expected to lay on such channels of communication itself so as to be able to provide an extensive service, is economically and in practice quite out of the question. In the course of years the Post Office has built up a micro-wave system of communications by means of which television channels can be provided. This has been done to meet the growing demand for trunk-like telephone communications. Even five years ago this system was still too limited in extent for us to provide on it channels through which it would have been possible to make available a television service covering a reasonably large part of the country. If a service had to be introduced at that time, it could only have been a limited service on a regional basis. Such a service could only have had one programme and everybody would consequently have had to view it. At present the position is such that it is at least possible to give consideration to the cost of providing television communication channels on the existing micro-wave system. It will still be expensive, but it no longer means that a separate system will have to be built up.</p>

<p>Scientifically and economically the picture has therefore changed to such an extent that it fully justifies an investigation. I do not know how the picture has changed in the socio educational sphere, but what I do know is that viewed from a socio-educational point of view a poor and unsound television service still holds great dangers to-day. This is an aspect which, according to their terms of reference, the commission has to investigate. Who can adopt an attitude of indifference to the possible harmful effects which such a service may have on the morale and morals of the nation, and especially the youth? With the attitude they are adopting, the United Party apparently wants to suggest that this is a matter of absolute indifference to them. This is the question which is of primary importance to us. The commission of enquiry will have to investigate this matter thoroughly. There can be no doubt about the fact that we are still adhering to our view that an open television service is not something pernicious. If anybody had therefore tried to suggest that it was something pernicious, he was not pursuing National Party policy when he made that suggestion.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Connie Mulder definitely did not do it. The attitude we adopted was that the time was not yet ripe for it, since it would cost a great deal and high priorities did not justify it. This is something which may hold dangers and should be approached cautiously. This has always been our standpoint. In the light of these circumstances it is logical, once circumstances have changed to such an extent that it would be realistic to give consideration to a possible television service, first of all to go into this whole matter fully and to subject every aspect of it to a thorough, expert study.</p>

<p><span class="col_593-594" refersTo="page_0309"/>The Government is definitely not prepared, as the United Party wants to do, to proceed precipitately all of a sudden and to announce the introduction of a television service without having taken the best advice as to what is involved. If the United Party thinks that such a commission of enquiry, which has now been appointed, is unnecessary, I want to say in all seriousness to-night that in that case the United Party is adopting an extremely indifferent attitude to the interests of this nation. Can anybody consider the introduction of this powerful means of communication for the masses, for our population, one of the most heterogeneous populations in the world, without experts having reflected on its individual and joint effects on the various sections of our population, and without knowing what the needs are of every section of the population? I have already referred to the possible harmful effects which such a service may have on the morale and the morals of the nation and our youth. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Durban (Point) should rather keep quiet. He thinks very little of morale and morals. The cost of such a service on a national basis, how it is to be financed as well as its effect on our national economy, are matters about which we cannot afford to decide without taking expert advice. The United Party always has a great deal to say about our manpower position, but where television is concerned the United Party simply does not care two hoots about what happens to that manpower position, for then they want a television service for the sake of amusement. The United Party has also been suggesting throughout this whole debate that they are very concerned about the provision of telephones and the provision of a telephone service of a better standard, but when it comes to a television service for the sake of amusement, they forget about a telephone service, the technicians and the professional manpower needed for building up that telephone service and making that telephone system possible in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then we have the Afrikaans language and culture about which&#x2014;and this one can understand very well&#x2014;the United Party has never in its entire history cared two hoots. This is another matter which this commission of enquiry has to investigate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville is merely trying to divert my attention. He knows what he is trying to do. He realizes that he has been cornered, and now he would like to get out of it. After all, that is the way we know him, Sir. Unlike the extremely irresponsible attitude adopted by the United Party in regard to this matter, I want to state with great emphasis to-day that up to now the action taken by the Government in this matter has never been anything but extremely responsible towards the people of South Africa. No responsible government may, as far as the interests of its people are concerned, take any action other than having a thorough investigation made into all the many important aspects which I mentioned and which are included in the terms of reference of the commission, before taking any further decisions whatsoever in regard to this matter.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Do you see, Sir? They are trying to divert my attention because they are so afraid of what I still have to say about this matter. As Government we have a duty towards the country, and this duty we per formed by appointing a commission, consisting throughout of people of note. They are persons who are recognized experts on the matters mentioned in the terms of reference. We must bear in mind that in the Western world no two television systems are designed, controlled and organized in the same manner. There is no such thing as a general recipe for a general television service, a recipe which we may take over and introduce into our country just as it stands. Therefore, it would not bring us any further to give on television as such an opinion based on the harmful effects of other systems which cannot meet our own needs and cannot satisfy our particular requirements and, in any case, cannot be considered for our country. I say that it is extremely irresponsible of the United Party to adopt such an attitude. That is why this investigation is necessary. It will enable the Government to assess the extent to which present-day technological developments may have the effect that South Africa may shortly be placed in a position where we ourselves will not be able to exercise full control over our own atmosphere as far as communications are concerned. That is why this investigation is being instituted. In conclusion I want to emphasize once again that the Government is definitely not acting under the pressure of any interest group seeking only their own gain, nor under the pressure of the official Opposition, which seeks to derive superficial political advantage from this matter.</p>

<p>Now I come to the question of the tapping of telephone conversations. I find myself in an unenviable position to-night, because a small party has now been formed, a party which in public, in the country outside, is launching attacks on me in regard to this commission of enquiry into television which has been appointed recently, in regard to the alleged tapping of telephone conversations in the Post Office, and because I did not re-appoint Dr. Weiss to the board of control of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. Sir, all afternoon I have been sitting here waiting for one of those members to rise and have the courage of his convictions to attack me here across the floor of the House and to repeat their allegations, the allegations they are flinging at me outside this House, in public. They have had a lot of time to do so. All that happened in respect of the tapping of telephone <span class="col_595-596" refersTo="page_0310"/>conversations, was that Albert Hertzog said &#x201C;Catch him!&#x201D; outside, and now the U.P. mastiffs are charging at me here. That is all that happened. The people of South Africa will not fail to notice that such wonderful fraternization has already taken place between the United Party and the Herstigte Party. The United Party has been making attacks in regard to telephone tapping all these years. The hon. member for Ermelo sat here and denied it. But hardly had he left the National Party than he launced the same attacks. Where is he now? He was here this afternoon. I heard that he would perhaps take part in the debate to-night. Sir, he is absent. This is the courage we find in this little party, the Herstigte Party.</p>

<p>One usually laughs when one does not have courage. What else can one do? In regard to this accusation I want to say that in reply to a question I have already made the position very clear to the hon. member for Orange Grove. I left him in no uncertainty about what is happening in the Post Office. In reply to a question by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, the hon. the Prime Minister also stated very explicitly that no authorized tapping of telephone conversations took place or existed. I want to add that as far as my own Department is concerned, the position is as follows: In terms of instructions Post Office staff have been forbidden to plug in to telephone conversations, except when it is necessary to ascertain whether a conversation is in progress or to exercise control over the quality of the telephone service. Nor may they remain plugged in to a conversation for a longer period than is strictly necessary for these purposes. Besides, all telephone operators, technicians and other staff are bound by an oath of secrecy forbidding them to disclose any information they may happen to hear through plugging in to a telephone conversation. As far as the Post Office staff is concerned, this position has applied for as long as the Post Office telephone service has been in existence, and the position is the same as it was under all former Ministers of Posts and Telegraphs. I want to add most emphatically that I was appointed as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs two years ago, and that I have not in one single case authorized anybody to tap telephone conversations.</p>

<p>Who is doing the tapping then?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The position is, as I have already informed the hon. member for Orange Grove, that there are to-day electronic and other apparatus by means of which conversations may be tapped without connecting this apparatus to the telephone system. In fact, this type of apparatus can not only be used to tap telephone conversations, but also to tap ordinary conversations between persons in their homes or Offices or at a distance, without using the telephone system for that purpose at all. The hon. member for Orange Grove wanted to know what was being done about this matter. He said that something had to be done about it and that America was making investigations in this regard. This is a world-wide problem for which no solution has been found as yet. That is why America is making investigations in this regard. The hon. member for Umbilo came forward here with wonderful evidence, as he intimated. He mentioned two cases in support of his statement. He said that this had happened in regard to the telephone system of the Durban Corporation in 1960. In what way did the telephone system of the Durban Corporation concern the Post Office in 1960? [Interjections.] This is not a matter which should be raised with me. The hon. member should raise the matter on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member went further by saying that the telephone manager of the Durban Corporation had given him the assurance that if tapping took place, officials had to be aware of it. In point of fact, tapping can take place without an apparatus having to be connected to the telephone system first. How can the Post Office staff ever be aware of that? I want to tell the hon. member that that telephone manager was, what is more, telephone manager of a very limited system only. He had never been in the service of the Post Office anywhere else. Under these circumstances, and once again I find myself in the difficult position to which I referred, I found it interesting to hear the other day how the hon. member for Innesdal had demanded my dismissal. He said that if it were not because of ignorance, it was because I was incompetent. He was digging a pit for me. He had already started burying me in that pit, Sir, when he found out that he himself was in a very sorry plight. Did the hon. member for Innesdal not consult his leader, the hon. member for Ermelo, to find out what listening-in means? If he had consulted him, and he was unable to tell him, then either the hon. member for Ermelo&#x2019;s memory failed him, or he did not do his homework properly when he was a Minister. If that is not the case, this was simply a blatant attempt to reveal a military secret of this country.</p>

<p>I shall now deal with the telephone services. I am very sorry that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not here to-night. In the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> dated 25th January, 1970, he said he believed that the backlog in telephone services could be made up by doing the following: Firstly, by making more capital available; secondly, by lifting the unnecessary restriction or the importation of cables and telephone <span class="col_597-598" refersTo="page_0311"/>equipment from countries abroad; and, thirdly, by making use of private enterprise until such time as enough telephones would be available. This also happens to be stated here, in the yellow booklet of theirs, as the policy of the United Party. Sir, he says more capital should be made available. Really, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must be a stranger in this country to say that more capital should be made available. Does the hon. the Leader now know that during the financial year 1968-&#x2019;69 an amount of R39 million was spent on the improvement of our telecommunication services, and that this is a record amount in the history of the South African Post Office?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Has the backlog been made up yet?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. the Leader know that in respect of the current financial year provision has been made for R52 million for improving our telecommunication services, which amounts to an increase of 33 per cent on the expenditure during the previous year? Can it be the case that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and also the hon. member for Yeoville, who sits there making such absurd interjections, are unaware of the fact that one cannot merely make unlimited capital available without taking into account one&#x2019;s ability to utilize it productively? What the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the United Party are suggesting, is already being done. So much capital is being made available that the Minister of finance is actually complaining about it. The availability of material, equipment as well as technicians will simply render it impossible to spend more capital productively. But this is one of their solutions&#x2014;make more capital available.</p>

<p>Let us see what their other solution is, i.e. to lift unnecessary restrictions on the import of cables and telephone equipment from countries abroad. When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says this, I must unfortunately tell him that he does not know what he is talking about, for neither I, nor my Department, and what is more, nor the manufacturers of telephone equipment are aware of these restrictions the hon. the Leader is referring to. Where did the hon. the Leader hear this? Did the hon. member for Orange Grove tell him about it? Surely, by this time the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the United Party ought to know that they cannot believe the hon. member for Orange Grove. The fact of the matter is simply that the manufacturers of telephone equipment have increased their production capacity tremendously in order to keep pace with the increased demand. What could not be manufactured in South Africa, was simply imported. No complaints or excuses to the effect that their activities have in any way been curbed by import restrictions have ever been received from the suppliers. I may just add that in certain cases overseas manufacturers have asked their South African factories to assist with the production. Problems in finding sufficient technical and professional workers are also being experienced in countries abroad. I have already said that two of the United Party&#x2019;s solutions are no good. What they are suggesting, is already being done, and there are no restrictions. In any case, the solutions suggested by that side of the House, do not help me out of these difficulties at all. The hon. the Leader goes on to say that, in the third place, we should make use of private undertakings until such time as sufficient telephones are available. Does the hon. the Leader not know what is going on in South Africa? Does the hon. the Leader not know that as far back as 1968, just a few months after I had become Minister, I announced that contracts for the installation of automatic exchanges would be given to suppliers of equipment?</p>

<p>Fourteen. Negotiations for further contracts of that nature are already in progress. In addition, the laying of underground cables has already been allocated to private organizations on a contract basis. Apparently the hon. member for Orange Grove, because apparently he told all these stories to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, knows nothing about this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (North) came forward with a brand new solution. He wanted to know from me why I did not ask the people who are constructing large buildings, to lay these cables at the same time. I am sure that if the hon. member for Orange Grove had heard this a few months ago, it would also have been printed in this yellow booklet. I am indebted to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the United Party for these suggestions they have made. In point of fact, this is nothing less than an admission that the official Opposition is incapable of doing more about the matter than is already being done. All the criticism they have been levelling at the telephone service, simply does not go down.</p>

<p>Two years ago, when I became Minister and when the Post Office became independent from the Treasury, I gave the assurance, with certain reservations, that within the next five years the Post Office would for the most part make up the backlog in telecommunication services. The reservations I made, were the recruitment of staff as well as the retention of trained and experienced manpower. At that time I also said that the backlog and the waiting list for telephone services would keep on growing until 1971, after which it was expected to show a downward trend. I have repeated this matter on three different occasions, and to-night I want to say that I still abide squarely by this assurance which I gave at the time. In 1968, and last year as well, I furnished in this House a detailed explanation of the reasons for the backlog, and I do not want to do so again. <span class="col_599-600" refersTo="page_0312"/>Hon. members opposite are welcome to read what I had to say about this matter in 1968 and in 1969. Having read that, they would not say the absurd things which they said in this debate to-day and to which we had to listen. Having read that, they would at least be able to discuss this matter intelligently, and would at least have been able to express intelligent criticism on what I am doing and on what I ought to do according to them. I want to repeat that this backlog in respect of our telephone services has nothing to do with weak administration at all. It also has nothing to do with planning or with the inefficiency of staff. It has nothing to do with a weak Minister or a weak Government. On the contrary, it has everything to do with a good Government which governs the country in such an excellent manner and which has stimulated and unleashed such tremendous economic growth through its sensible financial policy that bottlenecks have developed in our economy. One of those bottlenecks is the shortage of telephones. I should like to say something to those giggling and laughing hon. members on that side of the House. I should like to furnish proof for my statement that we have a rapidly growing economy. On 30th September, 1968, there were 24,750 names on the waiting list for telephones on the Witwatersrand. Subsequently 38,969 telephones were provided over a period of one year. Normally this would have wiped out the backlog. But what was the number of telephones outstanding on 31st December, 1969? At that stage the number of names on the waiting list amounted to 29,229. This is not an old waiting list which we are struggling and battling with; it is a growing waiting list which, as a result of the economic growth, we have to contend with in these times. On 30th September, 1968, there were 3,071 names on the waiting list for Pretoria. We subsequently provided 16,457 telephones during the period I mentioned before, i.e. during that year. At the time I really thought that Pretoria would no longer have a waiting list. But on 31st December. 1969, there was another waiting list of 4,388.</p>

<p>Look at the position in the Cape Peninsula and in Durban. A great deal was said about Durban because in Durban there was a waiting list of 8,638 telephones. At that stage we had not yet added the 4,000 names on the waiting list of the Durban Telephone Corporation. At the time 8,768 telephones were provided, but on 31st December, 1969, there was a waiting list in Durban, no longer of 8,600, but of 13,887.</p>

<p>That hon. member for Durban (Point) has not been listening, surely. Hon. members on that side of the House do not understand that basically the capital extension programme of the Post Office in respect of telephone services consists of two parts. In the first place, there is the extension of the capacity of the service. In the second place, there is the utilization of that capacity, i.e. the provision of telephones. When those hon. members speak about telephone services and the provision of telephones, they simply think that it is an easy matter and that the telephone merely has to be installed. They think one can simply go on providing telephones, and accuse us of not being able to keep ahead in doing this. If this were all we did, we could have caught up with this waiting list a year ago. But then we would have been saddled with a telephone service which would simply have broken down. If that had been the case, our telecommunication buildings would not have been big enough to accommodate our telephonists. We would simply no longer have been able to maintain the telephone service by means of the manually operated telephone exchanges any more. This is not merely a question of the extension of the telephone service in South Africa. We are also dealing with a question of the modernization and the automation of this service. In my Budget speech to-day I pointed out that good progress had been made in regard to the extension of the capacity, and that good progress was being made in regard to the utilization of the capacity of our telephone system. This is where Opposition members are making a mistake, i.e. they want to measure the extension of our telephone system against the increase in the number of names on the waiting list. Then they say that we are doing nothing and that the service which is being rendered, is a rotten one. This is a totally wrong criterion to use. This is not a good barometer.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This is, of course, far too complicated for the hon. member for Yeoville to grasp. The achievements of the Post Office as regards the extension of our telecommunication and telephone services, should be measured against the provision of telephone services in this country&#x2014;that is the criterion. During the financial year 1967-&#x2019;68 176,300 telephone services were provided. During the next year, i.e. 1968-&#x2019;69, 209.563 telephone services were provided. This points to an increase, in one year&#x2019;s time, of 19 per cent on the tremendous number of telephone services already provided.</p>

<p>I was not referring to new services. After all, I told you in my Budget speech what the new services are. I am referring to the provision of telephone services. The provision of services within the same central area is not included in this figure. Only the provision of transfers from one central area to another is included in this figure. Therefore it is obvious what our problems are.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove said to-day that note was taken of the people by whom the Post Office was being criticized. He said that even an economist of note, i.e. Dr. M. D. Marais, had expressed criticism. In this regard he quoted from an article taken from the <i>Sunday Times.</i> As far as this was concerned, the hon. member&#x2019;s information was very much out of date. Dr. Marais denied that report which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> In <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 15th December Dr. Marais said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although the telephone service in the Republic is inadequate, it cannot be blamed on poor planning or inefficient work by the Post Office. It is a result of the virile growth of a dynamic economy. He referred to a report in an English language Sunday paper yesterday, in which the impression was created that he was criticizing the Post Office. This conclusion, Dr. Marais said, was wrong. The infra-structure such as transport, telephone services and other public services, cannot always keep pace if the economy develops as rapidly as has been the case in South Africa. Tax payers &#x2026;</block>

<p>And this is at the same time a reply to all the rubbish we had to hear from the hon. member for Durban (Point).</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; are faced with a choice. They can either pay more taxes and receive the full telephone services of the Post Office, or they can pay the taxes they are paying now and wait for the service to make up the backlog.</block>

<p>I should like to treat the hon. member for South Coast with respect, and I really do not know what made him so terribly angry this afternoon. I do have respect for him. I do not think I have ever given the hon. member for South Coast cause to be so terribly offended. The hon. member for South Coast complained about the telephone services subsequent to our taking over the telephone corporation in Durban. He said the service had deteriorated. There are many other parts of the country where complaints are also being heard about the service, and I do not mind admitting it. I am being sincere in regard to this matter, because why should I be insincere about these matters?</p>

<p>In my Department nothing is being done which need be hidden under the counter. We took over that Durban Corporation service on 1st April, 1969, as the hon. member himself knows. We took over that telephone corporation with nearly all its employees. That is why this cannot possibly be the case, and I do not hope the hon. member for South Coast now wants to level against the employees the accusation that they have deteriorated because they are now working for the State. What is more, we also provided extra staff to improve the position there. After all, hon. members should also bear in mind that the system we took over there, was a fairly outdated one. We should therefore have expected to encounter problems there at some time or other. The hon. member for South Coast should, after all, not be unfair, unjust and unreasonable towards me or the Post Office. It is impossible for us to extend that telephone system of the Durban Corporation the way it ought to be in the short time it has been in our possession. The hon. member ought to know that one needs time to plan. The hon. member ought to know that it takes a factory two to three years to execute the orders placed with it. Furthermore, the hon. member ought to know that it takes 18 months to instal that apparatus. In spite of that the hon. member for South Coast became furious with me here this afternoon because I had been unable to straighten out the Durban Corporation service within 10 months. I think this is unfair.</p>

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(a) Besides a thorough knowledge of veld and game, a game warden must, in his area, be well acquainted with the condition of the grazing and water supplies, numbers and movements of game and the increase and mortality thereof. Furthermore, he must protect his area against veld fires and poaching; ensure that windmills are in good working order; maintain fences; supervise controlled veldfires; perform observations in colloboration with the biological personnel and continually patrol his area in order to exercise control in genera] to combat soil erosion and to control intruding vegetation. He is also responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of the National Parks Act, 1962, especially section 20 thereof, which stipulates, <i>inter alia,</i> that no person shall enter into or reside in a park without the necessary consent, and which prohibits certain other actions.</li>

<li>(b) Game wardens are selected by the Director of National Parks and the Conservator of Nature of the specific park, and appointed by the National Parks Board of Trustees. Considerations especially taken into account are the candidate&#x2019;s integrity, his ability to care for himself in the veld; his knowledge of fauna and flora and his capacity to manage people (white and non-white). Knowledge of a Bantu language spoken in the Lowveld is always an additional recommendation, as well as a wife who is prepared frequently to live a lonely and secluded life.</li>

<block name="quote">What is the amount of the Government subsidy per student at each university in the Republic.</block>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_national_education" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION:</from>

<p>According to the provision made in the Estimates, the Government subsidy per <span class="col_629-630" refersTo="page_0327"/>student at each university in the Republic in respect of 1969 is as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>University of Pretoria: R530</li>

<li>University of the Witwatersrand: R613</li>

<li>Rand Afrikaans University: R1,895</li>

<li>University of Cape Town: R581</li>

<li>University of the Orange Free State: R583</li>

<li>University of Port Elizabeth: R1,669</li>

<li>University of Stellenbosch: R609</li>

<li>Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education: R597</li>

<li>Rhodes University: R789</li>

<li>University of Natal: R659</li>

<li>University of South Africa: R152</li>

</ul>

<p>The Government subsidy in respect of the Rand Afrikaans University and the University of Port Elizabeth is high on account of the foundation subsidy which is paid to the Universities.</p>

<p>The above figures are, as already stated, according to the provision made in the Estimates and may have to be slightly adjusted when the actual subsidies, calculated on the approved basis, are paid. All the final claims in respect of salary adjustments have not yet been received.</p>

<question by="#marais" to="#minister_of_transport">

<p><b>Question:</b></p>

<ol>

<li>(1) How many unguarded level crossings are there in the Republic and South-West Africa;</li>

<li>(2) whether any calculation has been made of the cost of making unguarded level crossings safe and /or eliminating them; if so, what is the estimated cost; if not, why not;</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#marais">

<p><b>Reply:</b></p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Approximately 4,000.</li>

<li>(2) No; estimates are only prepared for schemes which are to be carried out in the near future. Calculation of the cost of the simultaneous elimination and /or protection of all level crossings will be unrealistic owing to price fluctuations as well as changing circumstances and demands. According to a rough estimate based on ruling prices, it will cost approximately R800 million to eliminate all level crossings or R80 million to provide improved protective devices at all crossings.</li>

<li>(3) (a) and (b) Full details in respect of the period prior to 1st April, 1928, are not available. Since that date 752 level crossings have been eliminated and protection provided at 276 unprotected level crossings at a total cost of R35 million.</li>

<li>(4) (a) and (b) The available details do not differentiate between accidents at guarded and unguarded level crossings. Particulars of level crossing accidents since 1910 are as follows:&#x2014;</li>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the few minutes at my disposal I should first like to assure the hon. member for Durban (Point) that I did not mean to offend him personally last night. That was not my intention. I am sorry if the hon. member is under that wrong impression.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (North) referred to the assurance which I gave last year, namely that I would act if the programme &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; became guilty of entering the party political arena. I waited for the hon. member to produce proof, but he never got round to it. This does not mean that I expected him ever to get round to it, because I have been waiting since 1968 for proof from his hon. Leader. I challenged him at that time to produce the proof, and I am still waiting for it. The hon. member for Orange Grove subsequently stepped into the breach for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and produced ten proofs, proofs which were not proofs at all. They were proofs which dated back to the year 1967, when I had not yet become the Minister. I want to tell the hon. member for East London (North) that, should he bring me the proofs, I would investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Railways and Harbours Part Appropriation Bill unless and until the Minister gives an assurance that&#x2014;</block>

<li>(2) he will expedite consideration of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Co-ordination of Transport in South Africa&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>Yesterday I made some remarks about the strange nature of the statement the Minister made to us in introducing the Second Reading of this Bill. It was, of course, totally inadequate if one compares it with the practice in this House of Ministers of Transport in the past and the Minister of Finance. The hon. the Minister asks the House to vote R650 million on account to conduct the business of the Administration of the South African Railways and Harbours until a full budget can be presented to the House in the session that will follow the General Election. But in his statement there was no report on the progress and the expectations of the Railways except for a few generalizations about the fact that there were changes in the transport of maize and that high-rated traffic had increased&#x2014; things which we all knew. Anybody who is reasonably interested in what is happening in South Africa must be aware of those matters. But we had no indication of whether the Minister&#x2019;s expectations were being realized, or how the Railways were faring in comparison with the Harbours, the Airways and the pipelines, which are all matters of concern. We had no indication about the actual position of the staff, although there was some reference to the staff shortage. We had no indication of measures, apart from mechanization, taken to overcome the staff shortage. In fact, I think we can truthfully say that the Minister gave us a minimum of information with regard to the year before us and the year that is past. He gave us the maximum information about his own virtues which meant that his speech was fairly short, but it certainly did not serve the purpose of introducing this measure to the House.</p>

<p>It has become clear from reports we have had that the hon. the Minister in his Budget last year was wrong as usual. He told us to expect a deficit on the year&#x2019;s workings of just over R5 million. Every indication at the moment is that he is going to have a whopping surplus. If there had been changes in the economic situation of South Africa after the hon. the Minister had introduced his Budget we could have forgiven him. But he was proved wrong immediately. Although the hon. the Minister budgeted for a deficit of over R5 million the first three or four months of the Railways&#x2019; working already showed a surplus of R4 million.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Are you annoyed about that now!</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell hon. members exactly how I feel about it. It is also clear that at this rate we will have a surplus on the working of the South African Railways and Harbours at the end of the year running into eight figures again. I think we are entitled in the case of the hon. the Minister of Transport, as in the case of the hon. the Minister of Finance, to more accurate bookkeeping. If one has a monopoly, such as the South African Railways and Harbours have, which is protected by statute against competition, the hon. the Minister by planning and fixing his rates can achieve almost any result. If he achieves these large surpluses it is a form of taxation. It is not as a result of good administration or good business because it is a monopoly and there is no competition. He has the field all to himself. When he produces these huge surpluses it is equivalent to a form of taxation, because every person who lives in South Africa contributes to the revenue of the South African Railways directly or indirectly. I therefore want to register the protest of the Opposition against the continuing practice of the hon. the Minister to which we have referred in the past with actual examples which I am not going to repeat, to budget wrongly every year. He underestimates his income and overestimates his expenditure and produces these artificial surpluses which is another burden on the common man in South Africa. In the case of the purchase tax, the hon. the Minister of finance at least had the insight to come almost at once with an apology to the nation and to reduce some of those taxes, even though not enough of them, and to admit that the criticism of the Opposition that he was exploiting the public was well-founded.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! That is not under consideration now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No, but surely I can draw a parallel. I want to bring a point home to the hon. the Minister of Transport, namely that he should do the same. When he finds as the year progresses that he has been hopelessly wrong in his calculations, surely he should take an early opportunity of giving the people the benefit of his having discovered his mistake or to give it to his staff? If the hon. the Minister does not have the power, he should see that he gets it. He has expert advisers and it should be possible for him to budget more accurately. One can understand that after three or four months the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s expectations can be proved wrong, but when from the very first month of the new year he is out at the rate of millions of rand per month, surely we can take notice of the fact that he is not presenting a true picture to the House when he presents his Budget.</p>

<p>I also want to express my regret that there has been no reaction on the part of the South African Railways to the recommendations made by the Marais Commission which was appointed during the first half of the last decade, with one exception. The hon. the Minister will appreciate that we have not had an opportunity of studying his interim report which was tabled yesterday, but one was able <span class="col_641-642" refersTo="page_0333"/>to get the gist of what was happening. The hon. the Minister says quite truthfully that this is a far-reaching report and is one which will affect the economy of the South African Railways and of the country to a considerable extent. We therefore concede that it does require careful study. It is interesting to note that on one of the most difficult recommendations of the commission the hon. the Minister can give an immediate reply. On many others, which will be to the advantage of the railway users, the staff and the public, he has great difficulty in coming to a decision.</p>

<p>What struck me on a cursory reading of this report is that it was a rationalization. It was not an argument which led to conclusions. It was a conclusion with arguments found afterwards to put in front of it. It was a rationalization. The Minister and the Administration had obviously made up their minds to reject the recommendation that the Railways, Harbours, Pipeline and Airways should remain under the control of one Minister but should be separated administratively. They sat down to find arguments. To give one example, hon. members only have to read para. 6 (3) and subsequent paragraphs of this report to see what I mean. There the point is made that the Airways and the Harbours get considerable benefits from their association with the Railways. The Railways render a great number of very valuable services to these bodies. According to this report the expenses would go up if they had to render these services to themselves. That is a point. Why should the Airways and the Harbours show these artificial profits? Why should the Railways present such a sorry picture when in fact it is rendering these valuable services to the more profitable aspects of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Administration? Why should there not be debits between independent bodies brought into account against the Airways and the Harbours for the services that the Railways render? Why should we not get a true picture of the working results of these three bodies instead of the false one that we get at the moment? As I have said before, I think it is a pity that the hon. the Minister did not give us a fuller picture of how these various branches of the service are functioning. Last year we had the shocking situation that the Airways showed a profit of almost R3&#x00BD; million and the Harbours a profit of R14,600,000. The Pipelines to the overtaxed Southern Transvaal showed a profit of R20 million. And the hon. the Minister tells us that this profit will be much higher this year. In contrast with these profits the Railways showed a loss of R30 million. The entire surplus shown by the hon. the Minister was derived after the loss of the Railways of R30 million had been covered by the other three services. We want to know what is happening and to what extent is that a true reflection of what is happening? To what extent do these three other bodies benefit from services by the South African Railways? What is it worth to them? By what amounts have their profits been reduced and the deficit of the</p>

<p>Railways adjusted accordingly? We are not shown a true picture. I think it is time that we should get a true picture. The consumers and the users of these various services are entitled to know. It is really unforgivable. I know that the hon. the Minister and his Administration have taken a stand in this matter. It will be very difficult to persuade them. We shall have to wait until the 23rd April before we can expect a change in this policy. We know that. I think it is becoming disgraceful that the community of the Witwatersrand, Vereeniging, Pretoria and the surrounding areas of the Southern Transvaal and the Northern Free State should be subsidizing the State transport services of South Africa to the tune of more than R20 million per year. I have tried to discover what justification there is for this discrimination against one community. The only answer I can find is a statement that comes in certain publications and statements by the Government that the revenue from petrol accrued to the South African Railways before the pipeline was established. Therefore the Railways are entitled to retain this revenue now that the pipeline has been established. I cannot see the logic of that. Because something was, it does not mean that it should be for ever. Because the benefits of modern development, modern technology, modern science and progress are acquired by people like the hon. the Minister who after years of fighting from this side of the House, accepted our policy and built a pipeline, there is still no justification for this position. Why should the people who benefit be deprived of their benefits? Why should they be asked to subsidise the rest of South Africa even more than they do to-day? I should like to remind the hon. the Minister who represents a Witwatersrand constituency that the Receiver of Revenue in Johannesburg collects by far the greatest amount of the taxation that the Government receives. He collects 40 per cent of the direct taxation paid in South Africa. Now the community of the Southern Transvaal and the Northern Free State are being called upon to subsidize, the South African Railways transport users in that area to the extent of probably R25 million per year.</p>

<p>It is an injustice that cannot be tolerated. This benefit should be given to the people of South Africa, preferably to the people concerned who are paying in any case a very large share of the expenses of running the South African state. It is something which one cannot justify or accept and a change will have to come about. It will come. The hon. the Minister knows that what the United Party says today he and his government do the day thereafter or the year thereafter. It is going to happen. The longest delay I could find was 40 years in the case of the outward policy. It will happen but it is a pity that in the meantime this injustice should be suffered by the people affected.</p>

<p>The change is coming and the hon. the Minister need not be concerned about that. One of the reasons for this change that is about to come is that the public are beginning to realize that the government thinks behind the United Party, sometimes a year behind and sometimes 40 years. Perhaps the people of South Africa are now entitled to the original thinking of the United Party at a time when it can make the best impact upon their welfare.</p>

<p>The other thing I thought the hon. the Minister could have told us more about is a vexing problem which I am sure is making him very unhappy too, namely the staff shortage on the South African Railways and Harbours. It is difficult to know exactly what is happening because one gets so many contradictory statements. The most authoritative statement I could find came from the General Manager himself on the 24th or 23rd July, when he told a conference of staff associations in Johannesburg that the South African Railways were short of 26,0 white workers alone. That in itself is frightening. But it becomes more frightening when one notices that the General Manager went on to say that in spite of this shortage the work of the Railways was increasing quite spectacularly. He made the point that even with 26,0 white workers short&#x2014;one does not know how many non-white workers are short&#x2014;the Railways were hauling 46 million tons of traffic and handling 153 million passengers per year. That may be a sign of tremendous efficiency. There were encouraging signs in this speech by the General Manager and in other reports that we have had that the Railways are stimulated by this staff shortage to seek greater efficiency, and with success in some respects. The General Manager could tell the staff associations that as a result of action taken by the management, namely mechanization and greater rationalization in the use of labour, they have found it possible to dispense with the labour of 600 platelayers and 10,000 Bantu labourers. That is their recent achievement. But if one were to be satisfied that this is a sign of great efficiency and better achievement on the part of the South African Railways and Harbours one will also have to be satisfied that the staff were in a happier position than before these measures were taken. That no one can claim. No one can claim that the benefits of rationalization and mechanization are also redounding to the benefit of the staff of the South African Railways and Harbours; everyone knows that the staff is being subjected to intolerable strains. I do not think I am exaggerating if I were to say that the position con cerning overtime work by some sections of the staff, particularly the running staff, is becoming preposterous and intolerable. I see that Mr. P. C. du Plessis, the new chairman of the Consultative Staff Associations, has referred in his speeches to the critical situation that obtains now as far as overtime is concerned in the Railway services. He has told us that the situation is now affecting the health and the productivity of large sections of the staff. I think it is ridiculous that members of the staff are expected to undertake to work regularly an average of 12 hours for five days of the week and Saturday mornings in many cases. I think it is preposterous for clerical staff who are doing a hard day&#x2019;s work and an honest day&#x2019;s work to be called upon to work overtime as shunters and other jobs which are normally done by the other sections of the staff. I think it is unheard of that shuttle services have to be run from certain towns on the reef and further afield for employees so that they can work overtime in spheres where they are not normally employed. Where will it end? Where is it going to? What is the hon. Minister doing or &#x201C;laat hy Gods water maar oor Gods akker loop?&#x201D; Something must be done because this cannot continue. It is wrong, it is unforgivable that the Minister is creating a situation where overtime earnings psychologically are regarded by the employee as a normal part of his income, entitling him to a normal adjustment of his standard of living to a higher income group. That is happening to-day and the majority of workers know to-day if they were ever to go back to normal working hours, they will not be able to exist on the basic wages and salaries the Minister is paying.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The truth does not change with time. Truth is eternal and the mess the hon. Minister has created in regard to the staff of the South African Railways, is unchanged. One has to keep on hammering at it. One has a duty towards these people which one has to discharge. What I am afraid of now is the result of the fact that overtime is becoming part of the normal life of the railway employee, all the reductions in hours of work, in the concept of what is a just period of work per week for the worker, is disappearing. All the work that was done by enlightened authors, writers, propagandists and trade union leaders is negatived on the Railways; everything that has been done from the days of Charles Dickens to the days of J. L. V. Liebenberg, disappears under the administration of this hon. Minister of Transport. I think it is wrong, I think it is cruel. I think it is unjust and I think it is abusing the willingness of the railwayman in South Africa to help the hon. Minister ouf of a mess. I think something should be done. There is certainly no happiness among the South African railway workers. We received an answer to a question from the Deputy Minister to-day dealing with the fact that a <span class="col_645-646" refersTo="page_0335"/>series of commissions of inquiry under the new Act of a few years ago has had to be appointed by the State President to resolve difficulties between the Minister and his staff. Even now, three of the commissions of inquiry are still in session. Three were appointed in November and I have not seen what the outcome of their inquiries have been. The technical supervising staff for example, have been involved in a dispute with the Minister since 1968. Special drivers have been battling for years to get justice for their cause. The most striking example however, is the dispute between the Minister and the Salstaff Association. This dispute has been dragging on since 1965 when the hon. the Minister just before the 1966 election gave considerable increases to the staff which resulted in a maladjustment between the salaried staff and other sections of the staff. They have been complaining and they have been asking for a redress of their grievances since 1965. However, the matter has still not been finally resolved. In the private sector trade unions have been complaining about the fact that certain employers deliberately drag out proceedings, using all the machinery which the labour conciliation machinery provides in order not to give justice to their employees. When a dispute in the Railways lasts from 1965 to 1970 and is still going on. one is entitled to ask if the hon. the Minister is not using a similar technique. Is he not doing this because he does not want to resolve the dispute, because while the dispute drags on, he does not want to pay these people the salaries which they ought to receive? That is a feeling that becomes unavoidable and I can only trust that this matter will be resolved very soon and that it will not happen again. We hope that this will not become a part of the pattern of conciliation between the Minister and his staff on the South African Railways. There is bitterness about this issue. I have here for example a report of a meeting which was held in Johannesburg on the 11th July, 1969 by the Western Transvaal branch of the Salstaff Association. It was attended by 800 railway workers after many could not get into the hall and had to be turned away. When you have a crowd of a thousand trying to attend a railway meeting to air their grievances, you cannot think that that section of the staff can be satisfied. There must be bitterness amongst them. The hon. Minister knows that to-day it is one of the most difficult things to get people to attend a meeting. I want to read the following comment on that meeting:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. J. H. Swanepoel, Western Transvaal chairman of Salstaff, said to-day that great dissatisfaction was expressed at the various service conditions of the clerical and allied grade &#x2026; Serious dissatisfaction was also expressed in the delay in implementing the shorter lunch break &#x2026; Members were particularly outspoken about the inadequate salaries of the clerical and allied grades &#x2026; Mr. Swanepoel said there was a widespread discontent and frustration amongst the salaried staff in general because of the inadequate salaries for first grade, senior and principal clerks&#x2026;. Many speakers expressed their bitter disappointment that representations which the staff associations had been making since 1965 that the three grades be adjusted, have not been heeded.</block>

<p>And so it goes on, Sir. And yet we are being asked to believe that there is nothing but happiness and contentment on the S.A. Railways. Every one of us who has contact with these people know that there is seething dissatisfaction and, what is more, that it is growing; the disillusionment with the Government and with the Administration is growing by the day.</p>

<p>What kind of contact do you have with the railwaymen?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>My hon. friend will be surprised; he will indeed be surprised. The Minister knows of some of the contacts I have, or ought to know, and he knows that when I bring problems of particular people to his attention I do so without trying to make political capital out of it. I usually do it with the object of getting justice done and I must say that the Minister reciprocates in a similar spirit and I appreciate that these cases are dealt with on merit. The fact is that I do not always make these cases public, although there are in fact some startling cases. The fact that I do not do this does not entitle the hon. member to infer that I do not know what is going on amongst the staff on the S.A. Railways. In any event, this explains why people are to-day resigning from the S.A. Railways at a rate of 2,000 per month, as was borne out once more by a reply to a question which, as far as I can remember, was put to the Minister last week. What is most alarming is that at present more people are resigning from the S.A. Railways than the number who are recruited inclusive of those who return after having resigned. Where is this going to end? Where is it going to end if fewer and fewer people continue working on the S.A. Railways? It is clear that the measures already taken to combat the staff shortage are not enough, good as they may be. There is a story going the rounds in Johannesburg of 10 clerical staff members who resigned to go to work in a bank. The Railway authorities thereupon sent an inspector along to interview them and to find out why all of them resigned together in order to go to work in a bank. Well, Sir, do you know what happened? The inspector went along, listened to the disadvantages of working for the S.A. Railways and to the advantages of working for the bank; and he himself did not return to the S.A. Railways&#x2014; he joined the bank! It may be a true story or it may not be true, but it could be true and the Minister should therefore pay heed to it. In the olden days we all accepted that it did not matter that a man working in the Civil Service or on the S.A. Railways was being <span class="col_647-648" refersTo="page_0336"/>paid less; it did not matter because he had security and all sorts of fringe benefits which he could not get elsewhere. But the world has changed, and to-day many private employers in South Africa, corporations and smaller employers, are offering similar fringe benefits and the same security as that offered by the S.A. Railways. People can therefore no longer hide behind the story that if you work for the State you enjoy advantages which you cannot get when working for private enterprise. In fact, the position to-day is the opposite, and the attitude of the Government is wrong. This was never typified more clearly than a few years ago when the Government passed a Bill prohibiting the City Council of Johannesburg from paying their people according to their worth, because the Civil Service and the S.A. Railways could not compete. Nothing could exemplify more clearly the shortsighted, bigoted and narrow attitude of the Government and the S.A. Railways than that simple and undeniable fact, which is part of the miserable history of this Government&#x2019;s administration.</p>

<p>There are certain remedies the Government can take; they are not doing it at the moment. One of these remedies is to pay proper attention to the pay demands of the staff. The time is past for the Minister to dish out a largesse from time to time, unscientifically and at random, as he does when he from time to time announces a, say, 10 per cent increase all round. Surely the time has come to follow the example being set by United Party administrations elsewhere in South Africa by appointing experts to evaluate the work that is being done by the various sections of the staff and to reconsider the pay structure in accordance with the findings of those expert job evaluators. If that is done, we would not have the anomalies which we have to-day; we would not have the grievances which we have to-day. Take for example, the grievance of our Airways&#x2019; technicians with the high skills demanded from them and the extreme care they are expected to exercise to maintain our aircraft on which the lives of many people depend. Yet they cannot be justly rewarded because their jobs are considered to be of the same value as those of people who do similar work but with less responsibility and less danger for the public likely to arise from negligence on their part. I believe that some sort of scientific job evaluation on the S.A. Railways is long overdue.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we on this side of the House believe that the Minister of Transport should do what the hon. Minister of finance and the hon. the Minister of the Interior did and accept the advice of the Opposition and change the nature of the pension schemes on the S.A. Railways. All over the world wherever you have a government organization like the Railways or a corporation which is humanly speaking established for all time, the old idea of a pension fund, a superannuation fund which has to be actuarially correct and in which R500 million is invested, like in the case of the S.A. Railways, at an uneconomic rate of interest in order to enable the Government to get at the expense of the worker money at a lower rate of interest, this old idea is disappearing. The tendency to-day is towards non-contributory pension schemes where the worker of to-day pays the pension of the workers of the immediate past, and that goes on for all time. The Government has accepted that for the Civil Service by reducing the contribution of the civil servant to their pension fund and undertaking to reduce it even further. But not so this hon. Minister. Has he no confidence in the future of the S.A. Railways? This could mean something. There is this huge sum of money, I believe more than R500 million, in the Superannuation Fund and the interest thereon can be used to subsidize pensions. There is good reason for retaining the superannuation committee on which the worker will be represented for the planning and conduct of the pension scheme. An enlightened administration will take urgent steps to change the nature of the superannuation scheme for the S.A. Railways and reduce the contributory nature of it with the object of eventually making it a non-contributory scheme.</p>

<p>Whilst on pensions, the time is already overdue for pensioners who went on pension before 1951 to be placed in some respects on the same basis as those people who went on pension since. This goes particularly for widows&#x2019; pensions. I think we have advanced far enough in South Africa to extend what was considered just and necessary in 1951 also to the fast declining number of pensioners and their widows who went on pension 19 years ago, before 1951.</p>

<p>Another matter to which the hon. the Minister should give attention, although it is not directly his responsibility, is the wastage of manpower on the S.A. Railways and Harbours as a result of the system of military training which is also imposed upon the Railway staff. The hon. the Minister, being an influential man, should take it up at Cabinet level. It is generally accepted to-day that the compulsory period of one year&#x2019;s military training is not really necessary. Almost all the young men who return from this year&#x2019;s training, particularly those in the infantry, will tell you stories of wasted time, of weeks of idleness, especially in South West Africa. Surely, Sir, since we have such a tremendous manpower shortage in South Africa which is hitting the Railways so hard, the time has come when the Minister should privately and, if necessary, publicly protest against this misuse of our youthful manpower in this country. More intensive and better training on the part of the Defence Force can mean a great relief to the S.A. Railways and to private enterprise.</p>

<p>I also want to say to the Minister that he can do much to relieve the staff shortage if he were to pay more attention to the housing problems of his employees. Sir, since the old <span class="col_649-650" refersTo="page_0337"/>days when Mr. Pirow introduced the housing schemes for railway employees, much has been done that we are all proud of to house our employees on the S.A. Railways and Harbours, but much remains to be done.</p>

<p>If we accept the proposition which was accepted in the days when the United Party was in power that an employee should not be expected to pay more than 20 per cent of his salary or his income on rental or instalments on his house, then I think the Minister will agree that as prices are to-day there are hundreds and probably thousands of railwaymen in our cities who are paying considerably in excess of 20 per cent of their income on rent. Sir, in the days of a United Party Government we had a rent rebate scheme, as the hon. the Minister may remember. That scheme, like so many other good things that we had in the days of the United Party Government, is gone. Now I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that with land prices as they are to-day and with the cost of housing what it is to-day, with rentals what they are to-day, the time has come when he should seriously consider reintroducing a rent rebate system in order to ensure that no more than a just proportion of a man&#x2019;s income is spent on keeping a roof over his head.</p>

<p>Sir, I think there is a whole series of legitimate grievances, causes for unhappiness, among the employees of the S.A. Railways and Harbours, to which the Minister should give due attention. Other speakers on this side of the House will devote more time to them. Although I am not going to enlarge upon it, I want to mention the system of discipline on the S.A. Railways and Harbours&#x2014;the system of disciplinary superintendents. The hon. the Minister will hear more of that from other speakers on this side but I want him to consider carefully whether this is the best way and the most reasonable way to do justice to the workers of the S.A. Railways and Harbours and even to deal with cases of discipline. I want particularly to mention something which, considering the manner in which it is done, one cannot in the times in which we are living to-day reconcile with one&#x2019;s conscience and that is what the railwaymen call the system of &#x201C;bush&#x201D; courts. I see the hon. member for South Coast looks at me in bewilderment; it is something which really bewilders one.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, amongst other things. Let me explain to the hon. the member who is looking at me quizically what it means. It means that a man is arrested and charged with some offence connected with his employment on the S.A. Railways and Harbours. He is taken before an independent court of jus tice, say a magistrate. The prosecution produces all the evidence it can against this man and he produces his defence and then the magistrate weighs the evidence and comes to the conclusion that the case against this man has not been proved and he is acquitted. Then, Sir, the Administration come along and appoint a court consisting, I take it, of Railway officials who are not necessarily trained in law or in the assessment of evidence. The man is retried and is found guilty by this bush court of the S.A. Railways and Harbours and is punished and even sometimes dismissed. But the hon. the Minister reminded me of something which I have forgotten, and in the process grave injustices are done. I remember one case published in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> and I think that is what the Minister had in mind because he acted, where a railwayman was found not guilty by the courts but was found guilty by a bush court. He took further steps; he appealed and other litigation followed, and eventually he was exonerated by the S.A. Railways; he was found to be not guilty, but then they refused to repay to him the salary he had lost while he was suspended as the result of the action of the bush court. Can you believe it, Sir? And I say thank God for a newspaper like the <i>Sunday Times</i> which brought that injustice to the attention of the public and to the notice of the hon. the Minister, with the result that quite speedily he had his back pay refunded to him, as was his due. But how many cases may there not be which never come to the attention of the hon. the Minister, where this publicity does not take place and the Railways get away with it? On what possible grounds can one justify it to-day that a man who has been tried by the trusted courts of South Africa and has been found to be innocent, or where at least it has been found that there is so much doubt that he cannot be convicted, should be convicted by a lay court consisting of his employers and punished as if he were guilty? On what possible grounds can it be justified, and how long is it going to go on? When is the Minister going to realize that this cannot be allowed?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I said that there were no proper courts, run by legally trained people. The Railways do not employ magistrates and judges, so how can they appoint a court? The whole point is that it is not a court; it is done administratively. [Interjection.] Whatever the Minister&#x2019;s reply is, this injustice exists. People who are found not guilty by the courts of South Africa are found guilty by the Railways and they are punished, and the Minister knows that. The Minister may argue about technical terminology, but he cannot escape the fact.</p>

<p>Sir, there are other things, too, that one could deal with in the light of the very inadequate statement we had from the hon. the <span class="col_651-652" refersTo="page_0338"/>Minister when he introduced the Part Appropriation Bill. I was surprised that the hon. the Minister did not refer to accidents. I was surprised that he did not take this opportunity, offered by this Part Appropriation, to express some sympathy or regret in connection with the children who died in the level-crossing accident at Meyerton not so long ago. I am not going to expand upon this, but I want to express the hope, which will be supported by other speakers on this side, that we shall expedite the good work which is being done in eliminating level-crossings and other safety measures on the S.A. Railways and on our roads, which affect the Minister in another capacity. One can only hope that more money and more energy and more determination will be shown by the Railways Administration and the other bodies concerned once and for all to eliminate this murderous antiquity which survives in South Africa, namely level-crossings which are unprotected or inadequately protected.</p>

<p>Finally I want to spend a little time with the hon. the Minister on the responsibility of the S.A. Railways for the care of animals entrusted to it. The Minister will remember that not so long ago the Meat Control Board abolished permits for the consignment of slaughter animals to the Johannesburg market. The result was that in the heat of summer these animals could not be slaughtered in time and many of them died in the most distressing circumstances of exposure to heat and thirst. I accept that the responsibility is that of the control board concerned, which without proper consideration or proper checking of the situation simply abolished the need for permits to consign animals to the market. But I want to know how it came about that there was no way of giving these animals water and sustaining them during the period of delay. Is it not the responsibility of the S.A. Railways to see that the animals it is conveying are watered and fed. if necessary, though it be at the expense of the consignor?</p>

<p>This is the most interesting and the most foolish interjection of which that hon. member has ever been guilty in this House, and I am glad that I have a few minutes left to deal with it. How in heaven&#x2019;s name can the Johannesburg Municipality be blamed for an ill-considered action by the control board responsible for the issuing of permits? How can the Johannesburg Municipality be blamed for the fact that it has been trying to build a larger abattoir in Johannesburg for years now, but has been prevented from doing so because of the Government&#x2019;s limitation on its capital expenditure? How can the Johannesburg Municipality be blamed when, as a matter of fact, its average slaughterings known to the Meat Control Board total about 5,000 animals per week? How can it be blamed, when as a result of making its employees work overtime, and by calling in employees from other services to help, it increased the rate of slaughtering by about 700 a week, in spite of the fact that, owing to the strain placed upon the abattoirs, it had two mechanical breakdowns which would have limited the number of slaughterings in any case? [Interjections.] No, Sir, one cannot blame the Johannesburg Municipality which is equipped to slaughter a certain number of animals per week when the Livestock and Meat Industries Control Board suddenly sends along more animals than the abattoir can cope with. [Interjection.] We are not debating the actions of the control board now. We are discussing the Railways. At a later occasion we shall be able to deal with this matter adequately under the Part Appropriation Bill. If we discuss this matter any further now, I am sure that you will call us to order any moment now, Sir. Anyway, I have made my point. I now come back to the South African Railways and Harbours. I want to know why it is that such a situation can arise. Surely it is elementary that, when a carrier accepts responsibility for conveying livestock, it should also ensure that that livestock will not suffer, and even suffer death, as a result of being deprived of something so elementarily necessary as drinking water. I want to ask the Minister another question. I am sure that there must be a simple answer, because otherwise it staggers the imagination. This much maligned Johannesburg Municipality. when it heard of the plight of these animals, that they were dying of thirst and heat, offered the help of its fire fighting department, the Johannesburg Fire Brigade, to take water to these animals and to spray the trucks to provide the animals with some moisture. That, I am told authoritatively, was refused. I cannot understand, Sir. I am sure that there must be some explanation and, by heaven, the Minister will need a very good explanation for the refusal of this offer. I notice that other people concerned with the conveyance of livestock have indicated that the trucks used for this purpose to-day are obsolete and old-fashioned. They say that there is a considerable bruising of animals, that it is difficult to feed and water them. Suggestions have been made to change the construction of these trucks by introducing removable lattices in the side so that troughs of water can be attached to them at stations. I do hope that, as a result of this unfortunate experience near Johannesburg, something will be done. This is not the first time that this has happened. I hope that the hon. the Minister will tell us that he has asked his Planning Department or his Technical Engineering Department, or whoever is concerned with the design of these trucks to go into the possibility of changing the construction of trucks used for the conveyance of animals.</p>

<p>There are a great many other matters we shall discuss with the hon. the Minister, but I hope that when he replies he will give his attention to this matter. As always, he can <span class="col_653-654" refersTo="page_0339"/>sneer at us and try to belittle us. He can insult us.</p>

I hope that the emergence of the reconstituted Nationalist Party is not going to frighten the Minister from doing something which is necessary for the South African Railways and Harbours, namely to accept the fact that his labour pattern will have to change, that he will have to employ more non-Whites in positions formerly occupied by Whites, and that he should give his white employees the opportunity of accepting more responsible and more remunerative work as a result of this changing labour pattern. I am nervous, Sir, of the phobia that the Government has developed in regard to the reconstituted Nationalist Party.

I want to say that I hope the hon. the Minister will, in spite of political changes in South Africa, and in spite of new dangers from the right, persist in following the wise policies and the good advice he has been accepting from the United Party, and that he will continue to accept them, to negotiate with the staff associations in order to bring about a more efficient pattern of labour use and labour deployment in the South African Railways and Harbours.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat undoubtedly has the ability to elevate the commonplace to the profoundest wisdom and, in addition, to flatter himself with great self-satisfaction and make himself believe that he is impressing people. It is in fact a form of presentation which is more suited to the stage of a theatre. One cannot omit to express ones regret at the fact that this hon. member who has a very good delivery and a fine oratorical talent does not confirm his facts before he comes to this House. I do not know whether one should lay this charge at his door or at the door of his party which does not give him enough time to consider, prepare and state his arguments properly. In pursuance of a few introductory remarks he made here I want to explain what I mean. The hon. member stated amongst other things that more officials were leaving the Railways each year than were being recruited. This is an unconsidered statement and devoid of all truth. This hon. member must be afforded an opportunity of considering these matters in all responsibility and he must get away from the tendency to blow up an innocent little balloon into a monster with big ears and great fangs and then stand behind it, shouting spitefully: &#x201C;Busch court&#x201D;, annoyance among officials, etc. Surely these are merely stories to frighten children with late at night. They are not appropriated to this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schoeman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall mention many figures in this connection in a moment. Between 1959 and 1969 the white staff of the Railways has increased from 113,000 to 115,000. This shows a continually rising trend. How can this be possible if the number of those leaving the service is greater than the number of recruits? Surely that is childish nonsense.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What about the past two years?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schoeman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In the past two years the staff of the Railways has increased from 113,000 to 115,000. This figure decreased in one year, i.e. between 1966 and 1967, but this was over a period often years. This is nonsense therefore which does not belong here. I am going further in regard to the statement which was made about the inaccurate Estimates. We replied in detail, I did so personally, to this last year and the year before and pointed out that according to scientific methods the Estimates of the Railways could be regarded as 100 per cent estimates because the deviation in the various departments was seldom more than 4 per cent. It usually varies between 3 and 4 per cent. People from outside who are acquainted with these practices confirm this. These are 100 per cent estimates, but the matter which was not stated is the envy and the jealousy that profits are being shown, globally speaking. This may simply not be mentioned, for it is not to the benefit of <span class="col_655-656" refersTo="page_0340"/>the Opposition. This may simply not happen, because it can bring benefits to the officials. This may simply not happen, because it can be progressively utilized for better services in the Railways. But that they do not say. These people are canvassing for votes from an intelligent staff of a very large Department. What do they say to these officials whom they are courting? &#x201C;You cannot manage your own affairs. You hold &#x2018;bush courts&#x2019;. There is annoyance and injustice as regards your discipline and your administration.&#x201D; This is stated emphatically in so many words. It appears on page 26 of this yellow pamphlet. I find it incomprehensible and tragic that an Opposition in this country and in this House can make itself guilty of such practices.</p>

<p>But I have an explanation for this. It is born out of panic. In his few introductory words the hon. member for Yeoville made it very clear in this House to the Minister that he accepted that there are certain matters for which they would still have to wait 40 to 60 years. The leadership of the Opposition Party in South Africa is giving judgment on itself. He is in a political prison for 40 to 60 years. He has no hope that he will attain the objectives for which he stands and which he advocates. What does that mean in practice? A life sentence! They who have drawn up this charge sheet, are already the accused and are suggesting to the electors&#x2019; court of South Africa: &#x201C;You will have the right to sentence us to 40 to 60 years.&#x201D; I only hope that after my plea the electorate, and particularly the railway officials will pass sentence of 60 years, but suspend the last 20 as a result of mitigating circumstances, lack of time, seriousness and thoroughness on the part of that party. When all is said and done it remains, in effect, lifelong imprisonment. Sir, just imagine an Opposition who utter idealistic slogans here like: &#x201C;Free competition! Abolish the monopoly of the Railways!&#x201D; And who cannot even compete! They do not want to compete. They accept that they have been eliminated, that they find themselves in political imprisonment and will remain there for the next 50 years.</p>

<p>We must not make blind and disconnected statements. Let us make a practical analysis of the few matters the hon. member for Yeoville put forward here, with particular reference to their notorious policy pamphlet&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Staff: Thousands of workers on the Railways are being paid less than R100 per month. No wonder employees do not feel attracted to the service.</block>

<p>What are the true facts? This is a rash statement, the implications of which are lost to sight. This is the shouting behind the balloon with ears like a rabbit. &#x201C;Watch out for a bush court, sin, scandal and hardship!&#x201D; Of a total of 115,000 white employees on the Railways there are only 12,000 who earn less than R100 per month. To this last group belong the labourers, trainees, apprentices, waitresses in restaurants, and so on. These are workers who participate in medical funds benefits, free holiday journeys, as well as other facilities, which, annually, are worth many rands to these workers if one were to express it in terms of money. To this must still be added a very important fact. The apprentices and the trainees comprise 6,813 of this total of 12,552. These are not people who work for the Railways, but are people who are receiving free training. In other words, more than half of these people. Expressed as a percentage it means that a mere 4 per cent of the total number of workers are earning less than R100 per month. In all fairness hon. members opposite must compare this with industries in Johannesburg. They will then find that in this connection the Railways are setting a very praiseworthy example. Only four out of every 100 of the Railways white employees are low wage earners. In certain industries this ratio is two to one in favour of non-Whites. Why then this illogical and groundless statement? What do hon. members on the opposite side mean by making a statement like that? Is it fair that this statement should be left unanswered and that these assertions should be bruited abroad unanswered? I think it indicates a total underestimation of, if not an insult to, the intelligence of railway employees. Such statements are without doubt cheap and in bad taste.</p>

<p>People who have during the past ten years received R147 million in salaries and wage concessions, as well as considerable improvements to pension benefits, will definitely not allow themselves to be misled or impressed by such sophistry. A staff that received more than R200 million in housing benefits, i.e. 51,000 houses under this Government, has already developed too much selfrespect and built up too much confidence to offer themselves at a United Party vote auction. These persons have already built up enough immunity not to fall for this welfare call from the Opposition. The hon. member was quite right yesterday. I admit that he was quite right in saying that there was no hope for them in their lifetime. I also want to mention a few reasons, seen from the point of view of the staff, in support of this. Mention was made here of meetings which were attended by more than 800 discontented officials. I know of meetings which were well attended by officials out of honest interest. They attend these meetings in their own interests and in order to make positive contributions. They do not do so in order to break down and spread poison, but in order to do something constructive. It is usually meetings such as these that can be easily handled by the head of this Department, the hon. the Minister, and that is the reason why one hears nothing more about it afterwards.</p>

<p>They say there is annoyance and unrest among the officials on the railway staff. They say the situation is disturbing. In the <i>Volksblad</i> of 6th March, 1958 the following report appeared on the meeting of the Pensioners As <span class="col_657-658" refersTo="page_0341"/>sociation in Cape Town last year (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The chairman of the Association, Mr. A. S. Manchip, said in a statement to S.A.P.A. that all railway workers and widows of former railway employees welcomed the relief which had been announced in the Budget.</block>

<p>It does not seem to me as if this man has a grievance. Nor, apparently, are his members aggrieved, because he speaks on their behalf. The report goes on to state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. R. H. Raine, executive Officer in Bloemfontein of the Railways Association of Artisan Staff said that it was more than he had expected. The concessions were a major step forward and present pensioners in particular could be pleased about it.</block>

<p>This is not a staff which suffers from the disease of discontent. We can carry on mentioning examples in this way. The <i>Cape Argus</i> is the United Party&#x2019;s own mouthpiece. It is not our mouthpiece. In this newspaper we read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A reassuring sign that the Minister of Transport&#x2019;s annual Budget, like most of his trains, runs smoothly, safely and with yawning regularity. Mr. Schoeman is to be congratulated too for being a good administrator. He has streamlined his organization to a point where more work is being done by fewer men.</block>

<p>That is the reply he was waiting for. This reply was furnished by his own mouthpiece. He said the hon. the Minister should come and explain here what he had done to combat the shortage of staff and to compensate as far as his administration was concerned. Here the <i>Argus</i> gave him that answer a few years ago. To-day he comes along and asks the hon. the Minister for a reply to that. Can one imagine anything more pathetic before an election than that an opposition party should kick up a fuss in such a way and expose itself to ridicule in such a manner? For after all, this is old news. I can mention other examples, but I do not want to take up the time of the House with them.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few other matters to which I should like to draw the closer attention of railway officials, arising out of what we have heard here this afternoon and which we shall still hear. In the pamphlet mention is made of the Railways which will be managed by well-paid staff. They will be paid in accordance with the responsibility of their work after the work has been evaluated by experts. Please note: These people cannot even say what they want to say. Or they do not know what they want to say. They can decide for themselves which is true. I proceed. &#x201C;The Railways managed by well-paid staff &#x2026;&#x201D; Who manages the Railways? Its chief manager or deputy managers? Or is it its labourers and ordinary employees? Whom are they courting here? The Management or the ordinary labourers? And who must undertake the valuation. Must a man like the hon. member for Yeoville undertake this valuation, a man who does not even know what he wants to say, or cannot even say what he wants to say? The hon. member for Hillbrow tried to explain here with a great fanfare and very seriously that they advocated that the labour market be thrown open to the Bantu and the non-Whites, for the financial benefit of all financial and economic institutions in South Africa. In the last sentence of his speech to-day the hon. member for Yeoville said that we should change the pattern of employment and the pattern of manpower in South Africa. Is that perhaps the reason why they are exerting such strong pressure on the dissatisfaction of the officialdom of the Railways and are talking about a crisis which has arisen in this country? Is that the reason why they want to have the colour bar abolished? Why are they not man enough to state it frankly and say: We have too little white labour. Let us throw open the doors. This was also put to you two years ago. But now the railway official is expected to fall for these sugar-coated pills, the arguments, illogical and contradictory. They expect them to fall for it. No, that will not happen. The railway official will see to that on 22nd April. To capitalize on, under the guidance of the Opposition party in South Africa, cheap labour at the expense of the Whites, this will definitely not be allowed to happen. It was also said that the disciplinary system on the Railways would have to be revised &#x201C;in order to eliminate injustice and annoyance&#x201D;. What does this mean by implication? The regional committee and the disciplinary appeal board on which officials of the Railways itself sit. take pleasure, according to the United Party, in causing their own colleagues annoyance and doing them an injustice. This injustce and this annoyance must be rectified, so it is said, by amending the disciplinary system. You who are sitting there now, officials of the Railways, you have so little conscience that you are causing your colleagues annoyance and doing them an injustice. You, chairman of the disciplinary appeal bord. and ex-magistrate, you are unethical towards your own profession. You are doing other people an injustice and you are causing them annoyance. That is what these people are alleging, and then display the na&#x00EF;vity of coming to ask these officials for their vote. Yes, this is being done on this day of our Lord, 10th February, 1970. First insult him and then ask him please to vote for you. They do not yet know whether this comprises the Railway Management or whether this comprises the labourers, but they are asking them please to vote for them. One can be very dejected and perplexed in this life, but you can at least try to be decent. You will then still be able to approach a situation in a dignified manner.</p>

<p>It is also being said here that no worker on the Railways will be punished for alleged offences once an independent court of law had <span class="col_659-660" refersTo="page_0342"/>found him not guilty. And what does that mean? I say. there is water! A train driver is charged with manslaughter in an ordinary court and is found not guilty on some or other technical point. That often happens. In the meantime it has been established that the speed that train driver was maintaining was too great or that he did not obey his signals. The result was that lives were lost and government property damaged. But, no, he is not guilty. He may not be tried again. The impression is being created here that he is being tried again. He is not being tried again on the same charge. He is being tried on the grounds of his own disciplinary regulations which are a condition of service of that official. What do you think of the intelligence of the railway official, esteemed valuator of Yeoville? What do the hon. members think of this hon. member if he makes such assertions and such rash statements? We must make an appeal to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to give this hon. member more time to do his homework. This was nothing more than a disciplinary step in terms of the Railway&#x2019;s own domestic arrangement, as consolidated and stated in the disciplinary regulations of the Railways. Must these now be abolished? Do the hon. members know what this valuator is doing and saying? He is buying votes at the expense of lives and the safety of government property. He says that they will abolish this system. They are prepared to make these sacrifices as long as they can get the votes of these workers. Really, this exceeds all boundaries of dignity and political decency.</p>

<p>He also said that an immediate inquiry would be instituted into the possibility of converting the Railways pension system to a noncontributory pension scheme. We have heard this before. It is a carrot as old and shrivelled as the United Party itself. I am calling upon the evidence of the hon. member for Kensington on this subject. This radish is just as old and as shrivelled as the United Party itself. In addition it is not even a radish, but a totally imaginary fiction. Hon. members can imagine for themselves what would happen if such a scheme were to be introduced for 100,000 or 200,0 officials. This could easily be done in the private sector, for with a small increase in the profit margin or a small increase in the turnover it would easily be possible to compensate for such an additional expenditure. However. to apply it to 100,000 or even 200,000 officials whose personal contributions to the pension fund total R19 million, is merely a fiction. It forms no part of the practical world. It belongs only with those who want to convert this State into a welfare organization and who want to injure the sense of honour of the Railway officials. Only in such a person can such a daydream be found. Where must that money come from? Must it come from the Treasury? Must it be recovered from increased tariffs or must it be recovered from the private sector? Who must pay for it? We heard a moment ago that it was unfair and unreasonable that the little group in Johannesburg should subsidize the rest of the country. They are supposedly paying such high income tax, and yet they must pay a lower price for petrol. That could only be United Party logic. The farmer in Lichtenburg and the bank clerk in Ladybrand must, I suppose, subsidize that lot there in Johannesburg, for, after all, it makes no difference. He may as well pay a little more because he received his petrol by rail.</p>

<p>At least I am glad I have progressed so far as to make this hon. member realize that he was talking nonsense. What would the reaction of the officials who have for many years already been contributing to such a pension scheme be if they suddenly had to share equally with new recruits who had not contributed a cent to their pension scheme? Would this not cause annoyance among the railway officials? Would it not be an injustice? Take the officials who play a part in the administration of this pension scheme of theirs on which they are represented; if such a voluntary scheme were to be introduced, their presence there would become unnecessary &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. member for Yeoville that if disaster should ever strike us and they should once again take over the government of his country and we should once again find ourselves in a position similar to the one we were in in 1948, when the Treasury was so bankrupt that the Railways could not perform its normal function, and this pension fund should peter out after 30 or 40 years, what chaos and what a fiasco would that not cause? Do you want to link the future of the railway official to this? Sir. it is not necessary for me to reply on his behalf.</p>

<p>We also heard here about the monopolistic policy of the Administration which should be abolished. What is meant by this? Sir, the private conveyancer must convey high tariff goods at the expense of the railway user, the inevitable result being increased tariffs, and in the meantime I hear it at the top of their voices, from among their ranks: &#x201C;We object to the transportation of motor cars per road on these multidecker trucks at railway tariffs; they ought to do it at a cheaper rate.&#x201D; Do you see the logic; do you see how these people contradict themselves?

He cannot believe the United Party; he cannot trust the United Party. The railwayman is also afraid of something else, i.e. that if the United Party were to come into power he would not be so certain of his job. He is afraid that cheaper labour will perhaps be used to take over his work. Sir, we have the same position in respect of the farmers, about whose interests we had a dreadful lot of agitation here from that side of the House.

<p>The hon. member elaborated further about the large number of resignations from the Railways. I know that resignations are taking place in the Railways, but I receive hundreds of letters from people who have resigned and who subsequently write to me, saying: &#x201C;Sir, I have now discovered that I made a mistake. Could you not please try to get my work back for me? Please write to the General Manager or to the Minister or to the System Manager. I am just a railwayman, nothing more.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member for Yeoville referred to what happened at the Johannesburg Abattoir. Sir, we all regret very much what happened there. We are very sorry for the animals that died there of hunger and thirst; we are very sorry because it is cruel. But who is responsible? Is this House the right place to raise the matter in to-day? At Colesberg, Noupoort or De Aar I load my cattle or sheep onto the trucks of the S.A. Railways and I make out my consignment note to Newtown, Johannesburg, and it is the Railways&#x2019; responsibility to get the consignment to Newtown. In the meantime, as the hon. member said to-day, there are places for off-loading the animals in order to give them fodder and water. I take it they drink water and I also take it they do not eat fodder, because an animal that comes from the veld will not eat fodder. You cannot blame the Railways for that; they give the fodder which they have at their disposal. I think it is very wrong to blame the Railways for the death of those animals.</p>

<p>That is once more a municipal matter, but I am coming to it now. Do you know how bad the slaughtering facilities there are? It is causing a meat shortage in Johannesburg, in spite of the fact that there are thousands of animals waiting that cannot be off-loaded, firstly because they cannot be slaughtered. Do you know what happens then? Butchers in Port Elizabeth then buy up those slaughtered sheep on the market, transport them to Johannesburg in refrigerator trucks and sell them at 5 or 6 cents profit per pound. Johannesburg&#x2019;s Municipality is responsible for all these problems because it is a United Party municipality and they do not want to improve matters.</p>

<p>The South African Railways has a very big task to fulfil. In the past year, 1968-&#x2019;69, such high demands were made on the Railways in the transportation of livestock to better grazing areas and in the transportation of fodder to drought-stricken areas, etc. You may now ask any practising farmer sitting here to-day if he ever ordered a truck for the transportation of his livestock or fodder and did not get one. When loading sheep one &#x2019;phones one&#x2019;s stationmaster and within 24 hours one has a truck, and I say that this is an achievement for the S.A. Railways. All its required duties are fulfilled in the shortest possible time. But one needs planning for that, and planning is what that side of the House does not have. The Minister saw how the country was developing. He saw from experience what could happen as a result of droughts and floods, and he planned ahead. He saw how our country&#x2019;s economy is growing stronger and stronger, and he planned ahead, because the Railways must play a tremendously large role. He ensured that enough locomotives were ordered. This costs a great deal of money. There are 250 electric locomotives, 190 diesel locomotives and almost 600 passenger coaches. There are 196 suburban electric coaches and almost 11,000 goods trucks.</p>

<p>Then I also come to the road transport done by the Railways. One has many places that are not near a railway station. Take the road transport services, for example, between Norvalspont and Venterstad. There is regular road transport and there are never any complaints. To-day the people in Venterstad do not mind not having a train service. An hour or an hour and a quarter after the train has stopped at Norvalspont, their goods are at Venterstad. There are no problems involved.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about the housing of the officials. I have already said a few words about that and I want to repeat that at the time the United Party was in power the people lived in zinc shanties, but show me a zinc shanty to-day at large railway centres. Because one paid &#x00A3;3 for a zinc shanty at that time, one cannot expect to pay the same amount to-day for a decent house. Since the cost of living increased adjustments have been made for the railwaymen, and I shall read out a letter here to you in a moment. In those four years between 1963 and 1967 almost 14,000 houses were granted under the three schemes, the home ownership scheme, the ownership assistance scheme and the departmental housing scheme.</p>

<p>We continue. For 1969 alone 1,200 loans were granted and 450 departmental houses were built.</p>

<p>I now come to the staff. I have already said that there is a shortage. We all acknowledge this, but does the service as a whole suffer from this? Does the public suffer for it? I say no. With savings and with improved techniques the work is being done without the public having to suffer for it. The private sector took up many of the people, and the Railways cannot always compete with the private sector. A good man perhaps has his price. If they offer him a price he will perhaps leave the Railways. However, there are many of them who return after a while.</p>

<p>I have already dealt with the question of overtime. I now come to wages and salaries. I do not want to claim to-day that the South African railwayman is paid enough, but I do, in fact, say that now, under this Minister, he is very much better off than he was in the days when the old United Party was in power. Sir, I saw them then. To-day, when one attends any large railway function one notices that most of the people there possess motor cars. Earlier they had to walk wherever they wanted to go. Or they rode an ordinary bicycle. Just look at how many motor cars there are at any of our large depots. Just go to their houses and look at how these are furnished. They need not be in the least ashamed of inviting Mr. Schoeman into their homes. Those homes are well furnished. Under this Minister those people reached a standard of living which they would never have reached under the United Party.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned this point, but I want to repeat it. Since 1948 wages have increased by more than 100 per cent. It is an achievement that in the past 22 years the Government has succeeded in increasing those wages by more than 100 per cent. Hon. members who are still to get up will say: &#x201C;Yes, but what is money worth?&#x201D; but I say again that they should go and look at those houses. Go and look at those people&#x2019;s radiograms, their <span class="col_667-668" refersTo="page_0346"/>refrigerators, etc., which they could never afford before. For the following figures I am now including all railway personnel. In 1961 the average wage was R1,674 per year. In 1963 it was R1,899, in 1965 it was R2,180, in 1967 it was R2,517 and in 1968 it was R2,586. What did the Minister do in 1968? He had a surplus of R44 million. He did not go and play with that. He said: I am going to give this to my people. You take that R44 million for yourselves. What did he do at the end of last year? Every man received his vacation bonus. R12 million was paid out for that purpose. Mr. Schoeman does not need the money. He is thrifty, but if the money is there he gives it to his people.</p>

<p>I now want to mention a round figure. Since 1948 the wage improvements have totalled more than R200 million. Let us compare the wages with those paid under the United Party. The hon. member for Randburg has already dealt with the question of pensions, and I shall not go into it any further. I have already said that the cost of living has indeed increased, but adjustments were made from time to time.</p>

<p>In spite of the staff shortage goods traffic has recently increased by more than 125 per cent. Revenue goods have increased by almost 250 per cent. The number of passengers have increased by 102 per cent and goods handled at our various harbours by 271 per cent. Planning was needed for that. One cannot handle so many goods if one has not planned for it in advance. The Minister saw what was going to happen and made the necessary preparations. That is why large amounts were spent for this. For example, from 1948 to 1969, R2.477 million was spent. If he had not done so we would have had congestion. Fortunately, with a look into the future the Minister saw what was going to happen in the country and subsequently made provision for it. The same applies to electrification and dieselization. In 1948 our tractive power was 4,500,000 tons. What is it to-day? Today it is 33,800,000 tons. So much has it improved. I have a short letter here in front of me. I do not readily quote letters in the House like a certain hon. member on the other side loves to do. This letter is from a Mrs. Wakefield. She lives in Durban and the hon. member for Durban (Point) who is sitting there may as well listen carefully to this now. The letter reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hereby want to inform you of how proud I feel of the South African Railways and also of the salaries our people earn if they want to work. I am constantly reading of people who are dissatisfied with the wages. Well, they ought to be ashamed of themselves, because when the wages are increased the cost of living also goes up.</block>

<p>This is a sensible woman.</p>

<p>I have a husband who is ticket inspector, a married son who must write his engine driver&#x2019;s exam in a few years time, and an other son who is a fitter. Well, they all work long, hard hours, but their wages are good. Before my sons began working my husband&#x2019;s salary kept us well provided for. All four children were then still at school as well. We lived well, we have good furniture and in the meantime we have also bought a new motor car. ft is just so hot in Durban that we would like to see our poor husbands getting lighter uniforms.</p>

<p>That is a request to the Minister, It is a matter which the hon. the Minister could perhaps consider at a later stage. I want to conclude with a special word of thanks to-day to the hon. the Minister of Transport, to the General Manager and his staff and to all Railway officials throughout the country for the fine service they give to the Republic of South Africa. They deserve the thanks which, after to-day, will stand recorded here in Hansard.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, being the good Whip that he is, the hon. member for Colesberg tried to come to the rescue of the hon. the Minister. But I think that in doing so he has not really made the task of the Minister any easier because all he has done is to put across a number of percentages and other figures which really mean very little when they are tossed across the floor of the House. My colleague the hon. member for Yeoville put a number of pertinent questions to the hon. the Minister and he made some constructive suggestions. The hon. member for Colesberg, quite rightly I suppose, did not attempt to reply to those suggestions and we shall wait with interest to hear what the hon. the Minister has to say.</p>

<p>I rise this afternoon to deal with one particular matter to which the hon. member for Yeoville made brief reference, namely the question of level crossings. The recent tragedy in the Transvaal has of course shocked all of us and it has I hope again quickened the conscience of the whole country, I think that all of us should hang our heads in shame at the thought that such accidents can still happen, I can look back to 40 years ago when the question of level crossings was debated in this House. A commission reported in 1927 on the question of level crossings, It made certain recommendations and stressed the urgency of the matter even in those days. It also made certain recommendations as to who should bear the cost involved. Three years later, in 1930, a private member&#x2019;s motion was introduced by a Mr. Roper, the then member for Wynberg, who afterwards became a distinguished judge, calling on the Government to implement that commission&#x2019;s report. The motion was seconded by the then member for South Peninsula. Modesty forbids me to mention his name, but he made quite a good speech. There was general agreement on both sides of the House about the urgency of the matter. But there was disagreement between the Railway Administration and certain authorities as to who was going to pay for it. I <span class="col_669-670" refersTo="page_0347"/>remember we argued that the question of who was going to bear the cost was surely a secondary matter, because in any case it would be the taxpayer who would pay, either through the Central Government, the Provincial Administration or the local government. But that was a stumbling block in those days to reach an agreement and get the thing moving. However, a permanent committee was appointed to deal with the question of recommending and advising how these level crossings could best be protected. Much, of course, has been done since then. But, Sir, 40 years is a long time. There still does not seem to be any agreement as to how many crossings should be attended to. At any rate, there are between 3,000 and 4,0 level crossings still in the country. Very many of them are either unprotected or inadequately protected. These distressing accidents&#x2014;they are worse than distressing&#x2014;continue to occur with the most horrid regularity. I understand they occur at the rate of very near to three a month. I shall later quote the exact figure which I was given. Figures have been published by various authorities recently. I do not want to go into too many of them, but I think one must mention some just to illustrate the urgency of the matter and to have it on record. Since 1927-&#x2019;28, when that committee was first established, some 752 crossings have been eliminated and 276 protected. The hon. the Minister passed fresh legislation in 1960. A new committee was formed whose function it was to administer the fund which was established then for the elimination of crossings. This committee, as I understand, has up to date listed about 380 out of these 3,0 to 4,000 existing crossings to be eliminated. They have dealt with 127 of them in the last 10 years. They have 31 of them in hand at the moment. They still have 230 on their list to be dealt with. I leave it to you, Mr. Speaker, to do a little mental arithmetic and see how many are still left for this committee to tackle before the matter can really be considered adequately dealt with. In the last 10 years, according to the Automobile Association, there have been 350 accidents on level crossings. That is very nearly three a month. In the eight years from 1960 to 1968, 664 people were killed and over 1,000 injured. There does seem to be a serious gap in the machinery. The committee that was appointed in 1927 had the specific task of making recommendations for protecting level crossings that could not be eliminated. I think it is here where the gap occurred. Elimination is one thing that is not proceeding as fast as we would like to see it and probably not as fast as the hon. the Minister would like to see it. Another aspect is the protection of level crossings, which I think is more urgent than the elimination of level crossings, because there are far more of them. It will still be many years before even the more important level crossings will be eliminated. According to the Automobile Association only some 250 level crossings have been made safer by the erection of warning devices during the last 40 years. They say that in 1967-&#x2019;68 20 level crossings were eliminated, but in that year only five level crossings were protected by means of flashing lights. This is where I think the gap comes in. The 1927 committee was empowered to advise on the best methods of protection for level crossings which could not be eliminated, but the 1960 committee&#x2014;if I understand correctly&#x2014;was established solely to handle the fund which was then created to finance the approved elimination of level crossings. The responsibility for dealing with the protection of level crossings was taken away from it and, as far as I know, it has not been assigned to any other particular body. Whilst the Administration is naturally concerned with the matter, it would appear that there is no particular body or committee charged with the urgent matter of creating protection for these level crossings. As I have said, 40 years is quite a long time. This I know to my cost. The Nationalist Government has been in power for well over half of that time and the hon. the Minister has been in charge of his portfolio for some 15 years. It is quite clear that the Nationalist Government and the hon. the Minister must accept a large measure of responsibility for the position as it exists to-day. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister, just as I appealed to a previous hon. Minister of Railways, the late Mr. Charlie Malan, 40 years ago. to make an all-out effort to tackle this problem effectively, first of all by speeding up the elimination of level crossings. I understand that the money that has been voted and is being voted is not all being spent, so it is therefore not a question of finance these days. Secondly, machinery should be created, even further machinery if necessary, to make the fullest and speediest use of the many protective devices which are in use here in this country and in other countries as well. I do not want to take up the time of the House by listing these devices, because I have no doubt that they are even better known to the hon. the Minister than to myself. A great deal can be done, if this matter is tackled energetically, to protect level crossings apart from eliminating them. About this I also do not have the slightest doubt.</p>

<p>The whole country has been shocked by this recent dreadful accident in the Transvaal. which has brought to a head this continuing stream of accidents at level crossings. One does not for a moment suggest that the officials of the Railways are solely responsible for these accidents. There is no doubt that many of them are due to the carelessness of the road-users themselves. However, that does not alter the fact that quite literally hundreds of people will lose their lives during the next 10 years. Many hundreds more will be seriously and possibly fatally injured on these level crossings. It is our duty to see, as far as possible, that that menace is removed. We know that the hon. the Minister of Transport would have all the members of this House supporting him and I am sure the support of the whole country, if only he would undertake and give the lead in a campaign to eliminate <span class="col_671-672" refersTo="page_0348"/>as far as humanly possible these crossings and to eliminate this continuing threat to the safety and the lives of what is a steadily increasing section of our people. Year after year the number of people using the roads is increasing. The number of cars, the number of lorries, the amount of heavy traffic is increasing. It is becoming more and more important, I think, that steps should be taken to protect these crossings as quickly as possible, and in the most efficient way possible. I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister could get all the money he wants to carry out such a campaign.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Constantia devoted his entire speech to the question of the accident which took place near Vereeniging.

<p>But why then did the hon. member for Constantia&#x2019;s whole speech deal with this? We are not unfeeling towards these people. The hon. member for Yeoville blamed the hon. the Minister for not sympathizing with those people in his speech. But surely the hon. the Minister did so on the day the accident took place. Why is he now being blamed for that? I just want to put a question to those hon. members. We are aware of this task that awaits us. And we are busy eliminating these railway crossings. However, the United Party was chiefly responsible for their creation. To-day, under this hon. Minister no more roads are being built without bridges being constructed at railway crossings. Under this party such things do not exist. We did not create these problems. They are problems we inherited chiefly from the United Party. Now I want to ask those hon. members what they did, during all the years of their administration, to solve this problem? The hon. member for Constantia was himself Minister of Railways. Let him tell us to-day what was done in his day. He did not spend a cent to eliminate one single railway crossing. Now that hon. member has the audacity to deliver a sermon to the present hon. Minister of Transport. There sits the hon. member for Constantia: he is old and decrepid and has now sung his swan-song. As I have said, that hon. member was himself Minister of Railwavs, but can he get up in this House now and mention one single instance, during his term of Office, where a railway crossing was eliminated. It is surely not fitting for them to point a finger at us now. Surely it is their problem that we are saddled with now. We spend R3 million each year on the systematic solution of this problem. However, I want to leave the matter there. The hon. the Deputy Minister will, in fact, give a full reply to this matter which is now obviously being exploited against the National Party.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is why I can say it.</p>

<p>Of course, as was clearly indicated during this debate, the United Party will make every possible effort to impress the railway personnel, because there is an election in the offing. The Railways have a large staff. There are about 115,000 Whites in the service of the Railways with a right to vote. Therefore I do not blame hon. members on that side of the House for putting their best foot forward now in order to win the favour of the railway officials and in order to try and make a good impression on them. But things have now gone a little awry for the hon. members of the Opposition. This is not the first Railway debate being conducted here. There was also one last year. Last year the United Party was blissfully under the impression that the general election would take place in 1971. Then hon. members&#x2019; strategy in respect of their Railway debates caused them to be caught very much on the wrong foot now. They did not think the election was just around the corner. Last year, under the pretext of a manpower shortage, they made a deliberate attempt to accuse the Minister of neglecting to employ non-Whites to replace Whites on the Railways. The lead was taken by the hon. member for Salt River who is now sitting and looking at me like a Father Christmas. Politically speaking that hon. member has never been further than the Salt River bridge. Last year the United Party made an attack here on the Minister under the pretext of a tremendous manpower shortage, the whole purpose of which was to get it across to the Minister and to persuade him to employ non-Whites in positions which were previously occupied by Whites. [Interjections.] Yes, now they will whine, but they think we have short memories. They cannot expect the railway people to have forgotten it already at this stage. The railwayman surely knows that the United Party has never shown any respect for that traditional principle which is maintained in the Railways, i.e. that certain work is done only by Whites. They have never respected that principle and time and again they have intimated as much. The railwayman knows that that old Jagger disposition is still prevalent in the United Party. It remains true to itself. It is an integration party. With this record, how do hon. members on that side expect to be able to appeal to the railwayman for his vote? I also want to tell the hon. members on the opposite side of the House why their efforts are still going to fail. The railway people remember that a few years ago the Opposition wanted to raid the Railway <span class="col_673-674" refersTo="page_0349"/>Rates Fund. When salary increases were announced to the staff and tariffs had to be increased with a view to defraying these, those hon. members said that we should rather make use of and deplete the railwayman&#x2019;s guarantee fund. They said that that money should be taken to make good the losses and that the salaries should be defrayed from there. This would be done to the benefit of commerce and industry. The railway people will not easily forget this.</p>

<p>There are also other things they will remember. The railwayman will not forget that, in the sixties, the Opposition was behind the agitation for the closing down of railway workshops and their transfer to the private sector. During those years the Opposition consistently took part in agitation to persuade the Minister to close down the Railway Workshops and to transfer them to the private sector. The argument was that the Railways or the State should not compete with the private sector. If the Minister had accepted and implemented the recommendations of the Van Zyl Commission what would have happened to the hundreds and thousands of artisans on the Railways who would have been without work? These things will not be forgotten so easily by the railwaymen. That was what the hon. member for Salt River wanted. What would have happened? He would have been without a constituency. Neither will the railwaymen forget how hon. members opposite were continually undermining the trade unions. They will not forget how the hon. member for Durban (Point) made a blatant attack on the trade unions here last year when he accused them of disregarding the complaints of their members. He accused the trade unions of neglecting to convey the complaints of members to the management and the Administration.</p>

<p>It is easy for the hon. member to say that I am distorting his words, but he knows what he said. The hon. member came here and made an attack on the trade unions with the intention of undermining their authority. Why? Because there are responsible leaders in the trade unions who do not want to play ball politically with the hon. member for Durban (Point). The hon. member for Durban (Point) must not speak now. The hon. member for Durban (Point), who is now courting railway votes to such an extent, is a member who insults the railwaymen at every opportunity. He referred in a humiliating way to the railwayman with his &#x201C;railway mentality&#x201D;. That is now the hon. member who believes he can obtain the railwayman&#x2019;s vote. I believe in the railwayman&#x2019;s sound judgment and I believe that all this courting by the United Party in this debate will bear no fruit. There are other reasons why the railway personnel will not let themselves be enticed by the stories and the sloppy promises which are now being made from the opposite side of the House. With their criticism through the years the hon. members have systematically been trying to discredit the major employer in this country, i.e. the Railways. Where would the railwayman have ended up if his employer had landed in difficulties? For example, in season and out of season they objected to the unlawful protection the Railways enjoyed under the Motor Carrier Transportation Act of 1930. At every opportunity they pleaded for the repeal of that Act. They wanted the protection to be taken away. They pleaded for greater freedom to use the private sector for their transportation. They said that fewer, or even no, restrictions should be placed on new forms of transportation, even though this would also mean that large amounts of capital, which were put into the Railways, would have to be written off. This was the attitude of those hon. members. They said that the Railways should go in for the transportation of mass freight, such as ore and coal. Coal already constitutes 30 per cent and ore 10 per cent of the Railways&#x2019; goods freight. They pleaded that the Railways should renounce its small amount of high rate traffic to the private cartage contractor. How did they then want to balance the Railways&#x2019; books? The hon. member for Yeoville said that he did not understand why the Railways&#x2019; books could not balance. But if the management of the Railways were to be left to him, the Railways&#x2019; books would never ever balance, because only 17 per cent of the freight transported by the Railways is high rate transportation, and this provides more than 50 per cent of the Railways&#x2019; revenue. The hon. member is prepared to give a large portion of this 17 per cent, the high rate traffic, to the road transport contractors. Once he has separated the Railways from the Airways and Harbours, how does he see his way clear to balancing the Railways&#x2019; books, as is expected under the South Africa Act? Sir, over the years hon. members opposite have consistently tried to discredit the Railways by their criticism. They also did so in other ways and they are still doing so today. According to this United Party booklet which they published, from which the hon. member for Yeoville read the text of his sermon to-day, it is United Party policy&#x2014;and this was also pleaded for here repeatedly through the years&#x2014;to separate the Railways, the Airways and Harbours, i.e. a breakdown of the Railways, of the National Transport Service. If this happens, how must the Railways carry out its national task. In this memorandum of the Minister various reasons are mentioned why this cannot happen, why it would not be in the interests of the country to do so. The hon. member for Yeoville may read this memorandum himself if he has the time. I just want to point out that the chairman of the commission said that this was contrary to international trends. It is contrary to general business practice. The tendency is to bring large economic forces together to obtain the maximum benefit. But the hon. member <span class="col_675-676" refersTo="page_0350"/>wants to retrogress; he wants to go against the stream. He wants to fragment the Railways; that is his purpose and that is why he is doing it, and then he expects these people, who earn their bread and butter from this institution, to vote for him on 22nd April.</p>

<p>Sir. the hon. member for Yeovillle is pleading for the separation of the Airways, the Harbours and Pipelines from the Railways and for the independence of their accounts. I want to point out to him that according to the White Paper tabled here last year the Railways suffered a working loss of R15.7 million in the year 1965-&#x2019;66. The following year, 1966-&#x2019;67. it suffered a loss of R17.8 million. In those two years the end result was that the Railways showed a loss of R13.3 million and a surplus on its joint services of R1.5 million, respectively, because every year about R11 million to R12 million is spent on the appropriation account fund, which must still also come from the profits of the Railways. According to the accounts, what have the trends in recent years been? Last year there was a shortage of about R30 million on the Railway Account. It is expected that it will be about R40 million in the present financial year. Where does the hon. member want to get the money to supplement these shortages if he does not do so from the other services? How does he want the Railways&#x2019; books to balance? He has a free and easy philosophy He believes that one simply has to go to the Exchequer and say that the Government must pay from the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket. Sir, it is a very easy philosophy to shift the transportation burdens onto the ordinary taxpayer and to benefit the merchant, the industrialist and the mining magnate. That is the hon. member&#x2019;s objective, but we cannot be so irresponsible. Sir, the railwaymen will reject the United Party because of the political opportunism which has characterized their criticism of the Railway Estimate over the years.</p>

<p>In the short introduction to his speech here yesterday the hon. member for Yeoville said that the National Party Government had ignored the blueprints which lay ready and waiting in 1948, had filed them away and had failed to implement them. It is a simple matter for the hon. member to speak like that now. He surely knows what the position was. No matter how many blueprints there were, the Railways did not have the money to implement the plans: there were no funds available. Sir. you know that the financial position of the Railways was very strongly and very seriously criticized by the Controller and Auditor-General during the United Party administration. You know that the financial position of the Railways was far from being sound. How then were they to implement those blueprints which they had? It is all very well to have blueprints in a drawer, but what good are those plans if one does not have money with which to implement them? In the meantime they wasted money. For large sums of money they bought fantastic paintings of English hunting scenes, but on the other hand the rolling stock looked like poultry stands and rattle traps. That is how they handled the Railways, and then they expect us to do the same. They may have had the plans, but they did not have the money to implement them. They also had other things that they did not implement; they had apartheid notice boards made which lay here in Salt River, but they did not have the courage of their convictions to use them. What is the use of having the things and hiding them in one&#x2019;s drawer? Apart from that, supposing that, when the National Party Government came into power in 1948. it could have obtained the money from somewhere; it surely goes without saying &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir. I am speaking about the Railways. I think those hon. members had more time for England than for the Railways. Even if, in 1948. the National Administration could all of a sudden have injected a fantastic amount of money into the Railways, it would have taken years to extend the service so as to keep pace with the development of the country. That is why the Railways landed itself in a crisis in 1954, on the one hand because such tremendous economic development had taken place in the country under the National Party Government. and on the other hand because the Railways was so grossly neglected during the war and post-war years as a result of the mismanagement of the United Party Government.</p>

<p>Sir. when I arrived here as a newcomer in 1958-&#x2019;59, the Railways being engaged in a tremendous. constructive plan to inject millions of rand into the capital programme to extend the Railways and to enable it to carry out its task, I remember how the Opposition members referred scornfully to the Minister and said that they could positively predict that Minister Schoeman would never extricate the Railways from the shambles; how the leader of the railway group on the other side, Mr. Russel, said at the time (translation): &#x201C;This attempt on the part of the Minister is a panic measure; the Railways will not succeed; more money must be put into the Railways.&#x201D; That was their attitude.</p>

<p>Sir, at that time they went as far as to plead very seriously for the removal of the Railways from State control and its transfer to the management of a utility company. Can hon. members still remember that? They must not think we have forgotten it; they must not think the railwayman has forgotten it: they must not think the railwayman has forgotten that they had so little confidence in our national transport service that they wanted to sell out to the private sector. At that time they did not have the confidence in the Railways that they have to-day, now that we have brought it to its present level. At that time they referred scornfully <span class="col_677-678" refersTo="page_0351"/>to the efforts we made to extend the Railways so that it could carry out its task.</p>

<p>Sir, the United Party did not make allowances for the determination of the Minister of Transport and his staff to get this wagon up the hill. That objective was achieved in 1960 and since then, for ten years, there has never been a single occasion when the Railways and its related services have not been able to handle the traffic offered in South Africa. Give me an example of another period in our history when this has happened. For ten years the Railways has consistently transported all the traffic offered; it never fell behind. notwithstanding the fact that there was tremendous development in the economic sphere, that there were nation-wide droughts which affected the Railways, that there was inflation, that there was a rush of traffic to our harbours as a result of the closing of the Suez canal and that there was a manpower shortage. Notwithstanding this the Railways never failed in its task. I say that at that time they pointed to us with contempt and then something else happened. In 1961 and 1962 there was an economic recession in this country and the Railways had a surplus capacity, and what did the Opposition do then?</p>

<p>Sir, they veered round just like that; instead of encouraging the Minister to extend the Railways, they veered round and said the Minister was pumping too much capital into the Railways. Then they stood up here one by one and said that the Minister should stop pumping such a tremendous amount of capital into the Railways each year because he was loading the Railways with an impossible burden of interest: he was influencing the profitability of the Railways; he was harming the private sector by harming private road transport, and he was neglecting road transport. And now in recent times they have dropped those stories altogether, and the hon. member for Yeoville is singing an altogether different tune to-day. Sir, how can you expect the railwaymen to be satisfied with such an opportunistic Opposition and to place his trust in its members? That is surely not possible. We, and the railwaymen in South Africa, have never known where we stood with the Opposition.</p>

<p>They also discredited the Railways in other fields, and if we had followed their policy we would have done the country the greatest disservice possible, and I want to support this statement with reference to the Opposition&#x2019;s criticism of the railway tariff policy. Other members and I have previously said that railway transportation plays an extremely important role in the economic development of our country. In fact, it is the hub around which our development in South Africa takes place, this national transport system; and the tariff structure of the Railways is based on the simple principle that tariff charged is what the traffic can afford. And it is a flexible tariff; it is a tariff which has made it possible for the Railways to carry out uneconomical services in the national interest from time to time, and the loss is then, to a degree, compensated for by the more profitable freight transported. But constantly this has been violently attacked here by the Opposition. They said it was wrong that one load should pay for another; they demand that each freight tariff should consistently cover its costs. Their policy was that the costs of the service should be the tariff.</p>

<p>Sir, had the Minister accepted that each individual tariff should cover the transport costs per unit, what would the results have been? Then production costs and price levels in South Africa would have increased in every respect, because the railway tariffs have such an extremely important influence on the general cost structure. I therefore say that industrial development would have been restricted if the United Party had had its way with its criticism of the tariff policy of the Railways. Prices of manufactured goods would generally have been higher. Industrial development based on basic raw materials which had to be transported over great distances, would have been retarded. We in the Western Cape would have had to pay more for our coal while, for the transportation of our manufactured goods to the north, to our markets, we would also have had to pay more. This would have prejudiced the existence of many industries in the Western Cape. But that is what the hon. member for Salt River wants. In general it would have impeded industrial decentralization in this country.</p>

<p>The Railways has a national task to carry out and the United Party&#x2019;s attitude in the past was that it made no difference to them what happened. If the Railways must perform a service in the interests of the country, the Central Government must pay the piper and I said a moment ago that it was an easy philosophy calculated to transfer the transport burden and to off-load it onto the ordinary taxpayer. I say that the United Party&#x2019;s approach to the railway personnel will pay them no dividends. They know the United Party too well for that, and South Africa cannot afford to have the national transport system end up in the hands of those hon. members. It would be disastrous for South Africa. If they were to take over the railway system they would break it down and they would be doing South Africa a disservice.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I was quite obvious that the hon. member for Parow was making in this House this afternoon what possibly would be his swan song. I know the hon. member has been here for over 20 years. He has had a good innings. But I think he realized that it is time he sang his swan song, because the possibility exists that he will not come back here. Not only that he will not come back, but that hon. members now sitting on that side of the House will not be sitting there when we reconvene on 17th July. It was quite apparent from the way he went on, the way he harped on what happened in South Africa before the rinderpest in 1948, and the <span class="col_679-680" refersTo="page_0352"/>way he harped on what he assumed was the attitude of the United Party towards the Railways, that he is desperately afraid of the outcome of the election on 22nd April. He did not deal with matters which should have been dealt with under this particular Bill; he dealt merely with what he thought he could use as part of his election campaign between now and 22nd April.</p>

<p>This hon. member started off by taking us to task for raising the question of the elimination of level-crossings. He tried to point out how little was done before 1948, but I think we can forget about 1948. In fact, we can even forget about 1958. What has this Government done in 21 years? It has done a certain amount. I will grant the Minister and his Department credit for having taken certain steps to eliminate level-crossings, but can that hon. Minister and his Department in all clear conscience say that they have done all that they could have done? Is the Minister satisfied that no more could have been done in regard to the elimination of level-crossings? I do not want to make political capital out of it. This side of the House has not tried to make political capital out of it. This is the only question we have put to the hon. the Minister, and if indeed he is not satisfied we appeal to him to do more than he has done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow raised the question of the introdudction of non-white labour on the Railways, doing jobs which traditionally have been retained for white people. He accused us of being an integration party and of being the ones who want to take jobs away from the white workers. But this Minister has admitted in this House that he has introduced non-Whites into jobs which have always been retained for Whites on the Railways, and he has had the courage, which this hon. member did not have, to say that this was done in the interests of South Africa: and I say more power to his elbow. But that hon. member is still living in the Dark Ages before the rinderpest. Does he know how many hundreds of non-white platelayers, gangers, shunters, checkers, etc., are being used in the Railways today? So, it is no good his trying to hide behind this. This is a fact to-day, and the railway workers know it. I want to say that, although he tried to make capital out of this, and although he is going to use this for his election campaign, it is not going to work, because that Minister has been pragmatic enough to accept this principle, which we have been trying for 20 years to get him to accept. I believe that the railway worker will be behind him in accepting that principle to keep the Railways going.</p>

<p>The hon. member for De Aar is unfortunately not here, but I should like to mention a few points regarding staff matters. The hon. member for De Aar and others mentioned the question of staff conditions and salaries. The hon. member for De Aar read a letter from a housewife in Durban, the wife of a railway employee, saying that she was happy with the salary he and her son were earning. But she did not say how much of that salary was in respect of overtime worked. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he is aware of the fact that the trains working staff on the Natal main line are all still working 12 hours a day, seven days a week. They work these hours to be able to earn enough to purchase the luxuries referred to by the hon. member for De Aar. I say that they are fully entitled to purchase those luxuries, including motor-cars. I do not believe that they have to get around on foot, as the hon. member for De Aar seems to think they should. I believe that they are entitled to these luxuries, but not at the cost of having to work 12 hours a day for seven days a week, month in and month out. Does the hon. the Minister know that station masters are employed almost eight hours a day working trains, and that they have to burn the midnight oil to get their administrative work done? I am sure that he is aware of these conditions, but he is not telling this House about these things. The hon. member for Parow and others are trying to hide these facts, or otherwise they are ignorant of them. We had the situation a little while ago, on the narrow gauge system which runs through my constituency. where for two days no trains ran at all. Farmers received no mail. Perishable goods perished at all points. The farmers are dependent on the railways for the delivery of their meat, but in this case the meat perished before it was delivered. When I made inquiries, I found that the reason why the trains had not run for two days was that a guard, one person, had unfortunately had an illness in his family and had been given compassionate leave. So far, so good, but do you know, Sir, that in the whole of the Natal system there was not a single relief guard to be had to relieve that man so that the train could run? Eventually, in desperation, a station master guarded that train so that some form of service could be provided after two days. This is the staff position in the Railways to-day. When one person goes off sick, a whole system stands still.</p>

<p>Yes, he will shortly be the ex-member. Sir, salaries and conditions <span class="col_681-682" refersTo="page_0353"/>in the Railways are not good. I am sure that if the hon. the Minister is honest, he will, when he looks into his heart, admit that they are not as good as they could be. This is why we have this shortage of staff to-day.</p>

<p>We have a similar situation developing in the Airways. Before I begin with the Airways, I want to pay tribute to the staff of the South African Airways. They have a wonderful record for punctuality, for efficiency and for safety. In fact, they have a record second to none in the world. I should like, however, to ask the hon. the Minister how long this is going to last. The staff that he has are being worked to the limit of their endurance. The strain on these people is terrific, not only on flying staff, but on ground crews as well. I am sure that he is aware of this situation. I am sure that he is aware of the responsibility and the strain which rest on the flying staff when they bring in these monsters, laden with passengers. We find that some of these pilots are bringing in these huge aircraft after having worked a continuous shift of 9&#x00BD; hours. This is the case on domestic flights, when they are perpetually landing and taking off. We heard, when the Minister replied to a question here this afternoon, that on international flights some pilots are landing aircraft after a continuous shift of 15 hours and 45 minutes. Surely something can be done about this. Is it essential for us to have such a system where a man, at the end of a shift of over 15 hours, has the strain of having to land this heavy machine? I want to ask the hon. the Minister to look into this matter. Is it not possible in some way to reduce the length of the shifts these men have to work? Some of these men on the international flights are completely and utterly fagged out at the end of a flight. As I have said, they have to land at Jan Smuts Airport after a shift of more than 15 hours&#x2019; continuous work.</p>

<p>There is another point I should like to make. I must thank the hon. the Minister for the replies he gave to my questions to-day. I have not yet had time to evaluate them fully, but there is one aspect which perturbs me. I am referring now to the actual flying training of pilots for the various types of aircraft they will have to fly. The length of actual flying training which the hon. the Minister considers sufficient to enable a pilot to handle a Boeing 707 or 727 aircraft is 10 hours. Ten hours&#x2019; flying time would comprise two circuits of our main aerodromes, namely Johannesburg to Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, Bloemfontein and back to Johannesburg, without time for bumps. That is all it comprises. After that short period these men are considered to be capable of taking control and flying those aircraft. In the case of the Boeing 737, it is considered that only five hours flying time is sufficient to train a man adequately to take control of the aircraft. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister really thinks that this is sufficient time. I wonder whether this is not why we have had more reports of bumpy landings and of bad take-offs. I am asking these questions in all seriousness, because I want to see this wonderful record of the South African Airways maintained.</p>

<p>I do not know about being irresponsible, Sir. The hon. member for Zululand, with his Hopalong Cassidy story about the rustlers, and so on, certainly cannot talk about being irresponsible.</p>

<p>Sir, while I am talking about aircraft, I particularly want to speak to the hon. the Minister about the question of the hijacking of aircraft. I want to discuss with him what the South African Government, and he in particular, as the Minister in charge, have done about this problem, and what I think he should do. I should also like to mention where I think he has perhaps been remiss. Hijacking has, of course, become an international problem. It is a problem which has assumed immense proportions in certain parts of the world. Admittedly, up to now in South Africa we have been free of any of this sort of piracy. In 1969 a conference of the International Air Travel Association was held in Amsterdam. This has become known as the Amsterdam Conference. I believe South Africa was represented there. At that conference a resolution was adopted, requesting governments to secure multilateral agreements with other countries to include provisions regarding the extradition and /or the punishment of hijackers. Many countries have taken this action, but I believe South Africa has not. In reply to questions which I put to the hon. the Minister, I have found that South Africa has no agreements with any countries regarding the hijacking of aircraft, either with regard to the punishment of the hijacker or the extradition of the hijacker to South Africa or to the place of departure for punishment, or even for the return of the aircraft, or for the safe custody of the passengers and crew of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Also during 1969 a conference was held in Tokyo. This conference has become known as the Tokyo Convention. This conference dealt with hijacking and certain other offences committed aboard aircraft. My information is that at this convention sound international law was established to promote the safety of civil aviation. In reply to a question I put to the hon. the Minister, he informed us that South Africa was not immediately a signatory to the Tokyo Convention. Nor is South Africa a signatory to-day. He informed us that he and his department are still considering the matter and that there are shortcomings in the agreement. I agree that perhaps the Tokyo Convention did not close all the loopholes and of course it cannot work unless all countries are signatories to it. But surely South African pilots, passengers and aircraft should have some protection. The hon. the Minister tells me that he is awaiting the outcome of a meeting of the legal committee of the I.C.A.O. in March, 1970 and <span class="col_683-684" refersTo="page_0354"/>that after that he will take action and decide whether South Africa should become a signatory to the Tokyo Convention or not. But what about the present? What about the situation to-day? If one of our aircraft was hijacked this week, we have no agreements with any countries and we have no undertakings from any countries as to the safe return of passengers and crew. We have nothing. Where we do have bilateral air agreements with other countries, notwithstanding the fact that we were represented at the Amsterdam Conference, I find from the replies given by the hon. the Minister, that South Africa has not included any conditions in any bilateral agreements (those we have with the countries mentioned by the hon. the Minister) with regard to the extradition or punishment of hijackers, the return of the aircraft or the safe conduct of crew or passengers. Surely our aircraft crews and passengers should be protected. Has the hon. the Minister not perhaps been remiss as far as this matter is concerned? I asked the hon. the Minister a further question in regard to hijacking. I asked him whether any precautions had been taken to prevent hijacking. This hon. Minister, in his customary manner, which usually displays the arrogance of the whole of the Cabinet, replied than it was not in the public interest to answer my question. If I had asked the hon. the Minister what precautions had been taken, I could have understood why he gave that reply but I merely wanted a reassurance from the hon. the Minister. It is not only I but the pilots of South African Airways, the passengers and the people of South Africa who merely want a reassurance from the hon. the Minister that some active steps have been taken to prevent the hijacking of a South African Airways&#x2019; aircraft. Our pilots are in the dark. They do not know whether we are signatories to the Tokyo Convention or not. They will know now. In the absence of any light being thrown on that question and on the question of whether any action had been decided on or whether any precautions had been taken with regard to the hijacking of South African Airways&#x2019; aircraft, they have made their own decision. Their decision is that they will not resist a hijacker. They will go along with him in the interests of the safety of their passengers, their crew and their aircraft. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister is aware of this. At any rate he is aware of it now. Against this background of a lack of action on the part of this Government. I want to discuss this whole question of hijacking. President Nixon of the United Stages of America, U Thant, the Secretary-General of U.N., and world leaders throughout the whole world have realized the seriousness of this question of hijacking. They have gone as far as to say that they consider this to be one of the most urgent problems facing the United Nations Organization. The International Federation of Airline Pilots&#x2019; Associations, which is known as IFALPA, has given this question top priority. U.N. was asked to act last year and in fact sat for two days on this question but failed to reach any decision. It failed through lack of unanimity amongst those countries which operate international airlines. Not all the countries which operate international airlines have brought pressure to bear on U.N. and I am sorry to say that South Africa is one of those countries which has failed in its duty to bring this matter forcibly to the attention of U.N. South Africa is one of the countries not actively campaigning at U.N. for the application of some sanctions not only against the hijackers, but also against those countries which will offer succour to and harbour hijackers. Why has South Africa not combined with these other countries in this matter? Does the hon. the Minister think that we are safe here in the southern tip of Africa? This is a growing menace. It is a menace which is spreading. It is better that we should not wait until a hijacking results in a major disaster before we decide to take effective action. Planes that have been hijacked have landed not very far away from us. In fact, there is still some doubt in the minds of certain people that the crash which occurred in West Africa a few months ago was not the result of a hijacking. Aviation in general and in particular the aviation of South Africa is not immune to the hijacker. For many years now it has been accepted that piracy on the high seas is a crime against all mankind. All nations have always had an obligation to suppress piracy and to bring the guilty parties to justice. Air piracy, hijacking, comes to the same thing. Why is South Africa not prepared to join these other countries who are actively supporting IFALPA in their campaign to eliminate this terrible crime against humanity? Air piracy is as much a matter of universal concern as piracy on the high seas was in the old days. Only conserted action by all the countries will eliminate this threat to freedom of air travel. The International Federation of Airline Pilots&#x2019; Association, realizing the importance of this and realizing that they were not getting anywhere fast as far as many countries and particularly U.N. were concerned, requested all their affiliated associations to bring to the attention of their controlling companies or to their governments, if they were government airlines, the seriousness of this problem. They have suggested that a world-wide stoppage of international air flights should take place. It is their intention that this should be a stoppage for 24 hours only to bring forcibly to the attention of all people the seriousness of this question of hijacking. In this way they hope to bring this matter forcibly to the attention of U.N. so that perhaps some action would be taken whereby mandatory sanctions would be imposed upon countries which harboured and succoured hijackers.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to hear that because that is the point to which I am coming. Individual associations <span class="col_685-686" refersTo="page_0355"/>have approached their controlling bodies and their governments for permission to join this stoppage. Many of them have received that permission. This action is being taken by most responsible men who are members of a most responsible organization and who probably have the greatest responsibility ever imposed on a few people in bringing in these monsters of the sky. I believe that the South African Airline Pilots Association approached the Administration for permission to join in this 24 hour stoppage. I asked the hon. the Minister whether he had been approached in this regard and his answer was that this had not been done. We have heard about a credibility gap, but I am afraid I cannot accept that now as the reason why the hon. the Minister said no. Perhaps these representations have not reached him in his Office. But I want to say that my information is that an approach was most definitely made. It was made to the Deputy Chief Executive of the South African Airways, who refused permission to the South African Pilots Association to partake in this 24-hour strike. Surely, that Executive would not have taken such an important decision on his own without referring to some higher authority. Be that as it may, I now want to appeal to the hon. the Minister, if such a decision has been made, if such permission has been refused, will he not now reverse that decision. Perhaps he can give this House the reasons why such a decision was given and why permission was refused. In terms of our industrial legislation no pilot can associate himself with such a stoppage without the prior consent of the South African Airways. I would be very glad to hear from the hon. the Minister why this permission was refused.</p>

<p>This was a request made by a group of very responsible people. This permission to participate in the stoppage has been refused. There is no other motive behind the actions of the South African Pilots Association in their request for permission to participate in this stoppage. Has the hon. the Minister considered the consequences of his refusal? Firstly it means that when IFALPA goes to U.N., it does not go with the backing of all the countries. It does not go with the backing of South Africa. But has the hon. the Minister thought of the effects on South African Airways and the aircraft of South African Airways which during that particular 24 hours will be flying international flights?</p>

<p>Well, this certainly is news to me. But just let me continue and ask the hon. the Minister whether he considered the fact, if this stoppage was called and South African Airways were to send up their aircraft, that they might arrive overseas and find no ground staff, no fuel or landing aids.</p>

<p>Let us then at that point leave international flights and let us come back to domestic flights and this question of hijacking. Has the hon. the Minister considered the possibility of a hijacking in South Africa on domestic flights? Our Pilots&#x2019; Association most certainly has. They are extremely perturbed at the possibility of the hijacking of an aircraft. If one thinks of an aircraft flying from Johannesburg to Salisbury it carries sufficient fuel to take it to Zambia, Tanzania or even to Kenya. Similarly, an aircraft from Johannesburg to Windhoek has sufficient fuel to take it into the Congo or to Zambia. We carry on our aircraft international passengers. We are not aware of whether any precautions are being taken. We know that there are no international agreements with anybody who will be able to assist us in the event of an aircraft being hijacked.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that he has many things that he will tell us, that he has much information on this particular subject. I wait with interest and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will accept what I have said this afternoon. I hope he will accept in good faith that I have put forward this case, not so much as criticism of the Government for political reasons, but as criticism of the Government for not having taken what I consider to be sufficient and adequate steps in the light of the information that I have, to protect South African Airways and the passengers who are flying on it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing that proves that this hon. member will not be returning to this House it is the fact that he made a 20-minute speech on a matter which does not exist. He heard what the hon. the Minister told him, i.e. that the International Pilots&#x2019; Association had decided that the 24-hour strike, during which the aircraft would remain grounded in order to bring the importance of airways strikes to the attention of the world, was not going to be carried out because it was not practical. The world realizes only too well how extremely problematical the situation of aircraft hijacking is. To paralyze the airways of the entire world for 24 hours and to disrupt services with the purpose of bringing it to the attention of a world which is already aware of this matter, they themselves decided would not be done. The hon. member spent all his time asking the hon. the Minister why he had prohibited the deputations from South Africa from voting in favour <span class="col_687-688" refersTo="page_0356"/>of it. They themselves found that it was not worth the trouble and was unnecessary. This is one example of the complete ignorance which the hon. member displays in this House. That is why he will not return.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, I only have half an hour and he struggled for a full half-hour to talk about this matter. This hon. member, in the same way as the hon. member for Constantia and Yeoville, once again discussed the matter of level-crossings from an emotional point of view. He stated that he did not want to make political propaganda with it and that he had not duscussed it for the sake of political votes. But even in the no-confidence debate the hon. member for Port Natal already broached this matter from an emotional point of view in order to see whether they could not catch a few votes as a result of this tragic accident, which we all feel very unhappy about. He is the fourth speaker to have broached this matter. What are the actual facts, Sir? I furnished the figures here in the House of Assembly during the no-confidence debate. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For we must point out that the average approximate cost of eliminating these railway crossings varies from R150,000 to R200,000. Now there are also &#x2026;</block>

<p>These hon. members say that they must all be eliminated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; crossings which would then have to be eliminated, which would cost R600 million to R800 million.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Parow made it very clear to hon. members that we do not build any new railway lines where there are crossings without seeing to it at once that a fly-over or a subway is built. We inherited this position. Since April, 1968, the amount has been doubled in that the Department of Railways, the National Roads Fund and the Treasury, equally divided, make R3 million available for the purpose of eliminating these crossings. But with this plea these hon. members are in fact advocating irresponsibility, rashness, and contravention of the law; because if this applies to railway crossings, it applies equally well to unguarded level crossings where major roads cross, where one sometimes finds the fourway stop streets. The road ordinances for the entire South Africa stipulate that one may not drive over a railway crossing without first having stopped and ascertaining what traffic is approaching. This is a road ordinance, and it is the law. If one does not obey this law and drives over a railway line without stopping one is contravening the law.</p>

<p>But what is the case further? We instituted a thorough investigation, and I want to inform you that the number of crossings&#x2014;we have no data in respect of the number of private crossings from farm gates&#x2014;which are equipped with warning signs on public roads, number 4,000, as I told hon. members. Then we have a number of level crossings equipped with warning signs plus stop signs, so that the stop line is also indicated on the road surface, which one cannot always have on a gravel road. We are not absolutely sure how many of these there are. We have equipped a number of level crossings with warning signs and flashing lights, i.e. 64. When one approaches a railway crossing and the light flashes on and off, then surely it is very clear that a train is approaching and that you should, in the interests of your own safety, know that you must stop. The number of level crossings equipped with warning signs plus booms or bells are nine. There are four level crossings with half-length booms as well as one level crossing which is equipped with bells. There are also a number of level crossings with warning signs which are also controlled by level crossing attendants. Level crossings of this kind are important, because I shall point out in a moment that accidents take place even there. There are approximately 58 railway crossings which are guarded day and night. A large number of railway crossings near stations are protected by railway staff, while shunting is in progress. This is the picture as it is at present.</p>

<p>I mentioned the other day how many railway crossings had been eliminated and how many are being eliminated. However, it is also important that we note the important fact that despite all measures which have been taken, accidents have occurred at level crossings. At level crossings where there are warning signs as well as flashing lights, there were 30 accidents during 1967-&#x2019;68 and 18 in 1968-&#x2019;69. At level crossings where there were warning signs, booms and bells, there were two accidents in 1967-&#x2019;68 and two in 1968-&#x2019;69 as well. At level crossings where level crossing attendants were on duty who regulated traffic by means of flags, there were 53 accidents in 1967-&#x2019;68 and 43 in 1968-&#x2019;69. This proves that despite all these measures taken accidents still occur at railway crossings. There are approximately 3,0 unguarded railway crossings which are going to be grouped in such a way that they can be provided with half booms. These booms prevent traffic from entering a railway crossing when a train is approaching, but allow motor cars, which are already inside the level crossing, through. Six of these booms are soon to be put into operation and we will then ascertain to what extent they serve the purpose of eliminating unguarded level crossings where the Administration cannot afford to spend large amounts on level crossings. If it is possible it will be a major step in the direction of solving this problem. However, to have four speakers in this debate, as well as in the no confidence debate discuss this matter one after another, is surely abundant proof that hon. members on the opposite side either have no <span class="col_689-690" refersTo="page_0357"/>thing to discuss and that they have no proper criticism or they want to exploit these unfortunate accidents, with the psychosis which has been created by the Press in regard to the accidents which occurred recently, before the election, in order to win a few votes in that way. Hon. members on the opposite side have no proper criticism, based on facts, of instances where things were incorrectly done in the running of the Railways. I put it to the hon. member that this is the reason why he devoted so much time to this topic.</p>

<p>The hon. member also put questions in regard to the staff. Just to prove that the hon. member does not know what he is talking about, he said here that simply because a train did not have a conductor, that train was stationary for a whole day and the station master had to act as conductor for that train the next day. The hon. member ought to know that many trains run without conductors and the trains are then run on what are called &#x201C;ears&#x201D; in the Railways so that other trains are aware of them. Now however, it is being said here that because a train did not have a conductor the train was stationary for more than 24 hours and that there was no traffic on that line. That hon. member is living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise and that is why he told the hon. member for Parow he was not coming back. The hon. member is himself afraid that he will not come back.</p>

<p>Most certainly. The hon. member for Yeoville made out a whole case, in the same way as the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District), about the staff shortage, and secondly that the staff of the Railways was not being adequately remunerated for the work they were doing. Let us now analyse the true position. In 1947-&#x2019;48 the Railways had a total staff of 187,705.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<p>That was long before the rinderpest.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was long before the rinderpest, but that was also the plague which wiped out the United Party. Of these 98,065 were Whites. By 3rd March, 1969, the staff had increased to 115,142 Whites and 109,464 non-Whites, a total of 224,606. In other words, there was a 19.66 per cent increase in staff on the Railways. That was while the Railways, as the hon. member for Parow said, had to contend with a tremendous industrial explosion and the economic growth of South Africa, when a manpower shortage existed everywhere. The criterion is not how much staff there is. The criterion which must be accepted is whether the Railways is efficient and whether the traffic which is being offered can convey everything at a tariff which fits in with the economic development of South Africa. The hon. member for Parow said the same thing. The second criterion is whether there is a staff which is satisfied to perform the work. I want to dwell for a moment on this point. A third criterion is the productivity of the Railways and its staff. In this connection I should like to analyse the years 1948 and 1969. The tonnage conveyed by the Railways in 1948-&#x2019;49 was 51,898,000. By 1969 this tonnage had increased to 120,855,000. In other words, there was an increase of 132.87 per cent. However, the staff increase was only 19.6 per cent.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>What about mechanization?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. Hon. members opposite blame us for having introduced mechanization. Hon. members opposite do not want us to try to solve our staff shortage problems by means of mechanization. All they want is that more staff should be recruited. or that non-white staff should be brought in where they are not necessary. The number of passengers conveyed by the Railways in 1947-&#x2019;48 was 243,694,000. The number of persons increased until in 1969 they were 102.35 per cent more, i.e. 493,109,000. Again this was done with a staff increase of 19.6 per cent. Since I am only mentioning these two figures hon. members can see what a high degree of productivity was displayed by the members of staff and the management of the Railways. I want to remind this House that when the hon. the Minister took over 16 years ago as Minister of Transport, he gave the assurance in this House that within five years he would be able to convey all the traffic offered in South Africa and would be able to cope with it. He placed his political life in jeopardy by saying that as long as he was Minister he would see to it that this could be done. The fact that the hon. the Minister has already had this portfolio for 16 years, and that he is trusted by the electorate as well as the Railway staff is proof that he has succeeded in what he wanted to achieve. The hon. the Minister mentioned certain of the improvements in his Budget speech, but let us see how the productivity of the Railways has been increased. We must accept that the Railways is the biggest employer in South Africa. Our production has increased as a result of the methods of work which have been improved and the mechanization which has been introduced. The labour productivity index indicates that the production figure has increased since 1950 by 166. This compares very well with France, Britain, West Germany and other countries. If one considers the number of staff members, we admit candidly that during the past five years we have been forced to perform our task with a worker shortage of 9 per cent. But if one has a staff of 224,000, and the shortage is 9 per cent, surely one need not feel any panic. Surely this is no reason, as hon. members on that side of the House did, to hold this up as a period of crisis for the Railways. Show me any prosperous industrial development in South Africa it makes no difference <span class="col_691-692" refersTo="page_0358"/>whether it is the steel industry or any other industry, which does not have to contend with a staff shortage. It is because this country, its great development, is growing so rapidly, that we have a labour shortage. Why is the burden being placed at the door of the Railways only? In spite of this shortage 16.4 million additional tons of traffic and 67.7 million more passengers are being handled than five years ago. That indicates that there is increased efficiency and productivity in the administration of the Railways. I want to mention a few of the most important aspects. It is necessary for me to indicate them. In the first instance, we modernized the accounts system for goods. In 1957 the conventional punch card installations were put into operation. The preparations for a computer were also made. After that we also acquired modern Office equipment and electronic apparatus. This brought about decentralization of the accounting Offices and the establishment of a revenue account bureau in all sections.</p>

<p>Secondly we installed a modern computer in 1963. The change-over to mechanized procedures in order to deal with these matters was completed within two years. At the moment we have ten computers for this. In 1957 we began a system for the mechanization and renewal of railway line maintenance. Since then this has been expanded to all sections at a cost of R9 million. The hon. members on that side of the House must not use the staff who formerly did pick and shovel work on the Railways as an example to prove that we have less staff, and a staff shortage. Track maintenance is no longer done by those people but is in fact done with the aid of these modern mechanical systems. As a result of this, it is possible for us to reduce the number of staff members in this branch of the service by more than 600 platelayers and 10,000 Bantu labourers. If the work is being done in that way now then surely there ought to be no complaints. This entails an annual saving of R1.5 million for us.</p>

<p>I want to mention a further example, i.e. the introduction of centralized traffic control. In this connection we have further expanded the carrying capacity of our single line sections. This train control system is extremely flexible. It presents considerable possibilities. I saw how this system was being put to use. The introduction of these centralized traffic control systems on the Kamfersdam, Postmasburg, Hamilton. Springfontein, Volksrust and Newcastle sections has enabled the Administration to reduce the number of station foremen by 72 without affecting the safety and the good control of trains. On the contrary, this was in fact improved. Now control can at all times be exercised over those trains.</p>

<p>My time is not going to allow me to mention all the other examples. But I want to deal with a further aspect in regard to the efficiency of the staff. Let us look at the income of the Railways. Again I want to refer to the years 1947 and 1948. Then the United Party was in power. It was also a period when, according to them, there was sufficient staff. However, that staff consisted of pick and shovel workers. Then the income of the Railways was R165,274,000. In the year 1968/1969 this income increased to R794,703,000. Surely there is no comparison. If the income and expenditure were added together so that the turnover could be calculated, there is an increase from R331,768,000 to R1,602,000,000 during this short period. Just look at capital investment. In 1948 capital investment amounted to R473 million. On 31st March, 1969, it was R2,477,000,000. This indicates the tremendous growth in the Railways.</p>

<p>But now hon. members have stated that the Railways staff are not deriving any benefit from these major increases. According to them these people are not getting enough. The hon. the Minister mentioned to us here that only during these past twenty years the salaries of Railways staff have increased by R255 million. The total amount paid out in salaries is R400 million. In the past twenty years, however, it has increased from R255 million to R400 million. This is an enormous increase. I want to indicate a few of these annual increases so that this matter can be clear in the minds of hon. members. On 1st April, 1951, an increase of R10 million was announced. In June 1951 an additional R12,409,000 was granted. If we bear in mind the increase of 88 per cent in the cost of living allowance, we see that a further increase of R11,400,000 was granted in 1952. In 1955 the salary increases and loan improvements for all staff members amounted to R8,200,000. Immediately afterwards, in 1956, a consolidation of the cost of living allowance of R7,170,000 was granted. In 1958 a further amount of R13,100,000 was also granted. On 1st April 1961 another increase of R11,470,000 was announced. So I can mention the various increases one after the other. The total amount of increases during the short period between 1951 to November 1969 therefore amounts to R215,499,000, in other words, the hon. the Minister of Transport has looked after the Railway workers in this connection. I do not know how hon. members on that side can complain and say that the Railway worker is not being looked after.</p>

<p>I want to make it very clear that every cent of this increase in the salaries of the Railways staff and in their housing, which other hon. members will probably go on to mention, has been deserved. They deserved every cent of it. It is they who look after the lifeblood of our phenomenal economic growth in the agricultural industry, in mining and in industry. As the hon. member for Parow said, this is the hub around which everything turns. The transport system and communications is the lifeblood of our economy. The most important requirement, however, is that the railway worker himself must have confidence in the Railways. His system of appeal which he is able to make must not be demolished. Nor must his system of discipline which is applied <span class="col_693-694" refersTo="page_0359"/>be demolished. He must have confidence and he must be proud. I can give the assurance that the railway workers are proud of this hon. Minister of Transport. I am proud of the fact that I am able to work together with such a person, that we can have such a person here to look after the interests of the railway worker and South Africa. I want to say to the hon. member for Yeoville that the relations between the hon. the Minister, the Management and the Railway staff are carried out through the agency of the seven different Railway staff associations. Those relations are as sound as any other relations between employee and employer in South Africa. There are no other relations which are as favourable as these relations which exist in regard to the Minister in the Railways. This is because the hon. the Minister has succeeded in bringing about a position where the railway worker and the railway staff in South Africa do not regard the railways as an independent employer. They regard them as part of themselves. They are owners, co-shareholders and co-directors in this great organization which does the conveying in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, listening to hon. members on the other side of the House this afternoon making their Parliamentary election speeches it was very interesting to see how they are going to conduct themselves as the friend of the Railwayman. The hon. member for Parow referred to me as father Christmas. I should like to give him a present on 23rd April, namely a new government which he will have no alternative but to accept. I listened to the hon. member for North Rand here this afternoon. I must pay him the compliment that he has always impressed me as a very good speaker as far as the Railways is concerned. He was, however, off form this afternoon. I do not know whether he is worried about the wives of Randburg and their lack of labour or whether he is worried about getting back his seat, or whether he is nervous about upsetting anymore people. In his whole speech he made very few points in replying to the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow seems to feel that we were starting some type of vendetta as far as level crossings were concerned and that we were trying to catch a few votes. The Government side is so ill-informed of the dangers of these crossings that they think that we are trying to get a few miserable votes out of it. Far be it from that. The position to-day is that the voting public of South Africa and others are concerned about the conditions as far as their safety is concerned, particularly at level crossings. When you have the hon. member for Parow getting up and suggesting that the hon. member for Constantia was trying to gain a few cheap votes it becomes just absolutely ridiculous. The whole question of road safety at level crossings is one that concerns everybody. I am pretty certain that it concerns the hon. Minister of Transport.</p>

<p>I was listening to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s deputy. I do not know whether he had been put in because the hon. the Minister of Transport is looking forward to his retirement on the 23rd and whether he put his deputy in to see what he could really do. His deputy however did not show up too well. The deputy also tried riding the level crossing horse but I think he failed miserably. The Government and the Railways are trying various methods to overcome the difficulty of getting level crossings bridged or have them made safer than they are. We must face up to the fact that when you go to the Continent and elsewhere you see quite a number of level crossings which are protected, as the hon. the Deputy Minister indicated, by half-gates. In addition thereto they have a bell and a flasher. That is something that we have to take note of. If we cannot protect these crossings by bridges I think we should go to the expense of having them manned and equipped with flashing lights. I myself do not think one crossing is worth one life.</p>

<p>We were criticized by the hon. member for Parow for having said that we were in favour of closing down the Railway workshops and handing the work over to the private sector. The hon. member for Parow must know that over the years the Railway workshops to a large extent have made use of the private sector for the production of the various needs of the Railways in general. As a matter of fact our coaches are not being manufactured in Railway workshops. They are being produced by private contractors. A lot of the components that we use in the workshops for the <span class="col_695-696" refersTo="page_0360"/>reconditioning of our rolling stock are manufactured outside. I do not know whether he knows that. It is not a question that we want to close down the workshops. He may be hoping to catch a few votes by telling people that. It is however just sheer nonsense.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow went into the question of the report into the co-ordination of transport. He however lacks the inside business experience to really understand what it is all about. We have the White Paper which was issued by the hon. the Minister which we have not been able to consider at any great length. If one is to gather from the tone of the debate here this afternoon that the Government is going to reject this report, I think it will be wrong. I will come back to that later.</p>

<p>We had figures quoted here by the hon. the Deputy Minister as to what happened in 1958 as far as the manpower shortage is concerned and what the position was when the United Party Government was in power. The hon. the Minister of Transport himself also reviewed the 21 years the Government have been in power and he should be reminded that in 1948, which was just after the war&#x2014;in which this Government incidentally took no part&#x2014; there was a terrific shortage of everything, including manpower, goods and materials with which to conduct and run our Railways. But the United Party Government had the foresight of planning ahead. We had plans and we had the services of Marshall Clark and others. We planned ahead to build up the Railways into the force it could be. We realized that we just would not have the personnel to develop this wonderful country. It was a very prosperous country in 1948 and in spite of this Government it is still a prosperous country. This country is blessed with a wealth of minerals and a wonderful spirit we have amongst our people. One wonders however how more prosperous this country would have been and what a more wonderful country it would have been had this party been returned in 1948. We talk about manpower shortage. We had this Government scrapping our Railway plans <i>in toto.</i> We have been told that we did not have the money. That is just so much rubbish. It was not the case. We were in a position at that stage to lend England something like &#x00A3;80 million in gold. Yes, we had the cash, we had everything. Of course, shortly after 1948 the cash ran out very rapidly. They stopped our immigration scheme and so the whole machinery of our Railways ran down. Let us remind the hon. members on that side of the House that this side of the House over the years reminded the Government that they should make a change in their Minister of Railways. They jogged along until at last the Government was forced to take action and to-day we have in our ministry the hon. the present Minister of Transport. Things started to look up. He did find that he had a terrific backlog and he had to start picking up United Party plans. Taking up the United Party plans he realized that during the interim period when his colleague was there, there had been no real planning.</p>

<p>As far as the staff is concerned, I can just say that they have been loyal. Throughout these years, when the former Minister was in charge, there was the feeling that the Railways were going backwards and that a ministerial change would have to be made. The hon. Minister started planning and started building up the Railways, but he has had to deal with as I have heard him say once, the political/ economic views of this present Government. He had to deal with a Government that did not want to allow him to import any artisans by means of immigration. Therefore, he had to jog along slowly. Our developing country, however, was demanding a better transport system than there was at that time. We must also remember the coal crisis when power stations threatened to close down because of the shortage of trucks. We were forced to cart coal from the coal fields in Witbank to Johannesburg in order to keep the power stations and the home fires burning. That was the result of a lack of equipment because the Government had rejected and thrown overboard the whole of the United Party&#x2019;s policy. Then they come along here and tell us about the wonderful 21 years! What they really are doing, and we have told them so in this House so often, is to adopt the United Party&#x2019;s policy. They are resorting to sound planning and the forecasting of the needs of this country. There is still a terrific backlog, we are still short of manpower, but I want to deal with that later on in this debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow has made a statement about our policy, and he referred to me in particular as far as the infiltration of Blacks of white jobs in Railways are concerned. If the hon. member had listened to the hon. Minister of Transport, he would not have made this speech. Some figures were given to the hon. member for Berea to-day, in reply to a question of his. The hon. Minister in reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question has said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Owing to the staff shortage, there are at present 84 Coloured, 72 Indian and 1,006 Bantu servants who are temporarily employed in work normally performed by white graded staff. In addition there are 1,287 Coloured, 135 Indian and 12,879 Bantu employees who are performing work formerly done by unskilled and ungraded workers.</block>

<p>When the hon. member for Parow stood up and said that we would like to see it happening, he was talking rubbish. It is happening. The hon. Minister of Transport, in order to keep his Railways going, has to be practical and face up to the issue: he has to be practical and he has to employ the staff where they are needed.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when business was suspended for supper I was dealing with the statements which were made by the various speakers from the Government side. I would like to come nearer home, namely to the Western Cape. Here I want to deal with what the Government has done and what they have not done for us during the past 21 years.</p>

<p>The first item I should like to deal with is an item which is of much importance to us here in the Western Cape, and that is the first Boeing 707 flight from Cape Town to London which took place on the 1st February this year. As far as we are concerned, it was an historical occasion when the D. F. Malan Airport received recognition as an international airport. We on this side of the House have pressed for it for a number of years and we were pleased to note that the Government had at last decided to recognize D. F. Malan as an international airport. At the moment it is not the gateway to South Africa, but I think that Cape Town has been placed on the road to becoming the gateway to the Republic. What really was disappointing was that this flight did not receive any official recognition from either the Minister or his Deputy, or any senior official. They might have been there unofficially, but no official function marked this very eventful happening at D. F. Malan Airport. Not very far from the D. F. Malan Airport, there took place the landing of Sir Pierre van Ryneveld and Quinton Brand many years ago. This event which has just taken place is another great event in the history of aviation in South Africa. The public of Cape Town took a very great interest in this event and some 20,000 people went to see that plane leave the airport. It was one of the biggest congestions of traffic Cape Town has seen for a long time. The people in the Western Cape took a very great interest in this event and therefore it was disappointing to find that the Minister did not give this flight the recognition that it was entitled to.</p>

<p>I want to refer to another matter concerning the D. F. Malan Airport. In view of the fact that the facilities at the D. F. Malan Airport are inadequate, even for our local flights, we have been promised over the years that certain facilities would be provided. According to international standards, the facilities were nothing more than shambles, although certain facilities were provided. I feel that there should be a speed-up in completing this airport and modernizing it to international standards so that we can offer our passengers, and especially tourists, the comfort that they are entitled to. The work should be speeded up to provide for the tourists, because I think D. F. Malan is bound to become a big tourist centre. When we studied the co-ordination of transport report, another ridiculous situation showed up. Here, at the D. F. Malan Airport, we have the old story of the Public Works Department building the building, the Department of Transport controlling the Airport, and the Railways and Harbours supplying the aeroplane. I think it is high time, as far as our airports are concerned which are operated by the Minister of Transport and the Airways, that all buildings and runways came under one control. The present situation is a ridiculous one. You can imagine what would happen at the Johannesburg station if the P.W.D. constructed the building, the Minister of Transport cleaned up the station and the Minister of Railways tried to operate the trains. That is the ridiculous situation that you have at our airports. You have the one person doing the one thing and another person doing the other thing. The runways are going to be built by the Minister of Transport, the buildings by the P.W.D. and the Minister of Transport will operate the aircraft. I think the time is overdue to give attention to this item. If the Minister is not going to accept the division of the Airways from the Railways, I think the Airways are entitled to take over the control of their buildings. I think we will then see a little more speed as far as the construction of buildings is concerned, and get away from the shambles and the conditions that we have at the D. F. Malan Airport at the present moment.</p>

<p>To get back to the Western Cape, I want to deal with the promises made by this particular Government. We are often asked questions about the Hex River tunnel. We feel that we in the Western Cape are rather the Cinderella of the Republic. I know that for some reason or other all eyes are on the Transvaal. I do not believe that the Minister has the regard for the Western Cape that we hoped he would have. Over the years we have asked the Minister to do something about expediting the building of this tunnel and giving better service to the north. In his Budget speech of 1965-&#x2019;66 he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Increased line capacity will now also be required between De Dooms and Touws River. It is now appropriate to recommence the Hex River Tunnel project. This scheme incorporates a new single electrified line which will be used in conjunction with the existing electrified line.</block>

<p>Well, we are now in the year 1970 and I do not think very much progress has been made except possibly in the drawing Office and by way of tests but that line has yet to be built. I suppose when the building of the tunnel is recommenced, if ever, the costs will be enormous. Sir, we in the Western Cape are anxious to get on. We do not want to see all industries moving to the north. We want modern rail connections with the north.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, we come to the question of Saldanha Bay. I can remember the hon. the Minister telling me when I asked him whether it was the intention to extend the line which at present goes to Montague Gardens to Saldanha Bay to take care of the development there that he would not see any great development <span class="col_699-700" refersTo="page_0362"/>in his time nor would I see it in my time. Of course, I think the Minister is going to be proved wrong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Is this the line from Montague Gardens to Saldanha Bay?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Sir, here in Saldanha Bay we have one of the finest deep water bays in the world; it only requires development. I know the Minister has recently lost interest in this matter and has handed it back to the Department of Commerce. I know that there are great plans to make it the ore port of South Africa, not with a three foot six inch gauge line but with a five foot gauge line. If the Minister will think along those lines then he will at least be thinking along modern lines. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to give serious thought to the building of at least a modern line from Montague Gardens. He has extended it already; it now goes as far as the refinery, but we hope to see a more modern line than we have at the present moment, instead of this outdated line running to Saldanha Bay. This would help industries in the Western Cape.</p>

<p>Sir, this Part Appropriation Bill reminds me of the Budget which the Minister introduced in 1965; there are certain parallels. You will remember that the report of the Schumann Commission was then laid on the Table and, strangely enough, this year we had the report of the Commission on the Co-ordination of Transport. In 1965 the Minister gave the railwaymen a financial bonzella and he has done the same thing this year; he has given them a Christmas box by doubling their bonuses. Sir, these measures are all vote-catching measures which are, of course, welcomed by the railway staff. But I would like to tell hon. members on the Government side that the railwaymen are not fools. They see right through the Government&#x2019;s attempt to try to soften them with an eye on the ballot box on the 22nd April. We have heard speakers here this afternoon stressing how loyal the railway-men are to the Government and how they are going to vote for the Government on the 22nd. Well. I think those members, including the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Parow, may be in for a surprise. The hon. member for Parow who is so sure that he will be returned to this House on the 22nd of April has lost touch with the railwaymen and so has the hon. the Deputy Minister. Sir, the railwaymen do not want these stop/go salary increases. As the hon. member for Yeoville said here this afternoon, they want something a little more permanent. With the rapidly diminishing buying power of the rand, the position to-day is that by the time the hon. the Minister has negotiated one agreement with the railwaymen it has become out of date and he has to start negotiating the next agreement, and then he stands up here and says, &#x201C;I gave them a rise only last year and now they want a rise again; it is impossible; I cannot keep up with this.&#x201D; He could avoid a lot of dissatisfaction if he would only adopt the United Party scheme of linking wages with the cost-of-living index. As the value of the rand diminishes, so his staff would automatically get more. He would then not have the complaints that he gets at the present moment. If he thinks for one moment that the railwayman is the best paid man in the country and is highly satisfied, then he is sorely mistaken. I suggest that if he, the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Parow, meet these people, they will find out that they are not so happy with their salary scales at the present moment. What is more, the last salary increases given to the railwaymen were so full of anomalies that it caused serious dissatisfaction in some of the grades. It is all very well to take R40 million and to hand it over to the railwaymen by way of salary increases, but that is not enough; the Administration should go into the effect of these increases on the various grades. There is terrific dissatisfaction amongst the railwaymen in this regard. Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister also had something to say about increased productivity. I have never heard such a fallacious argument in all my life. They cannot get the staff and the Minister admits that he has only been able to increase the staff by 15 per cent and that in spite of this small increase they are conveying a much larger tonnage. They say that that is increased productivity. They are making the men work day and night to convey a larger volume of goods with a smaller staff and then they say to the world that they have increased productivity. What they are doing is to kill the backbone of their service; they are over-working their staff at the present moment.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister talked here about mechanization. Well, you can mechanize to a certain extent. We went into all that in the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours and I think we are more up to date than he is as far as mechanization on the Railways is concerned. We saw what was being done by this very loyal, hard-working staff but don&#x2019;t forget that it is the last straw that breaks the camel&#x2019;s back. They must not overdo it. Sir, the hon. the Minister is worried about the fact that he cannot get staff. We were told here this afternoon about the railwaymen who left to go to a bank and about the inspector who went along to find out why they had left, also joining the bank.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister should not have another look at the application of the Disciplinary Code. I think it is high time something was done about this. I do not know about hon. members on that side of the House; they have a completely happy staff and they never get these complaints but we do. We get complaints from <span class="col_701-702" refersTo="page_0363"/>members of the railway staff about the application of the Disciplinary Code and its effect. I have a case here where a man happened to take too much liquor and was penalized and degraded about three or four years ago. But he has never been reinstated to his former grade and has never received promotion notwithstanding the fact that he is a first-class servant. He has been acting in a higher grade but he has not been able to get back to his former grade. This sort of thing causes dissatisfaction. These people walk around with a chip on their shoulder. Then, Sir, there is the case of the railwayman who would like to get on in the service. He wants to become a driver. He has been a fireman for quite a long time. They said to him, &#x201C;You can go and take your examination up in the Transvaal and if you pass you can come back again and you will be promoted to the position of driver, but you will have to accept a transfer. If you do not accept the transfer you will have to remain a fireman.&#x201D; Well, this poor man accepted the transfer. His wife apparently could not go along with him because there was no accommodation for them at the place to which he was transferred. In order to please his wife and so as not to disrupt his family life he has had to return and he is still a fireman notwithstanding the fact that he has passed his driver&#x2019;s examination. Sir, I could go on quoting these cases. There is something wrong somewhere. Let the Minister have his Disciplinary Code, but I say that there is something terribly wrong with the application of it. If the hon. the Deputy Minister and hon. members on that side will visit the workshops and speak to the workers, they will find that what I say here is true. People are being penalized for the most trivial offences. Sir, let us rebuild the morale of the railwaymen. Let us make them really proud again to be railwaymen. In the old days they were proud to be railway-men but to-day they are not proud of that fact for the simple reason that they do not know who is spying on them.</p>

<p>We have been asked here by hon. members on that side, &#x201C;Do you want to do away with overtime?&#x201D; The truth of the matter is that the railwaymen&#x2019;s wages are so low that they have to work overtime in order to be able to live decently, and if overtime was to disappear their wages should remain the same. It is wrong to try to run the Railways on the basis of overtime. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Before I react to the speech made by the hon. member for Salt River, I want to react to what the hon. member for Yeoville said in respect of the so-called bush court, as he phrased it. I can attribute his complaint about the so-called bush court to one of two possibilities. He was either engaged in practising cheap political agitation, or he has no idea whatsoever of what a disciplinary inquiry in the Railways means.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>It is both.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps I may lay both of these charges at his door. Sir, in the first instance I want to deny most vehemently that there are such things as courts in the set-up of the Railways. These are nothing but disciplinary inquiries. One does not need to have legal knowledge to know that it is an elementary principle that in certain Government Departments, such as the Railways and the Police Service for instance, one has disciplinary inquiries from time to time. For instance, it may happen that in the ordinary courts of the country a shed foreman is charged with theft of railway property and that he is acquitted, but it is quite possible and very fair and just that the same shed foreman would stand trial in a disciplinary inquiry on a charge in terms of the regulations, for instance that he did not exercise proper control over the same goods. For that reason I reject the reference made by the hon. member for Yeoville to bush courts as ordinary bush propaganda.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Salt River. He furnished us with a nostalgic retrospective view of the state of the Railways during the last months and years of United Party r&#x00E9;gime, but few of us present here, and few members of the older generation in our country, will share his nostalgia. What a Railways organization did we have in 1948! Exhausted funds, blatant political discrimination, in respect of which the National Government had to appoint a grievances commission to straighten out these matters. And then a point is made of saying that at that time the planning was right, but the question is not whether there was planning; the question is rather whether the planning was carried out intelligently. To pass over the bread-and-butter matters and to buy luxuries such as paintings, most definitely amounts to planning being carried out unintelligently, no matter what angle one views it from.</p>

<p>Once again in this debate much has been made of the staff shortage, and as was the case in other debates, the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. the Deputy Minister admitted quite frankly that the Railways did have a staff shortage, and they took the House into their confidence as regards what measures had been taken. But may this United Party speak of a staff shortage and a slackness in meeting this shortage? The present hon. member for Constantia was Minister of Railways during the last few years of United Party r&#x00E9;gime, and on 19th February, 1948, when he made the last Budget speech for the United Party, this is what he had to say. (Hansard, Vol. 72, Col. 1854)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More traffic was moved than ever before, although in meeting the transport needs of <span class="col_703-704" refersTo="page_0364"/>the country, the Railways had again to battle against shortages of material and manpower.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia had to make this admission, in spite of the fact that in his Budget speech he had admitted that as a result of the demobilization scheme they were in a position to re-employ more than 17,000 white ex-servicemen. How can a party which during the last year of its r&#x00E9;gime also spoke of staff shortages, a shortage when the labour market at the time was in the favour of the employer, now fling reproaches at this side of the House? But this hon. former Minister of Railways went even further than that. He proudly announced in his Budget speech that railworkers would in future receive 10s. 6d. a day. It is because that party was a 10s. 6d. party that they were kicked out a few weeks later and has never been able to come into power again.</p>

<p>But it was worth a lot in those days.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in those days it was quite a lot, but in comparison railway workers are earning much more to-day. When reference is made to-day of staff shortages and ways of meeting them, railway workers and railway officials should, in the first place, look at what philosophy each party holds in regard to safeguarding the white workers. It is being said that our labour pattern will have to change, and that is why we have to go into the philosophical background of the policy of each party. In the course of the non-confidence debate we recently had, the hon. member for Yeoville did us the favour of giving us a reasonably clear statement of their policy. <i>Inter alia,</i> he said: &#x201C;Job reservation is unnecessary because the conventions of South Africa have looked after that for years. These conventions will remain.&#x201D; And later on he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I can tell hon. members now that section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act in that respect will be repealed and the workers will be protected through industrial conciliation measures and through the right to negotiate with their employers.</block>

<p>Section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act provides safeguards against inter-racial competition for work. It provides comprehensive machinery under which, after a proper hearing, the industrial tribunal may, <i>inter alia,</i> recommend to the Minister that (a) white employees shall not be replaced by non-Whites and (b) work shall be either partly or wholly reserved for Whites. The United Party now wants to abolish this safe, tested machinery provided in the Industrial Conciliation Act, and in the place thereof they want to provide the vague machinery of conventions and promises that other channels will be created. I think the white staff of the Railways of South Africa will not allow this Opposition to come into power with such a philosophy, with such vague promises to the white worker, i.e. that they will safeguard his position. The white staff of the Railways also know that they are dealing with a Minister who is always prepared to improve the working conditions and remuneration of the staff, even if this sometimes means the introduction of unpopular tariff increases.</p>

<p>I now want to pause for a while at the report of the Marais Commission. As far as agricultural products are concerned, I want to thank the hon. the Minister once again for the fact that in many respects he is making concessions by not falling for the principle that transport costs are the primary factor in determining tariffs. In this way many agricultural products have been classified as lowrated traffic, which holds a great advantage not only for the farmer, but also for the consumer. In view of the fact that the Marais Commission emphasized once again that lowrated bulk traffic over long distances would remain the function of the Railways, it is obvious that the Railways will remain the principal transport organization for the agricultural sector. That is why I courteously want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to paragraph 237 of the report of the Marais Commission, i.e. the provision of more storage facilities at loading and terminal points. In this regard I specifically want to plead for the planning and construction of a grain elevator for maize at Richard&#x2019;s Bay to be expedited. The improved farming methods of the maize farmer may have the effect that in a cycle of good years a considerable burden may be placed on the Railways if additional storage facilities are not provided. I also want to refer to paragraph 257 of the report of the Marais Commission. I want to make the plea that the hon. the Minister should, even though this matter does not fall directly under him, help us so that it will as soon as practicable be possible to abolish the tax of 10 per cent per ton of coal delivered in the Transvaal and the O.F.S. If that is done, I think that the country as a whole will be satisfied with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s decision against separating the three main branches of administration, i.e. Railways, Harbours and the Airways.</p>

<p>It is significant that in that Commission the two persons who are the most knowledgeable about transport matters, i.e. Mr. Joubert and Mr. Anderson, found that the question of separation did not come within the scope of the Commission&#x2019;s terms of reference. Another reason why it is difficult to accept the Commission&#x2019;s recommendation in regard to separation, is that they failed to present a clear picture of the financial implications and the socio-economic consequences of such a separation. In view of the fact that the other sectors are showing a profit and the Railways are unable to do so, owing to the low-rated traffic, separation would mean an appreciably higher rail rate on, <i>inter alia,</i> agricultural products, something which our agricultural sector cannot meet at this stage.</p>

<p><span class="col_705-706" refersTo="page_0365"/>In conclusion I want to plead that no consideration be given to handing over any of the branches of the administration to private enterprise. The activities of the S.A. Railways are so intertwined with the socio-economic existence and progress of the people, that it is highly desirable for the Railways as a whole to remain nationalized.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>There are one or two points on which I would like to reply to the hon. member for Kroonstad as and when I get to them. Firstly, he mentioned a very important point, and a very practical one, about building an elevator for maize at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to investigate very thoroughly what effect the heat and humidity will have on maize at that point. I believe it is a very serious matter.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has risen, I believe, twice on this subject and on each occasion he has reeled off reams of statistics, especially about the development since 1948. I should like to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that in 1948 the Government of General Smuts handed over one of the most progressive countries in the world to this present Government.</p>

<p>May I inform him, Sir, that the development that has taken place since, has taken place in spite of this Government. The only thing is that, if he had remained in power, we would probably have found that the tempo of development would have been very much faster. As the hon. member well knows, they stopped the immigration policy which we set afoot. It appears to me that when hon. members on that side get up to reply to members on this side of the House, they try to avoid the issue. They try to introduce political arguments instead of practicable arguments. The dust has settled on that very unfortunate Highbury crossing accident. All that remains for us here in this House to do, is to sympathize with the bereaved. But, Sir, is that sufficient? Is that where our responsibility stops? I remember that gruesome accident, a similar one. just east of Leslie, when a schoolbus from Eendracht school was hit by a train. I can still remember the scene. I think there were 11 little coffins on the verandah of the school. I predicted at the time, and again after I had entered politics, that that would be repeated. We just did not know when and where it would take place. Now it has taken place, and three times that number of victims have been involved. I believe that a Commission of Inquiry is to be appointed. I take it that this is being done to fix the responsibility. But, Sir, as I have said, is that sufficient? Should something not have been done before that accident took place? already. according to the Press we have learnt that the line there is a double track, and an unguarded one at that. There were enormous potholes between the two tracks. Strangely enough, the driver of that bus went to Pretoria all the way from the Vereeniging area near Henley-on-Klip, where the accident took place. to report the condition of the crossing. Strangely, Sir, that crossing was repaired the day after the accident. What I want to know, Sir, is: Are there no gangers on that section of the line? Should they not have attended to the condition of the crossing?</p>

<p>The question arises: Was only the bus driver responsible? Were there certain responsibilities on the shoulders of the driver of the train? The hon. the Deputy Minister has given us statistics about what has been done in regard to the elimination of crossings. I say. Sir, that insufficient has been done as far as the elimination of crossings throughout the Republic is concerned. To give you an idea of what the public thinks, Sir, I should like to read a very short article on small crossings which appeared in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of the 7th February, 1970. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has spent R13.6 million on eliminating railway crossings since 1960, and steps have been taken to remove the remaining 645 crossings. At a casual glance, this seems to be an impressive effort, but a closer look reveals that the annual allocation to this vital work is pitifully inadequate. On average, it costs R50,000 to do away with a road-rail crossing which, by a process of simple arithmetic, means that the Railways are removing these potential death traps at the rate of 2.72 per year. At the present rate of progress it would take more than 200 years before the remainder of them vanish, and that is simply not good enough. The process must be speeded up to stop this unnecessary carnage. The statistics of 350 accidents a year, with 80 people killed, and another 130 injured, is proof enough that unguarded crossings are deathtraps.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I have previously suggested in this House that we should eliminate all crossings in the Republic. If we do not have the labour or the money to do so, we should call for international tenders. If necessary, we should even obtain a foreign loan to do so, but the quicker we tackle this problem, the better for South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir. what control do we have over crossings? Who keeps an eye on crossings? Is it the various section managers, or the System Manager? Is it not time that some sort of inspectorate is brought into being, which can attend to this vital problem in our Republic? We have a crossing called Sweet Waters crossing in Pietermaritzburg, which is closed or controlled by gates. There is a gateman there who closes <span class="col_707-708" refersTo="page_0366"/>these gates when a train passes. A very serious and fatal accident took place on the crossing inside the gate some time ago. I was one of the people who went out to investigate the matter. I asked the gateman how he was notified about the approach of a train. I asked him whether he had a telephone. The answer was that he did not. I asked him whether he had a railway timetable. The answer was that he did not have that either. The crossing is in a misty area. Thick mist occurs there in the afternoons. I asked him how he knew that a train was approaching. He said to me that they had to put their ears on the railway line or against a telephone pole.</p>

<p>This is not something to be laughed about. I am not laughing. This is a serious matter. We do not want to know how much money has been spent on the elimination of these crossings. We want them to be made safe and eliminated as soon as possible. That is a practical suggestion, Sir.</p>

<p>I now come to disciplinary inquiries, which were mentioned by the hon. member for Kroonstad. I agree with him. It is very sad to think that a railwayman has to refer to his departmental inquiry as a bush court. I have raised this matter in this House on a previous occasion. At that time the hon. the Minister replied:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;That is something that the railwaymen want.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Sir, such is not the case. I think that there is a misconception in this regard. The case referred to is one where a man is charged by the Railway Police for a serious offence and the case is sent to the local public prosecutor for him to decide whether to prosecute or not. The public prosecutor declined to prosecute. Mr. Speaker, all the legal men in this House will tell you that a civilian whom a public prosecutor declines to prosecute is a free man. This is not so as far as the Railways are concerned. He still has to face the disciplinary court and he may face the possibility of a discharge from the Railways. He is not allowed to have legal representation. The hon. member for Kroonstad who is a legal man can well understand why I am so perturbed about this matter. For this serious offence the poor railwayman must go to a bush court and get one of his friends or a railwayman whom they will appoint to defend him. That is wrong. I have said so in the past, I am saying it now and I will continue saying it. The fortunate thing is that railway-men are beginning to realize what the legal implications are. They only realize this when they are faced with an inquiry. Then they realize that they are in trouble. I ask the hon. the Minister in sincerity and humility, because I am that type of person, to alter these regulations and allow a railwayman who is in trouble to get legal representation if he so desires.</p>

<p>During the last session the Public Service Commissssion very kindly granted subsidies to public servants to help them pay their building society interest. In view of the shortage of houses among railwaymen, and I believe that there is a shortage of approximately 40,000 houses, railwaymen have to rent houses. Some of them have to pay very high rentals. I am told that the Minister is always assisting these men. Is it not possible to pay them a subsidy towards the high rental they have to pay for private houses?</p>

<p>Then there is the question of transporting stock from South West Africa to the Republic by train. I received a different answer to a question I put to-day to that which I received some years ago. When some years ago I asked a similar question I was told that 100 refrigerator trucks would be made available for the purpose of transporting fresh meat from South West Africa to the Republic to supply the local market here. I was told that they would try to avoid transporting slaughter animals over that very long distance. This is a case of cruelty to animals. People concerned with the matter asked me to raise it here over the floor of this House. I should like to know how many head of stock have travelled that long distance, from South West Africa to the Witwatersrand. recently when they could not be removed from the trucks for slaughter in Johannesburg? As far as I know the railway regulations lay down that after the Railways have accepted animals it is their responsibility to at least water them while they are in their custody. They remain in their custody until they are delivered. Then there is the old question of the pipeline costs. I see that last year the amount involved was R20 million and I understood from the hon. the Minister that it would probably be very much higher this year. The motorists I have met throughout the country do not like that story of the Minister. They want to see the price of petrol averaged out. A man out in the bundu. in the north of Namaqualand where I went last Easter, objects to paying 50 cents for a gallon of petrol when I in Natal only pay a little more than 30 cents a gallon. I do not care what the hon. the Minister does with the profits. I do not care whether he uses the profits to average out the expenses of the other departments. It would not work even if he did so anyway. I ask the Minister to be reasonable towards motorists on that particular point.</p>

<p>Then we heard quite a lot about the importance of Cape Town on the Cape sea route from Europe and America to the Far East. During the recess I visited Australia and the Far East and I only heard one complaint from the passengers, both American and English, who were on board ship and the Officers themselves. They speak very highly of our harbours, the hospitality they receive here and the courtesy they receive from the port officials. Everybody, however, wants to know why, if <span class="col_709-710" refersTo="page_0367"/>Cape Town is such an important port of call, it does not have a passenger terminal.</p>

<p>I notice that the jumbo jets are now flying regularly between America and England although they are only half full. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is prepared to tell us which airports in South Africa will be capable of catering for these large machines. We in Natal would like to know whether he intends building an airport for these machines in Natal, and if so, where and when. I think the public are entitled to know that.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) has not introduced much that is new into this debate. He has, however, introduced two quite interesting points. I notice that he has asked the hon. the Minister about conditions of heat and humidity in a grain elevator at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. This is a subject which was discussed quite fully last year and I have no doubt at all that if he refers to Hansard he will get a reply to his question. Then he introduced another unusual point. He has indicated that the hon. the Deputy Minister has risen twice in this debate. If the hon. member reads his parliamentary rules, I do not need to reply to that observation. Then he told us that he has wonderful powers of prediction. I can assure him that he will not need to use them on the 22nd April. He can ask anyone and they will tell him what the outcome will be. But, Mr. Speaker, he then went on and indicated that the position on the Railways would have been better had the United Party remained in power. What utter nonsense! That party is so confused that the Railways would have collapsed by now had they been in power.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River stood up and the first thing he did in his speech was to make excuses for an impassioned plea by the hon. member for Yeoville to the Minister, not to be put off by the presence of the Hertzog group in this House and to employ more non-Whites on the Railways. I want to ask these gentlemen, have they made up their minds what their policy is towards the employment of non-Whites on the Railways? In 1964 when I backed up the employment of Indian shunters by the hon. the Minister, I received a pill. It was dated the 5th November, 1964. This is what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Harry,</block>

<p>If the <i>Mercury</i> did not carry a correct report about Indian shunters, I think we should correct it. It has caused deep concern to members of the executive and, of course, is not United Party policy in its published form.</p>

<p>Sincerely, Douglas E. Mitchell.</p>

<p>I wondered myself what the United Party policy was. So I phoned the hon. member for Yeoville in Johannesburg. He said: &#x201C;You go on and you get all the publicity of that type and have the newspapers quote it for us. We love it.&#x201D; So here one found a conflict in 1964, and the conflict is still there now. And that does not only apply to the employment of non-Whites by the Railways.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River also said that he was sorry that the hon. the Minister had rejected the recommendations of the Marais Commission <i>in toto.</i> Of course, the hon. the Minister did not do that at all.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that those two gentlemen who base their objections on the fact that the commisssion had in fact gone beyond its terms of reference, are quite right. What we are dealing with here, is not a question of the co-ordination of transport in South Africa, which was the main objective of this commission; we are dealing here with the denationalization and the distribution of national transport right through the private sector. Is this not against the whole spirit of the original legislation at the time of Union which brought the transport set-up into being? Is it exactly the same set up? Is it exactly the same spirit? Realizing the difficulties of our country, our system of transport was obviously designed to develop this vast land of ours and to give transport, both economic and uneconomic, to the people who required it in our land. If we hand it to private enterprise, they would naturally want the economic transport. They could not be blamed for that. They are businesses which have to show a profit. But if they are given the economic transport which pays them profits and gives their shareholders dividends, what happens to the requirments of the other man whose traffic bears no profit? What happens about that? Who carries the burden of that? Does it go directly to the tax <span class="col_711-712" refersTo="page_0368"/>payer, or is it distributed through the whole transport system of this country? I believe that the commission&#x2019;s recommendations, had the Minister accepted them, would have destroyed the whole principle underlying our transport structure in South Africa. It would have replaced it, according to the chairman of this commission himself, with a system of private monopoly; because one, or two or half a dozen companies could not possibly under any circumstances cope with the transport requirements of South Africa. They could not capitalize it, apart from anything else. I think that without the necessary knowledge, without the necessary statistics, which I believe the commission more or less indicated that they did not have, this commission was about to do a very dangerous thing for South Africa in recommending what they recommended.</p>

<p>I believe, on going through this report, that one of the main reasons for them making the recommendations, especially in the case of harbours, was the evidence led by the shipping committee of the Durban Chamber of Commerce. This committee is headed by Mr. Ronald Butcher, whom I think we all know. He sat in this House. Mr. Ronald Butcher, we all know too, has pushed for this move in relation to harbours for many years. It is on record.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That is why you supported him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>He was not in this House when I introduced this subject. He had already gone. Mr. Butcher reported to the congress of the Associated Chambers of Commerce. His talk was entitled &#x201C;Reorganized transport. Airways, Harbours and Railways should be administered separately&#x201D;. He recommended that, we know, in 1952. He has been pushing it very hard up to this moment. I believe it was on the evidence which he presented that this Marais Commission made their decision to recommend the separation of these three departments. Mr. Butcher has for long&#x2014;we all know this; it is not secret&#x2014;represented private interests who have a lot to do with the harbours. We know that he is one who recommended that private hauliers should be allowed into Durban harbour, a position different from anywhere else in the country, to do the private cartage from the harbour to the various people who use the goods that pass through the harbour. But it doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that the interests which he represents are also the interests of the ordinary man of South Africa, the man for whom our whole transport system and our harbours function. I think to a large extent the fears of his committee are based upon the revolution which has taken place in transport, not only in South Africa, but throughout the world to-day. We have it here. We have it in articles that have been written. There is one which appeared in one of the trade journals which expresses the fear that the Government will take over all transport. It also expresses the fear that with the change in emphasis, where air is taking over sea passengers and air freight is taking over from sea freight everybody is going to be excluded and that the Government will have the monopoly. Surely this Parliament has control over that. Parliament controls the transport system of this country and it is operated for the benefit of the people of South Africa. As I see it at the moment I have no doubts that it will continue to be run for the benefit of the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>Another difficulty, I believe the Durban Chamber of Commerce has, is that they are afraid that Durban harbour will lose its status as the leading commercial harbour in South Africa, to Richard&#x2019;s Bay. They believe that the hon. the Minister obviously has plans which will take everything away from Durban and site it at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. I am rather surprised that they have this fear because they have had many assurances. First they had the assurance of the hon. the Minister. He told them what the purpose was for establishing Richard&#x2019;s Bay, Then in the <i>South African Digest</i> of 12th September, 1969, there was an article which said:</p>

<block name="quote">Richard&#x2019;s Bay&#x2019;s development would benefit the country&#x2019;s exports without reducing the commercial activity of Durban harbour, Mr. F. Jackson, technical consultant to the South African Railways, said in Empangeni recently.</block>

<p>They therefore have the assurance of Mr. Jackson as well who is the technical consultant and who knows the purpose for thich Richard&#x2019;s Bay is going to be established. It is rather interesting and I believe this underlying fear is one of the reasons for the type of evidence they gave. If you have read the harbour reports of the last two or three years you will find the thread of requests running through asking for exactly the same type of development in Durban harbour as has been requested for Richard&#x2019;s Bay. There has been a request which, perhaps, I originated for the widening of the entrance to Durban harbour and the deepening of the channel so that it could take super tankers, super bulk carriers and the like. I can also remember that many years ago the hon. the Minister pointed out that the deepening of Durban harbour is not the answer. The wharves had to be rebuilt and refaced and the sheds moved. It is not only a question of dredging. It is a far more economic proposition to supply the type of requirement envisaged for Richard&#x2019;s Bay in a completely new harbour than trying to establish it in an old harbour where the basic facilities do not already exist. I believe this hon. Minister was right when he said that and I believe the saving in cost alone will make it worth while for South Africa to develop the new harbour. Anybody who knows anything about Durban harbour knows that for many years to come, Durban harbour can cope with all the demands which are going to be imposed on it. Durban harbour has a good draught and many berths. The hon. the Minister has already told us that <span class="col_713-714" refersTo="page_0369"/>work has already started on No. 2 pier and that the work on No. 1 pier has been completed. We also know that the cross berth is finished and that that berth is available for container traffic as soon as it is so required. I can see nothing that is going to detract from the value of Durban harbour for many years to come.</p>

<p>At the moment the scene is clouded by diverted ships. Are we to provide for something that might stop to-morrow? Who knows what the position with the Suez Canal is going to be? When I say &#x201C;to-morrow&#x201D; I mean a time in which the canal may be re-opened. Should the hon. the Minister spend the money of the public of South Africa to provide facilities under these circumstances? I think the attitude of the hon. the Minister is backed up by a report which appeared in <i>Fairplay</i> of the 25th April, 1968. I think anybody who knows shipping knows the magazine <i>Fairplay.</i> The heading of this report is: &#x201C;South Africa: Urgent need for giant repair dock&#x201D;, and it reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The closing of the Suez Canal has certainly boosted the ship repair business along the South African coast, so that, in the long term, envisaging the day when the canal is again in business, current conditions are perhaps not a true reflection of future prospects, suggesting that overseas interests should take a Tong hard look at the South African industry before investing heavily. On the other hand, the huge tankers now in commission and the even larger vessels that are being designed are craft that will never pass through the existing canal. The grounding of the Sivella outside Table Bay indicates that there is a pressing need for a repair dock along the South African coast to handle such colossal ships. Saldanha Bay, on the West Coast, is suggested as the most suitable site for a new dry dock large enough to accommodate the tankers likely to be built in the future which means that it should be large enough to take vessels of at least 500,000 tons.</block>

<p>This is one point I want to put to the hon. the Minister in passing. The hon. the Minister has given us the assurance that he will build a dry dock in Richard&#x2019;s Bay that will be able to take ships of up to 200,000 tons. Will he reconsider this in the light of the larger bulk carriers planned? The report goes on and states the following:</p>

<block name="quote">At the monthly lunch of the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce in March, 1968, Dr. T. F. Gaskell, a world authority on off-shore oil exploration and drilling, said: &#x201C;I wonder whether it is not about time someone built a big repair dock here that can cater for tankers; you could have an accident at any time.&#x201D; He said that about a hundred tankers too large for Suez would be coming round the Cape and a collision or some other accident could easily happen.</block>

<p>And so the report goes on. I do not want to read the whole of it, but it says that until there is some stability in the repair business along the South African coast one cannot expect ship repairers to carry stocks of standard size boiler tubes to fit all the ships that are coming round and it cannot be expected that all the facilities that are going to be necessary can be provided. This means that the Government will have to supply a suitable dry dock. Even then the hon. the Minister must be assured of some use for this dry dock. Surely, before he can go to the expense of building a dry dock which can accommodate vessels of up to 500,000 tons, he has to be assured that that dock is going to be supported and used and that at least some of the capital charges will be paid off so that it will not only be a liability to South Africa. The report states that there is a feeling in the local repair industry that there is no point in building up comprehensive reserve stocks against casual contracts. If tanker and other ship owners were definitely committed to the South African repair yards all the necessary spares would be carried, but as conditions are at present it seems that the system followed for many years will persist. I believe that this is largely the position that will persist as far as the hon. the Minister is concerned.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that the approach of this hon. Minister, to this problem of the development of the harbour, has been consistent and I believe that he is being proved to be correct. Thoughts on the new breeds of ships coming into the world shipping market are now beginning to crystallize. Basically I think there are two types, namely the container type ship which uses the roll-on roll-off system and the ordinary container type, as well as the &#x201C;lash&#x201D; type which does not need a harbour because it discharges its cargo of barges in deep water outside and these are towed in. Then there are the combination ships, which can take containers, vehicles, and so on. These are not such huge ships. The newest of these ships which has just completed its maiden voyage to Britain, built by the Cunard Line, displaces only 18,000 tons. This ship is one of the newest&#x2014;it is in fact the newest. The &#x201C;Atlantic Causeway&#x201D; can transport nearly 900 cars on wheels plus two deckloads of trailers and coaches or break-bulk cargo, plus 600 containers at a time. This is the type of ship we are going to see as this container traffic develops. We have had much bigger ships than that in our harbours and we will have bigger ones in future.</p>

<p>We have the <i>Mactra</i> in Durban at the moment. I think that is one type of ship with which Durban harbour and Cape Town harbour can easily cope. In any case the Marais Commission has suggested that coasters should handle the container traffic from those two bigger ports coastwise, to give them an opportunity. This might well be a good suggestion. There is a new type of container handling, where cargo is side discharged. This will not <span class="col_715-716" refersTo="page_0370"/>need all the expensive equipment for places like East London and Port Elizabeth and yet can give them the benefits of containerization. These ships will not need so many berths either. I see the latest record in Britain for the turn-around of a container ship is 10 hours. In 10 hours the ship was brought into the harbour, berthed, loaded and turned-around again. Therefore berths will be available for at least twice as many ships and sometimes more. Perhaps five times as many ships will be able to use the existing berths, as can use them at the moment, as a result of this quicker turn-around. The other type of ship will be the bulk carrier. For these types of ships the hon. the Minister is making provision at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. I do not believe that we should have too many of these types of harbours with the fantastic draughts, which have to be maintained and the specialized facilities which have to be used for this particular type of cargo carrier, whether it carries liquids, whether it carries ore, whether it carries grain or any other type of cargo. I believe that for many years to come Durban will be able to cope with the sugar traffic and it will also be able to cope with certain other bulk products. I believe that one&#x2019;s approach to these problems makes all the difference. If a journal wants to take an approach which is critical of the hon. the Minister they can adopt the approach which <i>Travel and Trade</i> adopts in a report on a visit from overseas of a certain Mr. Clarke headed &#x201C;U.K. containers expert warns and encourages South Africa&#x201D;. The <i>Natal Mercury</i> of the 22nd September, 1969, contains an article on the same visit under the heading &#x201C;Container moves by S.A. praised&#x201D; in which it is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African Railways had shown considerable foresight in preparing for a change-over to containerization, the chief agent in Europe for United Transport Overseas Limited said in Johannesburg yesterday.</block>

<p>Mr. H. H. Clarke is reported to have said that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There were indications that shipping lines had made approaches to the South African Government to containerize South Africa&#x2019;s external trade, and the Railways, which had ordered 120 containers to international standards, was ensuring that the country&#x2019;s internal transport and a containerized trade system would dovetail.</block>

<p>Here we have another reason in favour of the administration of our harbours being retained within the present set-up. Mr. Clarke is reported to have said that within two or three years there would be few non-containerized break-bulk cargoes on the North Atlantic trade routes and world container capacity was expected to increase by 40 per cent this year. He went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If South Africa does not change over, it could well be left out in the cold and not benefit from appreciably lower transport costs. In South Africa, like everywhere else, the cost of living is escalating and basic costs should be pegged where possible. By containerization, transport costs can be effectively stabilized.</block>

<p>He warned that containerization was not a remedy for all transport ills and said that the South African Government was wisely adopting a cautious attitude to this radical change. So, here South Africa is both warned and praised, depending entirely on one&#x2019;s approach. Of course, when you are in opposition you would like to run the Minister down whilst when you are in the Government you have to have a good look and state exactly what the position is. Here we have the difference in approach which I am trying to illustrate.</p>

<p>This, then, is the picture of South African harbours as I see it. The harbours of South Africa under the policy which is at present being applied, but we still have to continue looking to the future as we go along. They have coped with the industrial explosion of South Africa and in addition to that they have coped with the consequences of the Suez crisis, pushed upon us. The staff in our harbours have, under the present policy and despite the overloading of our harbours, coped with whatever was required of them. Although there were criticisms I think we ought still to be grateful towards this hon. Minister for having stood his ground and for getting on with his job in the efficient manner he has. Similarly, we have to be grateful towards his staff who have served South Africa so well. We have had it from the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) to-night that people have praised the services we offer in our harbours and the hospitality they have encountered from the staff in our harbours. As far as I am concerned, all thanks are due to the Minister and to his staff for the efficient manner in which they have discharged their responsibilities and I am glad that he took the decision he has taken not to divide the control over the Harbours, Airways and Railways.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, very recently in this House the hon. the Minister of Transport told the hon. member for Umlazi, when he had made an impassioned appeal for separate harbour authorities, that Mr. Butcher had made this his theme song for many years and that the hon. member for Umlazi was merely following what Mr. Butcher had said. One hardly can be expected to take with any sense of sincerity the attitude of the hon. member this evening in suddenly saying that he no longer stands for separate authorities for harbours. One can hardly be expected to accept with any sense of sincerity the attitude which the hon. member adopted this evening when he all of a sudden stated in relation to the hon. member for Durban <span class="col_717-718" refersTo="page_0371"/>that he no longer stood for a separate authority for the harbours. But what goes further and what staggers me, if I may use that word (Umlazi), is his attitude that whatever one says depends on what side of the House one is on. [Interjections.] Surely, Sir, that is a prostitution of what the duties of a member of Parliament ought to be, which is to say what he believes and not what he is expected to say because of the side of the House he happens to be on. [Interjections.] I believe in every word I say in this House. But let me go further and finish with the hon. member for Umlazi. I think it was in <i>Die Beeld</i> that I read a very interesting thing a while ago, something which correctly describes what has happened to the hon. member. There was an invitation: &#x201C;Kom julle Kapenaars; kom julle verligtes; kom Transvaal toe; ons sal julle liggies &#x2018;fuse&#x2019;&#x201D; That is what has happened to the hon. member for Umlazi under the influence of the Minister of Transport. The hon. member&#x2019;s speeches these days seem to be designed to find quotations to support the Government instead of, as he did before, spending his time finding quotations criticizing the Government.</p>

<p>I want to say that I agree with the remarks that have been made in this House, i.e. that this country is indeed fortunate in having such a high standard of service being rendered by the employees of our S.A.R. &amp; H. Administration. Being connected with the Cape Town Docks, I want to say that this applies to our dock personnel especially since we have had this tremendous build-up of traffic lately. But I wonder whether we pay sufficient regard to the corresponding responsibility which is imposed on us, and particularly on the hon. the Minister, to see to it that these people who have worked in this manner and have served the country in this manner under difficult circumstances, are assured of an adequate remuneration, and the best working circumstances that they are entitled to on account of their service to the country in this field. Now, Sir, I want to say also from this side of the House that I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on one matter. I want to congratulate him because he has had the courage to apply in the Harbours Administration those steps which we have advocated year in and year out to relieve the manpower shortage in the administration of the harbours in that he has taken into the employ of the Administration thousands and thousands of Bantu and other non-Whites to do jobs which were previously done by Whites, but not to replace them. I do not make that accusation. It is being done because the Whites are not there to do the work. I want to thank the hon. the Minister in all sincerity and one appreciates that he has taken that practical and realistic step. Particularly do we say that when on a recent occasion, when he was asked how he reconciled that with the policy of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, he replied across the floor of the House: &#x201C;Ask the Minister of Bantu Administration about his policy. I need the labour and I am going to get it.&#x201D; I say that we congratulate him because he is setting an example which we hope will be followed by the rest of the Cabinet in other spheres. But those are matters I must not deal with at the present moment.</p>

<p>I want to express some thanks to the hon. the Minister. When I came into this House on the first occasion in 1966, I raised certain staff matters with the hon. the Minister across the floor. I referred to certain problems, difficulties and grievances which were felt by workers in the Docks in Cape Town. There were certain problems in regard to senior wharfmen and inspectors and their rights of promotion. The hon. the Minister dealt with me as a new member of this House, he being a senior and a long experienced member, and he gave me some good advice. The first part I did not think was very good advice, but I took it from him. But he said this to me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These matters are generally raised by the relevant staff organizations with the Management and eventually they reach the Minister, and I think that is the best procedure to adopt in matters of this kind. Anyway, the hon. member has done his duty and he can at least go back and claim that he did raise this matter.</block>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that that was very good advice, but unfortunately it meant an increasing mail bag for me ever since I raised this matter, without having had to tell the workers, because they saw this. They have now decided that they should inform me of what these complaints are because I raised the matter and they were told by the hon. the Minister that it was a very good thing that they should communicate with me. I want to deal presently with some of the letters that I do receive. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that with all the protestations that we have that the Railway Service is a very happy service, with all the attempts by the hon. the Deputy Minister to say that up till 1948 there were terrible conditions and that they have now improved, I hope perhaps to disabuse the mind of the hon. the Minister, and this House in regard to those matters. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that this <i>laissez-faire</i> idea of just leaving matters to develop through the organization has gone on too long and is not satisfying the railway workers and the dock workers.</p>

<p>I think one of the most extraordinary somersaults done by the hon. the Minister is in connection with the means test for pensioners. In the year 1967 the hon. the Minister, when he was asked to abolish the means test for pensioners so that they could go and supplement their pensions without losing the allowance, said that it would be a ridiculous thing to do, quite unheard of, and that it would cost millions of rands. That was his statement in the House. That is how he pooh-poohed the suggestion from this side of the House. But as has happened so often, the following year he did exactly what we asked him <span class="col_719-720" refersTo="page_0372"/>to do. Then it was no longer a ridiculous suggestion. He did not do it in response to us the year before because it would have been too obvious that he was reacting to pressure from this side of the House. The following year it suddenly becomes a very reasonable request and it was to cost the country R700,000. How does the railway worker react when the Minister makes statements that this would cost millions, that it is a ridiculous suggestion, and in the next year there is a somersault when he brings in this particular relief and says that it will only cost R700,000? That is why I say that this idea of the hon. the Minister, although he is a very busy man, to leave these staff matters to come filtering through the various organizations, though the Management of the Railways to him, is resulting in injustices, in hardships and disgruntlement amongst numbers and numbers of workers on the Railways.</p>

<p>I say that the Minister has remained aloof. I say that there is too much of an easy acceptance of the arguments put forth, as by the hon. the Deputy Minister, that everything is so good. The following letter I received, dated 3rd February, from a Railways employee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek wil h&#x00EA; u moet met Minister Schoeman praat.</block>

<p>He goes on to explain how he is being treated and so much for the bad days before this Government came into power. He says in his letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In die jare 1940 was ons Spoorwe&#x00EB; baie beter as vandag, want ons groot koppe in die kantore het ons met raad bedien.</block>

<p>He has a number of grievances. I will give them to you. The position of this man, like many others, is the result of the method in which large groups of Railways employees are treated differently from other groups. The Minister says I cannot raise them in Parliament and I cannot discuss these across the floor of the House. What about the Employees&#x2019; Union? These letters are from members of the Employees&#x2019; Union, namely those on the monthly paid scale. These are employees such as train-drivers, checkers, storemen, stewards, catering staff, and carriage and wagon examiners. What are their conditions of employment? What are their leave privileges, for instance? What are their sick leave privileges? They have through their union made representations to come more into line with the administrative staff. But nothing is done for them. After they have done 20 years of service these people get 27 days&#x2019; leave per annum, as against the scales that apply in some other branches of the service of 35 and 40 days.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will because none of these railway employees are satisfied with any explanation they have had so far.</p>

<p>I now want to pass to another matter. Mr. Speaker, you know that each year you. in accordance with recommendations made, may appoint a select committee to deal with pension petitions which are presented to this House. That committee sits and then it receives petitions from various persons who feel that they have grievances or who feel that they are entitled to some special consideration because of special circumstances. We all know, as practical men, that no laws can cover all circumstances and all conditions. It is for this very reason that the select committee on pensions sits and is charged with investigating petitions and then making recommendations as to what should be done in regard to the specific petitioner. The committee receives evidence and receives reports and finally it comes to its recommendation. I must say that every department, with the exception of the Railways and Harbours Administration, reacts to the recommendations of the select committee. They react and relief is granted by this House to the petitioner. When the reports of the select committee come before this House, the House, according to custom, passes the recommendations over to the Railways Administration to dispose of them or to deal with them as they think best. In other words, no decision is taken by this House. As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, the matters are referred to the Administration. From my investigations it seems that very few, if any, of the recommendations of the Select Committee on Pensions are ever implemented by the Railways Administration. These recommendations are not lightly made. They are made because they are cases of hardship. These recommendations are made by the select committee of whom the majority of members are members from the Government side of the House as hon. members know, but now they are turned down with great alacrity, with great speed after they have been referred to the Administration by this House. The hon. the Deputy Minister last year moved that all the Railway pension petitions should be referred to the Administration. I want to ask whether the hon. the Deputy Minister or the hon. the Minister personally handles these matters at any stage after that. I hope the hon. the Minister will tell me because I want to deal with the position, and I think there is one particular case which should be dealt with. I mention this particular case because this man retired under very unfortunate circumstances from the Service. This is a gentleman, a good South African, who in 1934 enlisted in the South African armed forces. It was during peacetime that he joined the Permanent Force, he joined the Special Service Battalion at the age of 19. A little later he was transferred to the Permanent Force. From 1939 to 1945 he was on active service in various parts of the world in the artillery division. He served in South West Africa, the Middle East, Algiers and then he returned to South Africa. When he returned to South Africa in 1945, he notified the Defence Force on 27th August of that year that he would like to be discharged on 1st January, 1946. But within a matter of a month, while still serving with the armed forces, he applied for enlistment in the South African Railway and Harbour Police. He was accepted. So he left the armed forces on 1st January, 1946 and he entered the employment of the South African Railway and Harbour Police on the same day. In his service subsequently he attained the rank of detective-sergeant. He has been awarded the good conduct medal and by private study he attained his National Senior Certificate. During the course of his service while on duty he sustained certain injuries which were originally assessed at 15 per cent. He has now been re-boarded and has been required to retire from the Service of the Railways Administration. This matter was referred to the select committee. The select committee found that there was one thing which this unfortunate person did wrong. He posted the wrong letter first. Had he written to the Railways to apply for a job in the Railway Police before he wrote his letter of resignation to the Defence Force, there would have been no difficulty at all, and his service from 1934 to <span class="col_723-724" refersTo="page_0374"/>1946 would have been recognized. However, because he wrote, or posted the wrong letter first, he has now lost that service time for pension purposes. He is retired now as a disabled person who has served his country during times of war and who has served in the Railway Police with distinction. I think this was an injustice, but I heard that the Department had turned his petition down. I therefore wrote to the hon. the Minister. I said that I hoped he would forgive me for writing to him personally, but when he had read the details I was sure he would be satisfied that a grave injustice had been done to this person. What did I get back? I got a letter from the administrative secretary which I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a decision not to implement the recommendation of the Select Committee on Pensions that Mr. Moolman&#x2019;s service from 26th Jaunary, 1934, to 1st January, 1946, with the South African Permanent Force service should be regarded as pensionable service with the South African Railways, was in fact taken by the Government and not the Railway Administration, you will appreciate that the Minister is unable to assist you in this matter which in any event cannot be resuscitated at this juncture.</block>

<p>Without abusing the processes of Parliament, I want to say that as far as I am concerned, this man is entitled to put this petition and to renew it from year to year until he gets justice from the Railways and Harbours Administration.</p>

<p>That just evidences my complaint to the hon. the Minister. I know he has a big department; I know that he does not want to split it up into separate controls for the Railways and the Airways and the Harbours, but these things which the hon. the Minister should be advised of are apparently not reaching him. I know the difficulties, but they are no answer to the employees in the Railways. It is no answer to them to know that somewhere along the line they are being treated in such a way that they are not getting the justice which they deserve. The hon. the Minister asked what this man&#x2019;s complaint was. I shall read it to him. This is the person who said that I should speak to the hon. the Minister. He says that he was transferred. He went to the Paul Sauer Building to discuss his transfer to Cape Town. When talking about the official he spoke to there, he says: &#x201C;Hy was baie onbeskof.&#x201D; He then uses some rather strong language which I should perhaps not read out. He goes on to point out the difference in the treatment which the working man in the Railways is getting now and the treatment he used to get in the years of the United Party Administration.</p>

This is the way in which people are treated within the Service. The hon. the Minister and those who support him in his party must not be surprised when they find that they no longer have the political support of the workers in the South African Railways and Harbours. They are not the only people in South Africa who are no longer prepared to support this Government.</p>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the United Party believes that the Railway people will have confidence in them, their disappointment after 22nd April is going to be acute. We have been sitting here the whole afternoon listening to the arguments of hon. members of the Opposition. However, we have in reality heard no criticism of the steps the Railways are taking. The only criticism expressed was in regard to trifling matters which could very easily be solved on an administrative level. I do not think the United Party believes that railway workers have so much confidence in them that they will appoint them as spokesmen to the Minister of Transport. I believe the exact opposite. The railway people for whom they raised so many pleas this afternoon have their spokesmen who negotiate with the Minister and the General Management of the South African Railways as far as salaries and conditions of service are concerned. I do not think they have any confidence in the hon. members of the Opposition in this House to do it on their behalf.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point read out a letter written to him by a railwayman. Even before he read out this letter he was already saying that all these people were dissatisfied. If I were to inform the hon. member to-night that there are at least two veterans sitting in the Opposition benches who are extremely dissatisfied with the leadership of the United Party, he would be unable to deny it, but this does not give me any reason to say that all the members of the United Party are dissatisfied. Those exceptional cases we will most certainly find. I think the Minister has a tremendous amount of sympathy with those exceptional cases. There are also many of those cases that simply cannot be helped. I believe that the Minister always has a sympathetic ear for everyone in the employ of the South African Railways.</p>

<p><span class="col_725-726" refersTo="page_0375"/>However, there is one thing which I do not want to allow to go unanswered to-night. That is the blatant way in which the United Party has tried to canvass votes with the very tragic incident which recently occurred. Reference has already been made to this by this side of the House. After the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport had gone into this matter very thoroughly, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) saw fit to launch another attack, an attack which was very clearly aimed at canvassing votes for the United Party out of this unfortunate incident. As was already said this afternoon, we are all shocked at what happened. We have every sympathy with those who are affected. However, it is not only the parents of the children who died in that accident who are affected. The schools are affected. The South African Railways is affected. The Transvaal Department of Education is also affected by this. We have deep sympathy with all these persons and bodies, but we also welcome the steps which have already been taken, and which will in future be taken, to eliminate incidents of this kind, if it were ever possible, so that they could eliminate them entirely. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) is the last person who ought to forget a thing like this, but he forgot this afternoon that one always has to take into account the human element. Whatever measures one takes to eliminate accidents one will always have to take into account the human element. This is deplorable, and that they should seize upon this matter in order to try to canvass votes was clear proof of the political bankruptcy of the United Party</p>

<p>Sir, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister this evening because he has not yet, as is in fact the case with the United Party, given way to the temptation of using the Railways organization for political gain. The speech made yesterday afternoon by the hon. the Minister is typical of a man who is dedicated to rendering service to South Africa. He is a man who is dedicated to utilizing a service organization in the interests of South Africa and also in the interests of those who are in the employ of that organization. Throughout the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s career as Minister of Transport he has continually refused to make concessions which would bring political benefits to the National Party. His primary consideration has always been whether it was in the national interests to take a certain decision. That was to him always the most important consideration. Hand in hand with the interests of the country the hon. the Minister has always had a sympathetic ear for these people who are responsible for the Railways rendering this service to South Africa. He has never yet had an unsympathetic ear for them.</p>

<p>On the contrary, he has always looked after the interests and the welfare of these people. Continually, and consistently, he has always said that when the financial position of the Railways allows, he will always give consideration to the review of wages and salaries. This he has always done. This, I maintain, bears the stamp of a man who will not give way to political pressure, and who does not do things which will allow the Party he represents here in the House of Assembly to derive benefit from, but who regards the national interests and the interests of the people in the employ of that organization as his most important consideration. For that, we owe him a vote of thanks. On that, I want to congratulate him to-night. The speech made here by the hon. the Minister bears the stamp of willingness to serve, growth and willingness to keep pace with that growth and to ensure that the service will always be rendered to the best of their ability. This is in contrast to the speech made by the hon. member for Hillbrow who was quite unable to make any positive contribution, but who in fact revealed an irresponsible attitude here by detracting from that which was being done and then pleading for concessions where concessions could be made. I found it really astonishing to hear how they carried on here about concessions in respect of salaries and wages while they omitted to mention how this should be done. I think it is necessary for us to refer here tonight to the transport services under the control of United Party controlled municipalities.</p>

<p>I want to dwell for a moment to-night on what is happening in Johannesburg where there is also a kind of miniature transport service which is controlled by the United Party controlled Municipality of Johannesburg. In this little booklet which they had published, they make all kinds of promises. They also speak of matters they envisage in respect of transport services. We as the taxpayers of Johannesburg have been waiting for many years now for them to do something in Johannesburg in order to improve those transport services and bring them to where they can, in the true sense of the word, render service to the taxpayers of Johannesburg. They speak here of a service which must be remunerative, and of transport systems which will be able to provide transport on an economic basis. In Johannesburg the transport service runs at a tremendous loss every year. This loss is simply transferred to the taxpayers. It is recovered from the taxpayers of Johannesburg. This is in contrast to what they have been pleading for all afternoon here in respect of the South African Railways. Now I want to put a question in this regard this evening. If it were to happen that the South African Railways were to run at such a tremendous loss, I want to ask them how they would recover this from the taxpayers if they are always talking here about decreased taxation. If one makes a <i>pro rata</i> comparison, these losses would run into millions of rand. They state in this booklet: &#x201C;We shall see to it that the profits on the operation of the pipeline are not exorbitant, but are kept on approximately the same level as profits on road transport.&#x201D; They also say: &#x201C;We will build national roads to keep pace with the growing economy and to increase the contribution by the Government <span class="col_727-728" refersTo="page_0376"/>to the National Road Fund.&#x201D; They want to increase contributions to the National Road Fund. They want to reduce tariffs on the pipeline. Then they want to introduce a transport service which will be profitable! I maintain that they are unable to do so, for in the Johannesburg Municipality they are unable to do so. Then they recover their losses from the taxpayers. In this case they will do the same.</p>

<p>The other aspect I want to mention here in this connection, is the following. This afternoon they offered a solution here to the manpower shortage on the Railways. On the one hand they spoke about wages which should be made attractive enough to draw people to the Railways. This is stated in the first paragraph of this booklet. The problem in Johannesburg is a shortage of workers. I am asking hon. members of the Opposition to-night why they do not offer wages in Johannesburg which will attract the workers needed to keep that transport service of theirs in operation? If they can offer wages on the South African Railways to eliminate the manpower shortage on the Railways, why are they unable to do so in their own transport service in Johannesburg?</p>

<p>But that is not all. I have never heard of the hon. the Minister of Transport having to cancel afternoon services in Johannesburg and of trains having to remain stationary because he did not have the necessary manpower to operate those trains, so that the passengers then had to go by foot to their destinations. But this is a daily occurrence in Johannesburg, where the United Party Municipality is in control. They cancel as many as a hundred bus services in the afternoon. Then the people must themselves find a means of getting home. They are the people who acted so piously here this afternoon and stated how they would control the Railways when they come into power. They cannot even control those few buses in Johannesburg. How can they control the South African Railways, the Airways and the Harbours? These people must first sweep in front of their own door before attacking in this House a man who has rendered service to South Africa like the hon. the Minister of Transport and the way in which he is doing his work. But in Johannesburg people queue up in the afternoons and then the report comes through that the services have been cancelled because there is insufficient staff to operate those buses.</p>

<p>Sir, but that is not all. We know that their main purpose is&#x2014;and that is why they are putting forward pleas here&#x2014;to have the colour bar abolished, and to staff the Railways with non-Whites. That is what they are busy doing in Johannesburg. That is why they have approached the Minister of Labour and asked for permission to employ Coloureds and Bantu on the buses which convey Whites in Johannesburg. I want to inform the United Party to-night that when we go to the polls, to the political platform to discuss our transport services in South Africa, I warn them not to appear on a platform in Johannesburg. That is probably the one reason why the hon. member for Yeoville has not made himself available for election in Langlaagte. If he has as much influence among the railway people as he tried to give out here this afternoon, and as the hon. member for Green Point tried to pretend, then he must not make himself available for election in Yeoville where there are no railway people: he must make himself available for election in Langlaagte where these people live. Then I would be prepared to meet him there. Then we can draw comparisons between the service which is being rendered by this National Party Government under the guidance of the hon. the Minister of Transport, and that which is being rendered by the United Party controlled Municipality of Johannesburg to the public of that city. Let them first ensure that they are rendering an efficient service in Johannesburg. We must take the comparison further. In Johannesburg they are dealing with the conveyance of passengers, and with the conveyance of passengers only.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Transport and his staff, on the other hand, are dealing with the conveyance of all goods. I should like to know how that hon. member, who is now laughing so heartily, would feel if he, returning tired after a long day at work, had to stand in a queue for a bus home only to hear that the service had been cancelled because the men to operate those buses were not available. Then they are the people who claim that they will attract more people to the Railways with higher wages and at the same time are going to reduce other tariffs! In Johannesburg, however, they have increased the tariffs consistently every year. and have still shown losses every year. These losses were then recovered from the taxpayers. They have never vet succeeded in rendering the service which is really essential. I think the difference is that South Africa at present has a Minister of Transport whose source of strength is nationalism and patriotism. He therefore weighs up every decision in the interests of the country. In contrast to this, is the United Party that rejects nationalism and patriotism. It is for this reason that the United Party will never become inspired to render service to South Africa. For that reason too, they will continue to dwindle as a political factor in South Africa until they eventually disappear completely. I want to make the assertion that after 22nd April their ranks will once again have been thinned out considerably. Their ranks will have been thinned out because they conduct themselves in such a derogatory manner in this House in regard to the affairs of people who are rendering good and loyal service to South Africa, <i>inter alia,</i> the staff of the South African Railways. The speech made by the hon. member for Yeoville in this House yesterday bears the stamp of irresponsibility, because he tried to prescribe to the railwayman here that he should be dissatisfied and that he should not take the interests of the country <span class="col_729-730" refersTo="page_0377"/>into consideration. It is a good thing to-day that we have men on the Railways who, in the same way as the hon. the Minister, are dedicated to rendering services in the interests of South Africa. If this were not the case they would have done what the hon. member for Yeoville wanted them to do and then they would have proceeded to be irresponsible, which would eventually have crippled our transport system. However, these people are as responsible as the hon. the Minister and the General Management of the South African Railways, and that is why they will not allow themselves to be led by the United Party and its fallacious arguments. And that is also the reason why the railway workers are doing the opposite of what the people of the Johannesburg bus transport service are doing, people who are leaving the service in droves so that it is then necessary to say that the staff with which to supply the necessary bus services is not available. The National Party and the hon. the Minister of Transport do not hawk the difficult position of the railwaymen about in order to catch votes, for this is something which has to do with a service which must be rendered to South Africa. Under the guidance of the hon. the Minister the railway workers are also dedicated to keep on rendering service, despite the many problems with which they have to contend, in order to place the transportation system in South Africa in a position where it can remain in continual operation and render the service the public expects from it. I challenge the United Party tonight to mention one case where the transportation system in South Africa has been unable to render the service the public expected from it. This we owe to a dedicated Minister, a man who has been serving this portfolio for many years, the man who lifted the Railways out of the doldrums and built it up to be the pride of South Africa. On 22nd April the railway workers will take the lead in paying tribute and expressing gratitude to Ben Schoeman. our respected Minister of Transport in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened with great interest to the hon. member for Langlaagte. I was not sure whether he was making an election speech to-night for the 22nd of April, 1970 or for the Johannesburg municipal election in some two years&#x2019; time. He referred to the United Party&#x2019;s policy as that of eliminating the colour bar. He knows perfectly well that that is completely untrue. That has never been the policy of this side of the House. What I do know is that there are more non-Whites in the employ of the South African Railways to-day under the hon. the Minister of Transport than there have ever been in the history of South Africa. I also know that there are 64,000 White salaried workers in the South African Railways who are earning a basic salary of less than R200 per month. It has often been said in this House that the members of the governing party have lost touch with the electorate. If ever there was evidence of the governing party having lost touch with the electorate, then we have heard it here in the course of this debate to-day. That hon. member has challenged us on this side of the House to mention any aspect in the Railway Service which is not satisfactory. I should like to deal with that part of the Administration with which I am most familiar. I should like to deal with the suburban service here in the Peninsula. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that whereas the suburban areas are growing apace the number of trains serving those areas seem to be getting fewer. If I may give an example, between Simonstown and Cape Town during the peak-hour traffic that serves the naval base which is growing fast and the residential area that is also growing very fast, only six trains are operating between 4.15 in the afternoon and 7 o&#x2019;clock. Only one of them expresses through a few stations. The rest are all-station trains. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that if he were to go down to Simonstown at that time of the afternoon, he would find the most appalling traffic congestion because the dockyard workers, naval personnel and other civilian employees in the navy are unable to use the completely inadequate train service. From Cape Town itself to the south there is likewise&#x2014;and I have drawn attention to this in this House before&#x2014;an inadequate number of trains at peak hours. It seems to be thought sometimes that the seaside areas are only pleasure resorts and holiday areas. In fact, they are mainly residential areas and a vast number of people live there these days. Recently I asked a question. Stations south of Lakeside alone cater for 53,000 season ticket-holders. The hon. the Minister last year referred to a survey of the peak hour traffic on the suburban lines which is held from time to time. I should like to ask him when the survey was last taken and whether the survey perhaps recommended that there should be an increase in the number of trains between Cape Town and Simonstown and between Simonstown and Cape Town. I should also like to ask him about a matter to which I referred in this House before, namely the question of the jolting and the jarring of the trains. I know that gave the hon. the Minister and his Administration considerable cause for concern over a number of years in view of the complaints that were made about the unsatisfactory conditions in the trains, in so far as jolting and jarring was concerned. There has since been an adjusted mechanism. As far as I can see, there is an improvement. However, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is satisfied that everything has been done to make that service more comfortable than it has been. Now I should like to draw his attention to a situation which can be very dangerous for users of the trains, particularly those who are young and those that are elderly. I now refer to the opening and closing of the doors. The system is not working well and I have seen elderly people <span class="col_731-732" refersTo="page_0378"/>trapped in the doors when the doors should have been released and <i>vice versa.</i></p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the stations and some of the problems which the suburban line users experience on those stations. The hon. the Minister said in reply to a question of mine some time ago that the station clocks on the suburban lines had been eliminated on account of excessive expenditure. I think he referred to maintenance expenditure. I should like to ask him whether it is not possible, at least on the more important stations, for these station clocks to be replaced.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the state of the subways. Most of the stations in the southern suburbs are served with a subway. The unhygienic conditions in those subways are to be seen to be believed. The cleansing staff does not seem to be adequate on those stations and there certainly does not seem to be sufficient patrol work done by the Railway Police in order to deal with the number of loiterers around our suburban line station subways.</p>

<p>And then, Mr. Speaker, there is another matter, namely the inadequate plumbing in the stations. The toilets for both men and women in many of those stations are in a most shocking condition. It is appalling to think that ladies particularly have to use toilets in the condition in which they are so often found. I have myself inspected many of these toilets and other facilities at the stations, such as waiting rooms. They are absolutely indescribable at times. I have made an offer to the hon. the Minister and to the System Manager that at any time convenient to any members of the staff I would be more than happy to take them along and to show them the facilities about which I am complaining. I repeat this offer now.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I should like to mention and that is the closing of the ticket Offices at some of the suburban line stations over weekends. I wonder if it is not possible for those Offices to be kept open, particularly during the season, when there are so many people using those trains.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of parking areas. I referred earlier to the phenomenal growth that is taking place in the Southern Peninsula; the number of people who use the trains and the greater number who would like to use the trains who come to the stations in their cars but are unable to find adequate parking facilities. Simonstown, for example, which I would have thought was a particularly important station because of its use by dockyard and naval men has no parking facilities at all, and yet the buses and cars and passengers are expected to use the very inadequate area that comprises station property at Simonstown. I should like to ask him in connection with Simonstown whether the road widening scheme in the approach to Simonstown will involve the demolition of some of the Railway houses on the main road, and if so, where he has planned to resite those houses. Will they be resited in Simonstown or will they be resited on Railway ground elsewhere in the southern Peninsula? I know that a number of the Railway people in those houses are most anxious to know if their houses are to be demolished and where they are to go. At Fish Hoek there is a parking area run by the municipality. It was taken over by the municipality from the Railways. That area is unfortunately also proving to be inadequate. More people are using the trains at Fish Hoek than ever before. Non-White and white townships have recently been established and are still being established on the fringes and the outskirts offish Hoek and I am wondering whether the hon. the Minister can perhaps go into that matter to see if it is not possible to make available more of the surplus land that exists around the shunting yard area at Fish Hoek for parking purposes. Then at Kalk Bay too there is an inadequate parking area. There is an old and redundant shunting area and I should like to suggest that the hon. the Minister makes available some of that land for parking purposes. At St. James station the road approach to the back of the station is in a most shocking condition. There are potholes and I would like to warn the hon. the Minister there are a number of elderly people who use the trains from that station. If they twist their ankles in those potholes there are going to be substantial claims against the Railways. At Muizenberg station there is no public parking facility whatsoever. Although the surplus Railway land in that area is admittedly very small, some of it could be made available for public parking. At Lakeside sufficient land is available and the parking area can certainly be extended and resurfaced. At Steenberg there is a large non-White complex. I think plans have been on the drawing boards of the Railways for a long time for a new station to cope with the numbers of people using the station. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what stage has been reached in the planning for the new Steenberg station. The same applies to Retreat. These areas, Steenberg and Retreat in particular, have expanded as non-White group areas. At Retreat there is a most extraordinary situation in that half of the railway houses are in the non-White area across the railway line. I have drawn the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this before. Vast numbers of non-Whites who live in this area go through the streets and past the houses of the white railway men who live next to the station. This gives a considerable amount of cause for friction. I think it is now time that those houses were resited in the white area of Retreat where there is plenty of land available to the Railways to build upon.</p>

<p>The next question I would like to raise, is the question of level crossings. Over the last three years I have asked the hon. the Minister questions in regard to the elimination of <span class="col_733-734" refersTo="page_0379"/>crossings on the suburban line and the most recent answer he has given me, disclosed that there are five level crossings south of Lakeside station and eight to the north side of Lakeside station. Of those south of Lakeside station I have recently drawn the attention of the Minister to the level crossing at Fish Hoek. I would like to thank him for the courtesy he has shown me when I put through a long-distance call to discuss this matter with him at very short notice. I know he specially made himself available and that he had left a meeting to talk to me. However, the Minister has ignored pleas by myself and by the local municipality for the elimination of that very dangerous crossing. I do not have to tell him that the south-easterly wind blows very strongly across the Fish Hoek beach and that the bells are completely inadequate and no safeguard to the users of that very busy intersection. There have been fatalities there and I am afraid that there will be further fatalities at any time unless flashing lights are installed immediately. I believe there are investigations being made but it seems that these investigations are taking a very long time. At any rate, until such time as flashing lights can be installed, surely the Minister can see to the employment of a flagman at this very busy level crossing. There are other problems in regard to level crossings elimination in other areas as well. At Muizenberg there is a level crossing, at Lakeside another one and at False Bay there is a very busy level crossing. The Minister has in reply to my questions some years ago indicated that that crossing would be eliminated in terms of section 4 of the Level Crossings Act of 1960. As far as I know, section 4 of this Act provides for the Railways Administration to eliminate level crossings at its own cost. In terms of section 6, however, I believe the Railways pay some 75 per cent of the cost of eliminating level crossings. In 1968 those crossings in the area were to be eliminated in terms of section 4 of the Act, which means that the Railways Administration would bear the complete cost. This year, however, it seems from the response to questions that these crossings are only to be eliminated in terms of section 6 of the Act. In other words, it is likely that the delay will increase even more. This is intolerable.</p>
