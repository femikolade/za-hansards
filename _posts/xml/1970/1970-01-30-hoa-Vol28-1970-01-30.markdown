<heading>STATE PRESIDENT&#x2019;S ADDRESS</heading>

<p>Mr. SPEAKER stated that at the opening ceremony he had received a copy of the State President&#x2019;s Address to members of the Senate and of the House of Assembly, which was in the following terms:</p>

<p>Meneer die President en Lede van die Senaat:</p>

<p>Meneer die Speaker en Lede van die Volks-raad:</p>

<p>I am glad to welcome you to this the Fifth Session of the Third Parliament of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Gedurende die afgelope jaar het die Regering voortgegaan om vriendskaplike verhoudinge met die buitew&#x00EA;reld te versterk en uit te bou. Met hierdie doel voor o&#x00EB; het verskeie Ministers besoeke aan die buiteland afgel&#x00EA; en vrugbare samesprekings met lede van regerings en ander instansies gevoer, asook verdere nuttige kontakte aangeknoop. Dit word verwelkom dat ook heelwat Ministers en ander amptelike besoekers vanuit verskillende dele van die w&#x00EA;reld, insluitende Afrika, die Republiek besoek het.</p>

<p>Die toename in wetteloosheid wat oogluikend in verskeie dele van die w&#x00EA;reld toegelaat word, skep groeiende kommer vir die internasionale gemeenskap. Dit is te hope dat tydige ferme optrede deur gesaghebbende instansies hierdie gevaarlike tendens spoedig die nek sal inslaan.</p>

<p>In Vi&#x00EB;tnam duur die oorlog en die daarmee gepaard gaande ellende voort. Hopelik sal die pogings van die Verenigde State van Amerika om &#x2019;n eerbare oplossing te vind, met sukses bekroon word.</p>

<p>Die vooruitsigte op &#x2019;n blywende skikking in die Midde-Ooste bly steeds skraal, en die toename in terrorisme en die ooglopende aanmoediging daarvan deur sekere lande is besig om die toestand gaandeweg te laat versleg.</p>

<p>Die treurspel in Biafra sal nog jare lank sy donkere skadu oor Afrika werp. Dringend roep dit om die skepping van &#x2019;n gees van realisme wat kennis neem van die werklikhede van Afrika, asook van die wyse waarop toegelaat word dat die Kommunisme sy greep verstewig.</p>

<p>In Afrika is daar die afgelope jaar weer eens goeie vordering met die uitbou van ons verhoudings met ons bure en ander state gemaak. Die tolunie-onderhandelinge met Botswana, Lesotho en Swaziland is bevredigend afgesluit. Samewerking op tegniese en ekonomiese gebied met state in Afrika en elders is verder uitgebrei.</p>

<p>In Suidwes-Afrika is die algemene vooruitgang op bevredigende wyse gehandhaaf. Die Regering het ook weer eens sy vasberadenheid beklemtoon om voort te gaan om die verskillende groepe inwoners op die weg van selfbeskikking tot vooruitgang, vrede en stabiliteit te lei.</p>

<p>Die toenemende bedrywignede van die Sowjetvloot in oseane waar hy nie vantevore gesien is nie, is onrusbarend. Met die oog op die beveiliging van die seeroetes, het die Regering herhaaldelik die aandag op hierdie nuwe ontwikkeling gevestig, en dit word vertrou dat die lande van die vrye w&#x00EA;reld realisties daarop sal reageer. Aangesien dit baie onwaarskynlik is dat die Suezkanaal in die nabye toekoms heropen sal word, is die Suid-Atlantiese seeroetes van toenemende belang vir die w&#x00EA;reldhandel en strategie.</p>

<p>Die afgelope jaar is gekenmerk deur &#x2019;n toestand van rustigheid en vrede in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika en in Suidwes-Afrika, alhoewel dit nog nodig was om eenhede van die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie op die noordelike grens van Suidwes-Afrika, in die Caprivi en op die noordelike grens van Rhodesi&#x00EB; te ontplooi om die moontlikheid van terroriste-insypeling die hoof te bied.</p>

<p>Die Suid-Afrikaanse Weermag gaan onverpoos voort om sy slagvaardigheid op land, ter see en in die lug uit te bou ten einde enige vorm van milit&#x00EA;re aggressie wat moontlik teen die Republiek gepleeg kan word, die hoof te bied. Onkonvensionele oorlogvoering geniet besondere aandag. Daar word terde&#x00EB; besef dat Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n strategiese posisie beklee op een van die belangrikste seeroetes van die w&#x00EA;reld.</p>

<p>Die inligtingstaak in die buiteland word in toenemende mate onderskraag deur private organisasies en individue wat hulle met geesdrif wy aan die bevordering van Suid-Afrika se beeld.</p>

<p>Soveel sukses is reeds behaal deur invloedryke persone uit verskillende lande as staatsgaste te nooi, dat hierdie program verder uitgebou sal word.</p>

<p>In die afgelope jaar het die Republiek weer eens &#x2019;n groeiende toeristeverkeer geniet.</p>

<p>Die getal toeriste vanuit Europa en die Amerika&#x2019;s het met ongeveer twaalf persent bo di&#x00E9; van die vorige jaar gestyg.</p>

<p>Die Ekonomiese Adviesraad van die Eerste Minister het gedurende 1969 ook <span class="col_5-6" refersTo="page_0015"/>ondersoek ingestel na die toeristebedryf in Suid-Afrika met die oog op die moontlike rasionalisering en bevordering van die bedryf. Daar word vertrou dat die resultaat van die ondersoek sal bydra tot die gesonde en doelgerigte ontwikkeling van die bedryf in landsbelang.</p>

<p>Die strewe van die owerheid om inflasie te beteuel is gedurende die afgelope jaar met &#x2019;n groot mate van sukses bekroon. en verbruikers- en groothandelspryse het slegs matige stygings getoon. Om hierdie rede en weens die afname in die toevloei van buitelandse kapitaal was dit moontlik om die beperkings op bankkrediet in in mate te verslap. Die ekonomie bly egter baie likied en aangesien baie tekens van &#x2019;n versnelde groeikoers tans te bespeur is, word geen verdere algemene verslapping van kredietbeheer nou raadsaam geag nie.</p>

<p>Na die buitengewoon vinnige styging van aandelepryse gedurende die eerste vyf maande van 1969 het hierdie pryse aansienlik gedaal. Hierdie daling het egter geensins die werklike koers van die ekonomie weerspie&#x00EB;l nie wat nog steeds deur toenemende produksie en werkverskaffing gekenmerk word.</p>

<p>As gevolg van toenemende invoere en verminderde netto invloeiing van kapitaal het die Republiek se reserwes aan goud en buitelandse valuta in die afgelope maande afgeneem, maar hulle bly nog op &#x2019;n bevredigende peil.</p>

<p>Na uitgerekte onderhandelinge is die onsekerheid in verband met die bemarking van Suid-Afrikaanse goud uit die weg geruim. Ingevolge &#x2019;n besluit van die Internasionale Monet&#x00EA;re Fonds is die Republiek daarvan verseker dat hy sy valutabehoeftes kan dek deur goud teen nie minder nie as die amptelike prys ($35 of R25 per fyn ons), min &#x2019;n klein hanteringsgeld, te verkoop.</p>

<p>Die Republiek neem deel aan die nuwe skema van Spesiale Trekkingsregte wat deur die Internasionale Monet&#x00EA;re Fonds ingestel is, en het onlangs die eerste toewysing van hierdie trekkingsregte aanvaar.</p>

<p>Die Republiek handhaaf goeie finansi&#x00EB;le betrekkinge met die buiteland, en die Regering en openbare korporasies het buitelandse lenings tot &#x2019;n aansienlike bedrag gesluit.</p>

<p>Die afgelope jaar is gekenmerk deur &#x2019;n verdere verhoging van die lewenstandaarde van alle groepe van ons bevolking. Dit het &#x2019;n verdere stimulerende uitwerking op die algemene welvaart van die gemeenskap uitgeoefen.</p>

<p>Ondanks die snel groeiende vraag na verbruiksgoedere was daar redelike skerp prysmededinging in die handelsektor. Hierdie skerp mededinging is aangehelp deur die heilsame uitwerking wat die opheffing van prysbinding op die pryspeile in sekere vertakkinge van die distribusiehandel uitgeoefen het.</p>

<p>Wat die Republiek se buitelandse handel betref, het die ho&#x00EB; peil van binnelandse besteding, asook die verslapping van invoerbeheer, tot &#x2019;n aansienlike toename in die land se totale invoer gelei. Daarenteen het die uitvoer van landbouprodukte, vanwe&#x00EB; droogtes, w&#x00EA;reldoorproduksie en marktoestande heelwat gedaal. Hierdie verminderde uitvoer van landbouprodukte is egter geheel en al uitgewis deur &#x2019;n sterk styging in die uitvoer van vervaardigde goedere, minerale en metale. Aangesien die uitvoer van fabrieksprodukte en metale verreweg die grootste groeipotensiaal inhou, skenk die Regering tans intensiewer aandag aan moontlike metodes om hierdie uitvoer aansienlik op &#x2019;n deurlopende grondslag te verhoog en plaaslike veredeling aan te moedig.</p>

<p>Dansky die ondernemingsgees en vertroue van ons nyweraars, en die verantwoordelike optrede deur ons werkers, het die produksie in die nywerheidswese &#x2019;n bevredigende groeikoers gedurende die afgelope jaar getoon. Die voortsetting van hierdie toestand is noodsaaklik, nie slegs om by te dra tot die opbouing van die Republiek se buitelandse valutaverdienste nie, maar ook om werk aan sy groeiende bevolking te verskaf.</p>

<p>Suid-Afrikaanse nyweraars sal steeds skerper mededinging ondervind. Gelukkig beskik die Republiek oor die kennis, ervaring en natuurlike hulpbronne, sowel as oor kapitaal uit eie besparing en moedige ondernemers, om die land in staat te stel om &#x2019;n hoe standaard van doeltreffende nywerheidsontwikkeling te handhaaf.</p>

<p>Sedert die Regering teen die einde van 1968 verbeterde aansporingsmaatre&#x00EB;ls vir nywerheidsdesentralisasie aangekondig het, het die desentralisasieprogram aanmerklik versnel. Die nuwe maatre&#x00EB;ls is veral bedoel vir groeipunte wat betreklik ver van die bestaande groot nywerheidskonsentrasies gele&#x00EB; is, en dit is juis by hierdie groeipunte waar daar nou goed gevorder word.</p>

<p>Terwyl die intensiewe ontginning van die visbronne teenoor die Republiek se kuste steeds voortduur, is dit verblydend dat die moontlikheid van internasionale beheer- en konservasiemaatre&#x00EB;ls op &#x2019;n onlangse internasionale konferensie in Rome, waar die Suid-Afrikaanse Regering verteenwoordig was, bespreek is. Daar was bemoedigende tekens dat die meeste van die lande wat aan hierdie konferensie deelgeneem het, bereid sal wees om toe te tree tot &#x2019;n internasionale konvensie vir die ordelike en beheerde ontginning van hierdie visbronne. As een van die belangrikste kusstate wat by die aangeleentheid betrokke is, verwelkom Suid-Afrika hierdie verwikkeling en bied sy volle samewerking aan.</p>

<p>Die bestendige groei van die land se mynboubedryf word gehandhaaf en veral vir sover dit platina, onedele minerale en diamante betref, is daar tekens van kragdadige uitbreiding en &#x2019;n aansienlike styging in produksie.</p>

<p><span class="col_7-8" refersTo="page_0016"/>Die bemoedigende resultate wait met die soektog na aardolie behaal is, het tot gevolg gehad dat prospekteerwerk met toenemende ywer voortgesit word.</p>

<p>Nuwe prosesse is ontwikkel en getoets om die doeltreffendheid van uraanekstraksie te verbeter.</p>

<p>Die Raad op Atoomkrag het &#x2019;n afdeling vir terrein- en installasielisensi&#x00EB;ring gestig met die oog op die latere vestiging van kernkragstasies in die Republiek.</p>

<p>The future development of our country, particularly in view of our dynamic economy, the rapid expansion in all industrial sectors and the increasing population growth, compels us to give more serious consideration than ever before to our natural water resources. May the Water Year which is being organized this year make us all more water conscious.</p>

<p>Where the necessity of planned water utilization in the interests of the country is increasingly being realized, the Government is giving consideration to improved methods for carrying out these plans which will necessitate additional trained personnel. A campaign to obtain such trained personnel, including a bursary scheme for students in engineering and the training of technicians at colleges for advanced technical education, is in progress and up to the present has met with success.</p>

<p>The Republic has just experienced a year of low rainfall in certain parts of the country, particularly in the Western Province and large areas of the interior. The Government is taking active steps to ensure that adequate water supplies will be available in future for these and other areas. These steps include the Tugela-Vaal project, estimated to cost twenty million rand and already approved by Parliament, and many other important schemes.</p>

<p>The Orange River project is progressing satisfactorily. Notwithstanding a shortage of skilled manpower, the work on the Hendrik Verwoerd dam is proceeding according to plan. It is expected that the work on the P. K. le Roux dam will commence during the first quarter of 1971. The construction of the Van der Kloof and the Fish-Sundays canals is already in progress, while a start will be made with the Welbedacht dam in March this year.</p>

<p>The planning and design of the water supply scheme for Bloemfontein and other towns have reached an advanced stage.</p>

<p>The Commission of Inquiry into Water Matters has just completed its report. Its recommendations are being studied carefully, and it is expected that it will be of great importance in the planning and development of water supply in South Africa.</p>

<p>Although grain and fruit crops were severely affected by drought and hail in certain areas, crop production was second only to the 1966 record, while in the case of wheat a new record was established notwithstanding serious drought in the wheat-producing areas of the Cape.</p>

<p>Prompt action was taken by the Government to control outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, downy mildew in vineyards, the burrowing eelworm in banana plantations and other agricultural pests. Much appreciation is due to our farmers for their effective co-operation in combating these serious threats to the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>The Government continued to give high priority in its agricultural policy to effective measures for the protection of the soil and the veld. During the Parliamentary recess a beginning was made with the application of the Soil Conservation Act of 1969, which will be administered by a national Division of Soil Protection.</p>

<p>State assistance for the improvement of veld conditions has also been extended by the institution of the Stock Reduction Scheme in the small stock areas under which the farmer receives compensation for the voluntary withdrawal of livestock from overstocked grazing areas.</p>

<p>A significant feature of 1969 was the exceptional increase in livestock production notwithstanding drought with, <i>inter alia,</i> new records in the number of sheep and pigs slaughtered and in the production of dairy products. The value of horticultural crops increased on account of increases in producers&#x2019; prices, also in some instances on foreign markets and in the quantities produced.</p>

<p>The domestic market remains the most important and stable outlet for agricultural food products and the industry still benefits from increases in the <i>per capita</i> consumption of most products. There are indications that the pattern of consumption in South Africa is gradually changing, mainly because more people are moving into the higher income groups and also as a result of the gradual change in the kind of food traditionally consumed by the Bantu.</p>

<p>The Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure continues to render financial assistance to farmers for the purchase of land, stock and implements, the acquisition of crop production requirements, the purchase of stock feed and the leasing of grazing. During the past year such assistance amounted to more than twenty million rand. Nevertheless, the ever-increasing and, in some cases, unrealistic prices which are being paid for land give cause for anxiety, as this can adversely affect the financial position of many a farmer who buys land on credit. It is an inexorable economic law that the load of debt of a successful farming enterprise should not be out of proportion to the land&#x2019;s potential, with due allowance for ruling produce prices and variable climatic conditions.</p>

<p><span class="col_9-10" refersTo="page_0017"/>The State constantly aims at keeping the deserving farmer on the land. The large irrigation schemes, such as those under the Orange River Project and the J. G. Strijdom Dam, will play an important part in this respect.</p>

<p>Exceptional progress in the constitutional development of the Bantu homelands has been effected. From October, 1968, to October, 1969, seven Bantu homelands advanced to new phases of greater self-government.</p>

<p>It is felt that health services in the Bantu homeland areas should not be divorced from the programme of economic, social and civic development in those areas, as it is an integral element of Bantu development as a whole. For this reason the Government has decided that all health services in the Bantu homelands must as soon as possible become the responsibility of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, assisted in an advisory and executive capacity by the Department of Health.</p>

<p>In view of the importance of the part that agriculture has to play in the national economy of the Bantu homelands, strenuous efforts are being made to develop agriculture and forestry as a primary industry from the subsistence level to that of an economic enterprise.</p>

<p>The settlement of Bantu in their respective homelands has progressed as quickly and as smoothly as available housing in the homelands allowed. The Department is also maintaining an intensive programme of development of residential Bantu complexes for the proper housing of the labour employed in border industries.</p>

<p>In the field of the natural sciences, research activities advanced so rapidly that it became necessary to adapt existing machinery in such a way that the development needs and the co-ordination of research programmes, as well as the utilization of manpower and expensive apparatus, can be considered on a concerted basis. Consequently it has been decided to centralize the activities of the approximately 65 existing co-ordinating and advisory committees amongst research organizations, under three standing National Advisory Committees of the Scientific Advisory Council, in order to provide that Council with the required substructure for the performance of its functions.</p>

<p>The Department of Community Development has made good progress with its work, <i>inter alia,</i> the resettlement of disqualified persons in their specific communities, the renewal of depressed urban areas and the provision of housing for the lower income groups.</p>

<p>At present resettlement is taking place at a rate of approximately 8,500 families per annum compared with an annual average of 5,500 over the past nine years. This rate will be accelerated as larger numbers of houses for disqualified persons are made available in their own group areas.</p>

<p>The urban renewal projects which have been embarked upon in the most important cities through the agency of state committees, are already producing results. The replanning of several urban areas has been completed and good progress is being made with the work connected with the renewal of those areas. Depressed conditions in all the large urban areas will, therefore, in the near future not only be cleared, but badly needed land will also thereby be made available for housing and other purposes.</p>

<p>An enormous house building programme is in progress throughout the country. Supplementary to the private sector, whose function it is to provide for the housing needs of the higher income groups, the Government has made approximately R66 million available to the National Housing Fund for the current financial year to be spent for the benefit of the lower-income groups. Although a great demand persists in certain areas, there is in fact no serious shortage of housing for the lower-income groups which the State must provide through the agency of local authorities and other bodies. As far as state housing is concerned, everything possible is being done to execute, within the framework of allocated funds, the Government&#x2019;s decision to provide housing for all married members of the armed and police forces.</p>

<p>The Government is, however, concerned about the very high prices of building land in and around the urban areas, as is evidenced by the appointment of a commission of inquiry to investigate this problem and report before the end of June, 1970.</p>

<p>As is generally known, an earthquake struck the Tulbagh&#x2014;Ceres&#x2014;Wolseley area on the 29th September last year, causing extensive damage. Immediate steps were taken by the Government to implement emergency relief measures in the form of housing and financial assistance to persons who had sustained damages. The reconstruction of the area is already receiving attention.</p>

<p>As a result of the co-operation from both employers and employees, labour relations in the Republic remain on a sound footing. The Republic enjoys peace on the labour front, and this state of affairs once again contributed materially towards the country&#x2019;s economic development.</p>

<p>It is intended to proceed with the Industrial Conciliation Amendment Bill which was introduced during the previous session of Parliament in connection with training schemes. It is also proposed to introduce a Bill to amend the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. 1941</p>

<p>The sustained economic growth and industrial development of South Africa demand that the trained and skilled labour force should be correspondingly supplemented. <span class="col_11-12" refersTo="page_0018"/>It is gratifying to note that, in spite of various obstacles, a constant stream of sought-after workers are still being drawn from abroad to South Africa by way of immigration. This contributes to a great extent towards supplementing the labour shortage in South Africa. Many persons who, since the inception of the immigration scheme during 1961, entered the country as school children with their parents, are now adults and they too are making their contribution.</p>

<p>Public interest in the promotion of the welfare of the aged in our country continues to grow.</p>

<p>While intensive study was devoted during 1968 to the development of a sound policy for the care of the aged in the Republic, particular attention was given during the past year to measures for the planned implementation of accepted policy and there has been important progress in this regard.</p>

<p>The specific need for institutional care for infirm elderly people has emerged very clearly and special measures have been taken to cope with this problem. It it a matter that calls for further study and planning.</p>

<p>In regard to the family and the strengthening of family life, attention is, <i>inter alia,</i> being given to the care of the children of working mothers and the development of a sound family policy for South Africa.</p>

<p>Two commissions of inquiry have made good progress with their work: the one concerning divorce and the other relating to the use of drugs. There is general public concern about the threatening danger of an increase in the abuse of drugs by both young and old. The State has taken timeous steps by ordering an inquiry into the problem.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker and Members of the House of Assembly:</p>

<p>Additional estimates of expenditure for the current financial year will be laid before you, and Part Appropriation Bills for the provision of the necessary funds in anticipation of the passing of the main Appropriation Bills for the ensuing financial year will be introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. President and Members of the Senate:</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker and Members of the House of Assembly:</p>

<p>I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may guide and sustain you in your labours and deliberations.</p>

<p>I now declare this the Fifth Session of the Third Parliament of the Republic of South Africa to be duly opened.</p>

<p>Late Mr. H. R. H. du Plessis</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move, as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 11th January of Mr. Humphrey Robert Henry du Plessis, who represented the electoral division of Kuruman, and desires to place on record its appreciation of his parliamentary service, which extended over a period of more than 18 years.</block>

<block name="quote">This House further resolves that its sincere sympathy be conveyed to the relatives of the deceased in their bereavement.</block>

<p>This hon. member was one of the senior Members of this Parliament. The turnover of members entering this House from time to time is a very large one, and in spite of the fact that the late Mr. Du Plessis entered this House only in 1951, there are few members who had a longer period of service than he had.</p>

<p>He was a person who did not participate very frequently in debates, but when he did he always stated his case with calm dignity and great conviction. He believed very profoundly <span class="col_13-14" refersTo="page_0019"/>in the principles he recognized. But I think that this hon. member will be remembered in particular because he was one of the most loyal members of this House. Our late friend Humphrey Du Plessis did not serve the House in the Lobby or in the coffee lounge. He served the House in this Chamber, in which we assemble. One rarely entered the House without his being in his place here. That same loyalty characterized his participation in the Select Committees on which he served. For years I myself had the privilege of serving with him on the Select Committee on Pensions, where he did exceptionally valuable work, and where his sympathetic understanding meant a great deal. He gave his time and his attention to that Committee for almost the entire period he was in the House of Assembly.</p>

<p>At all times he promoted the interests of his constituency to the best of his ability. Because we were aware of the fact that he had in recent years suffered from ill-health and that from time to time he had had to undergo serious operations, one was at all times struck by the patience and the forbearance with which he at all times endured the trials which afflicted him.</p>

<p>We commemorate with grief this loyal friend, this good colleague, and this dignified parliamentarian of many years standing who has been taken from us. We wish to convey our sympathy to his wife, his children and his grandchildren, to whom he was particularly attached.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House wish to associate ourselves with the words uttered by the hon. the Prime Minister in regard to our deceased colleague, Humphrey Du Plessis. He was a quiet member, but one who most certainly had no enemies in this House. In the course of years he made friends on both sides of the House. He was an approachable person. He was particularly popular in his own constituency, as indicated by the attendance at his funeral, which was one of the largest the district has ever known. He had the interests of his constituency at heart, and he served his constituency in various capacities. He was vice-chairman of the Divisional Council. He served on the Hospital Board. He served on the School Board, as well as on various other boards. He was a notable cattle farmer, but he also had other interests which he managed with the same competence. We shall miss him. We remember him as a dignified member of this House, and as a person who leaves behind him here an exceptionally good name. Our sympathy goes out to the members of his family. I second the motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expressed its deep regret at the death on 23rd January of Maj. John Erith Lindsay, who represented the electoral division of King William&#x2019;s Town, and desires to place on record its appreciation of his parliamentary service, which extended over a period of almost four years.</block>

<block name="quote">This House further resolves that its sincere sympathy be conveyed to the relatives of the deceased in their bereavement.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, unlike the late Mr. H. R. H. du Plessis, who was a senior member of this House, the late Maj. Lindsay was a new member in this House and he had not yet completed four years service in this House. Before entering this House he served for six years in the Provincial Council, and he was a comparatively young man when he passed away. When I personally look back on the career of this hon. member, I think that I will always remember him by the fact that he was one of the most bilingual members who ever came to this House. In that respect he set a worthy example to all people seeking public office in this country of ours. He struck us who sat in this House with him as a man who was obviously sincere and a man who spoke up with enthusiasm for his constituents and the cause in which he believed. It is in that regard that we will think of him in spite of the fact that he only came to this House a few years ago when one would normally have thought that he would have served in this House for many years.</p>

<p>I wish therefore on behalf of us who are gathered here to-day to extent our deepest sympathy to his wife and his children in their very sad bereavement.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House wish to be associated with the kind words which have fallen from the hon. the Prime Minister in respect of our departed colleague, John Lindsay. I think that his sudden death at a comparatively early age was a great shock to all those who knew him and worked with him. I think he will be remembered particularly as a trusted friend, a loyal supporter, an exemplary family man and a most upright man. He had the good fortune to grow up in the country and at a very early age he indicated his readiness to work for others. He joined the Permanent Force before the war and had a distinguished career in the Air Force. He was one of the first to participate in the hostilities. He was in fact shot down over Abyssinia and was extremely <span class="col_15-16" refersTo="page_0020"/>lucky to get away with his life before being taken prisoner by the Italians. He also served for some time after the war before he resigned to become a farmer. He very soon showed that he had an interest in the wellbeing of his fellow farmers and he came forward as provincial councillor for the Transkei area. He gained a reputation for his devotion to the interests of his constituency and for very hard work indeed. In due course he came to Parliament and I think that his dedication and very hard work were examples to us all. He was very soon recognized as being an authority on the Ciskei and some of the resettlement problems in that area. We shall remember him as a very modest man, a man who never pushed himself, a man who was essentially sincere and dedicated to his work, a man who was most honest and above all a man who set an example of family life which I think is a credit to the society in which he moved. We shall miss him. Our sympathies go out to his wife and daughters in their terrible loss at this time. With these words I should like to second the motion of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>
