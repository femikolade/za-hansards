<heading>STATEMENT IN REGARD TO TAKING OVER BY THE STATE OF MANUFACTURE OF EXPLOSIVES AND PROPELLANTS FOR MILITARY PURPOSES</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your leave I should like to make a statement in regard to the manufacture of explosives and propellants for military purposes.</p>

<p>When I introduced legislation during 1968 for the establishment of an Armaments Development and Production Corporation of South Africa, Limited, I stated that one of the most important objects of the Corporation would be to help to ensure that in all respects the Republic of South Africa might even sooner become independent of the outside world for its armament requirements. In terms of the Act the Corporation also had to gear itself for ensuring that the armament requirements of the Republic were met as effectively and economically as was practicable.</p>

<p>In the execution of its task it would be the duty of the Corporation to advise me on (a) the desirability and necessity for the State to obtain through the Corporation a share in and / or control over the development and manufacture of the more strategic items; and (b) steps which ought to be taken in order to place on a sounder basis the existing direct or indirect financial interests of the State in such activities.</p>

<p>As explosives and propellants for military purposes are indeed the lifeblood of a country&#x2019;s system of defence, it was obvious to the Government that the control over the manufacture thereof as well as the State&#x2019;s accumulated direct and indirect financial interests therein, were matters which had to receive the necessary attention as soon as possible. In consultation with me the matter was subsequently discussed very frankly by the chairman of Armscor with the firm African Explosives and Chemical Industries, Limited, which has been responsible for this activity up to now. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my personal appreciation for the spirit in which the discussions took place, and, in particular, for the sense of responsibility displayed throughout the negotiations.</p>

<p>Since the most important points of agreement have now been finalized, I find it a pleasure to announce on behalf of the Government <span class="col_735-736" refersTo="page_0380"/>that, in consultation with the firm African Explosives and Chemical Industries, Limited, it was decided to issue simultaneously the following joint statement at this stage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Following discussions with the South African authorities it has been cordially agreed that the time has now come for the Government to assume full technical responsibility for its munitions factories at Somerset West, Cape, and to own the land on which the factories stand. Accordingly African Explosives and Chemical Industries will arrange that over a mutually convenient period it will progressively hand over to Armscor responsibility for the consultative and technical services it has provided under contract; and it will enable the Government, subject to agreement upon a fair valuation, to acquire the land that the Company for many years has made available at a nominal rent.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise for just a moment to register our protest against the fact that the normal traditional procedure of informing the Opposition about the statement to be made by the Minister has not been followed in this case. It is very convenient and quite right for you, Sir, within your discretion, to permit such a statement, which may be debated later, but I think the traditional procedure of informing the Opposition should be followed. This indicates the disregard that this Government has for minorities in this country.</p>

<p>If one has listened to this debate up to this point one can only have arrived at one conclusion and that is that hon. members on that side regard the Railways, the interests and the weal and woe of the railwaymen as their particular terrain. They are the only people who can judge whether things are going well with the Railways and with the railwaymen, and we on this side of the House have no say or any information or any experience of what is happening on the Railways.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I got that impression, particularly after listening to the hon. member for Langlaagte and other members on that side. Let me tell the hon. member that the railwayman is not being disloyal to his undertaking. nor is he being disloyal to this Government if he should air his grievances to us on this side of the House, which he is to-day being forced to do because the aspirations and grievances and problems of the railwayman are to a large extent being glossed over by hon. members on that side of the House because it is not in the interests of the National Party to bring those problems to the fore. Consequently the railwaymen have to rely to an ever-increasing extent on us on this side of the House to air his problems, and that is why he expects from us, to an ever-increasing extent, that we will bring his problems to the fore in this House. In the same way it also becomes the task of this side of the House to bring the interests of commerce, the interests of industry and the interests of agriculture, when it comes to our national transport system, to the attention of the government. The hon. Chief Minister of Transport, when he took over some years ago from a former National Party Minister of Transport, said more or less that he had problems with the Railways, but that if he were given capital he would see to it that our national transport system, the Railways, would be placed on a proper basis. Now there is no doubt that the hon. the Minister has over the years obtained the capital with which to improve the position of the Railways, but I think it is high time&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister has time from now to the election&#x2014;he again asked the people of South Africa and this Parliament to come to his assistance in order to do something to improve the position. The hon. member for Yeoville put it to the hon. the Minister that the manpower shortage on the Railways to-day is such that it is not only restricting railway services, but that it is also causing major problems and dissatisfaction among the railwaymen themselves. But it was pointed out to the hon. the Minister of Transport years ago that South Africa, with its rapid development, would have this manpower shortage and that he would have to make provision for it. And the hon. the Minister took steps in accordance with a statement which was made by a previous General Manager of the Railways, Mr. Hugo; the late Mr. Hugo envisaged that our labour pattern in South Africa would have to change. In order to solve this problem he has already employed many more non-Whites to do work which had previously been done by Whites. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s problem in the Railways in this respect remains a major one and he will not give that satisfaction he ought to give with the Railways unless he reconsiders his policy in this direction even further. Now there are hon. members on that side of the House who will immediately say that it is the policy of the United Party now to replace Whites with non-Whites.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Colesberg ought to put that question to the hon. the Minister of Transport, for he is already changing that labour pattern and in this respect he will have to go even further.</p>

<p><span class="col_737-738" refersTo="page_0381"/>And he need not be afraid that he will offend the white railwayworker. There are hon. members who want to use this for political purposes, but we on this side say to them that they are keeping certain railwaymen at a particular level while they could move much further up the scale and could do better work, receive improved remuneration and bear greater responsibilities. Unless they are prepared to accept that direction, they will never solve the manpower shortage on the Railways.</p>

<p>The direction which was envisaged by the former General Manager, the late Mr. Hugo, and which the hon. the Minister has already been following over the past few years.</p>

<p>*Mr. S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;: Mention a few examples.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>To-day, in all humility, I want to state three requirements in respect of our transport system, or rather lay down three criteria. In the first place there is this criterion: Must our national transport system be far in advance of development? Must it run parallel to the development, or must it lag a little way behind? That is the first criterion I want to put. The second criterion I want to put is this. How are we looking after the interests of the railway worker? And the last criterion is this: Does it satisfy its clients, i.e. the users of the Railways? I think that when one takes all three these criteria, one can reach no other conclusion but that the government has not given its attention to the Railways as it ought to have done: and I hope to mention a few examples to the hon. the Minister to demonstrate why I think so. The last criterion relates particularly to our agriculture.</p>

<p>But the first test is whether the Railways is keeping pace with the development of the country or whether it should run parallel, whether it should be a little in advance or should preferably lag a little way behind. I want to state that if one were to go through the reports of the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Industries and the S.A. Agricultural Union, one would find the hon. the Minister is faced with one problem after the other in regard to the provision of adequate services, which are reiterated year after year to the Minister and to which insufficient attention is being given. I can understand that during the past few months the hon. the Minister has had a difficult time and perhaps did not have sufficient time to enable him to give sufficient attention to the Railways, but before that the Minister had a long time in which to do so. The last few months, we know, he has been flushing certain people out of their holes, and has been experiencing problems with his political organization in the Transvaal, but that is no excuse.</p>

<p>I then want to put the second requirement to the Minister, i.e. whether he has looked after the interests of the railway employees? The railway worker to-day is complaining to us about the overtime. They are complaining to us as a result of the high cost of living. They are complaining to us as a result of the high rates of interest they have to pay on housing. The hon. member for Colesberg boasted of it here that the salary and wages of railwaymen had been considerably increased, and that is correct, but only last year, in 1969, the cost of living increased by 5 per cent in South Africa. The hon. member for Colesberg and other hon. members on that side must not think that the railwaymen have forgotton the time a number of years ago when wages and salaries were frozen, and when the hon. the Minister came forward with that R43 million which he only gave to the railway people on a subsequent occasion. There was the same dissatisfaction in regard to that situation. The railway employee is dissatisfied to-day because his interests are not being looked after in this respect. I could mention examples to-day of people who had problems in regard to housing and who are today still struggling to get approval from the Railways Administration so that they can obtain money for their homes from some building society or other. If you travel up to Johannesburg along the main line to-day and talk to the ticket examiners on the trains they will tell you that they have been on duty for ten to 12 hours. Then they only get a few hours&#x2019; sleep and then have to repeat the process.</p>

<p>When last did you go by train?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is asking me when last I went by train. I can give the hon. member the assurance that I often travel by train. What is more, I am not prepared merely to talk to those people. I am also prepared to listen to the problems they have. This is good advice to that hon. member.</p>

<p>Sir, if it is a requirement that we should look after the employees of the Railways, one wonders whether the Government has succeeded in that respect. If it had succeeded there would not have been so many grievances aired with us, and those grievances would not have been increasing every year. The other criterion I want to put is: To what extent is there satisfaction amongst the users of the Railways? This point was put very clearly by the hon. member for Yeoville, and we realize only too well that our railway workers are working under extremely difficult circumstances. If delays and snarl-ups take place, one must bear in mind that these people are often working under difficult circumstances. They get little sleep, and they work a great deal of overtime. But in addition there are probably malpractices which take place from time to time in regard to the control of the Railways, which affect our farmers in particular very closely. <span class="col_739-740" refersTo="page_0382"/>Hon. members have stated that they were not responsible for the overcrowding of slaughter animals, nor for the fact that many slaughter animals recently died in Johannesburg. It could be true, as a result of the abolition or the quota system by the Meat Board, that there was a tremendous increase in the number of animals, but surely this is not the first time this has happened. I can quote the hon. member what happened as recently as 1967. At the time a great many animals also died in Johannesburg. A report in <i>The Star</i> in this connection reads, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The truck, according to Railway regulations, was supposed to contain only 59 sheep, but it was loaded with 86. It had been standing there since Sunday, after completing the three-day journey from Upington.</block>

<p>In addition it is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The rainy cool weather probably prevented more of them dying, for just over a week ago 92 out of a consignment of 130 were found dead in trucks.</block>

<p>In this report it is clearly stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We want to make sure that these trucks are not overloaded.</block>

<p>This is what a member of the Animal Protection Society said.</p>

A report with the heading, &#x201C;Ministers in hot water over 320 deaths&#x201D;, reads, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows: &#x201C;Farmers are embittered, because they are losing money&#x201D;.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am dealing with the question of these 320 sheep and cattle that died in that week of 25th January. If the hon. member is saying that there were other animals which also died before that happened, then it only makes the situation worse. I therefore do not know why he is putting those questions to me. If there is no obligation in this regard on the Meat Board, then surely there is an obligation on the Railways which transports these animals under certain circumstances. The Meat Board cannot be held responsible if these animals are not given any water and fodder en route. The hon. the Minister knows that it is one of the most frequent complaints to-day that animals are transported for long periods of time in trains without being taken off at strategic places and provided with water and fodder. Surely this is the responsibility of the Railways and not the responsibility of the Meat Board. We want to make an urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister to have an inquiry instituted into this matter, and not only in respect of the position in Johannesburg and at the abattoirs. He must also have an inquiry instituted in order to what extent the Railways are responsible for this situation. I want to bring it emphatically to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention that approximately 27 per cent of the goods traffic of the Railways consists of agricultural or animal produce. The hon. the Ministers are receiving a tremendous income from our South African agriculture. If he does not do something about incidents of this kind which are taking place on the Railways to-day <span class="col_741-742" refersTo="page_0383"/>he cannot expect those people to have confidence in the South African Railways.</p>

<p>I want to mention a further example to the hon. the Minister of how, as a result of poor service and administration, the Railways is affecting agriculture. I want to mention to him this example of an eminent farmer in the Hankey area of the Eastern Cape. He developed a new citrus variety and received orders to send this variety to Cape Town at certain times of the year. This is what he wrote to me in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To give you some of my personal experiences, apart from running one of the Republic&#x2019;s more important Jersey herds, I have developed a type of citrus fruit which I anticipated would not be dependent on the overseas market. When my trees came into moderate bearing last year I negotiated a contract with a Cape Town firm and my first orders were 200 trays of the one variety and approximately 50 trays of another variety to be railed weekly. My letter in this connection will give you a clear picture of what has happened in so far as transportation is concerned and you will observe that it has taken six months for the Railway Department to find out what caused the delay in transit.</block>

<p>Sir, he conducted one negotiation after the other with the divisional manager in Port Elizabeth to get this matter solved. We want to encourage our farmers to develop our own inland markets, to find their own markets. Then they suffer damage as a result of the fact that their products remain in transit for long periods, arrive at the market in a poor condition and then do not fetch a proper price. Now the hon. the Minister must not say that I am sucking these things out of my thumb. One can read daily accounts of criticism of this kind. One can read in <i>Georganiseerde Landbou, Landbounuusblad</i> or <i>Farmers&#x2019; Weekly</i> how farmers are objecting as a result of this bottleneck in our Railways.</p>

<p>I am going to mention a further example to the hon. the Minister. I am going to give him the example of a farmer, not far from here, who recently began distributing deciduous fruit in the northern provinces and Natal. This man requires refrigerated trucks in order to transport his products. Apparently he gets about two trucks a week. But recently it so happened that one of those trucks, conveying produce to Durban, took nine days to reach their destination. Now hon. members can imagine what his clients must pay for that farmer&#x2019;s produce under those circumstances. In the meantime this man has invested thousands of rands in pre-cooling facilities. But the moment his produce must come on to the market he is left in the lurch as a result of the fact that the service is not available. This is not the first time this has happened. The same thing has happened before. What is more, when the Railways saw that this truck which I am talking about did not turn up, an in vestigation was not instituted. No, Sir, if it had not been for his clients who investigated the matter themselves when the produce did not arrive, that produce would perhaps still have been standing somewhere along the line. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that this is his opportunity now to do something for our agricultural industry.</p>

<p>I want to mention a further example. There are to-day still large drought-stricken areas in South Africa where rain has not yet fallen. This is the position in Calvinia, Namaqualand and the North Western Cape. There are farmers who have to wait for weeks before orders which they placed in respect of lucerne and mealies can be executed. When that produce must be delivered, one simply finds that the bus driver and perhaps his assistant are compelled to throw of the goods because they are so busy and do not have workers at their disposal. Then hon. members on that side of the House say that people are satisfied with our transportation system. Not only is the railwayman satisfied, but also the railway user. If the hon. the Minister is not going to make better use of his time than to spend it on the difficulties in the National Party, I can tell him that difficulties of this kind will not pass unnoticed at this election on 22nd April. It is our task to point these things out to the hon. the Minister. If he is unable to furnish a reply to this, then the nation has no other alternative than to reject him as Minister of Transport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park made out a great case here of the cattle that had to stand over on the Rand and could not be slaughtered immediately. The hon. member tried to lay the blame on the Railways. I wonder, however, if the hon. member thinks carefully about this matter, who he thinks was the cause of it not being possible to slaughter that stock. There was only one reason for that, i.e. the Rand municipality did not make provision for the increased meat consumption of its inhabitants. The stock arrived, and because certain of the municipality&#x2019;s slaughtering facilities were out of operation it was not possible to slaughter that stock. After all, it is not the Railways&#x2019; task to establish waiting pens and other facilities if stock cannot be slaughtered. The Railways&#x2019; task is solely to convey the stock to the Rand, or wherever it is. I think the hon. member for Newton Park is laying the blame at the wrong door.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned this question of the labour pattern and said that it would have to be changed. He said that more non-Whites would have to be employed. He went further and accused this National Party Government of already replacing Whites with non-Whites. I wrote down the hon. member&#x2019;s words. Fortunately I have the numbers of persons employed, as well as other comparative figures. On 31st March, 1959, there were 113.726 Whites in the employ of the South African Railways. On 31st March, 1969, this <span class="col_743-744" refersTo="page_0384"/>figure had increased by 2,000 to 115,142. The hon. member stated that the number of non-Whites had increased and that they had replaced the Whites. On 31st March, 1959, the number of non-Whites in the employ of the Railways was 111,827. In March. 1969. their numbers had decreased to 109,464, which is 2,0 less. The true state of affairs is therefore exactly the opposite of what the hon. member stated it to be. During the past ten years 2,0 additional Whites have been employed while 2,000 fewer non-Whites are being employed. However, the hon. member alleges that it is just the other way around.</p>

<p>The next objection raised by the hon. member was that railwaymen had to pay such a high rate of interest on their house loans. On departmental house loans railway servants pay 4 per cent interest. The loans which railway servants obtain from building societies are being subsidized, just as in the case of other public servants, and they only pay 3&#x00BD; to 4 percent interest on those loans. Again, this is just the opposite of what the hon. member claimed. The hon. member claimed that railway servants were paying higher rates of interest. but the voters in my constituency are grateful for the fact that they are paying such low rates of interest. The last assertion the hon. member made was that the consumers were dissatisfied with railway tariffs. I have here in my possession the yellow booklet of the United Party with the title &#x201C;The answer: You want it, we have it&#x201D;. On page 26 the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The party will separate the railways, the harbours and the railways into three autonomous departments, under the general supervision of the Ministry of Transport.</block>

<p>What does that mean? The Railways itself has a deficit of between R30 and R40 million which has to be carried by the Harbours, Airways and Pipelines. Hon. members on that side of the House referred to the high tariffs. But surely they realize that if the policy elucidated in this little yellow booklet were to be accepted, it would immediately result in an increase in the tariffs, for from what source will this R30 to R40 million be obtained? Therefore, the United Party is not pleading here for which is in the interests of the people who make use of the railways transportation services, but for something which will be to their disadvantage, tariffs will have to be increased. because that is the only way their plan will succeed. Who are the people who make use of the train services and who will have to pay the high tariffs as a result of this system? It is for the most part the less well to do people, the older people and children. The United Party, through this policy of theirs, therefore wants to place these people in a very unequal position.</p>

<p>I listened attentively to the course taken by the debate and all the criticism on this side of the House, as we have just heard from the previous speaker. It is clear to me that those hon. members are with great difficulty trying to find fault with this mammoth organization, i.e. the transport system of our country. Much reference was made to manpower shortage. It is a problem. We realize that. It is the only matter they touched upon which does in fact have some substance. To my mind, however, the solution they proposed holds great dangers. I fear that their proposed solution will endanger our white workers. I shall refer to that again later.</p>

<p>The other question they raised is the elimination of level crossings. This matter is a familiar one to us. We have been dealing with it for many years, and a great deal has been said about the problem. We want to thank the Minister for having doubled the amount for the elimination of these level crossings. We also believe that the elimination of these level crossings will take place much more rapidly in future. Nevertheless, I want to express my gratitude for this new method whereby half of the road is closed as trains approach. This will, without doubt, be of great assistance. I just want to tell hon. members that they are very conveniently losing sight of one thing. That is that where flashing lights have been introduced and where the bell system is in operation, numerous accidents are nevertheless occurring. It is clear that the Railways are doing what they can from their side. Surely we realize that it is impossible to eliminate the 4,000 level crossings immediately. These signs, etc., which have been put up at level crossings are ignored by the public. The public pay no heed to them and simply drives across the lines. I want to make an appeal to the motoring public to pay more heed to these danger signals at level crossings.</p>

<p>We are on the eve of an election. On 22nd April the people will be asked to give a decision affecting the weal and woe of our nation. It is with the greatest confidence that I leave that choice in the hands of the voters to decide who shall govern this country.</p>

<p>My seat is a very safe one. It is a seat where the United Party does not dare put up a candidate. It is necessary for us to see this matter in its correct perspective and to glance back for a moment. If the Opposition were to take over the reins of Government, what would the position be? In the first place I want to ask what the United Party offers the railwayman if it should come to power. To my mind that is a very important question.

However, I want them to state in clear terms to the voters outside what their policy is.</p>

<p>But it is not only the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Hillbrow. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. member for Karoo also pleaded for this in very plain terms.

<p>That is hairsplitting. The fact remains that under the United Party these workers, as far as the colour bar are concerned, will not be safeguarded. But I want to go further. The hon. member for Karoo mentioned the possibility here of their being appointed as waiters on trains and on aircraft. Now I want to ask the hon. members a question. The hon. members speak of the labour shortage and the manpower shortage and this matter is blown up as if we had found ourselves in a tremendously critical situation. Is that the hon. member&#x2019;s solution? The hon. member for Karoo stated that waiters on trains and in the airways, conductors, shunters and ticket examiners could be replaced by Coloureds. I want to warn hon. members that the negroes in America took over the public service within the space of a few years. The percentage of negroes in the public service increased by 25 per cent a decade ago to more than 80 per cent at the present moment.</p>

<p>It is a fact, and the hon. member can convince himself by going to find out for himself. This happened under the policy of President Kennedy. I want to warn the United Party that if they come into power, the same thing will happen here in South Africa. Opposed to this there is the National Party&#x2019;s guarantee to the worker, i.e. work reservation with a colour bar. The worker knows this, because he knows the National Party and that is why he has confidence in it. The hon. member for Parow raised a matter here yesterday, i.e. the question of the Railways becoming black. He covered the field quite well and I want to congratulate him on that. In 1923 we had the Jagger mentality in the South African Party. This mentality still exists in the United Party. In those days the Whites had to be replaced by non-Whites who could supply cheaper labour. To-day they want to replace the Whites under the slogan &#x201C;manpower shortage&#x201D;. Whatever their motives are, the deed remains the same. That United Party is a mere extension of the old South African Party which did those things.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with this serious complaint raised by the United Party, the complaint in regard to overtime. This is also the last of the complaints I want to deal with here to-day. The United Party is so concerned about overtime the workers have to work. My constituency <span class="col_747-748" refersTo="page_0386"/>is probably one of the constituencies with the most railwaymen in the country. Not one single railwayman has, so far, complained to me about overtime. They are grateful for the extra earnings.</p>

<p>I want to say here that I rue the day these Railways are transferred to that United Party. What will the state of affairs then be? We know what chaos there was in the Railways in 1948. We know that in those days money even had to be borrowed from the Treasury in order to pay wages. We also know that the provident funds were used illegally. This Government had to pay millions of rands into those provident funds. Take the behaviour of the United Party during the past year. I challenge anyone to mention one occasion to me when the United Party rose to present a plea in the interests of the railwayman. On every occasion they merely presented pleas in the interests of the other sectors. When mention is made of high tariff goods, which provides 51 per cent of the Railways&#x2019; income, they advocate that it should be handed over to private transport. What must become of the Railways? Where must they get their revenue from? With what must we grant salary increases to Railway officials? Not only do they complain about high tariffs, they are also dissatisfied about the unfair protection the Railways enjoys, about the monopolistic tendencies of the Railways. They are prepared to chop off the head of the goose that lays the golden eggs. Now they have come forward with this booklet, this pamphlet in which their policy statement is contained, and they advocate that the Railways, the Harbours, the Airways, as well as the Pipelines be separated. This is further clear proof that they want to break down the S.A. Railways, because the deficit on the transport side of the S.A. Railways must be carried by the other sectors. There is no other solution. What they are advocating must result in one thing only, i.e. increased tariffs.</p>

<p>In addition they refer to mechanization, in such a way that they imply that it is merely a less important matter. According to them the efficiency of our Railway services has not really improved. The truth, however, is that it was only with the aid of mechanization and improved working methods that it was possible with the limited number of staff to achieve such a major success as that which was in fact achieved. The index of labour productivity indicates that the production figure increased by 166 during the past two decades. Mechanization of track maintenance resulted in a manpower saving of more than 600 platelayers and 10,000 Bantu labourers.</p>

<p>The last matter I want to refer to is the centralized traffic control System. In my constituency people went so far as to express concern that the introduction of this system would give rise to unemployment. In fact, quite a number of station foremen have been eliminated through this system. Fortunately it was possible to take them in elsewhere. With the introduction of this system on only a few lines the services of altogether 72 station foremen were eliminated. For years our Minister has been warned that he will have to get along with less labour. That is why he has gone over to increased mechanization and to-day we see the fruits of this in the sphere of labour saving.</p>

<p>The strength and the success of the S.A. Railways, however, lies, in the training of manpower. in the fact that they are training their labour units to become experts, so that every person can do his work as an artisan. Such training therefore means a great deal to the S.A. Railways. Under this r&#x00E9;gime we have not only had tremendous industrial development, but also a spectacular development on the S.A. Railways. Nevertheless, they have not failed to meet the country&#x2019;s transport requirements and have conveyed all offered traffic. The hon. member for Newton Park alleged that people were now supposedly struggling to get trucks, and so on. That I simply cannot understand; such complaints do not reach us. Where farmers were unable to get trucks, this could perhaps be attributed to the fact that the markets were already overloaded, as was the case recently when there was an accumulation of slaughter stock in Johannesburg and all stations subsequently received instructions not to load any more stock. Perhaps that is what the hon. member for Newton Park was referring to. The fact of the matter is that efficiency on the Railways has made it possible to increase its production more than threefold and that despite the fact that the complement of <span class="col_749-750" refersTo="page_0387"/>staff has remained virtually constant. The workers salaries has also increased more than threefold. On 31st March, 1948, the average income of a white person on the S.A. Railways was R910, in comparison with R2,962 at the end of March 1969.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the Minister to hold discussions from time to time on the highest level to see where adjustments are necessary, and the reason why the railwayman has such great confidence in the Administration is because this is being done The railwayman knows that the profits made by the S.A. Railways are ploughed back to their benefit. That is why the railwayman has so much confidence in this Government. In contrast to that the United Party wants to break down the S.A. Railways. The hon. member for Yeoville is even concerned about the fact that there will be a large surplus this year. Opposed to that we on this side are grateful for surpluses because it enables us to do something more for our people, for those people who work hard and co-operate with the Government to increase the efficiency of the S.A. Railways and to expand it further. As far as I am concerned, I want to express my gratitude to the Minister and to every official, from the highest to the lowest, for the part each one has played, and give them the assurance that we are proud of them; they are the pride of our country.</p>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to follow the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) too far in the theme he developed. However, there are one or two things in connection with his speech I should like to comment upon. Firstly, would it not be nice if in a debate on Railway matters we could apply ourselves to a discussion of the means whereby the Railways could attain maximum efficiency instead of looking for voting points and for vote catching phrases with an eye on the coming election! I have heard arguments from both sides of the House about the number of Africans, the increased number of Africans, now being employed by the S.A. Railways. As far as the Opposition is concerned, they use this argument to show that the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid is failing, whereas Government members, on the other hand, deny that there has been any replacement of Whites by non-Whites at all. But what does it matter? The only thing of importance, surely, is that the S.A. Railways should be run at a maximum efficiency. It ought not to matter if in so doing the hon. the Minister should find it necessary to increase the number of non-white employees. I have no doubt that he only does that when he has to, in the light of the particular philosophy which motivates him.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, I think it is quite wrong to try and make political capital out of this fact, because this is counter productive. It means that when the hon. the Minister might be considering increasing the efficiency of the S.A. Railways by employing more non-Whites, he is pulled up sharply by the realization that political capital is going to be made out of it, more so in these days when, so it seems to me, every Nationalist Minister is so aware of the fact that beady little eyes are fixed on them. They seem to me to be too much aware of the fact that beady little eyes are fixed on them trying to make political capital out of every colour issue in which their respective Departments might become involved and which might mean increased employment of non-Whites.</p>

<p>I commend the hon. the Minister of Transport for taking on more non-Whites if this has increased the efficiency of the Railways. We know that there are vacancies and that there is no unemployment amongst employable white people. At any rate, you have to be a very bad worker indeed, if you are white in South Africa, if you cannot find employment these days. Therefore I commend the hon. the Minister for taking on more non-white workers if by so doing he is increasing the efficiency of the Railways on the one hand and providing additional employment to non-Whites who require work on the other hand. It would be a very fine thing indeed if we could discuss this entirely from the economic angle and from the angle of the best benefit to South Africa rather than always trying to make political capital out of this. I wish the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District), in replying to the hon. member for Newton Park and other members of the official Opposition side, had used that argument rather than trying to prove that the Minister had in fact not taken on more Blacks and had taken on more Whites. I find it all a pretty sickening spectacle and I want to say so.</p>

<p>Sir, the other matter which was raised in passing by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) was a matter which was raised by a couple of members on the official Opposition side, and I want to say something about this also. I have various other matters to raise with the hon. the Minister too. I am not raising them in order of importance, but since the hon. member has raised this matter I want to deal with it right away. Sir, I want to talk about the scandal of the livestock deaths in Johannesburg in January&#x2014;the fact that over 300 animals died of heat, exhaustion, starvation and overcrowding. Where does the blame lie? The hon. member for Newton Park blamed the Railways and I think he blamed the Livestock Board. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) and, I think, the hon. member for Colesberg who spoke the other day, blamed the Johannesburg Municipality and said that the abattoir did not have sufficient facilities; that they did not, for instance, employ non-white slaughtermen and why did they not do so. I do not know why they do not but leave that aside.</p>

<p><span class="col_751-752" refersTo="page_0388"/>The blame was laid, as I say, on the one hand on the Railways and on the other hand on the Johannesburg Municipality. Well, I do not know where the blame lies but I do not think nearly enough has been done to find out about this because it is not the first time that this has happened. It is the worst incident that we have experienced in Johannesburg, and people in Johannesburg were shocked at what was going on in the abattoirs at Newton siding during January. It was a shocking, disgusting spectacle, but it is not the first time that this has happened. Indeed I wrote to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;he may or may not remember it because it is a small incident in his very busy life&#x2014;-about an incident which happened in December a year ago where something like 2,000 sheep were found in a miserable condition, dying of heat and exhaustion, crammed into trucks, by somebody who happened to go down to Newtown station to consign some horses, found these conditions and telephoned me about it. I wrote to the hon. the Minister and, as is his wont, he sent me a very polite reply saying that he had had the matter investigated, that no blame attached to the Railways but that there had not been liaison presumably with the Livestock Board. Attention had, however, been drawn to this and in future this would not happen. But, Sir, this happens over and over again. What happens apparently is that the quota is lifted: far more animals come into Newtown than can be coped with by the abattoirs and then there is this hopeless situation that nobody seems to be able to do anything about.</p>

<p>Sir, I suppose if I were sensible I would appeal immediately to the self-interest of the farmers. I find that that is always the best instinct to appeal to in this House. The farmers at least ought to get cracking on this and see that something is done because this involves loss of weight, loss of stock and loss of money for the farmers, apart from the suffering of the beasts which happens to be the thing that interests me. Anyway, something has to be done about this.</p>

<p>Now is it or is it not true, for instance, that the Government has not allowed the necessary extension to take place at the Johannesburg abattoirs? Is it or is it not true, that the Johannesburg Municipality&#x2014;for whom I hold no brief, but I do not see why they should take the blame if it is not in fact their fault&#x2014;has repeatedly requested the Government for permission to increase their facilities, and to double, if not treble, the facilities they have to offer, and is it not the Government which has forbidden this? Is it not true that a regulation which lays down that consignors may or may not request the Railways to feed and water animals en route still obtains? I am informed that there is such a regulation and that it is up to the consignor to decide whether or not he wants his animals to be watered and fed en route. If this is so, this regulation should be scrapped and consignors should have to request the Railways to water and to feed stock en route. I am told that in this recent tragedy there were horses which had been consigned from South West Africa, and they had been en route for about two weeks, during which time they were fed and watered only once. This is a disgrace to any civilized country. I realize that human beings are shunted around a lot in this country, and there is no concern for what happens to them at their destination, so one should really not be surprised that this is happening to animals.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not wrong. I suppose I should not really be surprised if this happens to animals, but I still think it is a disgrace to have such things happening in a civilized country. I am concerned about that regulation; I also do not know why there are not these facilities, but it should not be beyond the wit of a Government as powerful as this one is to see to it that the largest meat market in South Africa does have sufficient facilities to cope with this situation, and that this does not happen over and over again, as indeed it has been happening. I want to know why it was that the Meat Control Board lifted the quota without ascertaining, firstly, whether there were sufficient trucks to enable the animals to travel in relative comfort and, secondly, ascertaining that the abattoirs at the other end were able to cope with the situation; and if the abattoirs could not cope, why these animals were not taken to other sidings where they could be fed and watered until they reached their final destination, the slaughterhouse. This surely is the least that one can expect in this day and age. Johannesburg is an area which deals with thousands upon thousands of livestock and yet these conditions are continually applying. And I hope I get a better answer from the hon. the Minister when he replies to this debate than the one he gave me when I put a question to him on 6th February when he said that the difficulties experienced were brought about by the inadequate kraal facilities provided by the Johannesburg Municipality and the consequent inability of consignees to take delivery of all livestock; and that the Railways could not accept responsibility for the conditions. He went on to say that the reintroduction of the quota system by the Meat Control Board should prevent a recurrence of similar conditions. I think he certainly should institute a more searching inquiry into the matter. I think he should again find out whether it is true or not true that the municipality desires to increase its facilities, and whether it is in fact the Government which is the stumbling-block. I think he must liaise with other Ministers. He may not be at fault, but there is lack of liaison and that is what has caused the situation.</p>

<p>Now I want to pass on to something which is more important in many ways and which I have raised with the hon. the Minister again and again in this House, and I am sure I need <span class="col_753-754" refersTo="page_0389"/>not give him more than one guess as to what it is going to be. Every single year I raise with the hon. the Minister the question of the hopelessly inadequate rail facilities to Soweto, where something between 600,000 and &#x00BC; million Africans live, entirely dependent for their livelihood on their work in Johannesburg, all of them having to move from Point A to Point B in the morning at the same time to get to work, and moving back again from Point B to Point A when they return home. I have raised this matter every year, and every year I get a reassurance from the Minister that the lines have been doubled, more carriages have been ordered and more engines have been put into use. All these assurances have been given to me, and therefore I cannot understand why the position remains as abysmal as it still is, after all these years of improvement. One only has to go down to the station at rush hours to see the conditions and to realize how absolutely appalling they are. There are overcrowded trains, packed like sardines, with dangerous conditions on the stations, with people rushing and crowding in an attempt to get on the train, the sort of thing which happened when the footbridge at Dube collapsed not so long ago, when there were fatalities simply because there was a stampede of people trying to get to the station in time, knowing that if they missed that train they would not be able to get to work on time. Now I know that there are trains every 2&#x00BD; minutes at rush hours, but that is still not enough. People still have to get up at four o&#x2019;clock in the morning in order to get to work by 7.30. They get back home any time between 8 o&#x2019;clock and 9 o&#x2019;clock at night. My pleas do not seem to have made any difference, Sir. I have pointed out that the overcrowded conditions are physically dangerous. I have pointed out that this is a source of tremendous friction amongst the non-White people, particularly the Africans at Soweto. They work hard and long hours and they feel that they are entitled to better facilities. I have pointed out that the overcrowded conditions mean that they are a prey to tsotsis. Every time they receive their paypackets they are in danger of being robbed because the overcrowded trains lend themselves to these conditions. However, as I have said, I do not think that I have made very much impression on the hon. the Minister, because conditions have certainly not improved. I refer him to a voice which may have more effect on him than my small voice. That is the voice raised by members of the Johannesburg Sakekamer, at the Central Transvaal Regional Congress of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut at Vereeniging not so long ago. Every single one of the factors I have mentioned were reiterated by spokesmen at this congress. The Africans, or the Bantu as they called them, have to stand in long queues, they said. These people had long waits, and they had long journeys, even after they had reached the station in their township, Soweto. Most of them faced another half an hour walk to get to their places of work. They found that these people had to leave their homes in darkness in order to arrive at work on time. They arrived home back from work in darkness. They found that these people were packed like sardines in trains, that their wages were stolen and that they were attacked and robbed by bandits in the darkness. This does not come from me, Sir. This comes from the Sakekamer. They are worried because their labour is effected. They know perfectly well that the efficiency of people who have to put up with these conditions daily, is adversely affected. This sort of thing does not only occur now and then, when there happens to have been a breakdown on the line, and people are crowded into trains. These people have to put up with these conditions every single working day throughout the week, throughout the month and throughout the year. It is wearing, Sir. It wears down the efficiency of these people, and something has to be done about it.</p>

<p>Not only are these conditions as bad as they have been over all these years that I have been raising these matters in this House, but during the past year the hon. the Minister has increased the fares. He does not provide better service, mark you, but he puts up the fares. From 1st October, 1969 he raised the third-class rail fares for the second time in 12 months. In some cases the fare has been increased by about 14 per cent. I believe that in Durban the fares have been increased by as much as 50 per cent. The fares are now anything up to R2.80 per month. This is an enormous increase for people living below the breadline, where every solitary cent counts. I should not have to remind the hon. the Minister of the walking that took place some years ago when the bus fare was put up for the journey between Alexandra township and Johannesburg, by one cent per trip. People walked for 10 weeks in order to obviate this increase. The hon. the Minister saw reason in the end. For once this action was not put down to communist agitation. For once the hon. the Minister took the right step. He did not place the burden of the additional fees on the workers who could not afford it. Instead he instituted a transport levy. If the treasury is suffering so grievously because of the subsidy that it is paying out in respect of third-class fares, why put the burden on the workers who cannot afford it? Let the Minister increase the transport levy, if he has to. I do not think he has to. I shall tell him why I do not think he has to. He should not have to do so, because third-class fares have yielded additional revenue of 6.1 per cent anyway. And the hon. the Minister expects a further 3 per cent increase from this source during the 1969-&#x2019;70 year. What is more, as far as I can make out, the hon. the Minister has a thumping surplus on Railways. Why did he therefore have to increase these fares to this extent? This is another source of burning grievance, Sir, and the hon. the Minister ought to know it. The Africans are suffering from a sense of grievance as a result of this increase. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that he said that no <span class="col_755-756" refersTo="page_0390"/>considerable hardship was involved in the recent increases. How does he know that, Sir? Does he have any idea what the budget is like for people living in Soweto? Does he know for instance that the Johannesburg Municipality conducted a survey not long ago? They found that the cost of living in Soweto had, in the case of essential articles, increased by 12 per cent. Does he know that more than 60 per cent of those families are living below the poverty datum line of R53 a month? How can he say that a 14 per cent increase of fares is not a considerable hardship? He is wrong. It is a considerable hardship and the money must be saved somewhere else. It is very difficult to make a budget, which is as tight as these budgets, an elastic budget so as to cope with an increase in an essential expenditure like transport. It is one of the expenditures which one cannot cut down. The Minister has increased it, so the money must be found somewhere else. There are only two sources. The rents cannot be changed. They are fixed and they are also going up. It therefore comes from food to the detriment of the worker, or from clothing or fuel, the three essentials that form part of a poverty datum budget. Let me tell the House that a poverty datum budget worked out at R53 per month. This was some years ago and is probably hopelessly inadequate now in view of the increased cost of living. It makes no allowance whatever for any small luxuries in life, for any replacement of domestic appliances or anything like that. It is a budget of the barest minimum. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister, firstly, to revise his opinion and, secondly, to revise the fares and decrease them. The hon. the Minister of finance has reduced the sales tax and for that we are all very grateful. It should never have been imposed on essential commodities in the first place. It was never meant for that purpose. The hon. the Minister of Transport should now reduce the third-class rail fares which he increased.</p>

<p>On one occasion, long ago, the hon. the Minister said something that interested me. I hope he has not changed his mind since because I think he talked very good sense on that occasion. I cannot quote the exact source but he once said that if government policy forced Africans to live many miles from their work, as a result of the apartheid policy or separate development, removal schemes and so on, and forced them to commute every day, it was up to the government to subsidize their transport. The hon. the Minister was quite right. I know that the government is still subsidizing their transport costs. I am not saying that the increase in these third-class rail fares means that all subsidies have disappeared. He has, however, talked about repaying the Treasury R11 million subsidy per annum that is being paid in respect of transport. He was referring to the resettlement areas. Why should the Africans have to pay for this? The resettlement schemes are part of government ideology. Nobody among the Africans asked for them. They do hot want them. They have protested against them every single time they have been faced with them. I presume that when the hon. the Minister speaks about resettlement areas, he means Meadowlands. I hope he will tell me what he means because I cannot make head or tail out of this. He said that the increase in fares was to repay the subsidy on the resettlement areas like Soweto. I presume that he really means Meadowlands because the rest of Soweto is not a resettlement area. I hope he will explain this to me, but whatever he means, his reasoning is wrong here. Nobody living in Soweto, be it inside or outside the resettlement area, should have to repay the Treasury for a subsidy which I say the government owes to people that it forces to move a long way out of town. We not only force people to move a long way out of town resulting in their having to pay high fares for essential transport; we also have many other laws in this country which inhibit the earning capacity of Africans. We have laws that inhibit the capacity of Africans to earn a living wage. They are not allowed collective bargaining machinery. They are unable to join registered trade unions. They cannot go in for any of the closed shop occupations. Their skills are inhibited. For all these reasons they earn low wages. For this reason also, and not only because we force them to live a long way out of town, it is up to the government to subsidize essential items such as transport. I therefore raise this matter with the hon. the Minister once again. He will be glad to know that I am going to end my speech on a note of praise. [Interjections.] This might get him into trouble as I see that the hon. member for Worcester is fixing me with an eager smile. I wonder whether I should not perhaps omit this hon. member. It might do the hon. the Minister no good to have words of praise from me. It might very well be the kiss of death, who knows? All the same, I am going to go ahead.</p>

<p>The Nat vote in my constituency always goes to the United Party. We have discovered that in two elections. The Nat vote goes to the United Party, because obviously their colour policies are so much closer to each other than the policy that my party advocates. Notwithstanding that, I am afraid hon. members are going to have to put up with me for a few more years. [Laughter.] Yes. I am afraid so. I just want to say something about file Airways. I want to say that I think our Airways compare very favourably with any other airline on which I have travelled in any country in the world. As for efficiency, safety and punctuality, I think they are second to none, and I have travelled on many airlines in different countries of the world. I think the hon. the Minister could do one thing, however, namely to stop the tendency of overbooking. This is causing a lot of irritation among the users of the South <span class="col_757-758" refersTo="page_0391"/>African Airways on the internal services. Flight after flight is overbooked. People have their tickets. They book through agencies. They are entitled to believe that their tickets are valid. They get up sometimes at dawn to catch a plane and when they arrive at the airport the plane is overbooked by 10 or 12 passengers over and above capacity. I know the explanation is that the agencies overbook the flights. People do not turn up and the airways cannot take chances, but it is extremely irritating to be one of those passengers who arrives with a valid ticket and to find that one cannot get a plane after having made all the arrangements to be met at the other end. I would ask the hon. the Minister not to impair the fine record of the air service with this sort of irritation.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to ask him why he has seen fit to do away with the 60 lb. free train luggage&#x2014;I have forgotten how many kilos it is, but I shall get to that stage sooner or later &#x2014;the additional train luggage allowance granted when one was travelling by air, over the 44 lb. allowed on the plane. This was a very fine concession which was much appreciated by everybody. I do not think it could have cost the Railways very much to carry the additional baggage. I also want to ask, why do we have to go through all that intricate procedure in order to send any luggage air freight to England, for instance? In London, if one wants to send a case air freight, one simply takes it down to the air terminal and it is booked through. In Johannesburg one has to get a permit from the bank, of all things, and then go down to the Customs and have it cleared, then take it back to the Airways Office and then, if one is lucky, the case is sent through. This was my last experience. I admit it was more than a year ago. The situation may have changed since then. I want to know whether there is any special reason for all this intricate machinery, which again is a source of irritation and which I believe is an unnecessary blemish on the otherwise pretty faultless record of the South African Airways.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of her speech the hon. member for Houghton alleged that as long as the Railways functioned smoothly and efficiently it did not make that much difference if non-Whites were employed. That hon. member would, of course, welcome it most heartily if non-Whites could be employed, even in posts such as those of engine driver or conductor, as long as this resulted in the smooth functioning of the Railways. We know that her philosophy and our views in this connection differ so tremendously that we do not even want to argue with her about that.</p>

<p>With regard to the other matter she raised here at the end of her speech, the matter of the tariffs the Bantu pay for transport to the Bantu townships, the hon. member would also probably like to see the Bantu simply living among our people in the cities and our cities becoming blacker and blacker.</p>

<p>That is what I deduced from what the hon. member said. We know that this is her philosophy and I leave the matter there. I should like to make an observation in pursuance of what the hon. member for Newton Park and other Opposition members said. The hon. members wanted to make us believe that the railway people come to them with so many complaints and grievances. I represent a very large railway constituency, and the railway people in my constituency also come to me with their problems and their requests. But the difference in approach between myself, other members on this side and the members on the other side of the House in the handling of requests from railway people is that we use the normal channels. If it is a complaint, we take that request to the General Manager or to the System Manager concerned, as the case may be, or we take it directly to the hon. the Minister. I want to state here that the hon. the Minister of Transport is a person who investigates each matter and each complaint very thoroughly. It has already happened that in reply to my representations I have received a reply from the hon. the Minister running into four typed folio pages. This proves what a sympathetic ear the hon. the Minister has for the railwayman&#x2019;s affairs. But what does the Opposition do? They collect those little complaints and requests in the course of the year and then come along and submit them to the House when there is a railway debate. Then they act as if all complaints are big ones.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that he is talking nonsense now. The railway people in my constituency, Koedoespoort, will not go to the hon. member for Durban (Point) with their complaints and difficulties.</p>

<p>A great deal was said in this debate about resignations from the South African Railways. Hon. members attributed these resignations to grievances, dissatisfaction and unsatisfactory working conditions, to excessive overtime, poor remuneration or the high demands made upon the railwayman. Statistics prove that a very large percentage, i.e. 75 to 90 per cent of employees leaving the service of the Railways, make subsequent efforts to return. Very often these people come to members of Parliament to request their help in getting them back into the Railways. In many cases they actually plead to be taken back again. In 1967 there were 16,199 requests from former white employees alone for re-employment by the Railways. During the period December, 1967, to December, 1968, 18,846 white persons resigned from the Railways. Hon. members opposite will now immediately say that we should take note of the number of people resigning from the Railways. These people did not always resign as a result of excessive over <span class="col_759-760" refersTo="page_0392"/>time or as a result of the high demands made upon them, as hon. members opposite claim. Neither did they necessarily resign as a result of dissatisfaction and other grievances. A large percentage of these people resigned because they are possibly unsettled people or because in some cases they are work-shy. During the same period that I have just mentioned, 16,875 ex-railway employees applied for re-employment. This number is a little more than the number of persons who resigned during the same period. I should like to give hon. members the latest statistics.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>If that hon. member would just give me a chance I shall reply to his question.</p>

<p>The interesting aspect of this matter is that the South African Railways accepted 8,956 of the re-employment applications. What does this prove? It proves that the Railways Administration is selective in dealing with those applications. As I have said, many of the people resigning from the Railways were restless in the service. It is not because they are working on the Railways, as such, that they resign. Even if they were working for any ether employer they would possibly have done the same. Now, with re-employment, the Railways can be selective. The people the Railways re-employ are people with good records who resigned from the Railways, as the Railways Administration itself is perhaps aware, because of circumstances beyond their control. Now we come to the important point. This shows me that those people come back to the Railways because they know that the Railways is a good employer and because, comparing the Railways with their other, interim employer, they are satisfied that the Railways is, in fact, the better of the two, offering greater security than they had in the interim. It belies the Opposition argument, raised in the course of this debate, in connection with the resignation of people from the Railways and the dissatisfaction which is supposedly prevalent among them. I repeat that if the people were so dissatisfied with their previous employer they would never have returned.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of talk about the staff shortage. Almost every speaker had something to say about it. On this side of the House it was raised as a counter-argument against the arguments coming from that side of the House. We on this side of the House accept the fact that there is a staff shortage. No one is denying it. That was a string the United Party was continually strumming on, with one discord after another. We know that there is a general manpower shortage. However, this is not a shortage exclusive to the Railways. The manpower shortage is being experienced throughout the entire country. We have this shortage in the Public Service; even the highly esteemed private sector is also experiencing this problem, notwithstanding the fact that they have so many enticements for drawing people to them. We know that in this regard the Administration is applying scientific methods to combat this problem with which the Railways, like the other sectors, is saddled. In this connection the Railways looked to the future and planned accordingly. They knew that bottlenecks would develop in certain sections. That is why they made provision for dealing with and overcoming those bottlenecks. I do not want to discourse at length about this. However, we know that by mechanization and automation, by the improved training of employees and by making use of improved organizational methods, the employees&#x2019; production level can be increased. Consequently, as has been shown time and again by this side of the House, a greater quantity of work is done by a smaller staff. Yesterday the hon. member for Salt River said that he could not understand this. I realize that it is perhaps something that is very difficult for members of the Opposition to understand. This mechanization was implemented in various fields. I do not want to go into that in too much detail. However, I have a few cases in mind. For example, the use of mechanical equipment for the maintenance of tracks has resulted in a saving in staff. At the same time it also resulted in an improvement in the track surface. In addition I have in mind the improved present-day mechanical train control systems in use on certain sections of lines, ensuring that the capacity of the section concerned is increased. I have in mind, for example, the traffic which has increased; nevertheless, even with a smaller staff all the traffic offered was handled. Since 1967-&#x2019;68 this traffic has increased by almost seven million tons. All the traffic offered was handled. The tractive force was also improved by the substitution of steam locomotives by diesel and electric ones. Thus, during 1968, 93 electric and 40 diesel locomotives were taken into service, while the obsolete and useless steam locomotives were withdrawn from service.</p>

<p>I still want to refer to one small matter in connection with the attempt being made to combat the shortage of shunters. A new apparatus, something like a walkie-talkie, is now being used by means of which, in busy areas, the engine driver and the shunter can communicate directly. In this way the number of shunters on each shift can be reduced. I particularly want to refer to the application of the organization and method technique and to express a few thoughts about that. One of the steps taken, intially in the administrative Offices, was the application of the organization <span class="col_761-762" refersTo="page_0393"/>and method technique by which work is analysed, eliminated and streamlined. After the initial experimental investigation, which was very successful, it was decided to extend the organization and method technique throughout the service. The task was tackled on a scientific basis by a fully-fledged organization and method body which was established during 1968. Then the investigation was initiated. From information obtained it appears that on account of the wide field that must be covered, more suitable officials, who had taken this course, were appointed to investigate Offices and other sections. I also learned that this organization and method investigation, which also covered the reclassification of work, was not only crowned with a great deal of success, but would possibly be continued. I am aware of the fact that there are sections in the Railways where this organization and method technique is not yet being applied, i.e. in the evaluation of work and in the comparison of work with other sections. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is, in fact, also the idea to continue with this organization and method investigation in connection with work evaluation in the sections where it is not yet applicable. I should like to come to an aspect which concerns my constituency in particular. In the past, on behalf of my voters, I raised the question of air pollution here with the Minister. That smoke is caused by the mechanical workshops at Koedoespoort. The public in the immediate vicinity of the workshops complained a great deal about the air pollution caused by the foundry. Now, I do know that an investigation into this matter has, in fact, been instituted at very high level and I want to thank the hon. the Minister for that. I understand that the C.S.I.R. was approached to investigate this air pollution. Since I am asked this frequently by my voters, I just want to inquire how far this investigation has progressed.</p>

<p>At that foundry there are not only the persons working at the furnaces, but also other related workers, such as the crane-drivers, working under the same roof. We know that there has already been a great deal of investigation in this regard and that a great deal has also been spent to combat this air pollution, thereby making the working conditions more pleasant for those people. I want to convey to the Minister the thanks of the foundry workers. However, we know that that smoke is still causing a great deal of trouble. We want to express the hope that as science progresses and better methods for combating smoke come to light, the scientific methods will be applied at the foundry and the furnaces to make the task easier for the workers.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to put a question to the Opposition. This question is also in connection with this &#x201C;Booklet of 108 Promises&#x201D;, as one of my colleagues, who counted the promises, called it. This question is also concerned with the aspects raised here by the hon. member on our side of the House who spoke first and also by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District). This question concerns this United Party policy of separating the Railways, Harbours and Airways and then making them autonomous departments. I now want to ask the hon. Opposition, what then about the Pipelines? Do they also want to separate this from the Railways? If this is done they are at least being consistent since it is one of the four sectors of Transport. Last year the hon. member for Yeoville said in this connection that the Pipelines would furnish a R20 million surplus in 1969 and a R40 million surplus in 1970. The latter amount is almost as much as the shortage in the Railways over the entire country. He then said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This will be supplied by the population concentrated in the triangle Pretoria/Witwatersrand / Vereeniging.</block>

<p>Here the hon. member acknowledged that there could be a loss on the Railways as such. In this undertaking we know that one section with a surplus must supplement the shortage in another section. The pipeline was instituted in the service of the country as such, but also in the service of the Railways in order to assist the latter. The pipeline was initiated by the Railways and initially established by means of capital made available by the Railways. I should like one of the members opposite to tell us whether they also want to separate the pipeline from the other sections, because if they want to separate the other departments, they must of necessity separate the pipeline as well, if they want to be logical about it. The Opposition will probably want to divide up the pipeline profits somewhere; I do not know where this must be done. One would very much like to know what the Opposition suggests in that connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort touched upon a very interesting problem, that of the smoke nuisance or air pollution. It is a problem which has world-wide implications and with which large cities throughout the world are faced wherever there is a large concentration of industries, and it is a problem which should be tackled in good time. If it were to be neglected, we would be faced with the same problems which New York, London and other large cities have to-day. Mr. Speaker, at the mention of the words &#x201C;smoke nuisance&#x201D; or &#x201C;air pollution&#x201D;, my thoughts involuntarily turned to the following lines from Eugene Marais&#x2019;s poem entitled &#x201C;Skoppensboer&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Want swart en droef, Die hoogste troef, Oor &#x00E1;l wat roer, Is Skoppensboer.</block>

<p>I want to tell hon. members on that side that when they so boisterously announce what their political successes will be on 22nd April, they should sometimes turn their thoughts to these few lines.</p>

<p><span class="col_763-764" refersTo="page_0394"/>Mr. Speaker, it has been mentioned several times in this House that the Railways is the biggest employer in South Africa and that the South African Railways is a very large business undertaking. That is correct. It is also true that any business undertaking should strive, amongst other things, to have (a) satisfied shareholders, (to) satisfied staff and (c) satisfied clients.</p>

<p>One has satisfied shareholders when profits are made and one has a satisfied staff when the employees feel secure, when their material needs are met in a reasonable way and when their work is appreciated. One has satisfied clients when their needs are met at reasonable, fair prices. In this connection I immediately want to lodge a complaint as a client, and I shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister will inform us in this connection. I have in front of me a telex from Pretoria which deals with an airmail parcel handed in at 1 o&#x2019;clock on the morning of the 10th for dispatch with the first flight which left for Durban at 7.30. That parcel never arrived in Durban. It was traced between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on the 10th in Windhoek. The waybill number, for the information of the Minister, is 9480, and the waybill did arrive in Durban. Normally, identical addresses appear on the parcel and on the waybill. At 12,05 p.m. on the 10th it became known that that parcel was not at the Cape Town airport, and in order to get that parcel to Durban in time, a special chartered flight had to be used last night to transfer that parcel to a point from where it would not arrive in Durban too late. I want to say immediately&#x2014;and I speak from experience&#x2014;that the air freight department of the Airways usually provides very good service, and in this ease there was apparently no problem with the address, because the waybill did arrive at the correct place. The question arises whether, seen against the background of the good service which the airfreight department provides, there was deliberate sabotage in this case. I should like to get a reply to this from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which does not affect the clients of the business undertaking&#x2014;in this case the Railways &#x2014;but which affects the staff, and must be examined. I said that in a business undertaking the aim must be, amongst other things, to keep the staff happy and satisfied, because a happy and satisfied staff is a productive staff. The world in which we live demands of us that we aim for and reach higher, greater production levels. Here security involves not only physical safety&#x2014;I shall return to that later&#x2014; but also the feeling of not being threatened, the feeling of not being cheated. In this connection I must refer to a question put in this House and answered by the hon. the Minister yesterday. The question was put by the hon. member for Innesdal and concerned a circular relating to the withholding of certain disciplinary measures. The reply was laid on the Table here and I do not wish to repeat it. I just want to ask the hon. the Minister whether that suspension of disciplinary measures during the period 16th January to 16th April involves Whites or non-Whites. In the second place, I should like to ask this: Should there be any charge during the period 16th January to 16th April, charges of misdemeanours which are withdrawn in terms of this, and should the experiment to which the hon. the Minister referred in his reply not succeed, would those charges fall away, or would a member of staff who was guilty of such an offence still be liable to be punished after 16th April?</p>

<p>Sir, there is another aspect of staff security which should be attended to. Last year the hon. the Minister said in this House that 7,000 or 8,000 or 9,000 white posts were filled by non-Whites. His standpoint was that he did not want to see Whites working with picks and shovels. I support him fully in this. But from a reply given in this House yesterday, it appears that a total of 1,156 so-called &#x201C;graded staff&#x201D; posts are filled by non-Whites. My question is this: To what extent are non-Whites intruding in work traditionally held by the Whites? Can I accept that the &#x201C;graded staff&#x201D; are equivalent to skilled staff? Must I accent that it refers to administrative staff as well? If so. will the Minister tell us where those non-Whites are employed, because we have heard that there are approximately 115,000 Whites in the service of the Railways and it is surely very necessary that this country and the railway worker know where they will be threatened by the employment of non-Whites in traditional white work, if we have now passed the pick and shovel stage.</p>

<p>Another aspect of security which must be dealt with, is the physical safety of the railway worker. I am not talking about physical safety in the process of the performance of duties now I am talking about the railway worker who. as a user of the road, is exposed to the disaster of accidents at level-crossings. A great deal has been said here about level-crossings. I think the hon. members who protested so vociferously that political capital was being made out of this matter were a bit too hasty, because extremely interesting but disappointing statistics are available in this connection. I want to mention for the record that I asked the Minister for these statistics and that they reached me from his Office. [Interjection ] No, <span class="col_765-766" refersTo="page_0395"/>it is not a secret document. For the sake of the record I want to repeat a few figures which are mentioned here.</p>

<p>There are approximately 4,000 unguarded level-crossings in South Africa, and the elimination of these, according to an estimate which may not be very scientific because it has to be done in the future in a time of rising prices, will cost about R800 million, and the cost of installing improved protective devices will be approximately R80 million. We have also heard that since April, 1928, 752 crossings have been eliminated and 276 unguarded crossings made safe at a cost of R35 million. But now I come to the statistics which I find really shocking. I asked the hon. the Minister what the death toll at unguarded crossings was and the reply was that no distinction was drawn between accidents at unguarded and those at guarded crossings, but that the death toll was furnished for the total. In the 10 years from 1909-10 to 1918-&#x2019;19 there were 132 deaths at level-crossings. For the next 10 years it was 234, for the next 10 years 397, for the next 10 years 465, for the next 10 years 667, and for the next 10 years, ended 30th June, 1969. it was 703. Over the 60 years there were 2,598 deaths in accidents at level-crossings, which is an average of 43 a year. The average rose from 13.2 to 70.3 a year. The lowest number of deaths in any one year was seven in 1916-&#x2019;17, and the highest number 97 in 1955-&#x2019;56. I investigated these matters as a result of the statement made by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom, and I quote from the unrevised copy of his Hansard, where he dealt with the plea for the elimination of level-crossings. He said that in putting forward this plea these hon. members were in fact defending carelessness, thoughtlessness and transgression of the law.</p>

<p>I want to test the truth of this, and a good criterion for that would be to compare the number of licensed vehicles with the number of casualties over the years, and this produced the following very interesting information. I have left horse-carts and ox-wagons out of account, because one can accept that those vehicles move relatively slowly. [Interjections.] I have obtained statistics on the number of licensed motor vehicles, including lorries, commercial vehicles, motorcycles and buzz-bikes, but excluding tractors and vehicles which are granted exemption from registration, i.e. State vehicles. I found that in the year 1919, for every 3,077 registered vehicles, one person was killed. That figure rose through the years to 30,0 vehicles for one death. If the same ratio had been maintained, ten times as many people would have been killed for the 30,000 vehicles in the year 1968-&#x2019;69; that is to say, instead of 703 it would have been 7,030, but the ratio dropped.</p>

<p>Yes, there were, and you will be surprised to know how many. There were 40,000 licensed motor vehicles in the year 1919-&#x2019;20. The hon. member misunderstands the matter completely and I shall have to give him a lesson. I am talking about ratios. There were about 2.1 million vehicles in the year 1969. [Interjections.] Does the hon. member not understand my point? My point is in fact to prove that the citizens have become more law abiding and more careful, but that in spite of this the actual number of accidents have increased every year.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I know the story. The point is that the elimination of crossings is so tremendously important a matter that the rate at which it is being done is much too slow and the position has been reached where we no longer dare allow money to be spent on matters which, on the basis of merit, cannot be compared with this. It will be an indictment of this Government if they leave this very important matter in abeyance and continue with the elimination and protection of crossings at this slow rate. This matter is of great importance to me personally because in a certain part of my constituency there is a large primary school which is served by school buses which cross four crossings 16 times a day. In addition there is a high school which also makes use of such buses. Those school buses go over the crossings eight times a day. That community has for many years been agitating and asking for the protection or elimination of those crossings. Hon members must not say that I am trying to make political capital out of this, because I have here a copy of a telegram which was sent by a non-political body. I wish to read the telegram for the record. It was sent to the hon. the Minister of Transport. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is a very fair question, and I shall give a very fair reply to it. I had made representations to the hon. the Minister in regard to a specific crossing. That crossing was not in this area. It was near Rosslyn, where a few tragic accidents occurred, and where quite a few people died. Within the bounds of what was practical and possible, the hon. the Minister tried to rectify that matter as quickly as possible. I want to say this in all fairness. For this reason I have brought this matter to his attention as well, because I believe that if it is practically possible to rectify this matter, it will in fact be done. Hon. members must not try to attribute the same suspicion which is in their minds, to everybody else. I want to emphasize that this matter is very urgent. In the light of the statistics which I mentioned, urgent attention must be given to it, and not as slowly as in tile past.</p>

<p>There is another matter which requires attention. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) pointed out that the salaries for Whites increased from R910 on 31st March, 1948, to R2,962 on 31st March, 1969. If he works this out, he will find that there was an increase of R2,052. Expressed as a percentage, this amounts to an increase of 225 per cent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member must do his sums again. The increase is exactly 225 per cent. The hon. member suggested by that that the railway worker should be satisfied with the increases and compensations he received. By way of comparison I just want to point out something else. According to the statistical quarterly bulletin of the Reserve Bank for September, 1960, the gross domestic product at market prices was &#x00A3;978 million in the year 1948. It is estimated that the gross domestic product at market prices for the year 1969 will be approximately R11,023 million. This represents an increase of R9,067 million, which is equal to an increase of 463 per cent. The increase of 225 per cent sounds very large until one compares it with these statistics. Then it does not seem quite so favourable any more.</p>

<p>It is important to note the composition of the staff of the transport services. It appears from a thesis for a doctorate, &#x201C;Die Afrikaner in die beroepslewe van die stad&#x201D; (The Afrikaner in urban professional life), by Dr. S. van Wyk, that about 75 per cent of the total establishment of the South African Railways and transport services is comprised of Afrikaners. If one considers the Afrikaner&#x2019;s contribution to the development of the country by performing this important work, if one considers the Afrikaner&#x2019;s possessions in the private sector, and if one compares the increase in remuneration with the increase in the gross domestic product, one gets the impression that these people have been left behind along the way. This is a matter which cannot indefinitely remain without being attended to. Serious attention must be given to it.</p>

<p>Many speakers referred to another aspect, namely the shortage of manpower. It was shown, in some cases successfully, in others not, what is being done to overcome the manpower shortage. I want to suggest that one important aspect of the manpower shortage, or rather the shortage of technicians, to put it correctly, has not yet received attention here. I want to point out that there is no sense in bringing people into this country, through immigration or through natural increase, only for their active contribution to the country&#x2019;s economy to be cut short as a result of their dying cruel deaths on our roads. If one considers what is happening on our roads, one is simply shocked. There is only one year in respect of which full statistics are available, and from these it appears that in the first ten months of 1968 there were no fewer than 138,0 road accidents, in which 241,000 vehicles were involved and which resulted in a death toll of 4,800, of whom 1.176 were Whites. The rest were non-Whites. If these statistics are used to calculate the average figure per month and this is projected over the year as a whole, it appears that in the year 1968 about 165,0 road accidents occurred, in which 289,0 vehicles were involved, and which resulted in a death toll of about 5,760. the white component of which was about 1,400. This is a grave problem which is seriously increasing, because in only the first three months of 1969 there were 44,778 road accidents. That is to say, 5,463 more than in the comparative period in the previous year. This represents an increase of 14 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member must excuse me for not following him in his arguments I believe the hon. the Minister will reply to the arguments advanced by the hon. member. I want to address my remarks to the hon. dead sheep of the United Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I did not intend participating in this Railways debate, but I am perhaps forced to do so as a result of certain statements which were made here and which I think are incorrect. I just want to assure the railway worker that his security lies in the hands of the National Party Government and the Minister of Transport. They will defend and protect to the death the white railway worker and every other worker in the Railways. But what the Opposition would like to see happening and will do nothing to prevent from happening, is that when the manpower shortage in our country has reached saturation point and when such major expansions on the Railways can no longer take place, the white workers should be dismissed, or that the non-White worker should be dismissed and white workers be appointed in their place. That is what the United Party wants to see. The way I know the Government and the Minister, I want to give the assurance that such protection to the railway worker will be guaranteed at all times so that he will never have to go and do work previously done by non-Whites.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a few matters concerning the agricultural sector served by the Railways. Mention was made this afternoon of the conveyance of fodder to certain parts of our country. I want to say now that, where such problems have arisen, the Railways cannot accept sole responsibility for such a state of affairs. The Railways is least responsible for this. We know that certain grades of mealies are specified on the orders given to the Mealie Board, for example. Those orders are then placed at certain depots of the Mealie Board. When mealies of the grades specified are not available, the orders are forwarded to other depots. Hon. members opposite now expect every depot to be provided with trucks, whether such depots receive orders or not. After all, we know about these problems. Do hon. members expect the Railways to keep a supply of trucks there they cannot use? After all, we do not know of which depots the orders are going to be placed and what the nature of the orders will be that are going to be placed at the various mealie depots. Surely, this is unreasonable and unrealistic.</p>

<p>I now come to the overcrowding of animals at the abattoirs. I want to ask the hon. member for Newton Park, who spoke on this subject. whether he has really acquainted himself with the facts of the matter. When speaking about matters such as these, we must make a point of first acquainting ourselves with the real facts in question. One will not find one single farmer who is not prepared to express his regret about this matter. It is a pity that farmers have not only suffered losses, but that animals have had to suffer as well. But if something of this nature happens as a restult of coincidence of circumstances and when nobody in particular can be blamed for it, we should not pretend that only certain people are responsible for it. From 9th to 23rd January this overcrowding of livestock occurred. We regret the fact that losses were suffered, but the losses were not so great as hon. members tried to make out here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Were the losses not 300?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>No, the losses were much higher. I shall deal with that presently. The information of the hon. member is not even correct as far as that is concerned. During the whole of that period 673 sheep died, as well as 16 head of cattle and 50 pigs. I now want to ask hon. members what number of livestock died in January of the previous year. What was the number of animals that died during December compared with the number that died in January? Compensation amounting to R5.969 was paid to farmers in respect of the 673 sheep, 16 head of cattle and 50 pigs. This price does not make any difference to any assessment during any time in the past two years. I am glad we have such a scheme in terms of which provision is made when farmers suffer losses such as these. Could the hon. member assure us that these losses were suffered as a reult of something the Railways had done? We accept that the figure regarding the number of deaths is correct. This is the number of animals that died during the period November to January, while the livestock were being transported by rail. We know that December and January are exceptional months, because sheep have a difficult time in the heat. Furthermore, a terrible heatwave prevailed during that time. These sheep died from prussic acid poisoning during that period. I investigated the matter personally and so did the cooperative societies. What proof is there then that the Railways was responsible for these deaths?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Was it not as a result of the long period of transportation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>No. Many farmers have made representations to me that we should no longer provide livestock with fodder and water at points of off-loading, for example at De Aar. This was mentioned by the hon. member for Upington. I have been inundated with requests from farmers in this connection during the past year. The farmers allege that when sheep are off-loaded at points of offloading, they do not eat or drink and that the farmers nevertheless have to pay for this facility. The hon. member now accuses the Railways and the hon. the Minister that livestock <span class="col_771-772" refersTo="page_0398"/>were still being fed and watered at these points of off-loading notwithstanding the requests made in this connection. I regret that some hon. members get up in this House and raise matters without having acquainted themselves with the actual facts. What is the function of the Railways? The function of the Railways is to provide the trucks at the various loading points on the date allowed by the quota, for example on a Wednesday or a Friday, providing application was made well in time. Another function of the Railways is to convey and deliver the livestock loaded on the days concerned, to and at the proper destination at the specified time. Hon. members may perhaps be able to mention one or two consignments in respect of which matters went wrong, but generally the hon. member for Newton Park cannot give any proof of livestock which were supposed to arrive at Newtown market on a Saturday afternoon but which did not arrive at the appointed time. The hon. the Minister will probably give hon. members the reasons for the overcrowding in certain cases at a later stage. However, I should like to ask hon. members what the Meat Board and the hon. the Minister can do when the sidings to abattoirs get out of order twice on the same day. This is what happened. When the number of animals intended for slaughtering at a certain time of the day cannot be slaughtered, the facilities for the watering and feeding of animals which are to arrive the next day, become inadequate. Whose fault is that? The report of the Commission is being awaited at the moment and we do not want to provide facilities now which will force up the marketing costs to such an extent in future that farmers will not be able to afford it. To my mind the hon. the Minister has made a wise decision. I also think that a solution for this problem will be found in the near future.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. the Minister, the Railways Administration and the railway worker for the diligence they displayed in the past. I want to thank them for the high sense of responsibility they displayed during the years of service they rendered to the agricultural industry. The sense of responsibility of the railway worker will always be appreciated and recognized by the National Party. For that reason we are sure that the safety and security of the railway worker will be guaranteed. We cannot blame the railway workers as a whole for carrying out their duties inadequately and incorrectly merely because of the negligence displayed by one or two people in the service of the Railways who sometimes make mistakes. I want to thank the hon. the Minister and the railway personnel for having retained their sense of responsibility under all circumstances and for having done their best to accommodate the farming community, so much so that our railway workers threw hundreds of buckets of water over the animals in the trucks to try and save them, although it was not their job to do so. All the Railways receives, is complaints. It has become a habit of the Opposition always to level accusations against the Railways and the railway workers while they never try and protect them or express towards them the appreciation they deserve. I want to express my appreciation for the fact that the hon. the Minister and the railway officials have always done their duty, even in the coincidence of circumstances which were responsible for this incident.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not a farmer. The hon. member for Prieska will, I am sure, excuse me if I do not follow him in regard to his remarks concerning the trucking of animals. I believe the hon. member for Newton Park has expressed the point of view of this side of the House. The attention of the hon. the Minister has been adequately drawn to this matter. I hope the hon. the Minister will take cognizance of the remarks made by both sides of the House.</p>

<p>However, there was one aspect of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech which I feel I must react to. The hon. member for Prieska said that this hon. Minister would protect the rights of the White worker to the bitter end. Under this Minister a fragrant breach of Nationalist party policy is taking place. It is not something which we condemn. We regard it as an enlightened phenomenon. However, integration in the Railways is taking place at a very high rate under this particular hon. Minister. If the hon. member will listen to the figures I shall quote later on, I am sure he will be forced to agree with me.</p>

<p>I want to refer with regret and disappointment to the fact that the annual report of the General Manager has not been made available to the House before this debate. We had a short session of Parliament in 1966. Then we were called upon to vote R480 million for the part appropriation of the Railways. During this short session we are being called upon to vote an amount of R650 million. Yet we have not had the opportunity of making an examination of the report of the General Manager. Before the last short session, the report was issued on the 27th January, if my memory serves me correctly, and the similar debate took place in this House on the 2nd February. I realize that in subsequent years the release of the report has come later and later. However, it is important particularly for the Opposition, to have access to the report. I can only assume that its non-publication before the debate on the railway part appropriation is due, in part, to the labour crisis which exists in the railway service. This is one result of the critical staff shortage. I believe that the staff shortage in this respect is now hampering even the work of Parliament.</p>

<p>I would like to refer to another critical staff situation. That is in regard to the four harbours in South Africa. I will confine my remarks mainly to the harbours of Durban and Cape Town, because I believe that in so far as the other two ports, Port Elizabeth and East London, are concerned, the problem is not so acute, and that the traffic they are required to <span class="col_773-774" refersTo="page_0399"/>carry as a result of certain international events, is not so heavy. The ships of 55 nations use the ports of South Africa, mainly Durban and Cape Town since the closing of the Suez Canal. It has been said often by authoritative spokesmen on the government side of the House that the closing of the Suez Canal has been to South Africa a great financial advantage by virtue of the sea traffic which is using our ports and the ancillary services that have been called in; the supplies that have been sold; and the labour it has provided.</p>

<p>I just want to deal with this one aspect concerning Durban&#x2019;s harbour. I know that other representations at a high level have been made to the hon. the Minister by responsible bodies in regard to other aspects of Durban Harbour. I believe that this is something which requires the urgent attention of the hon. the Minister. One has only to look at the congestion of shipping that waits outside Cape Town and Durban to realize the magnitude of the problem. I think that the problem has been aggravated by the fact that there is lack of sufficient staff to deal with the work inside the harbours themselves. I do not say this inadvisedly. I want to point out, too, to the hon. the Minister and know that he will agree with me, that as far as the harbours are concerned, they are quite a good money spinner for his department. In fact, in 1968 the surplus earnings over expenditure of the harbours in South Africa amounted to no less than R22 million. This is something which we cannot disregard. What I do wonder about is the extent of the loss which various shipping companies, based in South Africa, are being called upon to bear as a result of unnecessary delays in many instances, which are occurring in the two harbours due to a shortage of staff. It is disturbing that the staff situation in Durban is worse than it ever was. I would Say that Durban could be regarded possibly as the biggest and one of the most important harbours in the link that we have to-day between the East and the West. When we examine the latest position we find that there has been an increase in the number of authorized posts in the Durban Harbour, of 676. This is a figure which was supplied after the figure of May, 1969. When we go into other facts we find that the number of permanently filled posts, despite this increase of authorized posts by 676, is one post less than it was in May of last year. When we come to the position of temporarily filled posts, we find that there has been an improvement, namely seven more posts which have been filled on a temporary basis. As far as the number of casual servants working in the Durban Harbour area is concerned, that number too has decreased. There are now 29 less. According to figures given to me yesterday, the picture at the moment is as follows. Of the total authorized posts in Durban Harbour totalling 4,262, less than half are filled by permanent personnel. Including the temporary and the casuals, the overall shortage amounts to 24 per cent. I think this is a very serious position indeed. I should like the hon. the Minister to explain how he expects the Durban Harbour to operate efficiently under the stress and strain which have existed since the closing of Suez and whether he has in mind any steps which will alleviate this staff shortage. If so, it would be appreciated if he could tell the House what those steps would be. On the general aspects of staff and labour, I have already referred to the fact that the Minister appears to be flouting government opinion in his approach to the labour problems in the South African Railways. I reiterate that we on this side of the House do not condemn the Minister for this. We congratulate him for this new and enlightened approach to this problem. However, I believe that this hon. Minister&#x2019;s behaviour only serves, to highlight the impracticability and the hollow mockery of this Government&#x2019;s labour policy. In order to make any point, I wish to quote further figures which have been supplied to me on an official basis. In 1966 I was told that there were 686 Coloureds, Indians and Bantu who were doing temporary work normally performed by White graded staff. Yesterday, roughly four years later, the figure has almost doubled to 1,162. These are non-Whites who are temporarily performing work which is normally done by white graded staff. In addition the reply indicated that over 14,000 Coloureds, Indians and Bantu were performing work formerly done by unskilled and ungraded workers. We must examine the salary conditions under which they are being employed. I would say that they, are being employed under conditions which almost amount to sweated labour. I say this because out of more than 16,000 non-white employees, only 526, a mere 3 per cent find themselves in the position that their salaries and their bonuses exceed R2 per working day. The amount of R2 per working day has been regarded over the years as a reasonable minimum wage for non-white workers. That was the amount considered to be the minim wage almost 10 years ago. Here we find to-day that only 3 per cent of the non-white employees are enjoying a wage in excess of this minimum which was regarded as being reasonably adequate 10 years ago. The overall record of the Railways in this connection is very bad. Out of the 92,000 Bantu who are employed on the South African Railways, less than 5 per cent are earning more than R2 per working day. This proportion compares very unfavourably with the figure which applies to private enterprise.</p>

<p>The insular attitude in regard to government policy which has been adopted by this hon. Minister goes a little further than this. Yesterday I asked the hon. the Minister whether he could give approximate figures of the annual loss or of the annual contributions which are being made by the Railways in terms of government policy in regard to Bantu suburban rail services and Bantu suburban road services. Secondly, I asked him a question in regard to the annual loss or contribution concerning incentives to border industries. The answer that was given to me was a double <span class="col_775-776" refersTo="page_0400"/>&#x201C;no.&#x201D; In other words, there is no loss in either of the cases, and no contribution is being made. In my second question I asked the hon. the Minister if there were any other sources which involved any loss or any contribution by his department. The answer again was &#x201C;No&#x201D;, in other words, a very positive negative.</p>

<p>I want now to refer further to the Minister&#x2019;s attitude, particularly in regard to staff and overtime problems. I want to lay at the Minister&#x2019;s door the blame for his failure to deal with long-distance passenger train services. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to adopt an enlightened approach to this problem. I believe that the archaic approach which this Government has adopted for many years to this question of speeding up passenger train services has resulted in a significant proportion of overtime costs, which eventually are met from the pockets of the taxpayer. But, Sir, on a human level I believe the Minister has a right to be concerned. What of the manpower situation? Key personnel are required to spend unnecessary hours, occupied in working passenger trains which are operating on outmoded schedules which have never been up-dated in so far as developments in regard to the track, signalling and other modern improvements are concerned. Surely some of the time saved by these people, if trains were operating on efficient and faster schedules could be spent by them with their families. Time spent with one&#x2019;s family nowadays seems to become a rare commodity. I believe that this is an aspect which the taxpayer must take into consideration because in the end-result it is affecting the amount which he is paying to the State, through wasted time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I say that the Minister has failed to go along with the times in regard to the running times of passenger trains because, apart from one train, the Trans-Natal. he himself said in 1965, I think, that there had been no alteration in overall running times. Sir, I may be wrong in so far as certain developments in the Eastern Cape are concerned but basically many of what are regarded almost as our crack passenger trains have enjoyed no improvement in their running times. In fact in so far as trains running between Durban and Cape Town are concerned, the benefit derived from the opening of the new section between Pentridge and Umlaas Road is nullified along the line because the Minister told me that there was a saving of, I believe, 20 minutes in one direction and nine minutes in the other direction, but this is negated because the trains either sit in stations or go more slowly from point to point on other sections.</p>

<p>Arising out of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comment yesterday concerning the Harrismith-Kroonstad electrification scheme&#x2014;I understood from the Minister that the section between Harrismith and Bethlehem is now in operation &#x2014;I would like to ask him what plans there are for speeding up the running times on that section and whether he can give an indication as to what the overall saving in time will be, on passenger trains which will be traversing this newly electrified route.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I will be the first to admit that the decline in patronage of long-distance passenger trains is not a problem unique to South Africa; it is a world-wide problem, but then I would be the first to say that many other countries in the world are dealing with this problem. They realize that if they wish to regain some of the traffic lost over the years through increasing plane travel and through the increasing use of private motor-cars, they have to offer the travelling public something special. In Europe, I believe, there is a trend back to travelling in comfort on properly operated, speedy, efficiently run passenger train services. You know, Sir, this could almost be regarded as a hardy annual on my part. I raised this matter in 1962. I dealt specifically with the Orange Express. I thought I made a good case. I quoted figures which to my mind proved&#x2014;they were not contradicted&#x2014;that the improvement in running times had not kept pace with the improvements in the track, electrification and tractive power. Since then I have raised this matter over the years during this debate and twice the Minister has reacted. Twice I have been the recipient of pleasant flattery from the Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, it is not my intention to re-tell the sad saga of the air-conditioned dining saloons. I am sure the Minister will remember, as I do, that in 1963 he made promises which have taken up to seven years to implement. When these air-conditioned dining saloons finally made their appearance on the track from the drawing boards an interval of time had elapsed, but apart from that the cost had increased considerably. The cost was estimated in 1963 but the taxpayers who had to pay for these particular dining saloons in 1968-&#x2019;69 had to pay considerably more than the estimated figure.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to refer to this slow delivery of coaching stock because I believe that it is having a very serious effect on the image of the S.A. Railways in so far as passengers are concerned. I know that we have had what I have come to regard as very pious statements in the annual report of the General Manager about the achievements and the number of new coaching stock placed in service, but when one surveys the overall position and bears in mind the number of very ancient ones that have had to be withdrawn, the net gain does not really keep pace with the requirements of first-, second-, and third-class long-distance passengers travelling on the S.A. Railways. I believe, as I have said before, that many users of the S.A. Railways who should be encouraged to use the long-distance facilities provided, never have a chance to enjoy the limited modern facilities that are available because it is only the regular passenger trains which enjoy these limited facilities of air-conditioned dining saloons and air-conditioned lounge cars. The majority of holiday makers and people who use the trains at seasonal peak periods find themselves conveyed to their destinations in the older type of rolling stock and suffer the draught and heat of the old-fashioned dining saloons.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he cannot tell this House&#x2014; he has been asked on many occasions&#x2014;when he is going to introduce air-conditioning on the important passenger runs? Sir, I believe that we are very far behind many civilized countries. I believe we are further behind than India, for instance; we are far behind Australia and we are far behind other countries where the air-conditioning of most forms of transport seems to be very, very much ahead of ours. The only air-conditioned train of which we can boast is the Blue Train, but its accommodation is strictly limited to, I believe, about 106 passengers. Sir, what about the other people? I referred this matter to the hon. the Minister some years ago and I pointed out the unpleasant experience of any traveller who had to journey through the Karoo in one of our allegedly crack passenger trains during the heat of the day without air-conditioning in the compartment. Do you know, Sir, what the Minister&#x2019;s reaction was? He drew my attention to the days when he as a man on the footplate had to work that section on a steam locomotive. Now I realize that that must have been a very arduous experience but I suggest that the Minister should realize that time marches on and that if he wishes to provide the people of South Africa with something commensurate to the times in which we live, he must not adopt that attitude. He must really give us some indication of what is being done in the planning stage and the implementation stage as far as air-conditioning goes. I have been led to believe that experiments have been made which might lead one to assume that possibly some of the new coaching stock could be adapted to air-conditioning on a general scale for long-distance passenger trains, and I want to ask the Minister whether he will take the House into his confidence and indicate what those plans are. I believe that if the Minister wants greater public support he must deliver the goods.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he can give us up-to-date information in regard to the stage of development of the two Blue Trains for which Parliament voted the initial expenditure some years ago. Could he say when they are likely to be on the tracks?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member is more at home among his herbs and bushes than among trains, but I shall leave the matter there. I want to refer to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s opening address in this debate, when he once more recalled the achievement of the S.A. Airways in inaugurating a new route. I am now mindful of the fact that in referring personally to the hon. the Minister we shall once more hear the scornful laughter from the other side, and that they will say that all we can do is praise the Minister. But despite that, since the matter has been called to mind again, I nvertheless want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister and his planners once more for the way in which the S.A. Airways was provided with an alternative route when Africa was closed to us. As the hon. the Minister rightly said, this had to take place within the space of a few hours, and it is a fact that is known throughout the world and that has placed the South African Airways in very high esteem among its competitors, i.e. that they could switch over to that alternative route without missing a single flight. We want to thank the Minister for the part he personally played in that and for his almost prophetic foresight.</p>

<p>I want to refer to certain staff aspects which featured in a regular complaint from the other side of the House. The hon. members opposite are now the self-appointed recipients of complaints from the workers in the S.A. Railways. In season and out of season the hon. members want to serve as self-appointed <span class="col_779-780" refersTo="page_0402"/>spokesmen in respect of things that are organized in a very orderly and efficient way in any case. In the S.A. Railways there are the seven staff associations and they in turn have come together in the Federated Staff Association which holds an annual congress. After that congress the executive committee of that Staff Association meets the hon. the Ministei and the Railways Board. In that way staff matters are discussed at a high and very efficient level. In fact, there is not a single aspect of the conditions of service of railway personnel that cannot be brought home directly to the Railways Board, to the Management of the Railways and to the Minister through these channels. Matters such as working conditions are discussed on those occasions. The classification and grading of staff are discussed there. Matters concerning salaries, fringe benefits, pensions and housing are all channelled through the staff associations to the Federated Staff Association congresses, and from there to the Management and to the Minister. In addition, the best and most cordial relations exist between those associations on the one hand and the hon. the Minister on the other, and this has always been the case. The best relations have always prevailed, and the greatest degree of mutual trust exists between these staff associations and the Management.</p>

<p>But it is also clear to us that there is something else going on here. These 117,000 white railway workers are among the happiest people in their line of service, with the representations they can make through their staff associations to the Management and to the Minister, and in consequence we have the greatest degree of peace and quiet in that labour sphere. Hon. members opposite cannot possibly rejoice at this peace and quiet prevailing in this sphere. That is why they come here as self-appointed agitators to disbrub that peace and quiet prevailing between the Management and the Minister on the one hand, and the staff associations on the other. But we must bear in mind that when these representations are made by the staff associations through those channels, and they consult the Management and the Minister but cannot reach agreement about certain representations, this is still not the last of the measures they can adopt in order to obtain satisfaction. There is additional machinery that can be set in motion. In the case of a dispute they have the opportunity of asking for a commission. The State President may then appoint a commission to go into the matter in greater detail, and such a commission represents the staff associations as well as the Management. On that commission the matter can then be settled at a high level. To the best of my knowledge there is one such commission at present engaged in adjudicating upon a particular dispute. In the past we have had the most cordial relations and this continues to be the case. All the United Party wants to do with their agitation is to place our staff associations on the same level as the British trade unions, in order to create the same kind of unrest and the same unhappy conditions here</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) is in the House, because I want to settle a few matters with him. Last night he made certain allegations in this debate which cannot be allowed to pass because they are quite easily capable of the wrong interpretation and because I think that he did not present the facts quite correctly. He had a question on the Order Paper and the hon. the Minister gave him certain answers. Then he drew further conclusions, which he used last night in his speech. I want to refer to some of the erroneous conclusions he drew from the reply he received. He referred here to the shifts worked by the pilots of the South African Airways. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We find that some of these pilots are bringing in these huge aircraft after having worked a continuous shift of 91/2 hours. This is the case on domestic flights, when they are perpetually landing and taking off.</block>

<p>It was probably an unfortunate choice of words to say that on the domestic flights the pilots have to land and take off perpetually. The word he used was &#x201C;perpetually&#x201D;. I think it was an unfortunate choice of words. That hon. member also flies with the South African Airways. Surely he knows that this 91/2-hour shift is the maximum allowed. It is the maximum laid down for pilots of the South African Airways. The hon. member knows that there is a great deal of tolerance within that limit, but let us assume, for the sake of his argument, that that maximum shift is worked. There are surely interim landings, and those landings are not &#x2018;perpetual&#x201D;, as he is trying to imply. The most landings are made on a flight which leaves from Johannesburg, lands in Cape Town and then make a turn again along the coast at Durban before returning to Johannesburg. There are consequently interim periods in which the pilots are not landing or taking off.</p>

<p>There may be six landings. That is quite correct, but what is the present-day routine in the cockpit of a passenger aircraft of this type? It is neither such strenuous nor such dangerous work as the hon. member wants to imply. There are surely the routine portions of a flight when the pilot relaxes. There are surely routine portions of a flight when the aricraft&#x2019;s automatic pilot keeps it on course. Surely, it is not right for him to try to create the impression among the public that these aircraft are still piloted in the way in which he, if he is a pilot, probably learned to fly, i.e. with a stick gripped between his knees to try and keep the aircraft on course. A Boeing aircraft is no longer controlled in this fashion.</p>

<from><span class="col_781-782" refersTo="page_0403"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>What about international flights? Why do you not speak about them?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I shall also go into that aspect. If there is ever more routine work and more tranquillity it is, in fact, on an international flight. Let us take a typical international flight. Let us take the new service between Cape Town and London. The aircraft takes off at Cape Town and lands in Luanda about three or four hours later. At about 10 p.m. it takes off from there and lands at 2 or 3 a.m. the following morning on Sal Island or on Las Palmas. What happens after the aircraft has taken off from Luanda and before it lands again at Sal Island or at Las Palmas? During that time the most important task is to keep the aircraft&#x2019;s height and course correct and to ensure that everything is going according to the normal routine for a Boeing aircraft. If there has ever been a wonderful discovery in science then it is the modern aircraft turbine which peacefully drones on hour after hour without any attention whatsoever from the pilot or the cockpit personnel. Surely the hon. member knows this. If there is ever a pleasant and enjoyable experience it is to sit and chat to the captain in his cockpit on that flight, and to watch this gigantic monster rushing along peacefully and safely 300 miles from the nearest land. The personnel of such an aircraft are changed at one of those interim landings. Another team then takes over. They take off between 2 and 3 a.m. and then they land later that morning in London, Frankfurt or Rome, or wherever the aircraft is heading for. If there is ever a peaceful and enjoyable routine adopted, then it is specifically the routine of the personnel of those overseas flights.</p>

<p>I also want to object to certain other things the hon. member said. He referred to the reply the hon. the Deputy Minister gave in respect Of the training of pilots on our aircraft. I have the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply here before me. Let us take one of the types of aircraft dealt with in his question. The part of his question referring to the Boeing 727 aircraft concerns our internal service. According to the reply the hon. the Deputy Minister gave him, the training of a pilot for such an aircraft takes about <i>23/4</i> months, consisting of five weeks of lectures on the ground, 40 hours of simulator training and 10 hours of flight training. The hon. member objects to the 10 hours of flight training. He says that those 10 hours are barely enough in which to complete two trips from Johannesburg, via the coast and back to Johannesburg. However, the pilots do not do their flight training in that way. The hon. member has the wrong end of the stick. After they have completed their simulator training, the 10 hours of flight training include take-offs and landings with instructors. This is done at an airport. It does not include routine flights at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>At every airport?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>No, not at every airport. I am coming to that, if the hon. member would just not be in such a hurry. His problem is that his tongue is quicker than his intellect. He cannot keep pace. What happens in practice is that this pilot first attends lectures, then he receives his simulator training. If the hon. member were to take the trouble to try to fly the simulator at Jan Smuts Airport, he would find out what simulator training is all about. He would then find out that precisely what is included in simulator training, and what it is all about. I can assure him that it is one of the most intensive types of training any man could possibly receive. After the pilot has completed his simulator training he is given ten hours of practical flight training by a senior instructor of the Airways. They take off and they land, and they take certain emergency action that may be necessary in certain cases. The pilot then learns to deal with any of these emergencies. This is something that cannot be done when there are passengers on board. That is why I want to rid the public of the impression that a pilot is being trained while flying from Johannesburg, via the coast back to Johannesburg again. People are not trained in this way. In those ten hours certain manoeuvres take place which do not take place when passengers are on board. After those ten hours the routine flights begin. Then he takes the right-hand seating position and flies in the company of a senior captain. Numerous routine flights are made, and then he lands at all the South African airports under actual airways operational conditions and under the control of the senior captain. Senior captains are still in charge of the flight. After he has completed many hours of this, and after he can handle the routine work to the satisfaction of the senior men, he becomes a commanding Officer. Only then does he become a senior captain of the aircraft. The hon. member is creating a wrong impression among our people in South Africa if he says that this is not so.</p>

<p>Something I also object to is another statement the hon. member made. Referring to the ten-hour training period he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wonder whether this is not why we have had more and more reports of bumpy landings and of bad take-offs.</block>

<p>I am now quoting from the hon. member&#x2019;s Hansard.</p>

<block name="quote">In the case of the Boeing 737, it is considered that only five hours&#x2019; flying time is sufficient to train a man adequately to take control of the aircraft.

<p>Then comes the sentence I read a moment ago, i.e.: &#x201C;I wonder whether this is not why we have had more and more reports of bumpy landings and of bad take-offs.&#x201D; Is the hon. member satisfied now? I have now read what he wanted me to.</p>

<p>I merely asked the hon. the Minister a question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member is making a speech at the same time as I am. He is welcome to do so, but I now want to ask him: How does one make a bad take-off with a Boeing? Could the hon. member explain this to the House? Sir, there is no such thing. What complaints does he receive about bad take-offs? The routine is such that all takeoffs, with the type of Boeing he is referring to, are the same. He surely knows this, He knows that the weight of the aircraft &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>You do not have a clue what you are talking about.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I know that the hon. member does not know what he is talking about. It is very clear from the hon. member&#x2019;s Hansard that he does not know what he is talking about. Before the pilot takes off, the weight, the quantity of fuel and the temperature are all taken into consideration. When the aircraft reaches the required speed it is lifted from the ground with simply nothing else to be done in between. It either lifts off the ground or it does not. As far as aviation is concerned, that hon. member&#x2019;s intellect has not lifted off the ground yet. There is no such thing as a bad take-off. I do not know what complaints he received, because there is no such thing. Such a thing cannot exist. In addition the South African Airways is accused of being guilty of bad take-offs, something that is physically impossible and does not exist. Such a thing is simply not possible. They are also accused of bad landings. The technique in the South African Airways differs essentially from that, for example, current in America. The South African Airways is specifically known for the fact that we apply a technique which is essentially different from the training our pilots receive in the U.S.A. on the same type of aircraft: one simply needs to ask any international traveller about this. For the sake of clarity let us just look at the American technique. The American pilot&#x2019;s technique is to select a point at the end of the runway and then to land on that point at all costs, at a higher speed than we in South Africa do. In other words, they fly the plane in up to a point on the runway. That is their normal technique. The technique of the S.A. Airways is to make a soft landing and not necessarily to aim for a point, although this is still a primary consideration. They do not necessarily aim for a point, but try to bring the aircraft in at the safest and most convenient possible speed, and to lift the nose for a soft landing. This is the essential difference between the South African and American techniques. The hon. member is welcome to ask pilots of the S.A.A., who receive training in the U.S.A., what the position is. Some of our pilots receive advanced training there. They will tell him that our techniques and or practice in South Africa are infinitely more convenient, better, easier and, in addition, safer than what they experienced in the U.S.A.</p>

<p>In the time left to me I should like to refer to another matter which the hon. member touched upon. The hon. member referred to the new and very unpleasant phenomenon of aircraft hijacking. This is indeed very serious and comparable to piracy in the olden days. This is so, but there is one small practical problem with which the world is faced to-day. This applies to the U.S.A. in particular. The problem is that the island of Cuba is not very far from their coast. The majority of hijackings of aircraft usually take place from the North or South American Continent to the island of Cuba. When the state where the aircraft lands, after it has been hijacked, is not prepared to deliver up the criminal, the aircraft, the crew or some of the passengers, it looks as if, at the moment, the world is completely helpless in the face of the problem. The whole solution seems to lie in an international agreement between countries according to which the hijacker will be treated as a criminal, the matter placed in the same category as piracy and the guilty person brought to book. The hon. member now blames the hon. the Minister for supposedly having taken certain steps. He referred here to an Amsterdam Conference which took place and to a subsequent Tokyo convention. The Amsterdam Conference to which he referred was merely an international conference that convened in Amsterdam, a conference of the International Commercial Pilots&#x2019; Organization. They adopted certain standpoints about this phenomenon, but this conference was never accorded any status to enable it to prescribe action of any kind to the governments of countries. The International Commercial Pilots Federation merely adopted certain standpoints and made certain recommendations to the governments of the countries from which the pilots came. After that the Tokyo convention was held. With this convention the world was faced with precisely the problem I mentioned earlier, i.e. that when this evil cannot be dealt with on a voluntary basis, there are no other obvious solutions. I hold it against the hon. member for trying to get a reply from the hon. the Minister about what we are doing in South Africa and how we are doing it. If there was ever anything about which we did not want a lot of talking, and pre-eminently not on the part of the S.A.R.. it is the ways and means adopted by the pilots and the Management of the S.A.A. as a whole in order to overcome this problem. If there is anything we pre-eminently want to say as little as possible <span class="col_785-786" refersTo="page_0405"/>about, it is specifically this matter, about which we want to make as few particulars as possible available.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I read the hon. member&#x2019;s Hansard. Negotiations about this matter are at present in progress on an international level. It is therefore a matter that is receiving very serious attention. The hon. the Minister has already given instructions that a most careful investigation should be instituted into all the aspects of this matter in so far as South Africa can become a contracting party to any international agreement which may come into being. I think that this is as much as the hon. the Minister should say. I hold it against the hon. member for wanting to find out more about this than is beneficial to the security of our country. In the few minutes remaining I just want to refer to another matter. The hon. member for Prieska also referred to this matter. It concerns the livestock that died during January on the way to the abattoir. The hon. member for Houghton also referred to this, but in an altogether twisted and distorted fashion. What are the implications of this matter as far as the Railways are concerned? We must ask what the task of the Railways is in this connection. The task of the Railways is as follows. Somewhere in the country or in South-West Africa livestock is offered for transportation. That livestock must be transported to another point, usually the abattoir, in this case the Johannesburg abattoir. To blame the Railways in any way for the acceptance of freight in the form of livestock at the point of origin is the most unreasonable accusation that could possibly be made against them. On the one hand the onus rests upon the agent who offers his client&#x2019;s livestock for transportation by the Railways at some point or other in the country. That organization of marketing agents has nationwide branches. They are in touch with one another by the hour and by the day. They can keep this matter under control and they ought to ensure that livestock are not offered to the Railways in a manner and in quantities which they themselves and the branch of their organization at the market cannot handle. That is the primary point of departure. Those agents must ensure that this is done and that the necessary control is exercised. On the other hand, when the receiving facilities at the terminal collapse, when it is impossible for the abattoir to do the slaughtering and for the market agent to do the off-loading, we again cannot blame the Railways. Then the Railways is least of all to blame. The Railways&#x2019; only task is to transport what is offered to it from this point to that point. Mr. Speaker, I can see by the look in your eyes that I no longer have much time left, and I do not want to make things difficult for you. I should have liked to go into further detail about this matter, but I want to conclude by saying that the South African Rail ways only did their duty in this connection, nothing less and nothing more.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not know about the flying experience of the hon. member for Middelburg who has just sat down, but when he makes the claim that one cannot make a bad take-off, I must admit it rather surprised me; because I was in the Air Force and I can assure hon. members that I was involved in many bad take-offs and held my breath on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>I have forgotten, Sir. We are probably honoured by the presence of the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation, because he was also in the Air Force during the war. I hope he did not make as many bad take-offs as the hon. member for Middelburg.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelburg said that we in the United Party had set ourselves up as the recipients of the official complaints from railways staff. Surely, if this is so, that is a reflection on the hon. member&#x2019;s party itself. Why should they come to us if they get satisfaction from the members of the Nationalist Party? But they are coming in our direction, because the Nationalist Party has long given up any pretence of representing or standing up for the rights of the railway workers. The hon. member also said that the different staff groups had their associations and that these were working very well with the hon. the Minister. But if this is so, then perhaps the hon. the Minister could tell us when he replies to the debate why he is having such a long drawn-out argument with Salstaff. As I understand it, the argument he is having with Salstaff has been going on for very many months now. Therefore, when the hon. member for Middelburg says that they are well represented by their own associations and that the Minister gets on very well with these associations, I would suggest that he probably knows as little about the Railways as most of the other hon. members on that side.</p>

<p>I am a little sorry that the hon. member for Umlazi is not here at the moment. He still is a constituent of mine; surprisingly enough, though he left my constituency four years ago, the hon. member for Umlazi is still a constituent of mine. The hon. member does not bother to change his registration. He leaves it in Port Natal. He probably realizes that he has a better representative in Port Natal than <span class="col_787-788" refersTo="page_0406"/>he has in Umlazi. The hon. member for Umlazi made all sorts of claims here. But what surprised me most is that everything he said was just the opposite of what he said two years ago. Suddenly the Minister of Transport is a fine chap and everything he is doing is perfectly correct. What he is doing with Durban harbour is what the hon. member for Umlazi wanted him to do. But if one looks at the hon. member for Umlazi&#x2019;s Hansard, one would see that in fact he is now supporting something which he opposed very bitterly not very long ago.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with one or two other matters. The first thing with which I want to deal before I deal with staff matters, is complaints from members of the public. In my own constituency&#x2014;we have complained to the hon. the Minister and his Department in the past&#x2014;a very large marshalling and shunting yard has been developing over the last few years. We have had promises from the Department that they would electrify all the trains working in the shunting yards. Since the shunting yards are surrounded by a densely populated area, a residential area, the noise that comes from this marshalling yard late at night has caused disturbance which seems to become worse and worse. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister if he can give us an assurance that this noise will be brought to a halt as soon as possible. He has said that he is going to electrify these yards as soon as he can, but it seems to me that he has taken a very long time and people are going to be very old before the hon. the Minister succeeds in having this done.</p>

<p>We had hon. members on the other side stating that the railwayman is quite content with his lot. I am going to suggest that they are so out of date that they do no realize that, where railwaymen a few years ago referred to &#x201C;Uncle Ben&#x201D; with some affection, they now in fact are seething against &#x201C;Uncle Ben&#x201D; and the Railways Administration.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that somewhere at high level he and the Government have taken the decision that the 115,000 railwaymen we are talking about can and will be exploited by the Government. I believe they are following a deliberate policy of exploitation against the railway worker; because if this was not so, I would suggest that the hon. the Minister, who claims to have been so loyal to railway workers for so many years, should see that they earn a decent living wage. But he, dare not pay them a living wage, because if he did so, he would not be able to get them to work overtime. This is the only reason why they will work overtime, because he will not pay them enough to live on. He is the Minister who once said that they will eat &#x201C;pap&#x201D;, but still vote Nat. They have not forgotten this fact. Now they are being exploited. If we want confirmation of this, we do not have too go very far. Not more than a few months ago somebody made this statement:</p>

<block name="quote">He urged that railwaymen be allowed to give evidence themselves instead of going through their staff associations. Railway-men, he said, were the cornerstone of the party, yet he had heard that complaints by African workers were dealt with more swiftly than white workers.</block>

<p>This statement was made by the hon. member for Newcastle, Dr. Viljoen. He was complaining at the Nationalist Party congress in Natal. He was complaining about the treatment of railwaymen. He was replied to by the Deputy Minister. Yet to-day and yesterday members on that side got up and said that there was nothing wrong in the Railway Service. There are in fact complaints coming from all quarters. The hon. the Minister knows that he can only get people to work overtime if he pays them so little that they have no alternative. He knows, for instance, that of the 15,0 odd clerical workers on the Railways to-day a very considerable proportion are working four hours overtime every day, driving trucks, acting as shunters, forklift drivers, and so on. Can the hon. the Minister in all honesty say to this House and to the people of South Africa that a man who is trained as a clerk, who has worked as a clerk since he left school, would be prepared to drive a truck or a forklift truck or act as a shunter if he was earning sufficient money? Can the Minister say that this person would be willing to give up four hours of his life with his family at the worst time of the day if he was earning enough money? I would suggest that the Minister is taking advantage of these people. He can take advantage of them, because, as I said just now, he sees that they do not get enough money and they have to work to pay their rentals. If this was to continue. what would happen to the staff and what is going to happen to the staff of the South African Railways? The Minister might, at the present time, be using thousands or hundreds of these clerical workers doing this type of overtime work to which they are completely foreign, but which they may do, according to the Department&#x2019;s instructions, &#x201C;either in the middle of the day, between 12.30 and 4 o&#x2019;clock or between 5 o&#x2019;clock to 9 o&#x2019;clock, depending on how the shift system works&#x201D;. But if these people are to continue doing this job how long will it continue? Where is the Minister going to find the labour to replace these people so that they can go back to their normal hours of work?</p>

<p>The tragedy is that they are already working a full nine-hour shift in the Railways. Organization and method Officers have ensured <span class="col_789-790" refersTo="page_0407"/>that they are kept busy all the time, but somewhere in between they are sent out to work. If a railwayman refuses to work overtime he can be fined. In 1968 I asked the hon. the Minister how many people have been fined for refusing to work overtime. This was in May, 1968, and the hon. the Minister then replied as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Cases do occur occasionally where the servants who are booked to work Sunday time or overtime fail to do so without advising their supervisors beforehand that they are unable to do so. In such instances the servants concerned are dealt with under the disciplinary regulations.</block>

<p>And then he said something very interesting, namely:</p>

<block name="quote">During the period 1965 to the 30th April, 1968, 22 cases of this nature have occurred.</block>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister must have misunderstood my question when he said that only 22 people were fined for refusing to work overtime during a three-year period. I am quite sure there is not an hon. member sitting on this side of the House who cannot say that he must then have had those 22 cases in his own constituency. I know that I can certainly produce more than 22 cases in my own constituency. The hon. the Minister was dealing with the whole country. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister just how many people have in fact been fined for refusing to work overtime in that three-year period.</p>

<p>I have here a pay voucher of an employee of the Railways which shows that this man earned a net income of R94 per month. This person is a married man with five children. We have been given figures in the House which show that something like 60 per cent of railway employees are earning a similar income. This man&#x2019;s basic income is R170 per month and he has little opportunity of working overtime in his particular line of work. After deductions he only takes home R94 per month. The interesting aspect of this man&#x2019;s basic salary of R170 is that R50 of it is paid for rent to the Department of Community Development. It seems that even the hon. the Minister of Transport cannot protect his own workers against the Department of Community Development. Nowhere else in South Africa is it expected that anybody should pay this proportion of his income for rent. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that it seems as if there is some breakdown between him and his department.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister will tell us that he has had no complaints of railwaymen in regard to language, but I wonder how many of these complaints ever reach him. I would like to tell him of an instance where a man I know, after 27 years of railway service, resigned as a result of the language issue. This person wrote a test in Afrikaans and failed and this was not the first time he failed. Each time he failed, this resulted in the blocking of his promotion for six months. When he went to his superior Officer and informed him that he was resigning as a result of the language issue, this Officer told him that he would refuse to state that reason in the report he would send to the Head Office. He would simply say that the man was leaving for a better job. This happened to a fully trained man after 27 years of service on the Railways. When the hon. the Minister, therefore, says that he knows of no such instances where this could happen, I have to accept that he does not know. What I want to say to him is that the information is never brought to his attention and that is the reason why he does not know, and not for any other reason. In dealing with this question of language I want to ask if it is right that when a person writes a language test he is not given the result? All he is told is that it does meet with the railway authorities&#x2019; requirements. Why should this be so? Surely he is entitled to know whether he failed miserably or that he only just failed. If a person should fail his promotion is blocked for six months and he cannot rewrite the test during that time. Where else does this happen? I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that if he expects railwaymen to be loyal to him I believe the time has come that he should be loyal to them. He should start seeing to it that some of their rights are protected.</p>

<p>I would now like to deal with a matter concerning harbours in particular. In the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s White Paper on page 8 he talks about what will happen if the harbours are separated from the Railway Administration. He says, <i>inter alia,</i> that the existing organization does not make ample provision for Officers to acquire specialized knowledge of harbour affairs. Some time ago I pointed out to the hon. the Minister a complaint I had regarding railway servants working in the harbours. Promotion to the System Manager&#x2019;s Office is blocked for them. All the top jobs in the harbours were filled by people transferred from the System Manager&#x2019;s Office. This system did not work in reverse, however. I mentioned this to the hon. the Minister, but he said that it does not happen. I can assure you that it does happen and that what he says here is not entirely correct. I would also like to ask him in view of the shortages of staff in the harbours whether the congestion that took place recently in the Durban harbour will be repeated. I know the hon. the Minister has no control over the weather or the sudden arrival of a number of ships, but most of the congestion is not caused by that at all. It is caused by the acute shortage of labour. Nowhere in the speech of the hon. the Minister or in that of any other hon. member opposite has there been any suggestion how the shortage of labour is going to be tackled by the Government. It seems to me the only way it is tackled is to make sure people are paid less so that they have to go out to work. Ultimately we will most probably see Members of Parliament on the other side working <span class="col_791-792" refersTo="page_0408"/>down in the Cape Town docks when Parliament closes in the evenings. At no stage during this debate did the Government try to give any answer to this problem. In the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s White Paper he also does not mention ship repairs in any detail. I am informed by ship repairers in Cape Town that the country is losing millions of rands in possible business through lack of facilities in Cape Town. The tragedy is that the facilities for ship repairs will probably cost the Government very little, because these people are prepared to invest money in such ventures as piers, and so on. The Government will, however, not make any provision in this regard. I would like a full reply from the hon. the Minister on this question of repairs in shipyards.</p>

<p>The only other issue I have to raise is one that I raised privately with the hon. the Minister and I do not intend to repeat it over the floor of the House. I would like to ask him, however, to give me a reply on it as soon as possible as it is one of great urgency.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Port Natal devoted the greatest part of his speech to the alleged dissatisfaction among railway servants. This is of course a very general complaint, which we now expect to hear from all Opposition members, who will repeat themselves in order to drag in alleged complaints. However, I want to ask the hon. member for Port Natal in particular whether my information is correct when I say that he opened a special Office in his constituency to receive complaints from railway workers. Is my information also correct when I say that the railway workers in Port Natal were not interested in taking their complaints to that Office, and that that Office has now been closed down? Secondly, I want to ask the hon. member for Port Natal whether my information is correct when I say that from the time he was elected to the present he has never yet attended meetings of post Office workers to which he was invited, nor has he held any meetings for railway workers in his constituency.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal need not furnish us with the answers to-day. He can furnish the answers in his constituency. I think his voters will themselves furnish him with the answer on 22nd April.</p>

<p>The test as to whether or not there is dissatisfaction among railway workers can best, in my opinion, be applied by those who represent constituencies which consist primarily of railway workers or people who were formerly in the employ of the Railways. I think that we who represent the northern suburbs of Cape Town are best qualified to reply to the question of whether or not there is dissatisfaction among our railway workers. If I may speak from personal experience I want to say that during the past 12 years I have been in politics there has never been a time when there were fewer complaints from railway workers than during the past two or three years. The speech made by the hon. the Minister of Transport in this House makes very interesting reading. He gave us a picture of the development in the transport system in South Africa since 1948. We as South Africans can be grateful for the fact that for so many of these 21 years this hon. Minister in question stood at the head of this tremendous undertaking. We can look back with gratitude this afternoon to what has been accomplished during the past two decades to give our transport system the image it has in South Africa to-day. When I speak of transport, I am thinking of transport in all its branches, i.e. the Railways, the Harbours, the road transport services of the Railways, and the South African Airways. There are certain aspects in particular which are very striking. The first is the tremendously high efficiency of this undertaking. This great efficiency is attributable to the fact that a great deal of advanced planning is done on the Railways, advanced planning on the part of the hon. the Minister who implements national policy, as well as advanced planning on the part of the Management. Even in times of crisis when, in my opinion, few transport services in the world would have been able to make the grade, the South African transport service was able to maintain its high efficiency through the experience of its officials. I want to refer, as the hon. the Minister of Transport did in his speech, to the period of crisis when the air routes across Africa were closed to South African aircraft. At very short notice the South African Airways opened a new flight route which was as efficient as before. We as South Africans will always remember the banner headlines which appeared after the announcement that African airports were closed to South African aircraft and that a different route had been opened. I also find it striking that our transport service is itself not yet satisfied with the good service which it has been rendering over the past two decades and that it is continually subjecting itself to a self-examination in order to make sure that the services it wants to render to the South African people are satisfactory enough. That is why we welcome the fact that a market research section was established about a year ago so that the transport services could use the information it acquired by taking a critical look at itself to enable itself to undertake planning of an equally good standard in the future as it had in the past. This gives us the assurance that there will be the necessary advance planning in the transport service for the next two decades of National Government as well. I am certain that those who will get to their feet in this House in 21 years&#x2019; time to discuss the role of the Railways, will praise this step in particular as one of foresight and advanced planning. They will be grateful for the fact that the Railways was prepared to take care of its liaison, to see where its markets were situated <span class="col_793-794" refersTo="page_0409"/>and to see what service it ought to render to South Africa.</p>

<p>To-day, as a National Party representative, as a representative of a constituency where thousands of railway workers are living, I want to say thank you very much not only to the hon. the Minister and the Management, but to every railway worker. In this debate, shortly prior to the 1970 election, we have had to listen time and again to stories of railway stall who are being over-exerted to such a great extent. This has created the impression that the Opposition is very grateful that an election is in fact being called now. I am thinking, in passing, of the speech made a few days ago by the hon. member for Windhoek, in which he analysed the attitude of the Opposition towards this election. If we were to listen to their speeches and were to believe that they were speaking with conviction in their hearts, I find it very significant that in spite of those speeches they are nevertheless afraid of the election which is going to be held within two months from to-day. I think it is a further proof that even representatives of constituencies on the opposite side realize that this alleged dissatisfaction among the railway workers does not exist. I have never seen so much loyalty among any officials in any service of this nature as does in fact exist among our railway workers. This has been my experience in my constituency as well. The fact that the Railways has been able, over a period of two decades, to increase its traffic by 200 per cent, while in contrast to that its staff has only increased by 50 per cent, is proof that these people are doing dedicated work in the posts they hold. We think that they are not only doing it for the sake of their salaries and remuneration for overtime, but that they are also doing it because as dedicated officials they like doing this work for our country.</p>

<p>The main speaker on the United Party side mentioned, <i>inter alia,</i> the disciplinary steps which are taken from time to time against officials of the Railways. In my day I was myself in the employ of the State Attorney. I often acted for the Railways and for railway officials at many kinds of inquiries. I also have a good knowledge of the procedure which is followed. I have had experience, not of scores, but of hundreds of cases. I am prepared to say that the standard which is maintained as far as the disciplinary steps taken in the railway service are concerned is not lower than in any other Government Department. I think a large undertaking like the Railways owes it to the country to be able to maintain high standards of discipline and safety. That is why it is essential that officials must know that steps can be taken against them when they err. Steps must be taken against them, not only when they commit criminal offences, but also when they make other mistakes, mistakes which could mean losses, mistakes which could cost lives. I think the railwayman himself is grateful for the fact that such procedures exist, procedures which will help to keep up the good name of the Railways and preserve that fine image the Railways has created for itself. I have never, in my whole life, acted in any type of inquiry where the person for whom you appeared did not believe that he was 100 per cent right. It rarely happens that one finds a person who really believes that he has made a mistake when steps are being taken against him, whether it be a criminal procedure or any other inquiry. At all times he believes that there was an adequate excuse for his behaviour and for the mistakes he made. We can accept that those people with experience who act as chairmen and members of these committees will act in an objective way and that they are not asked to find fault where no fault exists. It is in the first instance their task to see that justice is done to that official appearing before them, as well as to see that justice is done to this Service and the standards they must try to maintain. That is why this charge the Opposition is bringing against the Railways and which is supposedly causing dissatisfaction among the railway workers must be rejected.</p>

<p>There is one aspect I should particularly like to draw attention to, i.e. the question of housing which was also mentioned by the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister mentioned the large amount which has been spent since 1948, i.e. R118 million for the purchase of 28,0 houses by railway officials. He pointed out an amount of R85 million which had been spent to build 13,500 departmental houses. This brings us to a total of 23,000 departmental houses, which can now be rented to railway officials. What I find particularly significant is the figure of approximately R10 million which he also mentioned and which the Railways is giving to its officials as additional compensation in the form of losses they suffer in regard to those schemes. I do not think one can ever do enough in this direction. In spite of the enormous amount which has already been spent by the Railways for the supply of housing, perhaps even more can be done in this respect, particularly in our metropolitan areas such as Cape Town. I wonder whether it is not the right time now for the Railways to reconsider to a certain extent the merit system according to which houses are allocated. The problem is often experienced that people do not agree on what merit really is. A person who has been in the employ of the Railways for several years and who has not yet been able to acquire a house directly from the Railways is often dissatisfied and feels that he could perhaps be allocated a house on merit. For that reason I wonder whether the actual number of service years should not be utilized as an absolute criterion, or the only criterion. Let us take a railwayman who, for the sake of argument, has been in the employ of the Railways for the past eight years or so. He is therefore a person whom we can accept as one who has made the Railways his career. I wonder whether it could not perhaps be accepted as policy, or whether we could not at least try to do so, to have other considerations, such as <span class="col_795-796" refersTo="page_0410"/>merit considerations, cease to apply after a person has been in the employ of the Railways for such a period. The number of service years must therefore be accepted as the only criterion. I think this will help to cause officials, particularly those who have a long period of service on the Railways behind them, to feel that since they have shown that they want to make the Railways their career, and apart from the fact that they may perhaps have fewer children than others, or that other considerations may possibly apply, service years will be the only criterion. This ought to bring about a large measure of satisfaction in this respect.</p>

<p>I should also like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that a very interesting article has appeared in the latest edition of the monthly magazine of Assocom, i. e. Handelsmening. In this an analysis is made of the position of female labour. The figures furnished were revealing. This indicates the low percentage of women who are remuneratively employed in South Africa. As compared to the male population of whom 55.7 per cent have some occupation or other, this figure in the case of women is only 19 per cent. According to tables which were worked out by the writer, Dr. Machanik, it is also clear that the marriage age in South Africa is still reasonably low. The average age is 22 years. This indicates that most of the children of our families have already attained a reasonable age before the wife attains the age of 40 years. It is also pointed out that it appears from the lastest investigations which have been made, particularly in England, that quite often there is less neglect of children in cases of mothers who work than in cases of mothers who do not work. It appears that one must arrive at the conclusion that the objection which is often raised, i.e. that there will be no proper supervision in homes where both parents are working or, if a woman is husbandless, where she is not working, are unfounded, and it is more likely that a tendency to neglect children exists among certain people. One can therefore find the case of homes where only the man is working, or those of widows with children who are not working, where child neglect still occurs under those circumstances. Therefore this appears to be almost the only criterion on which to form one&#x2019;s own point of view in respect of this problem, i.e. whether one should encourage female labour or not.</p>

<p>I find it particularly revealing if one notes that the hon. the Minister stated that in the latest year the staff position on the Railways has deteriorated further. Possibly we should, under these circumstances, see whether we cannot make more use of female labour. If we consider the various directions in which female labour is done, in our own country and in other countries as well, and if we take note of the role they are playing to an ever-increasing extent alongside the man in the engineering profession, the medical profession and virtually all our technical professions, one wonders if, in the case of the Railways, consideration could not perhaps be given to the training of women in certain directions, directions which we traditionally accept as those belonging to men only. So we have what is virtually a progressive policy on the Railways under a National Party Government and they are ever prepared to listen to new ideas and make a critical appraisal of themselves, they could perhaps in this respect reconsider the position in order to determine whether these shortages which exist, and which will continue to exist for a long time, cannot be coped with in this way.</p>

<p>In the report of the Marais Commission, there appears quite a number of recommendations to which, according to the hon. the Minister attention will now be given. <i>Inter alia,</i> there is one recommendation in particular which is of great interest to me personally as an inhabitant and a representative of this part of our country. That is, namely, that it is recommended under various heads that the costal shipping industry in South Africa ought to be encouraged to a greater extent. I have already discussed this subject on previous occasions in this House. I want to inform the hon. the Minister that since he is now going to give consideration to all the aspects of this report, aspects in regard to which he has not yet adopted an attitude, that to my mind, apart from the motivations given by those appearing before the commission and on which the report was based, as well as the conclusions of the commission itself, there is a much more important consideration than any of those which appeared in the report, i.e. the location of our industries in the future. I have already pointed out that virtually every industrialist in South Africa, virtually everyone who has to give thought to what the future establishment points of our industries will be, point to the increasing role the manufacturing sector will have to play in our exports. They point out how decisive it will be in the years to come for the mere survival of South Africa and the raising of its standard of living. That is why I want to request the hon. the Minister to keep this extremely important consideration in mind when he returns to this House, after he has been elected once more as member of the House of Assembly and, we hope, Minister of Transport in the new National Cabinet, to deal with the various recommendations of the Marais Commission with us.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during the course of this debate we heard from the hon. members on that side of the House about the great satisfaction which exists amongst the railway employees. Indeed, it does seem surprising that when there is satisfaction amongst the employees, we have an increase in the number of resignations and of people leaving the service. That applies to Whites in particular. During the past week the hon. the Minister of Transport replied to a question which I put on the Order Paper asking for information as to how many railway employees left the Railway Service during 1969 and how many employees joined the Service in 1969. The <span class="col_797-798" refersTo="page_0411"/>figures supplied only pertained to White railway employees. It is interesting to note that 24,566 white employees left the service of the Railways Administration whilst 21,301, joined the service during the same year. This, we must bear in mind, is in a growing economy and, as the hon. member for Vasco has just stated in a call upon the Minister, the Railways must have a progressive policy to meet developments in South Africa. Surely it is a serious state of affairs when with a growing economy there is in fact a net loss in the number of employees. A progressive policy is therefore urgently required not only to attract more persons to join the Railways Administration, but also to retain the services of those who are already in the employment of the Railways Administration. We know that there are many people who, after they have resigned from the service in order to go into a job outside the service, rejoin after a few years. However, it is alarming to see that last year 10,488 white employees resigned from the railway service. What is more alarming is the fact that about the same number, namely 10,437 employees, absconded the Railways service. I believe there should be some explanation from the hon. the Minister to indicate why such a large number of white employees are absconding from the Railways Service.</p>

<p>To me this appears to call for some sort of explanation from the hon. the Minister. Out of the 24,500 who have left the service, 20,900 either resigned or absconded from the service. I believe that this question of retaining existing staff is perhaps a very important factor in dealing with the whole question of the shortage of manpower in the Railways Administration. We know that the Railway Service is looked upon as a secure career and is a career which many people join due to various fringe benefits which exist in the service.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when business was suspended for supper, I was dealing with the question of the decreasing number of white employees in the Railways Administration. If the number of Whites is going to decrease every year, I think it becomes obvious that the Minister will have to employ an increasing number of non-Whites to keep the Railways going. Unless the Railways Administration is able to retain staff, I think it is a case of facing the reality when we say that the overall loss caused by the number of people joining the service being less than the people leaving the service is going to increase in the future, making the gap wider and wider. In these circumstances it is important to ascertain in what manner the hon. the Minister can retain existing staff. In this connection I should like to refer to the question of fringe benefits. We know that the Railways Administration has always had the attraction of being a secure medium of employment. This state of affairs should continue to exist. One of the attractions has been the fringe benefits derived from such employment. I believe that closer examination should be given to these fringe benefits. First of all I want to refer to the position in regard to the existing pension scheme. We all know of the Superannuation Fund of the Railways. We know that the Superannuation Fund of the Railways has been subject to investigation and ways and means have been studied to improve this position. During the course of last year we had legislation based on the statements which the hon. the Minister made in his Budget speech, whereby improvements were made as result of the recommendations of a joint committee which comprises both representatives of the staff and the Administration. I believe that those adjustments which have been made had the full approval of the Railways Pensioners Association as well as the staff associations. However, I think the whole position requires a further examination. If one looks at the practical application of the improvements which were made last year, one sees that they benefit future pensioners to a certain extent. We on this side of the House supported the theory whereby the pension could be increased by 2 per cent per year compounded so as to offset increases in the cost of living. However, one has to look at it closer than that in order to get a picture of the present position appertaining to the Superannuation Fund. At present the fund has assets to the value of some R500 million. It would appear that for a number of pensioners this adjustment in the pension last year really did not result in any great increase in the payment of the pension they receive. That applies in particular to the older railway pensioners. If we look at the position, we will see that in many cases the only increase the older pensioners received was R6 per month for a married or R3 per month for a single railway pensioner. Here we have a situation whereby a pensioner is paid a basic amount from the Superannuation Fund. Various allowances, which come from Revenue and not from the Superannuation Fund, are added and this means that the emphasis was merely placed on the basic pension that was paid from the Superannuation Fund being increased and the amount of the allowances that were paid from Revenue has been decreased.</p>

<p>Whilst we have a system of this nature it is obvious that various difficulties will arise with regard to the allowances which are paid and indeed there are large numbers of separate allowances&#x2014;temporary allowances, supplementary allowances, a special supplementary allowance to war veterans over 70 years of age, and bonuses. These are all additional amounts which are met out of Revenue. It would appear that the whole structure of the present pension scheme should be further investigated to see whether it is not possible to institute a <span class="col_799-800" refersTo="page_0412"/>non-contributory system as far as State employees are concerned. We know that in the case of the civil servants their pension contributions have been reduced. I have heard from railway pensioners that they understand that there is a possibility of these contributions to the Superannuation Fund being reduced by as much as 50 per cent. Whether there is any truth in that statement or not, I do not know. However, it would be interesting to hear from the hon. the Minister whether he is prepared to give consideration to the whole question of the structure of the present pension scheme that is available for railway employees. If it is not possible to have a non-contributory scheme for these employees, one could consider the question of reducing the contribution of the employee.</p>

<p>Then I come to the increases in pensions which were granted last year and their effect. I have mentioned that it is a fact that many of the older pensioners only received an increase of R6 per month. Where they were receiving a minimum pension of R94 per month, in the case of married pensioners, this was increased to R100 per month. Many of these pensioners anticipated a far greater increase. When one examines how this pension is arrived at, one finds that all that has happened is that money which was previously paid as an allowance, is now being paid as part of the basic pension. I have looked at one or two cases to see what the effect of this has been. Let us see what the position was prior to the improvements which were made last year. In one particular case, where a man was receiving a basic pension of R40.50, he was receiving allowances amounting to R53.50, giving him an income of R94 per month. After these adjustments were made, this merely became a basic pension of R56.17, and his allowances were then reduced to R43.83, making his total pension R100 per month. So in spite of the 10 per cent addition to the basic pension, in spite of the 2 per cent compounded for each year that he has been on pension, this person only received an increase of R6 per month, which those in receipt of the minimum pension are also receiving. Sir, one can see that these difficulties arise where you have allowances which have been paid as separate amounts. Here I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider whether the time has not arrived to consolidate the temporary allowance, which has come to be looked upon as a cost of living allowance, with the basic pension. I believe that this would result in a considerable improvement in the pensions payable on the basis of an increase of 2 per cent compounded. The consolidation of the temporary allowance with the basic pension would result in a greater basic pension. Quite honestly, Sir, I cannot see what merit there is in keeping this as a separate temporary allowance or a cost of living allowance, in view of the fact that there is no longer any means test applied for the payment of this temporary allowance. It is in fact being received by all railway pensioners and there seems to be no reason why it should not be consolidated with the basic pension.</p>

<p>Let me now examine the increases that were given. The hon. the Minister did say last year that as far as the temporary allowances and bonus payments were concerned, the committee of investigation had also made certain recommendations affecting these payments, but that the actuaries had advised that they would prefer to await the results of the quinquennial valuation as at the 31st March, 1969. It would be interesting to hear from the hon. the Minister whether any further action is being taken in regard to the temporary allowance and the bonus payments, because this is obviously a matter which also received the consideration of the joint committee which went into this particular aspect. Sir, where you have a system such as we have, namely a superannuation fund, it is inevitable that a considerable number of people, when faced with financial difficulties, will contemplate resigning from the Service so as to obtain some immediate financial benefit to meet their commitments. This, of course, is a problem which does arise in other pension schemes as well. Indeed, the Cilliers Committee of Inquiry into Pension Fund Matters certainly highlighted this particular aspect when it indicated that no less than R60 million was paid out of various pension funds over a four year period in cases of other than death or retirement. This was due to resignations and the withdrawal of funds, which are funds specifically designed to meet the requirements of employees when they go on pension. Where an employee resigns from the Service in order to obtain an immediate lump-sum payment, then if he rejoins the Service he has sacrificed, in many instances, a good number of years&#x2019; service. When the time comes for him to go on pension, he has to be content with a reduced pension and he is unable to meet his requirements. Where you have a non-contributory pension scheme, however, you can have a different system of payment where employees resign from the Service. Here too I think the hon. the Minister would be justified in giving consideration to this particular aspect, having regard to the large number of resignations that take place from the Railway Service.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I believe that the whole question of the present pension scheme is a vitally important one in so far as fringe benefits are concerned. It is within the power of the Railway authorities and of the hon. the Minister to revise the present system and to introduce a more modern system which will enable him to meet some of the shortcomings of the present scheme and also to meet the competition which obviously arises from commerce and industry. To-day large numbers of commercial and industrial firms have their own pension funds, so the prospect of a pension, with the security that it involves, is no longer an attraction which is offered only by the Railway Service.</p>

<p>Sir, I have also mentioned the question of <span class="col_801-802" refersTo="page_0413"/>the decreasing number of white employees in the Railway Service and the fact that the hon. the Minister has inevitably had to employ more non-Whites so as to keep the traffic moving. In this connection the question of the pension requirements of the non-white employees obviously arises. Since the hon. the Minister has to use the services of non-Whites to a greater extent, he will also have to give consideration to the question of fringe benefits as far as they are concerned. As you know, Sir, they are not members of the Superannuation Fund. They have their own scheme under the Railways and Harbours Pension Act in terms of which they can receive annuities if they have had not less than 15 years&#x2019; service. There are various other stipulations concerning the payments that will be made to them either by way of a lump sum, by way of a gratuity or by way of an annuity. It is interesting to note that their system is on a non-contributory basis. In reply to a question last year in which I asked the hon. the Minister for further information in this regard, he said that no contributions were being paid by non-White servants for these benefits, which are payable only if they are retired from the Service owing to redundancy, reorganization, permanent ill-health or the attainment of the age limit. Here the principle of a non-contributory scheme is accepted. Then, in addition, the Railway Administration has a compulsory savings fund, to which these people make contributions depending upon their level of income. They are refunded this amount, together with compound interest at the rate of 4 pet cent per annum, on leaving the Service.</p>

<p>As I have said, improvements were considered last year as far as the Superannuation Fund was concerned, and improvements were certainly brought about in terms of the legislation passed in this House last year. In those circumstances I think the hon. the Minister should also review the position of the non-White employees. If non-White employees are to be used to a greater extent in the Railway Service, then a system should also be devised whereby their fringe benefits can be improved in terms of pensions or payments for services rendered to the Railway Administration.</p>

<p>Then there are two further points that I would like to raise with the hon. the Minister. The first deals with the question of housing. The hon. member who spoke before me, the hon. member for Vasco, dealt to some extent with the provision of housing and the availability of funds from the Railway Administration for the purchase of houses. In this regard I would like to look at the position of railway pensioners, who are also faced with difficulties when it comes to accommodation. Some of these people were unable to obtain a railway house while the husbands were working, and when the time comes for them to apply for accommodation in a home for the aged, their applications are rejected on the ground that the minimum pension of R50 per month, which many of them are receiving. precludes them from being accommodated in some of these homes. I should like to know therefore whether the hon. the Minister or his Administration has given consideration to the representations which have been made by the Railways Pensioners Association for accommodation and homes to be made available to these people in the latter part of their lives. It is important, of course, that we should provide housing for the present employees, but we must not forget those former employees who rendered service to the Administration during very difficult times in the course of their careers.</p>

<p>In the few minutes left to me I would like to put to the hon. the Minister for his consideration a point which has arisen because of the fact that many old people to-day are having to move from the cities in order to find cheaper accommodation outside our large towns and cities. Many of these people, have travelling expenses to meet; they often have to travel considerable distances to attend the out-patient departments of provincial and other hospitals, but they receive no concession as far as rail fares are concerned. We know that in some municipalities special facilities have been made available to these people. They are provided with concessionary travel tickets for use on municipal transport. I hope that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to the question of concessionary fares for social pensioners. Although the Minister has indicated on a previous occasion that the suburban and interurban rail fares are less than the ordinary fares, numbers of social pensioners face considerable financial hardship when they have to travel regularly to attend the out-patient departments of hospitals and where they have no means of transport other than the railways. These people look to the hon. the Minister for sympathetic consideration of their plight. I am sure that the hon. the Minister must be inundated from time to time with requests from various groups for a reduction of fares or concessionary fares. I believe that in view of the present high costs and the fact that many of these people are having an extremely hard struggle to exist on small pensions, particularly the social pensioners, the hon. the Minister should see whether it is not possible to assist them with regard to the cost of transport. This assistance, in many instances, is absolutely essential.</p>

<p>Sir, the establishment of homes for the aged, in many cases outside the cities, has also meant that these people are having to make use of railway facilities to an increasing degree. I hope that the Minister will give an indication as to whether he has given this matter further consideration to see whether it is not possible to assist them in their needs.</p>

<p>I believe that most of us in this House have great appreciation for the hon. member for Umbilo&#x2019;s supposed knowledge of pensions, but his whole argument this evening has again demonstrated to <span class="col_803-804" refersTo="page_0414"/>us something which is very obvious in our present-day politics, namely that when you know you will not be placed in a responsible position, it is very easy to create expectations among and make promises to the people outside, and in that process try to suggest that this National Party Government has no sympathy and that it is in fact the Opposition who must plead for these things to be improved for the electorate. In the past the hon. member for Umbilo had this field to himself in this House, but I want to warn him that he should use every opportunity often in the future, because he can now expect very strong competition from the mighty party spread out in front of me here.</p>

<p>In the past few Budget debates it has become obvious and almost traditional that hon. members opposite me always find some or other tragic happening to raise during a Railway debate in an attempt to rouse feelings in order to gain some political advantage. I remember well how the hon. member for Durban (Central) stood up here last year and tried to rake up that tragedy of the Boeing disaster at Windhoek in order to stir up feelings. What do we find this year? This year we have the position that the tragic event at the level-crossing at Henley-on-Klip became the subject of discussion in this Railway debate. Unfortunately I could not keep a record of how many speakers from that side referred to this matter, but it was done entirely to arouse feelings. I recall that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) pointed a prophetic finger in the air and said that he had warned the Minister last year that another accident would occur at a level-crossing. Mr. Speaker, can you imagine that it requires a prophet to predict that another accident will occur at a level-crossing! It is not without compassion that I say that it certainly requires no prophet to predict this evening that there will most probably be another accident at a level-crossing in the future. But the interesting thing about this whole situation, this pattern which has developed during this Session, is that the hon. member for Wonder-boom associates himself very strongly with that argument which is being presented here. The hon. member for Wonderboom produced an impressive series of figures to motivate his charge of neglect against this Government. Then the hon. member for Rustenburg quite innocently asked the hon. member for Wonderboom whether he had already made representations in the past in regard to those level-crossings which formed the subject of his speech and his charge to-day. Then came the revelation that he had made representations about another one, but never yet about this one. In his entire parliamentary career he has never made representations about those level-crossings, but now that it is a dramatic occasion, he levels the charge. In other words, this hon. member to-day has to make use of a tragic disaster in an attempt to evade his own political disaster. But from the statistics which were flung across the floor by the hon. members for Wonderboom and Pietermaritzburg (City), it appears that almost 4,000 level-crossings still remain. Then the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) made this brilliant statement. He said that at the present rate at which crossings were being eliminated, it would take us 200 years to eliminate all the crossings.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon. I cannot attribute so much intelligence to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District); I meant the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City). But surely that was an absolutely outrageous statement for the hon. member to make. I do not believe that in future it will be necessary for us to eliminate all level-crossings. I call to mind a railway line which I used in the past, and I am referring specifically to the railway line between Bredasdorp and Caledon. I venture to say that there are probably at least 50 crossings on that line alone. Sir, I can assure you that on that railway line the train is always doubling back because there are so many crossings and bends on that line. While there is so much agitation today for the elimination of crossings, it is probably no more than realistic that we should consider the other side of the picture too, and that we should take note of the fact that urgent representations to the contrary are sometimes made, namely that where crossings are proposed to be eliminated, the matter should be shelved indefinitely.</p>

<p>I would be grateful if the hon. member for Wynberg would pay some attention now. I recall a specific case which occurred as recently as last year. I want to say at once that I am definitely not mentioning this case in order to embarrass the hon. member for Wynberg, because I believe she really regarded it as her duty to deal with it. In Kenilworth there is a specific level-crossing which is on the priority list for elimination. At a certain stage the hon. member for Wynberg came to ask me whether I would assist her, as some of my constituents might also be affected, and that we should make representations for the closing of that crossing to be taken off the priority list, since it appeared that the Ratepayers&#x2019; Association of Kenilworth was strongly opposed to the closing of the crossing. This group of ladies came to see us one day and we granted them an interview. It then appeared that these representations actually had nothing to do with my constituents, but out of courtesy towards the hon. member for Wynberg I undertook to submit the representations to the system manager to ask him if she could lead a deputation to see him. I did this on 10th April last year. On 17th April the system manager replied that he could see no sense in an interview, as these matters were not dealt with by him; they were dealt with by a permanent committee. I do not know what further became of this matter, but I am <span class="col_805-806" refersTo="page_0415"/>just trying to indicate, and the hon. member must please not be offended, that there have been representations in the opposite direction as well. Since this specific case was raised by the other side of the House. I really cannot understand this arrogant claim of the Opposition that they are pre-eminently the people who are agitating for the elimination of crossings, and that the Minister and this Government are adopting so indifferent an attitude to the danger of crossings. It is surely clear that these people are trying to hold up a false image in order to hide their political bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Then we recently had the improper wooing of the railway workers&#x2019; vote. Last year the hon. member for Yeoville came along here and pictured the manpower shortage in the Railways as having developed into a crisis. Then he dramatically exclaimed that as long as we continued the present labour pattern, the manpower shortage would not be solved. But what happened when the hon. the Minister asked the hon. member for Yeoville: What do you mean by that; what do you mean when you say as long as we continue the present pattern? Do you mean that all vacancies should be filled by non-Whites? What reply did we receive? the only reply we have received up to now is that they will appoint non-Whites in those posts with the co-operation and approval of the trade unions. In other words, they are still hiding behind the trade union, but we are still waiting for a reply to the Minister&#x2019;s specific question as to what they would do if the trade unions did not agree to that. But surely it is clear what these people want to do, and that is why they do not want to give a reply. It was very clear in a debate here the other day, when the hon. member for Hillbrow showed us his slip. Did he not tell us in so many words that work reservation was a farce, and that it provided false security? But the white workers in South Africa, and the railway workers in particular, know that they are not safe under the United Party. The hon. members for Durban (Point) and Port Natal make a great fuss in every Budget debate after spending the entire recess in their constituencies to receive railway grievances. Then they come here with a file and fling all three which they had received, across the floor of this House. I now want to warn the hon. member for Durban (Point). If he is busy collecting grievances&#x2014; and in the past he picked up three per recess&#x2014;then he will have to take into consideration that he will have to compete with a mighty party in connection with those three grievances. No, the railway worker will not allow himself to be caught by the fine words in this yellow booklet, these fine words that they will have the work evaluated by experts. The railway worker will not allow himself to be caught by a word which comes so easily on the tongue, because he knows the man who really let the cat out of the bag is the hon. member for Salt River, who, after all. is an honest man. Did the hon. member for Salt River not say last year: &#x201C;Make use of all the available labour&#x201D;?</p>

<p>I want to conclude with the greatest confidence. I want to tell you, Sir, that we National Party representatives who represent the vast majority of the railway electorate, live with and among our people, and that we join them in thanking the hon. the Minister of Transport this evening. But then it has become a disgrace to say thank you in this House, and hollow laughter usually emanates from that side when we do so. I prefer to do it in another way. Because we do not get the opportunity to do so in private, I should like to invite the hon. the Minister of Transport this evening to visit my constituency, which is exclusively a railway constituency, so that we may express our thanks and pay tribute to him in a proper way. What is more, on 22nd April we will give this Government a present in the form of a shattering defeat, and in the process we will also enrich the Treasury with several thousands of rands in forfeited deposits.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, so far we have heard only criticism from the opposite side of the House in this debate. The main point chosen was the bus disaster at Henly-on-Klip, and then there were also smaller points of criticism against the National Party and the hon. the Minister of Transport. The previous speaker said that he thanked the hon. the Minister for what has been done. I too want to express my thanks. I do want to thank not only the Minister, but also the officials of the Department of Transport, for what they are doing for South Africa and for us. In the course of the debate a great deal of criticism has been expressed, but I have not heard one word of thanks to our railway officials from the opposite side of the House. We on this side of the House should like to express out thanks to those who work many hours overtime, and to those who are separated from their families for long periods for our sake and for the sake of the people of South Africa. To them we want to say; thank you very much.</p>

<p>The railway officials have been looked down upon in their profession for many years. I think the time has arrived for recognizing the railway official as a person rendering a service. May every one of us sitting in this House succeed in showing these people that they are rendering a service to us, and that we are grateful for it and appreciate it.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said about the abattoirs of Johannesburg. A great deal of criticism was levelled at the Minister and the Railways Administration. However, I now want to ask the United Party whether they have really conducted an investigation into what happened? It has been said that the trucks stood there waiting to be unloaded. Many hon. members have mentioned the animals which died. However, I have a cutting here in which a veterinary surgeon, a certain Dr. Ryksen, makes a few observations in this connection. He does not belong to the National Party, nor is he <span class="col_807-808" refersTo="page_0416"/>a member of this four-bench party in front of me here. He is a member of the United Party. He said that he had taken specimens from animals which had died.. He had found that in one single truck there had been 11 head of cattle which had not died as a result of hunger or thirst, but had died from prussic acid poisoning. Prussic acid poisoning cannot be contracted as a result of feeding on the dry fodder which is used by the Railways. It cannot be contracted from the water which had been given to them. Prussic acid poisoning can be contracted only when the cattle are fed wilted and over-ripe fodder before being loaded onto the trucks. [Interjections.] Let us look at this matter objectively. There were problems, but not only the National Party and the Department of Transport were responsible for them. The United Party Municipality of Johannesburg was also responsible for them. Now the blame is laid on the Minister and this party. Every one of us who is fond of animals and every one of us who wants to see to the conditions in which animals live and in which they are transported, must admit that mistakes can occur, but they are not the fault of the National Party or the Minister alone. There are also other people responsible for what happened in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>I am very glad that the hon. member admits that they are also to blame. I said at the start that we are grateful for the service rendered by the railway officials, but this evening I should also like to plead with the hon. the Minister for our railway officials, and specifically for the young people. We are very grateful that the Minister established a department in which young railway officials are scientifically tested for skilled and semi-skilled labour. Last year a little more than 20,0 officials were tested. These tests were followed up by further observations, which also take into account their emotional and personal circumstances. It was then found that 53 of these persons had shown increased productivity. We want to express our deep appreciation to them. They are people who may have limited capacities, but who showed increased productivity as a result of this development and these tests. We therefore want to ask the Minister to continue with this system which he has introduced. I think that this is one of the reasons why the number of passes at Esselen Park were 90.12 per cent last year. For that we want to pay tribute to the officials of the Railways. We find that in some cases many young railway officials resign not as a result of their salaries being too low, but because they have perhaps had to work overtime and there was no time for recreation and other activities. We should like to ask the Minister not only to increase salaries, but also to grant these people an opportunity of having leisure time for normal association with people, etc., when they ask for it in advance. These people work very hard. We realize this and we are very grateful for it, but we also wish to grant them those moments of recreation and the opportunity to associate with people outside the Department.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I should also like to bring to the attention of the Minister. It often happens that some of our officials fall ill and then have to be examined by a medical practitioner or by a specialist. I wonder whether the time has not come for the Department to employ a group of doctors as well as specialists on a full-time basis in order to examine railway officials when the need for it arises. In conclusion I want to address the following request to the hon. the Minister: Retain the sympathy which you have for the railway officials. Also keep in mind the young railway officials and let us all be ever grateful to those who render us service.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Tygervallei, who spoke before the last hon. member, illustrated the truth of an old Afrikaans saying which goes as follows: &#x201C;Waar die hart vol van is, loop die mond van oor.&#x201D; He completed his speech by saying that he had a &#x201C;geskenk vir die Nasionale Party op 22 April&#x2014;&#x2019;n groot nederlaag&#x201D;. Sir, I agree with him. He has a gift for the Nationalist Party on the 22nd April. He has stated it, and it will stand in Hansard. His gift to the Nationalist Party will be a smashing defeat. [Interjections.] Sir, that is what he said. Let him look at his Hansard tomorrow morning. If the speech of that hon. member was a case of &#x201C;wat die hart van vol is, loop die mond van oor&#x201D;, then the hon. member for Bethlehem also said something with which I can agree. It is not often that this happens and I find myself in a difficult position at the moment. I agree with them on certain points. The hon. member for Bethlehem said that the time had come to recognize railwaymen as persons who were giving service. How I agree with him! This side of the House will recognize the railwayman as a person who gives service. I am glad that the hon. member for Bethlehem recognizes that the time has come when that should happen, because it has previously certainly not come from that side of the House. The railwayman has not been a man who has been recognized as one who gives service. When we have pleaded for his welfare and his interests we have been accused of &#x201C;vryery na sy stem&#x201D;. Therefore I want to put on record tonight, speaking as a member from Natal, that we have in Natal certain concentrations of railway voters. We have for instance Glencoe in the seat of the hon. member for Newcastle, who is not here. Glencoe has a very large railway population, but we have heard not a word from the hon. member for Newcastle on behalf of his voters. We have the constituency of Klip River, which is held by the leader of the Nationalist Party in Natal, the hon. member for Klip River. Again we have heard not a <span class="col_809-810" refersTo="page_0417"/>word from that representative of another railway centre on behalf of the railwayman of Natal. We have a large number of railwaymen in Umhlatuzana, and what did we hear from the absent hon. member for Umhlatuzana on behalf of the railwaymen of that constituency? There are also railwaymen in Umlazi. The hon. member for Umlazi did stand up but during half an hour he did not say one word about the welfare of the railwayman. He told us how he had changed his principles since he had gone to sit on the other side of the floor and that when he was on this side he criticized and now that he is on that side, he praises. But we have heard not a word about the welfare of the railwayman. There are railwaymen in Zululand and the absent member for Zulu-land has made no plea for the railwaymen of Zululand. He is absent as the hon. member for Klip River is absent, as they have been for most of this debate. In fact, I counted yesterday that apart from Ministers and Whips there were 13 members of the Nationalist Party sitting in their benches listening to the affairs of the railwayman in South Africa being discussed. There were 11 members on this side of the House. How is that for a proportion: 11 out of 37 and 13 out of 127. That is the interest they show.</p>

<p>I said that this was an awkward occasion for me because I found myself in agreement with the hon. member for Bethlehem. I now want to agree also with the hon. the Minister on two counts. What is more, I want to confound the forecast of the hon. member for Bethlehem, because I want to express three words of thanks, but I regret that I cannot express them to the hon. the Minister. I do, however, want to agree with him in expressing the thanks of all of us on this side of the House towards those who fought the Cato Creek fire and who did such a great job there. I think they deserve the thanks the hon. the Minister expressed and I agree with him. Why I cannot extend those thanks to the hon. the Minister is because I would have liked him to have seen the conditions under which Cato Creek used to operate. I went there on three occasions to see the congestion and the impossible conditions under which that depot was operating. I should like to ask him to go and see the conditions under which the Railway fire fighting service of Durban has to operate. Then he would be able to speak with the same sincerity with which I speak when I speak of the work which was done by the staff and the railway fire fighters, because I know the conditions under which they had to struggle and under which they had to work and under which the railway fire fighters still have to work in Durban.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. the Minister on another issue, and that is in expressing appreciation to the loyal members of the railway staff, who have carried the burden of the struggle for another year. Again I cannot extend those thanks to the Minister because the hon. the Minister and this debate has revealed that an increase in staff of 15 per cent are carrying an increase of 100 per cent in responsibility and duties. I want to associate myself with the remarks that have been made by hon. members on this side of the House in regard to the load which is being placed on the railwaymen of South Africa, the strain which is placed on them physically and the strain which is being placed on their family life as well as the effect of that strain on the operation of the Railways. I intend to try to illustrate this in the few minutes available to me.</p>

<p>There is a third matter which I want to place on record. I want to agree with the hon. the Minister on a third issue. I believe that this will be the last time that I will have to agree with him as an hon. Minister. After this session I may agree with him as the Opposition spokesman on transport matters. However, I will agree with him in his present capacity for the last time in associating myself with the compliment paid to the staff of the South African Airways, who are a fine staff and an organization of which one can be proud. We on this side of the House have not attacked them, but have tried to help them by dealing with the problems which they face so that they can maintain the fine record that they have.</p>

<p>We have listened now to two days of debate and from every side of the Government benches there has only been one refrain, from the hon. the Deputy Minister downwards: Railwaymen are content, they are happy, they are well cared for and they have no complaints. The Opposition is sucking complaints out of their thumbs and everything in the garden is rosy except for one or two malcontents.</p>

<p>I do not need letters. I have some here to which I may refer if I am questioned on them. I want to get it clearly on record that in this last debate on Railway matters of this Parliament Government members stated in chorus that railwaymen in South Africa were in the words of the Deputy Minister: &#x201C;Satisfied, happy and well eared for&#x201D;. That is the view of every member on that side of the House, except the hon. member for Koedoespoort, who insulted quite a number of railwaymen. Having proved that 9,0 railwaymen had been taken back into the Railways in one year, and I assume a similar proportion were taken back in other years, he called those 9,000 and all the other tens of thousands who have gone back to the Railways &#x201C;werkskues en onstandvastiges&#x201D;. Let us therefore have it on record that the hon. member for Koedoespoort not only thinks they are happy, but also says that amongst the railwaymen there are thousands and thousands <span class="col_811-812" refersTo="page_0418"/>who are afraid of work or, in his own words, &#x201C;werksku en onstandvastig&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, against this background of a Government which believes that the railwaymen are content and that everything in the garden is rosy, I have something to say to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister and hon. members on that side have praised the railwaymen. We have done so too, but words are cheap; it is deeds that matter. The hon. the Minister and his Government are the government with the power to do things which must be done. I want to put it to him that apart from the election holiday bonus, a haphazard bonus, doubling the original bonus when he heard there was an election coming, there are four fundamental fields in which the Government has failed to deal with the problems of the railwayman.</p>

<p>The first of those has been dealt with before and I will not elaborate at length. That is the question of overtime. We were challenged by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) and others to state that we would abolish overtime. What a nonsensical challenge. Under this Government with their wage structure those members and the Government know that if one abolished overtime, the railwaymen could not exist. Our argument is that a man should not be forced to do overtime work in order to make a decent living. The hon. member asked for letters. One does not need letters; one needs the experience of what is going on. I have a record here of one person who showed me his overtime hours, varying from 110 to 130 hours per month in the harbour service of Durban.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, this came from a railwayman who sat in my Office with his wife, and his wife was in tears. She said: &#x201C;He wants to resign. We cannot make ends meet. We cannot raise our children on our salary. Now he has to work day and night so that we can exist.&#x201D; If those hon. members have not seen people like those, it shows that they have lost contact with the people of South Africa. I remember that hon. members who now sit on the front bench came in here perhaps not as affluent as other hon. members on that side of the House, perhaps not with large business undertakings. As the years have gone by, the contact which they had through their knowledge of the people of whom they were one, has become less and less. As their cars have become bigger, so their knowledge of the railwaymen has become less. These hon. gentlemen who used to know the railwaymen no longer know them today. When the Volkswagen made way for a Mercedes, the contact with the railwaymen was lost. Therefore one finds this denial. But I say that throughout the Railway Service the men, and particularly their families, are fed up with the hours they have to work. I can give hon. members case after case. One man was seeking a transfer, because he is working 101/4 hours per day. I have the letter and I will give the hon. the Minister his name if he wants it. I have taken it up with the System Manager. I have tried to get him a transfer. He said: &#x201C;I want a transfer, because in this particular station I can get 12 hours work per day and then I will be able to get that little extra money which will enable me to live.&#x201D; So I say that the first of the four failures of this Government is that they are forcing the railwayman to work overtime because of an unrealistic basic wage structure.</p>

<p>Vause, you are talking nonsense.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>If I am talking nonsense, then that hon. member believes that the 64,000 railwaymen earning less than R200 per month are well paid. I want to ask any hon. member on that side of the House how he will bring up a wife and children on under R200 per month, how he will clothe and feed them decently and pay the rents which he will have to pay today, unless he is one of the 22 per cent of the privileged railwaymen who have Railway housing. Only 21,500, in fact, are railwaymen who receive Railway houses. Apart from them, the other 80 per cent have to pay commercial rentals. They have to pay the standard rental which anyone else pays. They are paying to the Department of Community Development R40, R50 and R60 per month for a flat. They are earning R160, R170 and R180 basic salary. Yet these hon. members say I am talking nonsense when I say that an unrealistic wage structure is the cause for the overtime which is driving these men into ill-health and into family friction.</p>

<p>They can try and beat the racial drum as much as they like; that horse has been ridden hollowback. The railwayman has realized that he has been led along by the fear stories that the United Party would endanger his job on the Railways. They do not believe it any more. These hon. members who for two days here have said the railwayman is well paid, well off <span class="col_813-814" refersTo="page_0419"/>and satisfied, will find that they have lost touch with the real feeling of those people.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, I mentioned four things First is overtime and low wage scales, which are related. The second is the promotion system. Always, and I accept this, one will find dissatisfied people who feel that they have been overlooked. That is inevitable in any business, any society and any government. There have always been the odd people who feel they have been hard done by. But I have never seen so many complaints as I have over the last year to 18 months by people who feel they have not had a square deal. One asks them, &#x201C;But why don&#x2019;t you use the appeal system?&#x201D; They say: &#x201C;Of what use is that? It is a waste of time." The answer is that very few appeals are upheld. But I have had cases where a man has appealed and he has been turned down in the one case because the other man had merit as against his seniority. A few months later somebody else was promoted and he appealed again. He was turned down because he had the merit but the other man had the seniority. The same man was turned down twice for exactly opposite reasons. The hon. the Minister knows about the case. I sent it to him. I have dealt with it right through to the top. I could get nowhere with it. One is finding a growing dissatisfaction over the system. I say that is another field in which this Government owes the railwayman a rethink. It is a field to which we will give a rethink after April. There are all sorts of anomalies. I do not have the time to deal with them. I will just quote one case in the Harbour Service of a man who was a sailor with all the qualifications which he got from having been a sailor for years. He came in and because it is the red tape system of the Railways, he joined as a deck helper. In the last two years in which he has been in the Railways, he has acted as steersman, as coxswain and as master. He is at present acting as a master, or was two weeks ago when I left Durban. But he cannot be promoted, because other people are senior to him. They come in, not knowing the work; he has to teach them. He has to do the work, and as soon as the new man has learnt it, he goes back to deckhand. A few weeks later he is promoted, acting again. These are isolated incidents, but if one had the time, one could go on and name dozens and dozens of them. Individually they are piffling; individually they can be shot down. But when taken in the mass in which they are happening today, they are creating a spirit of dissatisfaction which I believe is not in keeping with the debt which South Africa owes the overloaded, short-staffed Railway Service.</p>

<p>Then I want to say that the disciplinary system is another source of serious complaint. I asked the hon. the Minister a question today as to whether railwaymen were penalized without having had a chance to defend themselves. My printed question reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Whether any Railway servants have been penalized for alleged or suspected offences without having been charged and without an investigation at which they could defend themselves.</block>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister replied: No, punishment is not imposed. In a supplementary question which I have here I said: My question was not &#x201C;punishment&#x201D; but whether they were penalized. The hon. the Deputy Minister then said that &#x201C;the reply is the same&#x201D;. In other words, railwaymen are not punished without a chance to defend themselves. But I have here a letter from the System Manager in Durban, dated 2nd February, 1970. This letter was not written on his own authority, because I warned that I intended to raise this case. He referred the matter to Head Office and replied to me as follows: I will not deal with the name of the person concerned or the details. I will give them to the hon. the Minister afterwards. The letter reads:</p>

<block name="quote">I have been in touch with the General Manager&#x2019;s Office and it has been indicated that the Officer dealing with the resignation acted correctly.</block>

<p>What happened was that a person committed an alleged offence in May last year involving an allegation that two people were found on his train without tickets. In December last year, seven months later, he had not been charged and no action had been taken against him. This man then resigned. But what happened? He was penalized by being made to forfeit the interest on his contributions to the provident fund. The letter reads further:</p>

<block name="quote">When a servant submits his resignation from the Service, the Officer dealing with the case is required to take into consideration any disciplinary action pending, or about to be finalized. If, in that Officer&#x2019;s opinion, based on the information before him, the resignation has been tendered to avoid dismissal or enforced resignation, then he is required to advise the servant concerned accordingly and to indicate that in terms of section 27, Act No. 39 of 1960, the refund of the pension contributions will be made without interest.</block>

<p>This happened to a man who served the Railways for some 35 years. As he put it to me if he wanted to do something crooked, would he have jeopardized his career for one or two rand for two non-white third-class passengers by not issuing them tickets. What could he have got out of it if he wanted to? He said that he made his position clear. I will give the person&#x2019;s name to the hon. the Minister. He was Mr. A. Meyer, a ticket examiner. From May to December he was not charged. Eventually this person got fed up, was offered a business opportunity, and resigned. I queried his case and asked how he could be punished <span class="col_815-816" refersTo="page_0420"/>by fining him the interest on his provident fund contributions. This is the reply I received, namely that &#x201C;in the opinion of an Officer, based on information before him&#x201D;, without a chance to defend himself, without a hearing or an opportunity to state his case he is fined the interest on his provident fund contributions. That hon. Deputy Minister said this afternoon that that could not happen. Is that the credibility gap of this Government? Is that what we must believe of hon. Ministers who, when you ask them a question, say &#x201C;no&#x201D; and here is the evidence that it can be done.</p>

<p>My time is running out, but I have other cases of disciplinary action which I believe are a disgrace. I want to say again that I believe the whole disciplinary system is causing discontent. I have gone into case after case. I accept that the people have made mistakes, but even for clerical mistakes people are fined. If a checker, for instance, places a parcel on the wrong lorry, and if he has done it two or three times before, he can be fined.</p>

<p>Nonsense.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It is not nonsense. I have seen the offence sheets and the personal files of people concerned in such cases. I accept that there have been previous convictions, but if people are working the hours these men are working under the conditions they are working, I do not blame them. I have seen gangs working with one checker where there should have been two, and this person was trying to handle two gangs of Bantu loading up lorries. If he makes a mistake he is subject to disciplinary action. I can go on and on but I want to state the incontrovertible fact that there is a great deal of dissatisfacion over the whole disciplinary system.</p>

<p>The fourth field in which something more could be done is that of housing. The hon. member for Bloemfontein District made a statement that was untrue this afternoon. He attacked the hon. member for Newton Park for having stated that some railwaymen have to pay high interest rates on bonds. The hon. member said that the interest rates were 31/2 to 4 per cent. I do not know who passed him that information. I would be interested to know from whom he received it on that little slip of paper he had. I have here the report of the Controller and Auditor-General on the accounts of the South African Railways Administration for the year 1967-&#x2019;68. The fact is that there are two schemes. One lends a Railwayman money for a house and he pays 31/2 to 4 per cent interest on such a loan. Under the Assistant House Ownership Scheme a servant is advanced the deposit to enable him to get a bond from a building society or a bank. On the deposit he pays 31 to 4 per cent interest but on the bond he has to pay 81 to 9 per cent. Our case is that the Railways should subsidize the rentals of railway servants who cannot get railway houses and who are being forced to pay high interest rates to commercial institutions. It is easy to talk of globular sums. Hon. members opposite talk of 3 million rand for housing, but what is R3 million? If one can obtain a house for R10,000, which one can hardly get to-day, R3 million means 300 houses. We have heard of the great advance made with housing, but I want to read the footnote on housing in the report. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">During the year the total number of departmental houses decreased from 23,108 to 22,727.</block>

<p>Of those 22,727, 1,525 were not occupied. In other words, 21,000 houses are available for the whole of the South African Railway staff. This is stated in the Report of the Controller and Auditor-General, whose word I accept before those of the hon. members opposite. There are dozens of other matters I could raise. For example, in connection with the promotion system and casual clerks. I have one case where 23 people have not been paid their Christmas bonus because they were transferred from the grade &#x201C;intermittent casuals&#x201D; to the grade &#x201C;temporary staff&#x201D; during the year. Although they had unbroken service they had not worked as temporary staff for the necessary 313 shifts. These 23 men were, therefore, fined their Christmas bonus although they had unbroken service for 4 years. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before dealing with topics of a more controversial nature and while the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind, I trust, is still perceptive, I should like to propose a certain matter to him which I trust has the agreement of both sides of the House. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. the Minister for at last listening to what I have to say. I want to propose a matter which I trust will have the agreement of both sides of this House. It is a matter which affects the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs of whichever Government may be in power after this election. We know of course who will be in <span class="col_817-818" refersTo="page_0421"/>power, but the hon. the Minister will not agree with our view. On the 24th May this year, it will be the centenary of one of the greatest men that our country&#x2019;s history has ever known. I am referring to Gen. Smuts. I trust and hope that whichever Party is in power and whoever is Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, favourable consideration will be given to issuing a commemorative stamp on that memorable day. I want to put that to the hon. the Minister without any political implications, or any political second thoughts.</p>

<p>I now want to come to issues which are a bit more controversial. Firstly, the hon. the Minister announced that radio licences for all social pensioners would in future be R2. Of course, we are not going to oppose that. More than that, we are going to agree to a very large extent with that because it has been this side of the House, the United Party Opposition, which has fought all along throughout the years for a concession of this nature. But even then the hon. the Minister has not gone far enough. We asked for these licences to be only R1,00. He made them R2,00. He has at least accepted part of our policy, but he has not gone far enough. I trust that the country will remember how long, for how many years, we have had to fight on this particular issue and how long it has taken us ultimately to persuade the hon. the Minister to make the announcement which he made during the second reading debate. I have here a letter which proves how long we have been fighting for it. My hon. colleague the hon. member for Umbilo has been appealing and asking the Government over the past ten, twelve, fifteen years to grant a concession of this nature to the ordinary man, to the social pensioner. Do hon. members know that in 1963 the S.A.B.C. in a letter to my colleague the hon. member for Umbilo agreed that it could be done and that it should be done? However, it has been the Government itself, the hon. the Minister and his predecessor, who refused to grant this concession. A letter dated 20th February, 1963, signed by the head of the secretarial department of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have pleasure &#x2026;</block>

<p>This was in 1963, remember&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in advising that the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C. at a recent meeting approved the suggestion that concessionary radio licences be extended to old-age pensioners, persons who receive allowances from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and the blind.</block>

<p>The S.A.B.C. has been in favour of it for the past six years. The hon. the Minister, his predecessor and the Government have been undermining this excellent principle. However, at last, after all these years, we have convinced them and persuaded them to accept at least part of the United Party policy in this regard. It is a small step forward. I suppose we cannot complain; we must congratulate the hon. the Minister halfway. Let us hope that some time in future there will be further concessions granted, I trust by a new government.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister made quite a great play of the issue of television. I think everyone of us will agree that it was obvious that the hon. the Minister was not arguing with this side of the House. He was replying to objectors in his own Party. He was replying to people who, on hearing of the appointment of this commission, asked themselves: &#x201C;What on earth is happening now? We thought television was such a vast evil; we thought that our Government was against television and here we see that a commission has been appointed.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister appointed this commission to hide the fact of the vast division in his own party, in his own caucus and among the ordinary ranks of the Nationalist Party in regard to television.</p>

<p>He said that television had nothing to do with this election. He challenged us to ask him to make television an issue. Good gracious! I accept that challenge. Let us make it an issue; then we shall have the three points of view, namely, the view of the Herstigte Nasionale Party, which is a 100 per cent against television; secondly, the view of the United Party, which is 100 per cent in favour of a good television service and, thirdly, the view of the Government itself, which does not know its own mind and has to appoint a commission under the chairmanship of the Broederbond chairman to find out whether it should accept television or not. Then the hon. the Minister added: &#x201C;Please remember, whatever they do decide, I am not bound by the decision of the commission; I may not accept it.&#x201D; Of course, we accept that challenge. Will he make that an issue at the election? They do not even know what their policy will be. They have to ask a commission to tell them what they have to do.</p>

<p>I think we should look at this commission which the hon. the Minister mentioned in his speech. I, quite frankly, am not impressed by this commission; I am not impressed by its terms of reference; I am not impressed by its membership and I am not impressed by the energy and enthusiasm with which it has tackled its task. The terms of reference include this vital one, namely, that this commission has to find out whether television will be desirable for South Africa, whether it will be desirable that our children should be educated in part by one of the most modern methods of education ever yet devised; whether it would have been desirable for the people of South Africa to have seen the landing on the moon; whether it would have been desirable for us to have seen Graeme Pollock <span class="col_819-820" refersTo="page_0422"/>and our great South African cricketers at Durban. He does not yet know; he has to appoint a commission consisting of members of the Jukskeibond to decide on this matter.</p>

<p>As I have said, I am also not impressed by the membership of this television commission.</p>

<p>I believe that it is not fair to both sections of the South African population. The commission consists of 13 members, of which nine are Afrikaans-speaking and only four, as far as I could establish, are English-speaking. When one looks at the names of the Afrikaans-speaking members, I am sure that if the majority of them were ever to get together it would be like an old-home week of the Broederbond, with cabalistic rites and secret hand grip and all. I am not a member but enough leaks out. We know that the Broederbond is basically against television. There is a split in their ranks.</p>

<p>I am not even impressed by that. I do not think that all four the English-speaking members appointed to the commission are really representative of English-speaking South Africans. Surely, after having appointed Prof. Horwood to the Senate as a supporter of theirs, then appointing him to this television commission is an admission that they are not looking for an independent judgment and an independent point of view. They are simply appointing supporters of their own party.</p>

<p>The next reason why I am not impressed with this commission is that it is entirely unrepresentative of the interests who really will be affected by television when it is introduced. There is no representative of the Press on this commission; there is no representative of the advertising industry in this country; there is no representative of sporting bodies; there is no representative of the entertainment bodies. For instance, the cinemas are not represented. It is one of the most unrepresentative commissions to decide on a vital issue that has ever been appointed in this country. This is supposed to be a commission to decide on the effect of television on family life. Why is there not a single woman on this commission, or not more than one, for that matter? Surely the mothers of South Africa are the people really to decide on the effect of television on family life.</p>

<p>The third reason why I am not impressed by this commission is its lack of enthusiasm in tackling its task. It must be remembered that this commission was appointed on 3rd December, 1969. In January we heard that the secretary was rushing around trying to find where the members of the commission were so that he could at least have a meeting of the television commission before the end of January. But there was no meeting at all in January. Last Friday I asked the hon. the Minister a question on this, and he then said that the commission had not yet met. And then, when we opened our papers this morning, we discovered that they had had their first formal meeting. Do you see how long it has taken them?</p>

<p>Yes, they probably adjourned. I am quite sure they have already adjourned. How can you expect a timeous decision from this commission? It is quite clear that this television commission is a bluff. It is a bluff and a bit of a sop to the enlightened section of the Nationalist Party. I think that the light emanating from this commission is not much more than the light of a poor little lonely, love-sick firebug in a fog which has lost its battery. This is a case of a government which is in search of a policy. It is a case of a government which is afraid to put the issue of television before the voters because it has not developed a policy. It is a case of a government which has befuddled its own supporters to such an extent that its own supporters are coming and pleading with it, asking, as in the case of the sports policy: &#x201C;Please tell us what has happened.&#x201D; It is a case of a government who is hopelessly and basically divided on this particular issue. I only wish that the hon. the Minister and his Government just had a little bit of intestinal fortitude. If they would only go to the country and say that they are in favour of television and that they will ask the commission to report before 22nd April to say whether it is in favour or not. But I am quite sure that they will not do that. The reason is that the verkramptes in their ranks are still far too strong.</p>

<p>There has been a less acceptable development in regard to television. After the announcement of the appointment of this commission, we found people exploiting the idea of television. They are exploiting the ordinary people of South Africa, trying to convince them that television is definitely coming, so as to make money out of it. I am going to mention this case this evening. It is the case of a firm called Teljoy (Pty.) Ltd., or Telgeluk (Edms.) Bpk. This is one of the worst cases of the exploitation of the ordinary man that I have yet come across. It is a firm which says that it will rent television sets to subscribers when television comes. This firm seems to be sure that it will come. In its pamphlets are a wonderful set of photographs of what the television screens would look like. There are photographs of landings on the moon, entertainments, etc.</p>

<p>The rental is 85 cents per week. They are asking the people here to pay three times that amount of rental, which means 300% profit. I have it in black and white and I am not talking nonsense. I say that the indecisiveness of this Government has resulted in what I want to call the exploitation of the ordinary public of South Africa.</p>

<p>There is no uncertainty about the policy of the United Party in this regard. We demand television. We are not in doubt whether it would be advantageous to our country. We ask this commission to report in two stages. After all, let us get that first stage over and done with, the first stage which would say whether television is desirable or not. Let us get that report before 22nd April. We do not ask it; we demand it. [Interjections.] It is utter nonsense for the hon. the Minister to say we in the United Party do not care what type of television comes. We realize that if we were to be in power and were to introduce television, it would not only be enough to say &#x201C;Abracadabra!&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Hey presto&#x201D;, &#x201C;Open Sesame!&#x201D;, or something like that, and that we would then immediately have television. We agreed that there should be an investigation, but there should not be this time-wasting delay of first of all deciding in principle as to whether television should be introduced or not.</p>

<p>For the record, I should like to read what the United Party policy on television is. I hope the hon. the Minister will listen and that we will not hear those nonsensical remarks from the other side of the House that we have no policy on television. We say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">1. The United Party believes that the policies of the Nationalist Government over the years in regard to television have placed South Africa in a humiliating and indefensible position in regard to other countries, and we reject the intolerance, bias and falseness of such policies.</block>

<p>2. The United Party Opposition further believes that the majority of citizens want television, and calls upon the Government, if it has any doubts on the matter, to hold an immediate referendum on the subject.</p>

<p>Possibly, if the hon. the Minister agrees, we could take this general election as a referendum on the subject. I now go on to Point No. 3&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">3. A United Party Government shall introduce television without delay.</block>

<p>4. The television service shall give proper attention to the cultural and language needs of the main population groups and seek to maintain a proper balance between news, entertainment and instruction.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, we too shall have a commission, but not a commission to decide whether we should have television. It will be a commission which will have to decide on certain basic facts and certain basic items which we believe to be important, namely to enquire into and advise on&#x2014;</p>

<p>They have no policy. In the little time that is left, I should like to say a few word in regard to a certain body of which there has not been as much discussion as there could have been, namely the South African Broadcasting Corporation. I believe I might just as well start at the top. It is well known that the chairman of the Broadcasting Corporation, Dr. Meyer, will be terminating his period of Office during some time this year or early next year. Could I ask the hon. the Minister whether he has considered reappointing Dr. Meyer or whether he has considered appointing someone else in his stead. A strange statement was made by the hon. the Minister recently in reply to a question of mine when he uttered the following words:</p>

<block name="quote">There may be lack of reasons for reappointing a member of the Board of Governors.</block>

<p>There may be instances where he does not want to give the reasons, but here he states that there may be no reason at all for re-appointing a person as a member of the Board of Governors. What is his attitude going to be in regard to Dr. Piet Meyer? Let us refer to the other appointments. We have read that Professor Weiss has been ousted from the Board of Governors. I believe the Herstigte Nasionale Party will have more to say about that than I, because my views and those of Professor Weiss do not agree. Somebody was appointed in his stead and his views do not agree with mine either. This person is nobody else than Mr. W. A. Maree. We know the gentleman and we should like to hear from the hon. the Minister why he was appointed to the Board of Governors. We should like to know what his qualifications were so that he was appointed member of the Board of Governors. We know that the hon. the Minister is an ex-organiser of the Nationalist Party in the Free State and I believe that Mr. Willie Maree is one as well. They are old political cronies. Is this simply an attempt to get an old friend on to the Board of Governors to act as a sort of a watchdog against Dr. Piet Meyer and against the verkramptes? The hon. the Minister should tell us what the qualifications are of Mr. Maree for being appointed in this particular post. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>One does not know to what extent the verkramptes have infiltrated the Board of the S.A.B.C. and the other echelons of that body. I want to quote from a newspaper article, whose heading is: &#x201C;Top S.A.B.C. men at rebel Nat meeting, says Jaap Marais&#x201D;. Mr. Marais disclosed at a public meeting in Lichtenburg &#x201C;that top S.A.B.C. men attended a meeting of the Hertzog Group.&#x201D; Amongst these S.A.B.C. men were Dr. Piet Meyer, Mr. Douglas Fuchs, Director of Programmes and Mr. A. M. van Schoor, editor of <i>Die Vaderland,</i> who broadcasts on foreign affairs. The <i>Sunday Times</i> also disclosed that Mr. Theo Greyling, who is largely responsible for writing &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;, attended the meeting. To what extent have the verkramptes infiltrated into the S.A.B.C.? We ask the hon. the Minister what is he going to do about it. Merely appointing Mr. Willie Maree is not enough at all. What is he going to do about that?</p>

<p>The S.A.B.C. is very much a body on its own. We must realize that most other bodies associated with the Government have their books audited by the Auditor-General and their finances can be discussed in this sovereign Parliament of ours. However, this is not the case with the S.A.B.C. We read about the chairman of the S.A.B.C. going on an extended trip abroad during last year or the year before. If Mr. Willie Maree or any other Minister goes on an extended trip abroad, at least we have the right to ask in this House what it costs. We dare not ask what the trip of Dr. Piet Meyer cost. All that we can see is that the expenses of the Board of Governors increased by 30% in that particular year. In this sovereign Parliament of ours we can ask about the ministerial black yachts on wheels, the Cadillacs, but we dare not ask about the S.A.B.C. All we see in the report is that R400,000 has been spent on buying vehicles for the S.A.B.C. Calculated at approximately R2,000 a vehicle it means that 200 motor cars have been bought for the S.A.B.C. However, we dare not put a question to the hon. the Minister on that issue, because he refuses to answer anything along those lines.</p>

<p>I want to refer to another topic. We had a discussion on phone tapping during the discussion <span class="col_825-826" refersTo="page_0425"/>on the second reading of this Bill. What utter confusion there was on this issue! The hon. member for Umhlatuzana said that there was tapping, but that is was necessary. The Prime Minister said there is no tapping at all. The hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, however, said that he did not authorize any tapping, but if other departments have done so, or if we suspect they have, we had to ask them. Here we had three different points of view on the issue of tapping. The real answer came from my colleague the hon. member for Umbilo, who proved that tapping has taken place at the instigation of the Government. The hon. the Minister had the political effrontery to accuse the Durban Corporation on account of that. Does he not realize that it was the security branch of the police of his Government who asked the Durban Corporation whether the phones could be tapped? Does he not know that there was a &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, from the discussion of the third reading of this Bill it is quite clear to us that the Opposition is making a final attempt not only to prevent this legislation from being approved, but also to use this opportunity to indulge in some scandal-mongering. The Opposition is aware of the fact that the Post Office as a department has been independent financially for merely a year now. It was only during the past financial year that they had their own funds at their disposal for capital expenditure and other expenses. The hon. member who has just sat down, raised a few matters here to which I would like to refer. In the first place, he claimed credit for the Opposition for having made the pleas which lead to the reduction of radio licencing fees for pensioners and scholars. He referred to the fact that the S.A.B.C. had also said in 1963 that it was essential that the amount payable should be R1. Considering what the income of pensioners was in 1963, we can understand that they would have found it more difficult at that time to take advantage of this concession in respect of licencing fees and to pay the small amount of R2. The value of the money they had to pay for those licences in proportion to the pension they used to receive every month, was much greater than it is to-day. They can, therefore, afford more to-day because pensions were increased yearly since 1963. For that reason they are now, under the present circumstances, better able to pay this small amount. For that reason the concession announced by the hon. the Minister, is so important. It is alleged by those hon. members that it was their pleas that convinced the Government of the necessity of a step such as this. I can say quite frankly here that since I have been a member of this House, not one suggestion made by the Opposition has done anything to convince this Government of the necessity of such a step. This Government acts quite independently according to circumstances and according to what is right, fair and possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member also had a great deal to say about television. He said they were not impressed by the commission of enquiry appointed by the Minister into the possibility of introducing television in South Africa. Whether they are impressed or not, leaves us cold. Up to now not one hon. member on that side of the House has made the slightest attempt to calculate what television is going to cost, or what effect television is going to have on the people of South Africa; whether salaried people in this country will be able to afford it or not or whether the system will not be too expensive or hopelessly unpractical and inadequate. They have not made any suggestions as to how it will be possible to make television available to all the races in South Africa in the light of the variety of languages they speak. All we got from them, were vague statements which were actually made with a view to the election. I still remember what they said before the last election, namely &#x201C;If you want T.V., vote U.P.&#x201D; or something of that nature. The idea was that if people voted for them, we would got television. This was said without consideration being given as to how it would be used, what the cost and effect of it would be and what kind of films could be made available. All these considerations did not carry any weight with them. It is typical of the Opposition to act in this manner. As far as this matter is concerned, I want to lay it specifically at their door tonight that, during all these years that we have known them as an Opposition, they have never said or suggested anything which served to promote the Afrikaans language and culture in South Africa. We have never heard one word to that effect from that side of the House. Their attitude has always been one of materialism and unpatriotism. For that reason we cannot expect them to take up the cudgels for the Afrikaans language and culture at all. I shall be glad if those hon. members can <span class="col_827-828" refersTo="page_0426"/>mention one example now which will convince us that they have, in fact, done something to promote the Afrikaans language and culture. What is more, they do not want to do anything for South Africa as a whole, the more so since we became a Republic in 1961. They did not want South Africa to become a Republic. For that reason we cannot expect them to take up the cudgels for the language and culture of the Afrikaner and for everything that is dear to a South African. Over the years they have adopted only one attitude, and that is to fix their gaze on strangers overseas and not on South Africa.</p>

<p>In the short time I still have at my disposal, I want to say that this commission of enquiry referred to will possibly bring South Africa television. If they were to make a recommendation of this nature, and if the Government were to accept the recommendation the people of South Africa would know that they are going to have a fine television system in South Africa, a system which everyone will be able to afford. People will then be able to watch future moon landings. I believe that a great number of the Opposition members are still going to go to the moon one day. I shall be glad to be able to see on television how they land on the moon. One of those hon. members expressed criticism as regards the members appointed on the commission and also asked, <i>inter alia,</i> why no women were appointed on the commission. A woman may well be appointed on the commission at a later stage after a favourable recommendation of this nature has been made and after the Government has decided that programming, and so forth, has to be worked out. At that stage there will be ample opportunity for a number of women to be appointed on the commission. Why should this be done at this stage? This is criticism which really has no substance.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the fact that people wanting to rent out television sets are already advertising it even at this early stage. This is a personal matter; it has nothing to do with this House or with our party or with the Opposition. Any person can start a business undertaking of this nature. These people have already been warned by various sources that they do these things solely at their own responsibility.</p>

<p>Comment was also made as regards the appointment of members of the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C. I am grateful that the hon. member for Orange Grove has not been appointed on the Board of Governors yet. There is one other matter as regards the S.A.B.C. I want to refer to briefly, namely the improved programme broadcast for the farmers of South Africa at 6 o&#x2019;clock in the morning. This programme really provides in a great need. We want to thank the Board of Governors and the people responsible for the programming for that excellent service rendered to the farmers of South Africa.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs deserves that we pass the third reading of this Bill. As was stated quite clearly by the hon. the Minister during the second reading debate, major capital works have to be undertaken. For that reason it is essential that we make available these amounts at this stage, otherwise the hon. the Minister cannot proceed with this work. We are confident that, with the amount they have at their disposal, they will be able to carry out what they have set for themselves as an ideal.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the few moments granted to me I shall be able to touch upon a few points only. The first point I should like to touch upon, is that of telephone tapping. The hon. the Minister said that a few years ago I had allegedly said that no tapping was taking place. I should like to ask him to correct his findings slightly. At that time I said, and this is all I have always said, "By the Post Office&#x201D;. No tapping is being done by the Post Office. I have never said that tapping is not being done by other bodies and persons. I maintain that tapping is in fact being done by other departments, by the Police Department in fact.</p>

<p>The Minister of Posts is not in a position to allow or not to allow it, for this is being done on the quiet. It can be done on the quiet. It is very easy for us to ascertain whether or not this is the case. We need not level the accusations at one another here that one or another person is telling an untruth. After all, there is an easy way of ascertaining this. I want to challenge the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and the hon. the Prime Minister to take steps whereby it will be easy for us to ascertain this. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to recommend to the Prime Minister that a select committee be appointed to investigate that matter. That select committee should have the freedom to enter every Office and every building where necessary. If that is done, we shall very soon get behind the truth. I want to tell the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Prime Minister that if they do not accept this challenge I am afraid that only one conclusion can be drawn, i.e. that, in the first place, tapping does in fact take place in South Africa and, in the second place, we shall unfortunately arrive at the other conclusion that there are certain Ministers whose word one cannot accept in this House. There is only one way in which these two conclusions can be prevented, and that is by appointing a select committee to investigate this matter.</p>

<p>Now I come to the next point, namely that of television. The Government has appointed a commission of enquiry in order to ascertain whether television is desirable. Unfortunately I regret that I have to tell the hon. the Minister that his arguments carry very little conviction. I can only conclude that when one advances <span class="col_829-830" refersTo="page_0427"/>unconvincing arguments for steps one takes, there must be other considerations; there must be reasons other than the reason one reveals. This must be the case. The conclusion I arrive at. is either that the Government is already giving serious consideration to introducing it, or that it has in point of fact already decided that it will introduce it. The hon. the Minister advanced two main reasons why he had to introduce television. He said that it is in fact true that Dr. Verwoerd was against it, but that was ten years ago. He forgets that Dr. Verwoerd died only three years ago, in 1966.</p>

<p>He said that Dr. Verwoerd had been against it ten years ago. He also said that circumstances had changed a great deal since then. According to the hon. the Minister these circumstances had changed, in the first place, because of scientific changes and, in the second place, because of economic changes. Let us take first the changes in the economic sphere which the hon. the Minister advanced as a reason. As regards the scientific sphere, he said, television broadcasts from satellites had now become a possibility. This means that by means of satellites other countries can transmit to us television broadcasts which we have to receive here in South Africa; and from that observation one infers that it would be better if one had one&#x2019;s own system. This is a very unfortunate argument, because it is after all very easy to prevent this. The hon. the Minister need only licence all television sets with this personal licence and refuse to permit people to have television sets in their possession or use. Then this possibility would be prevented altogether.</p>

<p>That is precisely one of the complaints we have to-day. It is no longer merely a question of what the Government is doing, but of what they do not have the courage to do. There are more sins which are being committed in South Africa to-day because they do not have the courage to take action, than the fact that they are making wrong decisions, and the wrong decisions are already large enough in number. That is why I say that if the wish to safeguard the people does exist, one has it in one&#x2019;s hands. This is an easy means. But let us now deal with the economic sphere. The hon. the Prime Minister said the major change had occurred in the economic sphere, because we had a micro-wave network in South Africa. However, what he did not say, was that the micro-wave network merely meant that there was a micro-wave line between Johannesburg and Cape Town with a slight detour, and another between Johannesburg and Durban and a little further. This is not a network over South Africa. In other words, these &#x201C;networks&#x201D; do not affect the major part of South Africa at all. In point of fact. they do not affect the Rand, nor that extensive, densely populated area, because they can do without that network. No, the most densely populated part of South Africa&#x2014;Pretoria, the Rand and Vereeniging&#x2014;is not affected by that argument. The only area which is in fact affected by it, really amounts to Bloemfontein and the coastal towns, because that is the course the micro-wave line follows at present. This is, after all, no argument. This is, after all, no change. That major complex has been there all these years, just as it was in the time of Dr. Verwoerd. In the time of Dr. Verwoerd he said, &#x201C;No.&#x201D; But that hon. member says things have changed since Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s time.</p>

<p>I am not afraid of replying to any question. This is just another example of the fact that this Government has absolutely closed its eyes, or is trying with open eyes to destroy one after the other&#x2014;and to destroy them quickly&#x2014;the wise principles which our people retained in the past, and to deviate from all the principles which one of our greatest leaders pegged out for us, one after the other. That great leader showed us the course we had to follow, also in regard to television.</p>

<p>Let me now deal with what Dr. Verwoerd said in order to show how the hon. the Minister and that side of the House are absolutely deviated from his policy and doing infinite harm to the white man in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#hertzog">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HERTZOG</person>:</from>

<p>Dr. Verwoerd said in the first place that it would be wrong for us to introduce in South Africa a black-and-white television system, because the whole world was moving in the direction of colour television. It would be better to wait until we were able to introduce colour television. If television had to come, one had to wait until colour television could be introduced, because, so he said, the cost of the conversion would from the nature of the case, according to our knowledge to-day, be astronomical. The cost will be so exorbitant that it will be foolish to introduce at this stage <span class="col_831-832" refersTo="page_0428"/>a black-and-white system when the colour television system may be introduced in the future. The conversion alone is terribly expensive. Therefore, Sir, at present it is not yet possible for us to introduce colour television with great success. That first requirement which was laid down by Dr. Verwoerd, has not yet been complied with at all.</p>

<p>But let us now deal with the second requirement. He said that there were in the world various frequencies on which television was being broadcast. To change over from one frequency to another, is a terribly expensive process. We know that there is a difference in the frequencies used by France, England, America and other countries. It would be foolish for us to decide on a frequency before knowing what the civilized world will eventually decide and prove to us what the best frequency is, because we shall have to convert again at an enormous loss for the population. I say that the second requirement laid down by Dr. Verwoerd, has not been complied with either. And the Government on that side and the hon. the Minister still want to proceed with this policy and proclaim that they are pursuing Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s principles.</p>

<p>But let me deal with the third principle. The third principle stated by Dr. Verwoerd is as follows: He said television was a luxury from which only certain people benefited and that it involved an infinite number of disadvantages. He said that since it was not essential, but a luxury article, it would be foolish to start something the cost of which would be enormous, when such a large portion of the population of the country was looking forward to economic aid and development. There are thousands of farmers who find themselves in most distressing circumstances, young people who do not have homes, pensioners who are almost finding it impossible to make a living, medical expenses which have become astronomical, and the water resources of the country which have to be developed. Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s wise policy was that one did not choose a luxury article at enormous cost when one&#x2019;s own people had to forego essentials. I want to repeat that hon. members opposite are only thinking of enriching a certain little group of merchants and not of looking after the interests of the farmer and the small man. Nor are they interested in the need of pensioners and of those persons who require hospital services. This is the state into which that party has unfortunately fallen.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the fourth requirement that was set by Dr. Verwoerd. He said, &#x201C;It is true that where physical danger is visited upon a country, a Government always tries to keep a new invention out of that country.&#x201D; He also said that &#x201C;if there is spiritual danger of possible harm being done to one&#x2019;s society, a similar attitude should be adopted&#x201D;. Is this not a deadly argument from a clear-sighted person? He said that one could not destroy one&#x2019;s nation. If something is capable of doing spiritual harm m one&#x2019;s country, that thing dare not be introduced. These are the words of Dr. Verwoerd and also his fourth requirement. Everybody has admitted the harm television can do. British merchants have calculated that they will make a profit of R200 million out of the introduction of television in South Africa. Rather than looking after the interests of their own people, hon. members opposite are looking after the interests of those people overseas, of their few rich friends who want to extort vast riches from the public of the Republic of South Africa, and of firms in Britain which want to make a profit of R200 million. Television is a spiritual danger, and because it is a spiritual danger we must avoid and avert it until eventually it will no longer be a spiritual danger, and that time I do not foresee at all.

<p>This newspaper foresees that this hon. Minister and the Government are planning to bring these films and television programmes into the home of every White person in South Africa. The influence of the cinema does not achieve enough and must now be carried right into the home of every person. Those people would then be broken down spiritually and the children would be prepared for accepting the race attitudes of America and England. This is what they are doing. I cannot but remind myself once again of the words of that leader. Here we have the mouthpiece of five of the hon. Ministers on that side of the House, i.e. <i>Dagbreek.</i> This is the mouthpiece which expresses their opinions; the mouthpiece which expresses their points of view, for otherwise it would after all not be able to exist. Their approval has been attached to it. I want to repeat that the attitude adopted by the <i>Washington Post</i> tallies precisely with the attitude adopted by <i>Dagbreek,</i> which is as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is at stake, is the elimination of obsolete ideas in an old Afrikaner world <span class="col_833-834" refersTo="page_0429"/>which no longer exists. This is an illusion which has to be destroyed for good.</block>

<p>This is what is behind it. They are playing precisely into the hands of our enemies who are now engaged in destroying the old Afrikaner world, that old Afrikaner world which in the time of Dr. Verwoerd was the good world. This is the world that was accepted by those people three years ago. They are now destroying that world which is the salvation of the South African and the White man in South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to-night the hon. member for Ermelo once again accused us in this House, as he has been doing before the public outside, of forsaking the principles of the late Dr. Verwoerd. The hon. member quoted from the speech Dr. Verwoerd made in this House in 1960. The hon. member for Ermelo said that we were destroying and breaking down the principles for which Dr. Verwoerd had stood. He also mentioned the principles here. Is the hon. member for Ermelo not ashamed of this incorrect interpretation of the words of Dr. Verwoerd? I want to read out to the hon. member what the first principle in regard to this matter is, as Dr. Verwoerd saw it. This is recorded in the same Hansard from which he quoted, in column 3002. He can check me. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s words were as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first principle is this: No government can or will lightly say that it is going to keep any invention permanently out of its borders, nor have we ever done so.</block>

<p>This is the first principle Dr. Verwoerd laid down on that occasion. But the hon. member for Ermelo did not mention this; he mentioned other principles here. The hon. member for Innesdal now wants to suggest that this was a general statement by Dr. Verwoerd. However, Dr. Verwoerd himself laid this down as the first principle. This is the way they quote Dr. Verwoerd. I should also like to quote what the hon. member for Innesdal said in this House in 1965. This could just as well have been my voice in reply to the hon. member for Orange Grove the other night. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is sufficient to show how wise this Government is in not acting over-hastily and &#x201C;immediately&#x201D;, as the hon. member for Orange Grove wants it to do, by introducing an immature medium which can only result in trouble and expense and other disadvantages if we do not wait until it has been developed properly as a medium.</block>

<p>But to-night we are told that it is we who are running away from the principles of Dr. Verwoerd. They interpret their own words just as they please. I am very glad that the hon. member for Ermelo has taken part in this debate, because he, too, has attacked me outside this House by saying that I did not re-appoint Prof. Weiss, not because I wanted to break down the Hertzog idea in the Broadcasting Corporation, but because I was in point of fact breaking down the principles for which Dr. Verwoerd had stood. This is the argument. The hon. member used the fact that Prof. Weiss had not been re-appointed to show the country that I was breaking down the Verwoerd school of thought in the S.A.B.C. It has apparently slipped the hon. member&#x2019;s memory that Prof. Weiss was not appointed by the Verwoerd Government. Prof. Weiss was appointed by the Vorster Government in 1967.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, towards the end of the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville he said, in referring to me, &#x201C;as always, he can sneer at us and try to belittle us; he can insult us&#x201D;. I do not know why the hon. member is so sensitive. Sir, is it that he realized towards the end of his speech that as usual he had allowed his eloquence to run away with his common sense? When the hon. member himself gets to his feet, he is completely insensitive to the feelings of his opponents. I do not sneer at the hon. member, Mr. Speaker. I do not belittle him when I point out in a gentle way his shortcomings as a transport critic. I do not insult the Opposition when I say that I have seldom witnessed a more blatant exhibition of political opportunism by the Opposition than during this debate. I am not insulting them; I am merely stating a fact.</p>

<p>It was really pathetic to listen to hon. members opposite and to hear their deep concern for the welfare of the railway workers. The hon. member for Yeoville said, among other things, that I must pay proper attention to their pay demands. I usually do. In the past 15 years I have always paid proper attention to their pay demands. He said I should appoint experts to evaluate their work. Well, Sir, it sounds very nice but there are over 630 different grades in the Railway Service and I do not know whether it is humanly possible to get an expert from outside the Service to evaluate the work in every one of those grades. Evaluation has been done by the Management itself, but not by the expert envisaged by the hon. member. Then he said that we must introduce a non-contributory pension scheme. Well, Sir, the contribution of the Administration is approximately R221/2 million annually and it increases every year. In other words, the expenditure would be increased by R221/2 million for the first year if we had to change from a contributory to a non-contributory pension scheme. The hon. member said that we should reintroduce the rent rebate scheme which was abandoned in 1954. It sounds very nice, Sir, but it is going to cost a considerable amount of money and it will certainly not give satisfaction to the staff because so many of them will receive the benefit of the rent rebate scheme whereas others will not receive it. Other Opposition members too, Sir, were very concerned about the welfare of the railwaymen. They asked for better wages and increased benefits. I need only refer to the hon. member for Salt River, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City), the hon. member for Green Point, the hon. member for Newton Park who also entered the debate because he suddenly discovered that he had a few railwaymen in his constituency&#x2014;so he had to say something about them&#x2014;the hon. member for Umbilo and the hon. member for Port Natal who said that I dare not pay railway workers a living wage because if I did I would not get them to work overtime.</p>

<p>Sir, I have heard lots of nonsensical arguments in this House, but I think I have never heard a more nonsensical argument or statement <span class="col_839-840" refersTo="page_0432"/>than that made by the hon. member for Port Natal. But the total of their promises will add up to many millions of rand of increased expenditure, and at the same time they want to reduce revenue. The hon. member for Yeoville says, as he does every year, that the profit of the pipeline must go to the users of petrol on the Witwatersrand. In other words, approximately R20 million must go to the users of petrol on the Rand, but at the same time he wants to increase expenditure by many millions of rand. Now, of course there is an election pending and the railwaymen and their dependants constitute a very powerful block of votes, almost 1/4 million. That is why the Opposition shows such deep concern for the welfare of the railwayman, as they do before every election. [Interjections.] In 1961, before the election, they moved an amendment. Among other things it said that the House should refuse to pass the Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill because the Minister has, <i>inter alia,</i> (a) concluded an agreement with certain groups of the staff, thus prejudicing the interests of the staff as a whole; (b) departed from the long-established principle of enhanced payment for overtime worked by railway workers, and (c) failed to provide relief for pensioners. That was in 1961, and then the election took place. They lost the election and their number of seats was reduced. In 1966, again before the election, they moved this amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill unless and until the Minister gives an assurance that the Government will eliminate anomalies and injustices which over a long period have been detrimentally affecting the users as well as the employees of the Railways.</block>

<p>Again the election of 1966 took place. They lost the election and their number of seats was reduced. In many of those constituencies the Railway vote held the balance of power, but they still lost. In fact they lost constituencies such as Umhlatuzana, Germiston (District) and Maitland, which had a preponderance of Railway votes. You see, Sir, apparently the railwaymen do not believe them. They know that those hon. gentlemen have not the slightest hope of ever getting into power and that they will never be in a position of being able to implement their promises, so why worry about such a futile Opposition, such a powerless Opposition? And with every election the railwaymen have voted almost <i>en bloc</i> for the Government, as they surely will do again on 22nd April.</p>

<p>Now the 1970 election is coming up. The Opposition moved an amendment again to the effect that until the Minister gives an assurance that he will remove the strain and injustices suffered by large sections of the staff, they will not pass this Bill. It is going to be very interesting to see whether they will get the support of the railwaymen. I am afraid they are in for a terrible disillusionment. In spite of the so-called confidence the members have on that side of the House, I am afraid they will come back here probably as a reduced Opposition, with fewer seats than they have now. But of course they are pinning all their hopes on their new allies, the Herstigtes. Sir, they are depending on a broken reed. The formation of the H.N.P. and its nomination of candidates will certainly not help the United Party.</p>

<p>This cross-debate having finished, I shall continue with my speech. I want to deal with the level crossings, a matter which has been raised by a number of hon. members opposite. The hon. member for Yeoville said he was surprised that I did not take this opportunity offered by this Part Appropriation to express some sympathy or regret in connection with the children who died in the level crossing accident at Meyerton not so long ago. Sir, I think this was a shocking statement to make. I think it is shocking that the hon. member for Yeoville should endeavour to make political capital out of the deaths of 23 little children. [Interjections.] There is no other explanation for it. I expressed my sympathy and my regret on the day of the accident. Why should he raise the matter in this form in this House if he did not want to make political capital out of the deaths of these 23 little children? Sir, I am a father and a grandfather myself. I can feel and realize only too well how those parents must have felt who lost their children. I think it is a terrible tragedy. In fact, it preyed on my mind for quite a time after the accident had taken place, and that is why I take such strong exception to the shocking manner in which the hon. member for Yeoville endeavoured to make political capital out of the deaths of these children. Having said that, I do not think that we should lose our sense of perspective.</p>

<p>We never have lost it.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I do not want to retort to the remarks of a woman, because after all they are unpredictable. I say we must not lose our sense of perspective. In 1968-&#x2019;69, 60 people were killed at level crossings. Almost 6,0 were killed in 1968 on the roads. Surely the motor vehicle drivers should also have <span class="col_841-842" refersTo="page_0433"/>some responsibility to take sufficient care before crossing the rails. After all, if they observe the law that they must stop at a level crossing and look to both sides to see whether the lines are clear before they proceed over the crossing, crossing accidents would be reduced by 90 per cent. Surely some responsibility should also rest on the drivers of motor vehicles. I introduced a Level Crossing Act, Act 41 of 1960, for the first time to create a fund for the elimination of level crossings and the establishment of a Standing Committee which is representative and consists of experts and which must make a survey and draw up a list of priorities and enter into negotiations with the local and provincial authorities. Since 1960 R17.5 million has been allocated for the elimination of railway crossings, more than in any comparable period in the past. In 1965 I amended the Act also to provide, out of the funds of that particular fund, for the erection of protective devices such as flash lights and booms, etc. Up to 1969 389 level crossings have been listed; 111 have already been eliminated, and construction work is in hand for the elimination of a further 31 crossings. Negotiations are well advanced for the elimination of a further 76 level crossings, and negotiations are being conducted with the authorities concerned in connection with the elimination of a further 146 crossings. I can only say that everything is being done within the means at our disposal to eliminate these dangerous crossings.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) also made a contribution. He told the House about a crossing called Sweet Waters near Pietermaritzburg, which he said was controlled by gates. He said he went there after an accident had taken place to investigate the matter, and then he had a talk with the crossing-keeper. He asked him whether he had a time-table. The crossing-keeper said no, he had no time-table, and he said he did not have a telephone either. Then the hon. member asked the crossing-keeper how he could know when a train was coming along. The man said he lies down and holds his ear to the rail, and when he hears a train coming, he jumps up and opens the gates. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it must have been a very arduous job. Just imagine that poor crossing-keeper lying on his side all day with his ear to the rails, listening for trains to come along. Then, if there are two sets of rails, a great deal of agility will be required as well, because the keeper would have to jump from one set of rails to the other. Sir, what are the facts? The Sweet Waters road level crossing was equipped with flash lights at the end of 1967 and crossing attendants were withdrawn early in 1968. Prior to that date, the cabin occupied by attendants at the level crossing was equipped with red lights which were switched on by approaching trains. The attendants were regularly issued with working time books, which contained information regarding all trains. Can the House blame me for be coming impatient sometimes, when I have to listen to such nonsense?</p>

<p>*We again heard, of course, of the serious manpower shortage, especially from the hon. member for Yeoville. Half a dozen of those hon. members said that they would win the election. They said there would be a change of government after 22nd April. One could have expected them to say that, but what are they going to do to meet the serious manpower shortage on the Railways? Let me say at once that the manpower shortage is, in fact, exceptionally serious. What solution does the Opposition offer in this regard? Here I have that infamous booklet of theirs, the yellow book, published by them. I am sorry, but I only have the English copy of the book. Therefore I shall have to quote in English. Under the heading &#x201C;Transport Services&#x201D; they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party policy will ensure that &#x2014;(1) the Railways are run by a well-paid staff, paid according to the nature of their responsibility after the jobs have been evalued by experts.</block>

<p>No, there is not a single word about the manpower shortage on the Railways. Do hon. members know what they say in connection with the manpower shortage? Now this is applicable mainly to workers outside the Public Service and the Railways. This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It meets these problems by a policy which &#x2026; guarantees employment of Whites at real wages ...</block>

<p>What are these &#x201C;real wages&#x201D;? To me this is a peculiar statement. I think they themselves do not know what it is. This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It meets these problems by a policy which &#x2026; guarantees employment of Whites at real wages not lower than those they earn at present. The guarantee should last for at least ten years in those industries where non-Whites are beginning to do white jobs.</block>

<p>It is interesting that they mention &#x201C;industries&#x201D; in this regard. They are now going to give such a guarantee for ten years. In other words, suppose there is a shortage of firemen. They will now give the engine drivers a guarantee often years that they will still be in the service, which will be the case in any event. Such an engine driver will not earn less than he is earning at present, but now he has to allow Bantu on the engines as firemen. Do you see. Sir, they do not know what they stand for. It is the ignorance of the Opposition that irritates one so at times. They have heard something, but they definitely do not know the rights of it. They proceeded with their policy statement. They said it was &#x201C;a policy which pays special attention to education and re-education &#x2026;&#x201D;. Hon. members should remember that I am now dealing with the Railways. They have to solve the Railways&#x2019; manpower shortage. These are their proposals. Their policy, they say, is one &#x201C;which introduces a national minimum wage for Whites&#x201D;. Now what on earth does that have to do with this?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is long overdue on the Railways.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>A &#x201C;national minimum wage&#x201D; is not necessary. It is quite unnecessary. If I had introduced a &#x201C;national minimum wage&#x201D; three years ago. all wages would have been approximately 50 per cent higher by this time. What point is there in introducing a minimum wage when wages are constantly increasing and not decreasing. Mr. Speaker, they do not know what they are talking about. They go on to say, &#x201C;We will apply the rate for the job at realistic, not minimum. wage levels in all those cases where normal wages are above the national minimum wage for Whites&#x201D;. Now this is supposed to solve the manpower shortage. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should find a different adviser on labour matters, because in that case they might come forward with more sensible ideas. These then are the proposals to solve the manpower shortage on the Railways. There are certain jobs on the Railways which are being done by non-Whites at present. I have dealt with this matter here by way of question and reply. There is, for example, the unskilled labourer. At present there are many thousands of Bantu doing that pick and shovel work, but this had started many years ago. There is also a considerable number of non-Whites doing graded work, but there is a standing committee consisting of members of the Management and of the trade unions and each time a non-White is about to be employed in a white job, his case has to be submitted to that standing committee and they have to give their approval. This is how this is being done. When these hon. members said on a previous occasion that they would only be able to do so when the trade unions concurred and gave their approval, I asked them what they would do if the trade unions did not give their approval and whether they would still do so in that case. I am still waiting for a reply to that question. I say there is a serious manpower shortage, but higher wages is not the solution, because the private sector is always able to outbid the State. This has been proved throughout the years. What we do is to introduce better working methods, mechanization and automation in every possible field in order to save manpower and to keep the wheels rolling in that way. That is why we are transporting 115 million tons of goods every year with fewer white workers than five years ago. I want to mention one example. We are making use of and in future we shall make further use of what is called &#x201C;loopgeselsers&#x201D; in Afrikaans. I do not know whether the hon. member knows what &#x201C;loopgeselsers&#x201D; are. They are &#x201C;walkie-talkies&#x201D;. The use of walkie-talkies will save the Railways approximately 500 shunters.</p>

<p>They need not work overtime in order to live. These are the absurd remarks we hear in this House. The hon. member for Port Natal is not present at the moment, but he told the story that I was keeping basic wages low in order to force these people to work overtime. Overtime has been worked since the time the Railways came into existence. It has never happened as yet that we have been able to schedule all trains in such a way that they arrive at their destinations at the exact time when a man is to go off duty. Why does the hon. member not think before he opens his mouth. Then the hon. member for Yeoville spoke of what he called &#x201C;bush courts&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, this name, as I said by way of interjection, he got from <i>The Sunday Times.</i> One of their reporters, who wanted to be very funny, was the person who used this name &#x201C;bush courts&#x201D;. There is no such thing. There is no court on the Railways. Does the hon. member not know that? Why does he not take the trouble just to consult the Service Act to see what the disciplinary procedures are? There is no such thing as a court. The only thing that happens when there is an offence is that which is called an &#x201C;ondersoek&#x201D; in Afrikaans is held, an &#x201C;inquiry&#x201D;, if he does not understand Afrikaans. After the inquiry has been held, a report is made. That inquiry does not punish the official. The only thing they do is to present a report to the discipline superintendent to say whether they have found the man guilty or not guilty. Then punishment is imposed. Then that staff member still has the right to appeal either to the appeal board, on which he is represented by his own people, or to the head of the department, the General Manager and the Minister. This is the procedure. But I do not know from where they get this idea of &#x201C;bush courts&#x201D;. It is ridiculous to speak of this. There is no such thing as a &#x201C;court&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I know what the railway-men say and think. They support the disciplinary code. They know what it is. But, of course, any man who is guilty and is punished for an offence, does not like it.</p>

<p>Then hon. members spoke of the accumulation of livestock at Johannesbrg last month. In this regard I just want to say that this is not the fault of the Railways. The Railways are a transport undertaking. When goods are offered for transport, these goods have to be transported from the consignor to the consignee. Surely the Railways cannot exercise control over the number of livestock consigned. This is. in the first place, the responsibility of the consignor and of the consignee. When such livestock arrive at their destination and cannot be received, they have to remain standing there. This is what happened in January. The municipality failed to make adequate provision for the slaughtering of all the animals. They alleged that their slaughtering line had broken down. For years it has been the position that they have been warned that the facilities at Johannesburg are inadequate, but up to to-day they have not yet started constructing a new abattoir. The result was that hundreds of trucks had to stand there. These trucks were standing in yards. Now, I do not know whether the hon. member knows this, but one cannot off-load animals from a truck if there is no platform and no proper kraal. One cannot simply make them jump from the truck to the ground where there is no platform. Neither can one simply off-load them on a platform and let them take their own course if there is no kraal. For that reason it was not possible to off-load them. In that case they stand in the yards where shunting operations are in progress all the time. That is the reason why they could not be fed and watered. Now one of the Johannesburg City Councillors, who was quoted by this hon. member, has come forward with a beautiful idea of designing a new type of truck, something which is, of course, a foolish and impractical thing. In any event, there are numerous places where these trucks are going to stand where water is not even available. How then is one going to take down the troughs, open the hatches and push in the troughs, especially if the truck is fully loaded with animals? Should one make the troughs high or low? While the trucks are in motion, will that water ever remain in the trough? The whole argument is absurd. I just want to say that animals are being transported and trucks are being designed in the closest cooperation with the Department of Agriculture in every respect.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I am now coming to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). I am afraid that, in terms of the Standing Orders, I am only allowed one hour for my reply, so I cannot deal with all the points raised by hon. members. But the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) made certain allegations that I cannot let pass. The hon. member for Middelburg replied very adequately to him, but I think that I have to add something. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) said that the flying staff are being worked to the limit of their endurance&#x2014;remember the words &#x201C;the limit of their endurance&#x201D;&#x2014;namely <i>91/2</i> hours on domestic fights and 15 hours 45 minutes on international flights. Now, Sir, if the public reads that, they will think that these men are strained to the limit of their endurance and that the safety of the public will be in danger. That is why I cannot let that pass. But the hon. member has heard something about this. He probably picked up a few stories here and there and came to this House, in spite of receiving a reply to a question he put, and made these statements. The <span class="col_847-848" refersTo="page_0436"/>position as regards domestic flights is that the South African Airways is well within the 12 hour limit laid down by the International Federation of Airline Pilots for domestic flights.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? In reply to my question you answered on Tuesday morning that the International Federation of Airline Pilots Association did not lay down a limit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must now listen to what I am saying. This is the position regarding domestic flights:</p>

<block name="quote">Nine hours, thirty minutes are not considered excessive as two pilots are available on all these flights. The time given for international flights, namely 15 hours 45 minutes represents the time taken on the longest uninterrupted South African Airways flights, namely London to Jan Smuts via Sal. Three pilots are available on these flights as well as sleeping accommodation on board with the result that pilots are afforded sufficient time to rest which varies according to individual demand. The next longest uninterrupted flight is that from Jan Smuts to Lisbon, the duration of which is <i>91/2</i> to 10 hours, where two pilots are available. More than sufficient time is allowed for rest after all flights and is never less than 24 hours on the fight to London via Sal.</block>

<p>It is interesting to know that pilots prefer the flight to London via Sal. No complaint has ever been received on any aspect of this flight, That is the position and I think if there is any complaint I will receive them from my pilots. They would not have gone to that hon. gentleman to complain. The hon. member also spoke about the actual conversion courses and again he showed his ignorance. I wonder if the hon. member knows what a simulator is. I do not think so. I do not think that he has ever seen the inside of a simulator. The conversion courses on Boeing 707s are approximately three months long, consisting of six week ground lectures, 45 hours simulator training and 10 hours flying training. In the case of Boeing 727s the course is approximately 23/4 months long, consisting of five weeks ground lectures, 40 hours simulator training and 10 hours flying training. The training for Boeing 737 pilots takes approximately <i>21/2</i> months, consisting of four weeks ground lectures, 40 hours simulator training and five hours flying training. I hope the hon. member will learn a lesson from what I am saying. Modem simulator conversion training is considered to be more effective than actual flying training, which has resulted in the curtailment of actual flying time in aircraft. The new Boeing 737 simulator has proved extremely effective and provision will be made in the Additional Estimates of Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works for the acquisition of an improved type simulator for Boeing 707s, which should further curtail the conversion time to this type of aircraft. The conversion time prescribed by the South African Airways is rather on the conservative side and compares favourably with those of other airlines. It should be borne in mind that once experience has been gained in jet aircraft pilots should be conversant with the basic techniques so that the conversion from one type of jet aircraft to another is comparatively more simple than, for instance, from Viscounts to Boeing aircraft.</p>

<p>The hon. member will have an opportunity to speak again during the Third Reading and he may put his question then. The hon. member also said that the short flying hours of training pilots receive may be a reason why they have had more and more reports of bumpy landings and of bad take-offs. By saying that the hon. member is casting a serious reflection on the ability of my flying staff. I want to ask the hon. member where he received those reports from and from whom. The hon. member for Middelburg also repudiated the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks on bad take-offs. If one makes a bad take-off in a Boeing 707 it will go into the ground. I want to ask the hon. member to hand over those reports and to tell me from whom he received them. Hon. members make allegations and talk without any basis in fact.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about hi-jacking and about the Amsterdam conference. It was an ordinary general meeting of I.A.T.A. at which certain resolutions were taken. South Africa was represented at this conference. The hon. member also spoke about the Tokyo Convention. This convention did not seek a solution to the problem of hi-jacking. There is only one solution to hi-jacking, namely that it should be regarded as sea piracy. All the countries in the world should enter into an agreement that they will treat hijackers the same as sea pirates. For instance, Cuba must enter into a convention such as this. But the Tokyo conventions did not make any suggestion as to how the problem of hi-jacking could be solved. I can only give that hon. member the assurance that if the countries of the world are prepared to enter into such a convention, South Africa will also take part. Hi-jacking should be regarded as piracy. The guilty person should not be extradited, but should be punished in that country where the aircraft lands.</p>

<p>Of course we are pressing for it all the time. We do not press at UNO. We press at I.A.T.A. We press it wherever there is a possibility of getting countries to agree.

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Salt River. He advocated the building of a line from Montagu Gardens at, Milnerton to Saldanha Bay. I do not want to comment on this except to say how much his contribution is worth. Just imagine building a line from Milnerton to Saldanha Bay! I need not say anything more.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point said that all the members of my employee unions are so dissatisfied with the staff associations that they come to him with their grievances. I have a lot of confidence in all my staff associations. In my opinion the leaders are responsible men. I have been dealing with them for more than 15 years. They always try to do their best for their members and to put their case. That is what they have done through all the years. That is why the leaders and their executives are re-elected every year. The hon. member came here with a number of grievances, he said, from I do not know how many members of the employees union. He said that they are complaining about sick leave, about sickness benefits and all the rest of it. I want to say that I have progressively improved leave and sickness benefits over the years. I think the staff associations are much more competent to raise matters such as this with the Minister and the Administration than that hon. member. They at least know what they are talking about.</p>

<p>Overtime is not regular. One man might work 20 hours overtime during one month, whilst during the next month, he only works 10 hours overtime.

<p>Of course, it will not reach me because they are not prepared to make such stupid suggestions to me. The hon. member, as a final proof of the dissatisfaction of the railway workers, read us a letter. The contents of the letter were about a man who was transferred and who then went to the Paul Sauer Building. There he spoke to an official and, according to him, the official &#x201C;was baie onbeskof&#x201D;. So he says the United Party Government was a much better government than this one because this official was &#x201C;onbeskof&#x2019;. And that is now the final proof of dissatisfaction with the Railway Administration. I always thought that that hon. member was a well balanced man and that he does not speak before he thinks. It now seems to me that he does speak before he thinks.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Vasco spoke of the allocation of houses. I just want to say that the allocation of houses is done by the staff itself. There is a housing committee and a method for awarding marks. When the worker obtains sufficient marks, he gets a house.</p>

<p><span class="col_851-852" refersTo="page_0438"/>We also like to employ women. Every day we employ more women.</p>

<p>I have taken cognisance of the representations of the hon. member for Bethlehem, especially those in connection with recreation time for young people. We are doing what we can, but if the work requires them to do so. they have to work.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park said there were many complaints from Chambers of Commerce, industries and agricultural societies regarding inadequate services. During the past year I received nothing but praise from the Chambers of Commerce and of Industries. I attended some of their meetings. They are very pleased about the fine services they are receiving. The hon. member is a stranger in Jerusalem or otherwise he fabricated those things. What is the nature of the type of cases he mentioned? There are a few cases of delays in forwarding. We transport 115 million tons per annum. Naturally there are delays at times.</p>

<p>In Johannesburg, yes. But there we have already accommodated them. Wherever there are complaints, we remedy matters. For this very reason I now have a large number of private entrepreneurs to undertake those delivery services from Kazerne. I want to continue by saying that if those people who complain would only cooperate and be prepared to receive goods on Saturday mornings and during lunch times, there would not be such an accumulation of goods. The hon. member also spoke of a few head of sheep that died suddenly, etc. This also happens. I do not deny this. But this is no proof of the inefficiency of the services.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member said that there was a salary and wage freeze three years ago. Where does he get that from? Where does he get it from that there was a salary and wage freeze in 1967?</p>

<p>This is the type of story he is telling that will probably cost him his seat. One must not tell a railwayman these stories. I think the hon. member should rather confine himself to agricultural matters. In that regard he ought to do better.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I wish to say to the hon. member for Houghton that the services from Soweto and other Native areas have been improved during the past year. But the population is also continually increasing. It is extremely difficult to keep pace with the increase in population. The hon. member should go to a place such as Melbourne to see what happens on those stations at the peak periods. The hon. member should go to Japan where she will see that they make use of pushers. When the train stops and the doors open the passengers are pushed from behind to get them in. They have no seating accommodation. Additional facilities will be provided, but it is extremely difficult to accommodate all the passengers at the present time. The increase in third-class fares is fully justified. Those Bantu are still being heavily subsidized by the Government, to the tune of R12 million per year. They are subsidized by the Government; that is why their fares are so cheap. The wages of the Bantu workers have increased over the years. There is no doubt about that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wonderboom also had a word to say. He spoke of a parcel he had sent by airmail to Durban. Apparently it went astray and only after it had been to Windhoek did it arrive at Durban. The hon. member said he wondered whether that was not sabotage. I can only say that the hon. member is over-estimating his importance. Who would want to sabotage him? Is it necessary? I do not even know what the parcel contained, but to think that they would sabotage him by sending that parcel to Windhoek instead of to Durban, really is somewhat ridiculous. The hon. member also spoke of the employment of non-Whites, but I am afraid that he will not be able to derive any venom from that. This is no innovation. This has been happening throughout the years, also when he still sat on this side of the House. Therefore he knows what the position is and therefore I hope that he is not again going to make that kind of propaganda we have been up against lately.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would not like to describe the hon. member for Yeovilie, because I do not think it would be parliamentary.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) named a number of members on this side of the House who did not enter the debate. It is quite right that they cannot outbid the Opposition. It is quite impossible for them to make promises which would outbid those of the Opposition. They have no hope to do that. Why should they then enter the debate? Should they try and outbid the Opposition? The difference is, and the railwayman knows it, that these hon. members look after their interests whereas the Opposition only talks. The hon. member himself said &#x201C;words are cheap; it is deeds that count&#x201D;. It is so true; all the words are on that side of the House and all the deeds on this side of the House. The hon. member for Durban (Point) became quite indignant&#x2014;one would easily have thought that he was in the last stages of labour&#x2014;when he spoke about the injustice and the penalizing of a certain Mr. Meyer. This Mr. Meyer resigned from the Railways and apparently did not receive interest on his pension contributions.</p>

<p>*In the first place, the disciplinary inquiry was to be held on 13th November. Then, however, Meyer suddenly became ill with a headache. The disciplinary inquiry was then postponed until 15th January. Meyer knew what he had done and what he had been caught for&#x2014;dishonesty. Then, on 18th December, it came to the attention that Meyer had handed in his resignation and that he would work his last shift on 31st December. Thereupon the disciplinary inquiry was specially advanced to 22nd December, i.e. to a date prior to that on which his resignation would become effective. His resignation was accepted and he was informed that he was regarded to have resigned in order to avoid a disciplinary inquiry and disciplinary steps which would result from that inquiry. Meyer refused to proceed with the inquiry which had been set down for 22nd December.</p>

<p>If the man had remained in service and had attended the disciplinary inauiry, the hon. member would have been able to see What would have happened. This was not the first time a trap had been set for ticket examiners. On the contrary, it happens often; and often they are punished in terms of the disciplinary code. If they are found guilty, they are normally discharged. Meyer knew this, of course.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Simonstown raised mostly local matters. These will be inquired into. I can only say that the suburban services are being improved continually. But, as I say, he has raised mainly local matters and I do not think he can expect of me to have first-hand knowledge of the condition of, for instance, the women&#x2019;s toilet on a particular suburban station.</p>

<p>*In conclusion I want to say that I think that it is generally accepted that I have been looking after the interests of the railway workker during the 15 years I have been occupying this position. often I have had to refuse demands and requests. This is so. But, on the other hand, wherever it has been possible to do so, I have said &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. My responsibility is not towards the staff only, but also towards the public and towards South Africa. It is very nice and easy to become popular&#x2014;one need only say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; all the time. After all, it ought to be nice to meet all the demands of the railway staff and to give them increases all the time. That would be very nice. What is more, the profits yielded by the S.A. Railways do not, after all, come to me; this is not a private company which pays dividends to its shareholders. I have a responsibility, as I have said, also towards the public and towards South Africa and for that reason I have had to say &#x201C;no&#x201D; often. But in spite of that I have been enjoying the full support and confidence of the railwayman throughout the years. I once addressssed a challenge to an hon. member opposite, an hon. member who had a lot to say, i.e. I declared myself willing to call a meeting of the managements of all the staff associations so that he and the hon. member for Yeoville might address them. I would not be present. My undertaking was that if one-third of the members of those managements were to adopt a motion of no confidence in the Minister, I wold resign, and if that did not happen, the hon. member would have to resign. That offer was never taken up. For that reason I say that I am not concerned ab out what the railwaymen and their dependants, those who can vote, are going to do on 22nd April. I have sufficient confidence in their sound judgment to leave that safely in their hands.</p>

<p>Question put: That all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; stand part of the motion.</p>

<p>I want to inform the hon. member for Orange Grove, who asked for a commemorative stamp in commemoration of the centenary this year of Gen. Smuts, that his representations were made at a very late stage. It is customary to submit applications during the year prior to the year in which the stamps are to be issued. The Cabinet has already decided on the issue of postage stamps in 1970 and the hon. member will understand that the work has to be done by an artist. It inevitably takes time, and the artists are not always available to do it.</p>

<p>This brings me to the question of the tapping of telephone calls. The hon. member for Orange Grove referred to the proof the hon. member for Umbilo would produce. Now, the proof of the hon. member for Umbilo is nothing new. It has already been raised in this House on a previous occasion, in 1961. At the time the hon. the Minister of Posts, the hon. member for Ermelo, gave a reply. The question read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Oldfield asked the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs (1) whether his attention has been drawn to a report in the <i>Natal Daily News</i> of 13th February, 1961, that an official of his Department attended a meeting on 22nd February, 1960, between a police Officer and representatives of the Durban City Council to discuss a request by the police for permission to tap telephone lines of the municipal telephone system, (2) (a) what was the name of the official, and (b) in what capacity did he attend the meeting; (3) whether the official was invited to attend the meeting; if so, (a) by whom and (b) for what reasons was his presence required; if not (4) whether the official sought permission to attend the meeting; if not, why not; if so, (5) whether permission to attend the meeting was granted; if so, by whom.</block>

<p>To that the then Minister of Posts and Telegraphs replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1 Yes; and (2), (3), (4) and (5) I have no knowledge of the alleged happenings. I can but repeat that the tapping of telephone calls is not permitted in the Post Office.</block>

<p>[Interjection.] I can do nothing about the matter. You must discuss it further with the hon. member for Ermelo. The hon. member for Ermelo said yesterday evening he had only denied that Post Office officials had ever tapped telephones, but, he said, he had never denied that other Departments, <i>inter alia,</i> the Police Department were doing so. Now I do not want to do the hon. member an injustice in regard to these words of his. I have the Hansard report here. This is What he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. Minister said that I had allegedly said a few years ago that no tapping was taking place. I should like to ask him to <span class="col_859-860" refersTo="page_0442"/>verify his facts a little. I said at the time, and I have always said &#x201C;by the Post Office&#x201D;. No tapping is done by the Post Office. I have never said that tapping was not done by other bodies.</block>

<p>Now I also find that the hon. member for Ermelo, when he was Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, replied to a question by Mr. Hopewell in this regard on 3rd March, 1961. The question read as follows (Hansard, vol. 106, col. 2333)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether any steps have been taken by his Department to ensure that telephone tapping does not occur; if so, what steps; and, if not, why not?</block>

<p>To that the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, the hon. member for Ermelo replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The equipment in telephone exchanges is designed in such a manner that telephone calls cannot be tapped without knowledge. It has never come to the knowledge of my department that a telephone call is being deliberately tapped and it will also not be permitted.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is the choice of this House, you and the country outside to decide whether they are going to believe Dr. Albert Hertzog, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs of 1961, or whether they are going to believe Dr. Albert Hertzog, the chief leader of the Herstigte National Party of 1970. Precisely the opposite of what the hon. member said last night he admitted in this reply. He denied that any tapping, by any person whatsoever, was taking place, for the Post Office officials knew &#x2026;</p>

That is what is so unpleasant about it all.

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is fine to see a dignified old man of absolute integrity, but if an old man stands before you, stripped of dignity and integrity, it is not a pretty sight. There sits the paramount man of truth of South Africa. I want to say to the hon. member to-day that with the spirit he has revealed to-day he would have been a very good man of truth during the war years, for in everything he would have done, as far as he would have gone, he would have slandered and maligned his fellow Afrikaner.</p>

<p>Last night the hon. member attacked me on the question of the micro-wave system. He said that I had given the impression that the micro-wave system was a tremendously large network. By doing so he belittled the work which he himself began. He belittled his own work on the micro-wave system which he began as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, because when I became Minister of Posts and Telegraphs I was shown a card on which the micro-wave network of South Africa was indicated. In the year 1972 that work will be nearing completion. It is a network which will then cover a mileage of 4,246 miles, will have 135 stations and will, at that stage, have cost a total of R24.3 million. If it should be decided to introduce a television service the micro-wave system of the Post Office will, when such a service is introduced, form a wonderful network throughout the country, and only isolated parts of the country and a very small percentage of the population will not be served by the television communication channels of the micro-wave system. I felt ashamed yesterday evening. I felt ashamed for the part of an hon. member who. for the sake of the political benefit he thinks he will derive from it, does not hesitate to belittle the work he did, or at <span class="col_861-862" refersTo="page_0443"/>least commenced. That is the thanks officials of the Post Office get from their former Minister.</p>

<p>Stop being abusive. Reply to the arguments I raised.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>What were the arguments the hon. member raised? Let me tell the hon. member what arguments he raised. I am glad the hon. member reminded me of this, because it gives me a chance to quote his own words. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said however that the micro-wave network simply meant that there would be a micro-wave line between Johannesburg and Cape Town with a slight detour, and one between Johannesburg and Durban and a little further. This is not a network across South Africa. In other words, this network does not even affect the major portion of South Africa. In reality it does not affect the Rand either, nor those large heavily populated areas, for they could get along without that network.</block>

<p>The biggest centres in the country will be linked by this micro-wave system. What is the hon. member for Ermelo talking about? He does not know what is going on in the Post Office. I want to say to the hon. member for Ermelo that great progress has since been made with the construction of the micro-wave system, for to-day there is no longer time for gossip in the Post Office. To-day work is being done in the Post Office. The hon. member for Ermelo also spoke about courage. He said: &#x201C;The hon. the Minister need not merely licence all television sets with his personal licence and refuse people permission to have television sets in their possession or to use them, then this difficulty would have been prevented entirely. It is no longer a question of what the Government is doing, but of what they do not have the courage to do.&#x201D; The hon. member sat here for ten years as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Why did he not have the courage to do so? Why did he never have the courage to do so, for then he would, after all, have made it impossible for me to do. Why did he not have the courage to do so? It was, after all his own legislation. Mr. Speaker, in regard to television I want to inform the hon. member for Orange Grove that when he said yesterday that the United Party would also before the introduction of a television service, have referred the matter to a commission in order to investigate certain aspects of television&#x2014;this is by the way the first time I hear of this in this House&#x2014;he was simply proving again that the Government announcement in regard to the appointment of a commission of inquiry on television was necessary, and that I hit them hard and accurately the other night when I replied to the Second-Reading debate by pointing to that careless irresponsibility the Opposition was displaying by wanting to introduce a television service in South Africa without first having the matter investigated by a commission of experts.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not have time. The hon. member is trying in vain. This proves the hon. member&#x2019;s whole attitude.</p>

<p>How true my summing up was that this Herstigte gossip party were going to use television as a bogey in the election is simply proved again by the words of the hon. member for Ermelo. In the last part of his speech he issued another warning. He quoted to us what the <i>Washington Post</i> says to prove what a terrible danger it is for South Africa, for the Afrikaner and for our race policy. Can hon. members imagine that, the editor of the <i>Washington Post</i> must give guidance and light to the hon. member for Ermelo! It is true, Sir, because they are people who are afraid. They are afraid that the Afrikaner will have to come into contract with English-speaking people. They are afraid that the Afrikaner will come into contact with overseas countries, for the Afrikaner will not be able to maintain his identity. They do not believe in the Afrikaner. They mistrust their own nation, the Afrikaner nation. They think that its integrity is so poor that it cannot maintain itself. It is these people who have to receive guidance from the <i>Washington Post</i> from America in order to throw a scare into the people of South Africa. Do hon. members know that that party owes its establishment to all the American books they have read which have frightened the hon. member for Innesdal in Particular so much that he starts shivering and is still shivering today. When he gets up he shivers when he thinks of all the dangers the American books have made him believe in, and with thich he wants to make every Afrikaner in this country afraid.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

</speech>

<p>Hon. members will notice from the documents already tabled that provision is being made for additional expenditure which amounts to R2,508,000 and is to be defrayed from REVENUE FUNDS during the financial year 1969-70. This brings the revised estimates to R860,360,000.</p>

<p>The additional appropriation under Railways &#x2014;Head No. 17&#x2014;<i>Miscellaneous Expenditure, Net Revenue Account</i>&#x2014;amounts to R45.796. <i>Ex gratia</i> payments total R7,723, of which the amount of R5.322 is in respect of livestock injured or killed during transit by rail. An amount of R20,000 is in respect of a donation to the Bureau for Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Bureau, whilst an amount of R1,000 is required for a contribution to the Municipality of Pietermaritzburg for the maintenance of a private siding in consideration of its use for departmental purposes.</p>

<p>In respect of Head No. 28&#x2014;<i>Working and Maintenance</i> <i>(Airways</i>)&#x2014;an additional amount of R2,380,689 is required. This is, <i>inter alia,</i> attributable to the renovation of and alterations to the S.A. Airways Office in New York, increased holiday bonus payments to the staff, improvement of salaries and allowances of aircraft crew, hire charges for aircraft, increased working costs, increased landing fees and increases in insurance premiums. Material requirements have increased owing to the modification of Boeing 707 engines and the replacement of unserviceable spares, whilst expenditure in respect of meals and refreshments for passengers, as well as the cost of accommodation and meals for the cabin crew, is higher than was estimated.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 30&#x2014;<i>Miscellaneous Expenditure, Net Revenue Account (Airways)&#x2014;</i>provision is made for an amount of R80,000 which, under a pool agreement, is to be paid over to B.O.A.C. in respect of international traffic conveyed to and from Zambia.</p>

<p>As far as additional expenditure on CAPITAL AND BETTERMENT WORKS is concerned, hon. members will notice that an additional amount of R26,133,200 is required. However, it is possible to finance an amount of R16,112,090 out of savings under existing appropriations, whilst an amount of R21,110 is available owing to the surrender of working capital which was voted for a specific purpose but was in excess of the actual requirements. Therefore, this does in fact leave only R10 million to be voted from loan funds.</p>

<p>As will be noticed from the budget documents that have been tabled, there is a number of proposals in respect of which only a nominal cash provision is made. This is mainly in respect of work of an urgent nature which cannot stand over until the main estimates are submitted to Parliament later this year without harm being done. Such votes include, <i>inter alia,</i> the replacement in the Durban Harbour of good-sheds F. G. and H. which burnt down recently, level crossings elimination schemes and housing for the staff.</p>

<p>An amount of nearly R1,839,000 in respect of belated debits is to be approved under the various heads in accordance with the resolution of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 1&#x2014;<i>Construction of Railways</i>&#x2014;additional cash provision amounting to R3,350,000 is required as a result of the fact that the progress made in regard to the construction of the new railway line between Metsi and Kaapmuiden and that from Vryheid to a point on the railway line under construction between Empangeni and Richard&#x2019;s Bay was more rapid than was expected. In addition to that a further amount of R900,000 is required for the railway line to Richard&#x2019;s Bay, since more filling up had to be done as the ground formation in the Nselini swamp is not as firm as it was originally thought to be.</p>

<p>The additional appropriation under Head No. 2&#x2014;<i>New Works on Open Lines</i>&#x2014;is R1,700,000. Of this amount R78,300 is required for urgent works which were financed in the meantime out of the Unforeseen Works Vote and for which specific provision has to be made now, whereas cash provision to the amount of R22,000 is required for the purchase of a house in Blantyre for the District Sales Manager of the S.A. Airways.</p>

<p>Arising from an inquiry into the handling of export fruit, it was recommended that pallets be used in order to eliminate manual labour as far as possible, and an amount of R180,000 is now to be voted for this purpose.</p>

<p>In view of the conclusion of several relaying works, an amount of R380,500, originally charged to the Renewals Fund, has to be transferred to the Betterment Fund.</p>

<p>In order to relieve the heavy burden on the carriage section of the Renewals Fund, an amount of R1,461,900 is being appropriated from loan funds to finance part of the cost of new carriages.</p>

<p>It is, in addition, the intention to finance out of Capital Funds one Boeing 707 aircraft which would originally have been provided out of the Renewals Fund, and for this purpose an amount of R4,850,000 is being voted under Head. No. 6&#x2014;<i>Airways,</i> whereas an amount of R450,000 is similarly required for financing the two Boeing 707 QC aircraft which were ordered recently.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 8&#x2014;<i>Working Capital</i>&#x2014;an additional amount of R500,000 is required for the Home Ownership Scheme, whereas an amount of R12.1 million has to be voted for <span class="col_865-866" refersTo="page_0445"/>the Administration&#x2019;s major requirements in respect of stores stock because of the expansion of activities and the rising prices of material and equipment.</p>

<p>To summarize, therefore, the position is that an additional appropriation of R26.ll 3,200 in respect of Capital and Betterment Works and R2.508,000 in respect of additional expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue Funds, are required.</p>

<p>This is in connection with allocations from the Renewals Fund to capital funds. As I have already explained in my speech, it was to have been paid out of the Renewals Fund originally. But as we did not want to weaken the Renewals Fund too much or exhaust it, we are now using these capital funds partly to cover the cost.</p>

<p>Could the hon. the Minister give us more information in regard to the globular amount of R12.100,000 under Item No. 180 [R.P.9&#x2014;1970, p. 37] which is to be spent on additional requirements as far as store stock is concerned? I ask this question in view of our past experience with regard to Railway stocking and the difficulties connected with railway stores over the years. The footnote here is very short and the hon. the Minister in his introduction of this particular item discussed it very briefly. I wonder whether the hon. Minister could give this House a little more detail on how this amount of R12 million is to be spent. It is a large amount and I think we should get an explanation in this regard from the Minister.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In the first place, this Bill seeks to afford protection to certain workmen who are excluded at present. Furthermore, the object is to adjust as from a fixed date all current pensions awarded before 1st October, 1967, in accordance with the increased pensions payable at present. I have already tabled an explanatory memorandum and I now take pleasure in furnishing hon. members with the necessary further details.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, one of the overseas companies which was granted the right to search for oil along our coastline, succeeded in striking petroleum gas. This company employed quite a number of persons living in our country to assist in these drilling operations. In the course of these activities a number of accidents took place which were reported to the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner. However, the commissioner is of the opinion that the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, as worded at present, does not apply to these activities outside our territorial waters, and the legal advisers support him in this view. It is also understandable that this would be the case, for activities of this nature are a new development in our country, and when the Act was passed in 1941 there was as yet nothing of the kind. Apart from the drilling operations, there is the possibility that construction works will eventually be erected over such drill-holes. This is dangerous work, and as the prospecting and drilling operations increase in scope, it may be expected that more and more persons will sustain injuries. In these circumstances it appears to be desirable to bring within the scope of the Act workmen who are resident in the Republic and engaged in connection with such activities, despite the fact that they are for the most part engaged outside our territorial waters and by foreign employers as well. Clause 3 (a) of the Bill makes provision for this.</p>

<p>Normally these persons would, while in the employ of foreign employers, not come within the scope of the Act, since the continental shelf does not form part of the Republic, However, the Republic has sovereign rights over our continental shelf, even outside our territorial waters, for the purpose of exploring, examining and exploiting the natural resources in it. These rights are embodied in an international convention accepted by the Republic during 1963. and under the Territorial Waters Act of 1963 our territorial waters were extended in this manner. Since reference is made in clause 3 (a) of the Bill to &#x201C;continental shelf&#x201D; and &#x201C;natural resources&#x201D;, it is necessary to define these expressions for the purposes of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, and in clause 1 provision is being made for this.</p>

<p>The amendments in clauses 2 and 4 relate to seamen and airmen. It is only under limited circumstances that such persons are at present regarded as workmen for the purposes of the Act. In this manner section 11 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Act shall only apply in respect of a seaman or airman who has met with an accident outside the Republic on a <span class="col_869-870" refersTo="page_0447"/>Republic ship or aircraft, provided that such a person was a member of the crew. As drilling operations increase, it may be accepted that certain employers will make greater use of seamen and airmen. In clause 2 of the Bill it is being provided that such workmen shall also be covered if they are involved in the exploitation of natural resources. In addition clause 4 provides that the restrictions imposed upon seamen and airmen by section 11 of the Act, shall not apply to such workmen as their working conditions differ considerably from those of ordinary seamen and airmen.</p>

<p>Clause 3 (b) deals with workmen who, when employed by foreign employers, may possibly be covered by the workmen&#x2019;s compensation legislation of another country as well. At present section 10 (3) of the Act provides that where accidents happen to such workmen of the Republic while they are temporarily employed outside the Republic, and they would be entitled to compensation under the law of the other country as well as under our law, such workmen shall elect the law under which they wish to claim compensation. As the same position may arise in respect of certain workmen who are engaged in the oil-drilling operations, and who are now being brought within the scope of the Act, it is being provided in clause 3 (b) that such workmen will also have to make a choice, just as is the position in respect of other workmen in similar circumstances.</p>

<p>In addition section 96 (3) of the Act provides that a foreign employer who carries on business in the Republic, shall register with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner. It is being provided in clause 10 that a foreign employer who is concerned with the exploitation of natural resources on the continental shelf and employs workmen of the Republic, will also have to register with the commissioner. The amendment contained in clause 5 seeks to eliminate a gap. Section 43 of the Act provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the payment of increased compensation if an accident was due to the negligence of an employer or a responsible person in his employ or a patent defect in the condition of the premises, plant, machinery, etc.</p>

<p>However, an application for increased compensation has to be lodged with the commissioner within six months of the date of the accident, and under certain circumstances the commissioner may extend this period by a further period not exceeding six months. Subsection (6) of section 43 also empowers the commissioner to apply of his own accord the provisions of the section in any case where, even if no application has been lodged, he considers that there is <i>prima facie</i> proof that a workman is entitled to additional compensation, but he may only exercise this power within 12 months of the date on which the accident happened. Recently there was a case of an employer who failed to report an accident, and subsequently it was impossible for the commissioner to exercise his powers in terms of the Act, since, when the application was considered, a period of 12 months had already expired after the date of the accident. It appears to be unfair that the rights of a workman can be foiled in this manner through the failure of his employer to meet a statutory obligation. Therefore, it is now being provided in clause 5 that the period of 12 months shall be calculated from the date upon which the accident was reported to the commissioner.</p>

<p>Now I come to clause 6 (a) which deals with the adjustment of pensions. As hon. members know, the increased benefits granted in the past were only applied to accidents which happened on or after the date on which the statutory amendments took effect. Financial considerations played the most important part in this. In the first place, it cannot be expected from the present employers to finance in the form of higher annual assessments the additional costs of accidents which happened years ago. In the second place, bearers of risks other than the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund, will not find it easy to bear the additional financial burden. These bearers of risks include, for instance, the mutual associations such as the Rand Mutual, which undertakes accident-insurance for the mines, and the Federated Employers Mutual Association, which undertakes insurance for the building industry. There are, in addition, certain exempted employers such as municipalities, the Railways, Provincial Administrations as well as all Government Departments. However, representations in connection with a revision of existing pensions have been made to us for quite some time. In the light of these representations I instructed the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner to investigate the possibility of an adjustment of pensions awarded before the 1967 statutory amendments. It appears from his report that, on the basis of the present formulae and wage limits, the cost involved in an adjustment of this kind will, it is estimated, amount to approximately R443,000 a year. The capitalized value of this will be approximately R5&#x00BE; million, which will also be the total cost for the Fund.</p>

<p>In the absence of details, calculations have not been made in respect of the other bearers of risks, which include Government Departments and the Railways. Everybody came out in favour of the revision, but the two licensed mutual associations have emphasized that these adjustments should not be regarded as a precedent, since the rate at which they have accumulated reserves is for the most part dependent upon the assessment rate system. Without long-term planning and tax implications for the associations, this system cannot be changed to make provision for regular pension adjustments.</p>

<p>I should now like to give a few examples of the way these adjustments will look like in practice. A widow whose husband died in 1943 as a result of an accident at work and received a salary of R69.77 per month at the time of the accident, receives a montly pension <span class="col_871-872" refersTo="page_0448"/>of R10.27 at present. After the adjustment she will receive R20.93 per month. A workman who is 100 per cent unfit for work owing to an accident which happened in 1960 and whose salary at the time of the accident was R171 per month, receives a monthly pension of R66 at present. After the adjustment he will receive R112.50. A widow with three children whose husband died in 1965 and received a monthly salary of R154 at the time of the accident, receives R90 per month at present. After the adjustment she will receive R112.50.</p>

<p>However, I want to emphasize that everybody will not gain the same amount by the adjustment, as the workman&#x2019;s wage plays a fundamental role in the calculation of his pension. For instance, a pensioner with a pension which was based on his total wages, will receive no increase, unless the accident happened before 1961, at which time a less favourable formula applied.</p>

<p>Furthermore. I want to call attention to the fact that pensions payable under the 1934 Act, have not been included under the envisaged revision, since accident-insurance under that Act was borne by private insurance companies.</p>

<p>According to my information the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund has sufficient reserves for bearing the additional expenditure, and it will not be necessary to increase the assessment rates for this purpose.</p>

<p>The amendment contained in clause 6 (b) relates to the deletion of certain provisions of the Act. Section 43<i>bis</i> of the Act provides, for instance, that a pensioner may, in addition to a pension and subject to certain conditions, be paid an allowance in respect of an accident which happened before September, 1956. Applications for such allowances are rare, and since 1957 only four such applications and allowances have been received and awarded, respectively.</p>

<p>As it is being envisaged to revise all current pensions, the said provisions have become redundant and it is being proposed that they be deleted. The present beneficiaries will not be prejudiced by this step.</p>

<p>Several organizations have now for many years been making representations for the year of assessment of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund to be changed so that it may coincide with that of the income-tax year. This proposal also has the support of the Federated Chamber of Industries, the Iron and Steel Federation, the Associated Chambers of Commerce, the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut and the South African Agricultural Union. Clause 7 of the Bill and the consequential amendments contained in clause 8 carry these representations into effect. The financial year of the fund will remain the same, i.e. 1st January to 31st December, but the year of assessment, for the furnishing of wage-sheets, will extend from 1st March in any year to the end of February the following year. However, the wage-sheets for 1971, i.e. at the time of the con version, will also have to include the wages paid out in January and February, 1970.</p>

<p>The amendment contained in clause 9 seeks to extend the powers of the commissioner in regard to further or special medical treatment. As hon. members know, the Rehabilitation Hospital in Johannesburg is now in full swing and provides excellent services to injured workers. This hospital was erected at a considerable cost, and it was expected that this centre would enjoy the full support of all interested parties, i.e., employers, workmen and doctors. However, I regret to have to say that full cooperation, especially on the part of doctors, is not as desired. Investigations have brought to light the fact that some doctors give preference to private institutions, the result being that a considerable number of beds in the Rehabilitation Hospital are empty. A similar trend is noticeable at the centre in Durban.</p>

<p>As the commissioner finances these hospitals, it appears to be justifiable that he should have the power to place, at any time, injured workers in such hospitals for further or special medical treatment, as well as for treatment with a view to rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Prominent orthopaedic surgeons have already mentioned to the commissioner that such a step would be welcomed, and official representatives of the Medical Association of South Africa also supported these proposals in principle.</p>

<p>However, I want to emphasize that it is by no means the intention to grant autocratic powers to the commissioner, and consequently there is a provision in terms of which consultation with the Medical Association of South Africa has to take place prior to an instruction being issued in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these are the main features of the envisaged amendments, and I trust that they will meet with the approval of the House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill is a measure to improve the administration of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act and which removes certain anomalies, and What certain people call injustices, and for that reason the Opposition will support it. But with a view to facilitating discussion in the Committee Stage, I should like to put a few questions to the hon. the Minister, and I hope he will reply to them, so that we can take the matter further in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>It appears to me that this Bill will mean that fishermen fishing and exploiting our natural resources outside our territorial waters, will also be covered by the Act. I should like to know whether this is the case. Then the Minister should explain to us the position of those fishermen who, according to an old and strange custom, receive no salaries, but a percentage of the catch, in terms of a fixed contract with the owner of the boat. I wonder if they too will be covered by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. If not, can something not be done to ensure that these people will also <span class="col_873-874" refersTo="page_0449"/>be covered? The fact that they work for a percentage is, as I said, a question of tradition. I think in practice they are really employees of the owners of the boats.</p>

<p>Then I should also like to ask the Minister whether this Bill contains anything which would cover deep-sea divers. In this connection, I am thinking particularly of a case we had a year or two ago when the young man Mr. Beukes drowned near Durban and was apparently not covered by the Act. In this connection, too, I would be pleased if the Minister could assure us that such cases are covered by the Bill, and if not, whether he would consider rectifying the matter in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Under clause 9, in terms of which the Commissioner will have the right to designate the institution at which an injured person must receive special or further treatment, I should like to ask whether the Commissioner will have the power, for example, to send injured Bantu back to the homelands. We know that it is the desire of the Government to send as man) Bantu as possible who are not immediately required for work in the white areas, back to the homelands. Misgivings have been expressed to the effect that this power may be used by the Commissioner in order to achieve this end. I should very much like to hear the Minister&#x2019;s comments in regard to that. If it is the case, as I think it is, that the Medical Association must be consulted in all cases, it is difficult to see how this can be used to carry out the other aspect of policy, but the misgivings do exist and have been raised, and I shall be very grateful if in his reply the Minister would deal with this as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is an ornament to the Statute Book of South Africa. I Should like to assure the Minister that whenever he wants to introduce any measure to improve it, he may always depend on the wholehearted co-operation of the Opposition, because it is the party on this side of the House Which placed the original Act on the Statute Book, as is the case with all the good laws.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we wish to thank the hon. the Minister of Labour for this amendment Which he has introduced. We are grateful that the hon. members of the Opposition agree that this Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is an Act of which this House can be very proud. But we are even prouder of this Act because it is being administered so well by the Minister and his Department. None of us wants to make political capital out of this Bill, because the person Who derives the most benefit from this Bill is the unfortunate worker who is injured at work. For this reason we are grateful that amendments which will be to the advantage of the worker are again being introduced. This Act was placed on the Statute Book for the first time in 1941, and it came into operation in 1943. It so happens, however, that highly necessary amendments are added every second or third year. I want to ask the hon. the Minister Whether the time has not arrived for this legislation to be consolidated. I know that it is a big task which lies ahead, but I want to appeal to the Minister to consider this. The Minister should seriously consider whether instructions should not be issued for this Act to be consolidated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Certain pension benefits are now going to be improved in terms of clause 6. I understand that 3,200 persons are receiving pensions under this Act. In this connection, I should like to address a request to the Minister. Let us say, for example, that the case of a worker who was injured in 1957. and whose case was finally dealt with in the same year, is reopened in 1969. 12 years later. Twelve years later that worker is still suffering as a result of the accident which he had in 1957, but when his compensation is determined, it is done on the basis of the salary which he received in 1957. Since we are now granting new pension benefits to these workers, I want to ask the Minister to see whether an improvement cannot be granted in regard to compensation as well.</p>

<p>That is just wishful thinking. We can have another good fight next week. Let us talk about the worker for a While on this occasion. There is another matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister. As far as the large industries are concerned, we find that there are no problems in the application of this Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. A large industry has its own welfare officials. If a worker is injured, there is a first-aid room where he can be taken. The worker who has been injured, is treated. He can be taken to a doctor. As a result of the fact that the industrial expansion in our country is taking place so rapidly to-day, we find, however, that more and more smaller industries are being established. When a worker is injured in such a small industry, even the employer does not always know exactly what should be done, nor does the employee always know what advantages he can claim. Now I want to know whether it would not be possible to take short extracts from the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act to be pasted up in a prominent position in every factory. Both the employer and the employee will then know exactly to what benefits they are entitled, and what they should do in order to obtain those benefits.</p>

<p>If the hon. member says that this is the case, then I say that I have seen factories where they have not been pasted up. I ask the Minister to ensure that it is done.</p>

<p>Clause 9 deals with the rehabilitation hospital. Our rehabilitation hospital is probably one of the best rehabilitation hospitals in the world. We are very grateful to the Department of Labour for having established such a rehabilitation hospital to take care of the worker, but at the same time one is sorry to hear that that hospital is not being utilized to the full. We agree with the hon. the Minister that the worker should be transferred to that hospital, because, after all, the fund pays for it. I also want to tell the hon. the Minister that we from the East Rand in particular find that the hospital in Johannesburg is situated in a place which is not easily accessible. The rail and bus services to this hospital are not convenient. Although I have already done so in the past, I again want to submit a plea to the hon. the Minister in this connection this afternoon. When a worker is injured and has to spend a long time in that hospital, is it not possible for the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund to provide his wife and children with a rail or bus ticket at least once a week so that the family may visit the person who is in hospital? I read in the newspaper that there is talk of this rehabilitation hospital possibly standing in the way of Johannesburg&#x2019;s new freeways.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as indicated by the hon. member for Yeoville, we on this side of the House will support this Bill. In fact, we welcome the amendments which are introduced by the first few clauses. The effect of these amendments is to bring within the provisions of this Act those persons who are working above or below the water on the continental shelf so that they will be protected by the Act. In view of the growing importance of oil drilling and prospecting both on the continental shelf and inland, we consider it to be particularly important that those persons engaged in these activities should be protected by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. We will therefore support the amendment which has the effect of giving them this protection. Ait this stage I should like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention a matter which we will discuss more fully in the Committee Stage. If will, however, give him a little time to consider the matter if I raise it now. This is the question which was briefly referrred to by the hon. member for Yeoville, namely the protection of divers. It seems to me after a proper reading of these amendments that divers will now be protected because they will fall under the definition of &#x201C;workmen&#x201D; and not &#x201C;seamen&#x201D;. If they come within the definition of &#x201C;seamen&#x201D;, then it seems to me they cannot be protected because the definition of &#x201C;seaman&#x201D; reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Seaman&#x201D; means a workman within the meaning of section 3 employed in any capacity on board a ship by the owner or master.</block>

<p>A ship is defined as &#x201C;a vessel of any description used in navigation&#x201D;. An oil rig is not used in navigation and therefore would not fall within the definition of a ship. A diver, if he falls within the definition of &#x201C;seaman&#x201D;, would therefore not come within the provisions of the Act. I think that it is important that divers should have this protection by being brought within the provisions of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. As I say, Sir, I think that the position is covered if divers do come within the definition of &#x201C;workman&#x201D;.</p>

<p>There is one other aspect about this legislation that I should like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. Clause 3 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where an accident happens to a workman resident in the Union, while employed in, on or above the continental shelf in connection with surveys, research, prospecting or exploitation in respect of natural resources, this Act shall apply in respect of such accident as if it had happened in the Union.</block>

<p>The point which I should like to raise for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s consideration, is the following. If certan workmen are actually resident on an oil rig operating on the continental shelf, would such a person be regarded as being &#x201C;resident in the Union&#x201D;? In terms of this clause it is necessary that he be classed as being &#x201C;a workman resident in the Union&#x201D; before the provisions apply to him and before he can be entitled to compensation. It seems to me that a workman on an oil rig operating off the continental shelf of our coast would be regarded as being resident in the Republic, only provided that that oil rig is operating within the territorial waters of the Republic, which, in terms of the definition of the Territorial Waters Act (Act 87 of 1963), is defined as being &#x201C;the sea within a distance of six nautical miles from low water mark &#x2026;&#x201D;. Some parts of the continental shelf extend <span class="col_877-878" refersTo="page_0451"/>beyond six miles. It is doubtful whether an oil rig operating outside the six mile limit can be regarded as being within the Republic. Consequently, in such a case it seems to me that it may be doubtful that a workman resident on that oil rig can be classed as being resident in the Republic. In my opinion there would be no problem with regard to a South African citizen, because in any event he has a permanent home in the Republic. So he would be resident within the Republic, irrespective of the fact that he may be on the oil rig. But this may not be the case in respect of a foreigner who is brought to South Africa particularly to work on one of these oil rigs and therefore has no permanent home, or no residence for that matter, in the Republic. If the amendments that are being introduced by the hon. the Minister, are intended to cover persons who are not South African citizens I think very careful consideration should be given to them. If an accident occurs foreigners are given the choice either to claim compensation under this Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act or under some other provision which may entitle him to compensation. I think it is necessary to give very careful consideration to these matters in view, as I have said earlier on, of the growing importance of the search for oil both on and off-shore in South Africa.</p>

<p>Before sitting down it may be of interest to refer the House to a very recent article which appears in the January issue of the Federated Chamber of Industries&#x2019; official journal, <i>Viewpoint.</i> This article was written by Major Louis Croft who is the Public Relations Consultant of Total South Africa and a writer and lecturer on scientific subjects. He has extensive experience in this field. In this article he examines the prospect of finding oil in South Africa, either on-or off-shore and comes to a very encouraging conclusion. He says there are reasonable prospects of a discovery of the type of oil which was recently made in the Saharan oil fields which are apparently owned by the Total group where a strike of about 90 million tons was made. The conclusion he reaches in this article is that there are reasonable prospects of a strike of that size which, in comparison with other strikes, would be regarded as being a medium quantity. It will not be a huge strike, but will be of medium quantity. This article is perhaps more encouraging than many other comments that have been made on the prospects of the oil search in South Africa. In conclusion I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to give careful consideration to these aspects of the matter, particularly in view of the growing importance of the exploitation of these natural resources.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to refer to the relations between the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner and the medical profession and the relations between the medical profession and the nursing homes and hospitals which are referred to in clause 9 of the Bill. The hon. the Minister wants to give the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation</p>

<p>Commissioner the right to direct an injured, man, subject to certain penalties if he fails to do as he is told, to certain hospitals. The last thing I want to do is to give the impression that I do not approve of these hospitals. They are extremely fine hospitals and they represent an advance in social services. They are extremely valuable to the injured man and to the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner. There is a similar hospital in Vienna where most of the workmen&#x2019;s compensation cases are treated. However, this is not necessarily the best hospital because the head of this hospital is a salaried man from an insurance company. It turned out in practice that he is a genius. But this might not have been so. Firstly, the profession is seriously concerned about the freedom of access of all doctors to special hospitals, to these few special hospitals which may be followed by others. They would like the assurance from the hon. the Minister that the freedom of patients to choose their own doctors is assured. They want the assurance that there will not be the slightest interference with that. This is really a principle of the original Act and must be observed by both sides. The doctors feel that there should be freedom of choice of doctors and of specialists. They also feel that all the facilities of these hospitals should be available at all times to all the doctors who are attending patients in these hospitals. I am sure the hon. the Minister will give these assurances. However, as the hon. member for Brakpan pointed out, there are other difficulties. The patients may have good reason for not wishing to go to these hospitals. It is not very accessible, I understand. Transport to these hospitals is difficult. One of the most appreciated privileges which a patient has is that he can be visited by his relations. However, if he is taken to a hospital which is difficult for his relations to reach, unless you provide some way for his relations to visit him, this privilege is lost. These are all working people, which make it all the more difficult for them to visit their relations in the hospitals. Therefore, some provision should be made for a patient&#x2019;s relations to visit him. He may even have to provide financial assistance for these people. It is not easy for a mother of three or four children to leave her home and be away most of the day, or at least most of the afternoon, in order to visit her husband. The husband may have reasonable grounds for asking to be moved to another hospital which he may even be advised by his doctor not to do. But, nevertheless, to him it is something of great importance. I hope the hon. the Minister will give thought to making some arrangements for these people to be collected. There is a social welfare movement in Durban and also perhaps at other centres called the St. Giles Association. They collect people who are injured or crippled and who need physiotherapy or similar treatment or electrical therapy and take them to hospital where they receive their treatment. Then they return them home. Something of that nature might be considered by the hon. the Minister. However, he will certainly run <span class="col_879-880" refersTo="page_0452"/>into trouble if he tries to enforce on the workman, who is very often supported by his own doctor, the use of a hospital which is not easily accessible to his home. The profession as a whole feels that they would like from the hon. the Minister an assurance that free and total use of all the facilities and totally free choice of doctors will be assured to the patients and to the doctors attending them. I feel that it will be an infringement on the rights of a person should he be forced, after having had an accident, to go to a hospital which might be excellent, but to which he has good reasons to object.</p>

<p>*The MINISTER OF LABOUR Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the exceptionally good reception which this measure has received in this House. It is with pleasure that I reply to questions which were put to me. The hon. member for Yeoville put a number of questions in respect of which I should like to give him certain information. As far as deepsea divers are concerned&#x2014;and with this I am replying to the question of the hon. member for Musgrave as well&#x2014;I can assure him that they will most definitely be covered by this measure. The question of fishermen is not so easy. Fishermen outside our territorial waters are not covered by this measure.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a great deal of sympathy for this case. There was, however, sympathy in the past as well for those people whom we cover to-day, but whom we could not cover under the fund at the time. This is also the position in respect of fishermen who are at the moment excluded because they receive only a part of the profits as their wages. They are still excluded. This is the position because it is so difficult for the Commissioner to make calculations in respect of these people, because their wages consist of a part of the takings or profits. This is the reason why they were excluded in the past and unfortunately still remain excluded.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but surely they do receive other benefits in this country. The hon. member wanted to know whether the Commissioner would have the right to send Bantu to the homelands. The hon. member perhaps did not notice that this rehabilitation hospital is intended for Whites. In other words, it falls completely outside the scope of the discussion.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Durban (Central) wanted to know whether injured workers would have a choice of doctor. Yes, they will most certainly retain the choice to make use of their own doctors. But this provision is meant to do justice to that hospital. When I visited it recently, I was really impressed by the high standard in that hospital. By chance that young man who had suffered 90 per cent burns was in that hospital. You will recall that this case was in the headlines about a year ago. At the time I paid the visit there, this young man was almost on the point of leaving the hospital as someone who could face life again. It made one realize what good and outstanding work is being done there. When such a beautiful hospital exists and offers these services, it is a pity that it is only half-full. When the reason is advanced that the doctors send their patients to their own clinics in which they have interests, instead of to this hospital which is financed from the fund, one feels that this is really anomalous. Hence this necessity. I want to assure you, however, that the Commissioner will exercise the power conferred upon him by this provision, in a very reasonable way. Apart from the fact that the Medical Association will be consulted, he will act in a very reasonable way, and definitely not simply in an autocratic manner.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan also raised a few matters to which I want to reply. The hon. member pleaded for a revision of compensation so that it will be calculated on the basis of a workman&#x2019;s present salary, and not the salary received by him at the time of the accident. This is another matter with which one has a very great deal of sympathy, but it is something which must be borne by the fund. The fund, as the hon. members know, is maintained only by the contributions of the employers. The workers do not contribute a cent towards this fund. Only the employers contribute towards this fund. The fact that we are now inserting this provision which will in fact make the benefits applicable to a period prior to the amendment of the Act represents a very great concession by the fund to the workers. Now I fear that to ask for more benefits would certainly not be fair to the fund. The concessions which are incoporated here, will provide great relief, and because of that I think we should show our satisfaction at this juncture. I have already mentioned the financial implications of this: it will amount to R53/4 million over a certain period. At the moment this amount is all the fund can afford.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan also asked me for information in connection with the fund. The Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund Act does not make provision for extracts to be pasted up on premises, as in the case of the Unemployment Insurance Fund Act, for example. Perhaps the only reason for this is that only the employers contribute to this fund. In any case, I shall ask the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner whether this is a matter which can be investigated, i.e. whether, as in the case of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, the benefits or the main points of the fund can be pasted up. The hon. member for Brakpan also wanted to know whether this measure could not be consolidated now. Consolidation is always necessary, and we are always busy consolidating Acts, because it is useful for reference purposes, but it is an extensive task, especially in view of the staff position. I shall <span class="col_881-882" refersTo="page_0453"/>aso present this matter to the Commissioner and find out if his staff position is such that he will be able to undertake this task.</p>

<p>Then the question of the possible removal of the rehabilitation hospital in Johannesburg to make way for the new freeway was raised here. It would really be a pity if this beautiful and well-built hospital had to be demolished. We have heard that such a possibility exists and we made very earnest representations to the authorities concerned and I am hopeful that our representations will succeed. The hon. member also spoke about the awkward situation of the hospital in that some people have to travel long distances to get there, from the Far East Rand, for example. It is a fact that for some people the hospital is inconveniently situated, but it is well situated for the inhabitants of the Witwatersrand, as well as for people who have to come by train, since it is situated close to a station. This position can however not be changed. The hon. member also asked that we should provide free bus tickets to the women and children of injured workers, so that they may go there once a week. Such a measure would also have financial implications, and the fund must consider their expenditure very thoroughly when such concessions are contemplated. In the past they did not see their way clear to doing this. I can ask them again to consider it, but I can make no promises in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave referred to the workers living on ships outside the territorial waters of South Africa. He wanted to know what the position would be in respect of them. The position regarding them would be that if they were ordinarily resident in the Republic and were living on the floating oil rig only temporarily, they would in fact be covered. If they were not ordinarily resident in the Republic, they would not be covered by this Act. Then they should be covered as foreigners by the funds of their own countries. This is the most the fund is able to do at the moment. I have now dealt with the questions which were put to me.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>It is not only the policy of the Government, but the Government regards and accepts as its responsibility and duty towards the people, to give continual consideration to the economic and social position of the various population groups, and to see to it, as far as this is within its power and possible in prevailing economic conditions, that every population group is able to make a reasonable subsistence within the economic and social structure. This duty the Government feels to an even greater extent towards those groups in our society that are dependent upon protection and the financial assistance on the part of the State for a reasonable subsistence. Hon. members will agree with me that one group towards whom the State has such a duty&#x2014;and I personally feel very strongly about this&#x2014;is those people who as a result of industrial diseases can no longer carry on their occupation as miners and continue to support their dependants. I am referring here to the mineworkers who suffer from pneumoconiosis and /or tuberculosis, and their dependants, and to the dependants of the deceased victims of these two diseases. The Government has a duty towards these people and I do not think anyone will begrudge my saying that this Government has, over 22 years, never hesitated to do its duty towards them and to look after their interests. I therefore find it a pleasure to announce that the Government, after careful consideration, is convinced that an increase in the compensation payable in terms of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act is necessary and justified, and that it is the purpose of this Bill to effect such increases in the rates of compensation.</p>

<p>The last general increase in compensation was in 1965. Subsequent to that, in 1968, only certain rates of compensation were revised and adjusted to eliminate the difference in the compensation for mineworkers who were entitled to compensation prior to 1st October, 1962, and those who were entitled to compensation subsequent to that date. At the same time only a general increase of pensions was granted to the dependants of deceased pneumoconiosis sufferers. Therefore the Government has now decided, as in 1965, to grant a further general increase in compensation on the basis of (a) an increase of 20 per cent in respect of all benefits payable under the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act, with the exception of the pension payable to mineworkers and Coloured labourers in respect of pneumoconiosis with 20 to 50 per cent disability, and (b) an increase of 10 per cent in respect of the pension payable for pneumoconiosis with 20 to 50 per cent disability. The first group includes single amount benefits for all race groups, pensions of miners and Coloured labourers with more than 50 per cent disability and the pension payable to widows and dependent children of deceased beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The difference between the two groups of beneficiaries is drawn on the grounds of the fact that mineworkers and Coloured labourers with 50 per cent or less disability are not legally obliged to stop working in this dustladen atmosphere in controlled mines. After certification the greatest percentage of these people continue working as normal on the mines and receive these pensions in addition to their normal and full remuneration. Those <span class="col_883-884" refersTo="page_0454"/>in this group who no longer work in mines have relinquished their work for reasons other than pneumoconiosis, but such other reasons and diseases which are not related to their occupation as miners do not give them a claim to increased compensation. It should be noted that compensation for work disability brought about by pneumoconiosis and which results in a loss of the ability to earn a normal wage forms the basis of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act. I do not think we should begin to tamper with this basis. On legal, social and moral grounds there is therefore no justification for giving the group with a 20 to 50 per cent disability the same increase as those workers who are compelled by the Act to relinquish their earnings and who in many cases therefore are exclusively dependent upon their pneumoconiosis pensions for a subsistence, and to the widows and dependent children of deceased beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The result of the increase in pensions since 1962 on the basis of a percentage of the pensions prescribed in the 1962 Act is that pensions now include cents in the total. This gives rise to a great deal of work and makes mechanization in regard to the drawing of cheques and the payment of benefits difficult. Although benefits will therefore be increased on a percentage basis, as I have already indicated, it was decided, in the interests of simplifying the work involved, to take pensions to the nearest rand in future, for example if the pension were to amount to R89.61 in respect of a miner, his wife and dependent children, this pension would be taken to the nearest round figure, i.e. R90.</p>

<p>In addition to the direct increase in benefits, the following additional concessions were also included in the Bill: (a) In 1965 a single amount benefit was introduced for the dependants of miners who were at post-mortem found to have been suffering from pneumoconiosis with less than 20 per cent disability. Since then it has become apparent, from a legal opinion which was obtained, that this provision was not applied to the dependants of miners who worked on mines doing other work than work in a dust-laden atmosphere. This matter is now being rectified so that such persons will in future also receive their rightful compensation; (b) It was found that as a result of increasing costs the assistance granted in connection with burial costs was inadequate. Provision is now being made for assistance to be rendered with regard to burial costs as well to the dependants of deceased miners who received only a single amount benefit and the increase in the contributions to these costs. This assistance which is at present limited to R120 in the case of white miners and R60 in the case of Coloureds,_ is being increased to R150 plus 20 per cent, i.e. R180 in the case of miners, and R75 plus 20 per cent, i.e. R90 in the case of Coloureds; (c) The position of persons simultaneously in receipt of a pneumoconiosis pension and an old age or other social pension has also been considered, and in order to give these people as well the benefit of the concessions, the Government decided that the increase in pneumoconiosis benefits under this Bill, just as in the case of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Amendment Act, 1968, will not be reckoned as means for the purpose of social pensions. This means that the person who in addition to his pneumoconiosis pension also received another pension or allowance from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions will continue to receive that pension or allowance; (d) A further concession which appears in the Bill affects persons who were resident outside Southern Africa. Such persons are, according to a provision in the 1962 Act, and all previous Acts, excluded from any increase in benefits. In the meantime some of these people and /or their dependants have, however, returned to the Republic, while they are still receiving compensation granted to them in terms of a previous Act. These people will now receive the appropriate pension payable at present. This however applies only to persons who have returned and obtained permanent domicile here. There are approximately ten such cases; (e) Provision is also being made in the Bill for the exercise of medical control over people who work in &#x201C;works&#x201D; as defined in the Mines and Works Act in contrast to &#x201C;mines&#x201D;. Control over works is exercised by the Government Mining Engineer in terms of the above Act in the same way as other mines. However, the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act is only applicable to mines so that there is no medical control over works. This is a serious deficiency for in many of the works people are exposed to large concentrations of dust and it is therefore necessary that legal authority be obtained to subject persons who work in works under harmful conditions to medical examinations and in order to exercise medical control over them. It is not the intention that such persons be included under the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act for compensation purposes. For this purpose they fall under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, and this is left as it is; and (f) in addition the Bill also makes provision for compulsory medical examinations of persons working on controlled mines in works other than work in a dust-laden atmosphere. This will afford the Department an opportunity of obtaining medical evidence in order to be able to establish what occupations ought to be declared to be work in a dust-laden atmosphere. In future this will make effective medical control over such workers possible and also compel mine owners to make such workers available for medical examination. These people will then go for examination to the Bureau more readily.</p>

<p>The increase in benefits and the other concessions of course create additional liabilities for the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund. As you know the Fund consists of three separate accounts, namely the A, B and C account. The C account (that is, the State) is responsible for the compensation of all cases certified before <span class="col_885-886" refersTo="page_0455"/>the 1962 Act, and the A and B accounts for all cases subsequent to the commencement of the 1962 Act. In 1956, however, the Government accepted the principle that mines should not be burdened with additional debts arising as a result of the retrospective increase in benefits. The Government consequently decided that this retrospective burden would now, in all fairness, have to be borne by the State, as in the case of all increases in 1956 and subsequently. So, too, the Government decided in 1956 that it was unfair to burden existing mines with further obligations created in respect of closed mines. The Government therefore decided that this burden would also have to be borne by the State.</p>

<p>In terms of the accepted policy the mines were consequently held liable for the costs of all future certifications, while the State bore the additional costs in respect of the increase in the pensions of all existing pensioners.</p>

<p>The financial implications of the increase in benefits has been provisionally calculated and will, according to estimates, be as follows in respect of beneficiaries who have to be compensated from the A account, that is to say by Group A mines and from the B account, that is to say by Group B mines&#x2014;</p>

<p>As I have already explained, the State bears the costs in respect of the increase in existing pensions, and the mine the cost of the new certifications. In respect of new White, Coloured and Bantu beneficiaries, the increased burden of the Group A mines will amount to approximately R800,000 per annum and that of the Group B mines to approximately R112,000. In addition to this, Group A mines will accept an additional obligation in respect of latent pneumoconiosis of approximately R5,600,000, and Group B mines of approximately R710,000. This debt is in respect of damage which has already been done to persons concerned, but which will only subseqently be disclosed by way of certification. The annual levies make provision for damage done during that year and which will subsequently come to the fore by way of certification. This provision is being made at current compensation tariffs. When an increase in the compensation tariff is made it means that an insufficient amount has been provided for such damage and that it. must subsequently be recovered. In this way outstanding debt is created in respect of cases which have not yet been certified. Provision for future damage is made in the increase in annual current levies.</p>

<p>The additional liability for which the State will have to accept responsibility is estimated at&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) approximately R959,000 per annum in respect of the increase in pensions payable from the C account;</li>

<li>(b) approximately R2,840,000 in respect of the increase in existing pensions payable out of the A account; and </li>

<li>(c) approximately R380,000 in respect of the increase in existing pensions payable out of the B account.</li>

</ol>

<p>This means that the State&#x2019;s obligation in respect of the C account will increase by approximately R959,000 per annum.</p>

<p>In addition to its increased obligations in respect of the C account the State will have to pay the amount of R2,840,000 to the A account and the amount of R380,000 to the B account, that is altogether R3,220,000, in respect of the increase in existing pensions.</p>

<p>When benefits were increased in 1965 this debt was paid out of the C account to the A and B account, but what is being proposed now is that it should not be done in this way again since eventually it will merely increase the deficit in the C account and secondly, will oblige the C account to sell investments at a loss in order to find the money. The Bill now provides that this debt be paid out of appropriated funds directly to the A and B account.</p>

<p>A few other administrative corrections are also included in the Bill but no matters of principle are affected thereby, and in addition they are of lesser importance.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that I have already informed the Chamber of Mines of the Government&#x2019;s intention to grant an increase to beneficiaries under the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act. The mining industry accepts and concedes that certain concessions are in fact necessary and in view of the fact that the State bears the greatest burden in respect of these concessions, I do not think the mining industry has any reason to complain about this. I am satisfied that it does not place unreasonable obligations on the mines.</p>

<p>At the same time I also want to say that the mining trade unions, and the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union in particular, have asked for concessions. I may say that I am continually coming into contact with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union who are continually bringing this matter of improvements in compensation to my attention as Minister of Mines. However, it is not only the miners who have asked for this. There is the closest co-operation between myself as Minister of Mines and the mineworkers group of the National Party caucus here in Parliament, <span class="col_887-888" refersTo="page_0456"/>and the members of that group admittedly urged even higher and greater improvements and compensation than is being granted here. But I think in all fairness that the members of the group can feel satisfied, although I am sorry that I was unable to concede to their requests for greater and improved benefits. It is unavoidable that one has to cut one&#x2019;s coat according to one&#x2019;s cloth. I am grateful on your behalf as well that the Minister of finance and the Government nevertheless saw their way clear to making these considerable improvements. Although they are not yet aware of the concessions which have been made, I am convinced that the persons who are entitled to compensation, that is those who are still working, those who are no longer working as a result of greater affliction, and the dependants, will accept that this is a vast improvement in the case of our miners and their unfortunate dependents. For the information of the House I shall mention a few examples of how this will be applied in practice. Let us in the first instance take the case of a mineworker who has a wife and one child. I do not know why my Department took the case of a man with one child, for usually they have three or four children.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister can speak as an authority on this subject. I am now giving the House the example of a mineworker with a wife and one child. Persons who are certified to the extent of 20 to 50 per cent are at present receiving R39.60 per month. This is now being increased to R43.56, but we are taking it to the nearest round figure of R44. In other words, there is an increase of R4.40 per month. Those who are certified to the extent of 50 to 75 per cent, are at present receiving R76.80. They will in future receive R92. This is therefore an increase of R15.20. Those who are certified above 75 per cent, are at present receiving R114. From 1st April they will receive R137. In this case therefore there is an increase of R23.</p>

<p>The second group pertains to pensons for a widow and dependent children. A widow at present receives R42 per month. This is now being increased to R50. There is therefore an increase of R8 For every child a widow at present receives R21 per month. This is being increased to R25 per month. There is therefore a monthly increase of R4 per child. After pneumoconiosis has been posthumously found to the extent of less than 20 per cent, there is at present a single amount for the next of kin, i.e. the widow, of R1,150. This is now being increased to R1.380. That is to say, there has been an increase of R230. Mr. Speaker, I am certain that this Bill, with its implications, will be accepted with great pleasure by both sides of the House. For that reason I now move the Second Reading.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House will naturally not oppose this Bill. We welcome quite a few of the clauses in the Bill. What we do not like, is the way in which the Minister has discriminated against certain sections of the mine-workers who are going to receive benefits. Let us deal firstly with clause 2. Here he has divided those who will receive pensions into two groups, namely those with a disability of less than 50 per cent and those with a disability of more than 50 per cent. That is the meaning of this clause, because we have one group with disabilities ranging from 20 per cent to 50 per cent and another group with disabilities ranging from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. Those with a disability of less than 50 per cent will only receive a 10 per cent increase Those with a disability of over 50 per cent will get an increase of 20 per cent. There is a difference of 10 per cent in the payment to the pensioners in these two groups. For what reason does the hon. the Minister increase the pensions? He does so, obviously, to meet the rising costs of living to-day. That is one of the main reasons for this increase. He wants to meet those rising costs, so he says: I am going to give you more. Sir, surely rising costs are the same for all pensioners. These costs do not vary between one group of pensioners and another. The hon. the Minister said that he did not grant an increase of 20 per cent to the group with disabilities ranging between 20 per cent and 50 per cent because those people were still able to work on the mines. But the Minister knows that the same applies to those above the 50 per cent mark. They can also go back to work.</p>

You see. Sir, it is possible for a miner to go back to work. The hon. the Minister will remember quite well, I am sure, that he said that a miner who was suffering from a disability of 50 per cent to 70 per cent, could still be an active worker.</p>

<p>No, I am not. They can go back to work. That is the point. I am not encouraging any miner who is suffering <span class="col_889-890" refersTo="page_0457"/>from pneumoconiosis to go back to work underground. We know that pneumoconiosis is a progressive disease, and therefore my plea was that the miner, once found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis, should be warned not to go underground because we know that it is going to endanger his health. For that reason I pleaded some years ago, I think it was in the days of Dr. Van Rijn, that the miner should be taught a second trade or a second occupation immediately he is discovered to be suffering from pneumoconiosis.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I think so. This is something we have to consider. My point is that when we grant an increase to a pensioner, the purpose of that increase is to meet increased living costs. The increase should therefore be spread out evenly amongst all of them. I think the Minister should really have given a person suffering from a disability of between 20 per cent to 50 per cent an increase of 20 per cent in his pension. I have worked out the figures as well, and the hon. the Minister has confirmed my findings. If a person has a wife and a child, he will only get an increase of R4 per month. That is an increase of a little over a rand per month each. That is what the increase is going to amount to. The hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions has at times been more generous than that, and he is not too generous. I say again that we have to reconsider the amounts that are to be given to mine workers. After all is said and done, Sir. one of the big reasons might have been that there are many more miners suffering from a disability of 20 per cent to 50 per cent than miners suffering from a more advanced stage of the illness.</p>

<p>It does not matter whether they are fully occupied or not. That is not the point. Why should all miners not get the same increase? I cannot understand why we should discriminate against certain miners merely because they are in a certain stage of the illness. Whether they are working or not is beside the point. If the Minister is going to say that there is a difference in allowances because some of these people are working, they are not entitled to get anything at all. This is what happens when one goes to the other extreme. I say that people who are drawing a pension should all receive the same increase, even though they are in different stages of the same disease.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows as well as I do that these people can be engaged in other work. They may still work on the mines, but they may be engaged in clerical work. That, however, is beside the point. The point is that an increase is being given, and the man who is suffering from a disability of 20 per cent to 50 per cent is being discriminated against. That is what I do not like about clause 2. The hon. member may have his arguments, but I have mine, and I do not like this discrimination.</p>

<p>Sir, that hon. member has only been here a week or two. He only has a little longer to go, so let him enjoy himself. There is a further form of discrimination that I do not like in this Bill. I shall deal with clause 7. In terms of clause 7 the Minister is going to increase the amount he gives for funeral expenses and he is going to give a reasonable amount towards immediate medical expenses. He is going to give this to the white worker and the non-white worker. His powers are very, very wide here. This is going to be given to dependants of miners who for the first time during post-mortem are found to have been suffering from pneumoconiosis. If these people had been working on the mines, it is quite obvious that their pneumoconiosis resulted from their work. If a person has been working in a mine they may find, only 20 years later, that he has pneumoconiosis. We say that that pneumoconiosis is due to his having worked in a dusty atmosphere. Why was it not discovered originally when he presented himself for his periodic examinations? There may be a hundred and one reasons for it not being discovered. There may be very good reasons for that but the fact is that the person has pneumoconiosis. Whether it is discovered or not, the fact remains that he did have pneumoconiosis while he was living and that he got it from working in a mine. I say that the dependant of that miner who is also found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis in any stage below 20 per cent should receive at least two-thirds of the pension that would normally have been paid to the widow if he were suffering from pneumoconiosis of 20 per cent to 50 per cent.</p>

<p>It does not matter. The hon. the Minister will agree with me that whatever the man died of, pneumoconiosis would have been one of the factors which contributed to his death. It may have been the cause of his death; in any event, it certainly is something which contributed to his death.</p>

<p>No, I said from 20 per cent upwards and not under 20 per cent. I said between 20 per cent and 50 per cent. My case is that that man had pneumoconiosis and that if he were alive he would have received a pension. On his death his widow would have received a pension.</p>

<p>But it was only discovered after his death at the post-mortem. Mr. Speaker, I want to leave this aspect of the matter now. I have put my point across to the hon. the Minister and I have quite a few other matters to discuss. I want the hon. the Minister to remember what I said. The dependants of those people who during a postmortem were for the first time found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis are entitled to a pension if they are not already receiving one.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Are you referring to cases below 20 per cent?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is below 20 per cent. Let me put my case clearly to the hon. the Minister. A dependant will receive the pension if the man concerned had been found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis from 20 per cent to 50 per cent or above that at the time of death. If through a postmortem it is found that the person concerned has got pneumoconiosis at any stage, and I said that with emphasis, his dependant is entitled to a pension because it would have progressed if he had been working. [Interjections.] I hope that is clear now. I want to ask the hon. member for Brakpan if he will support me if I change my plea from two-thirds of the normal pension to a plea for a full pension.</p>

<p>There is another point which I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. It would appear that clause 16 brings us nearer to the establishment of a department of industrial medicine, which we mentioned previously. I have pleaded for the establishment of such a department of industrial medicine and I see that the Minister has introduced a clause which could lead to this. He brings in other types of work which are covered by the Mines and Works Act. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister knows this, probably he does, but he is doing work for other industries. For instance, if you look at page 17 of the Blue Book of the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau of 1967 you will see that work was done for the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner, the South African Iron and Steel and Industrial Corporation, the Union Steel Company, Dowson and Dobson and the South African Railways and Harbours. Already we see that a channel is being formed whereby we can get people who are suffering from industrial diseases into this department. It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that people who are suffering from conditions other than pneumoconiosis should be covered by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. I would remind the hon. the Minister that he does not specify this in the Bill at all. Clause 16 (2) of the Bill reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, on the recommendation of the Government Mining Engineer and the Director, declare any works to be a controlled works from a date determined by him, if he has reason to believe that the performance of work at or in connection with such works has caused or is likely to cause injury to the health of persons performing such work.</block>

<p>The Minister does not specify in the Bill that the injury should be a type of pneumoconiosis. He does not specify that there must be injury to the cardio-respiratory system only. He covers by this Bill a person who comes into contact with a substance which may cause, say, dermatitis. In terms of this Bill he also covers persons suffering from deafness or allergies. All these diseases will be covered. If that is the intention of the hon. the Minister with this Bill, then I am very much in favour of it. If it is not the intention of the Minister to include these diseases to which the mine worker is subjected, although other workers may also be subjected to them and also do work which may cause pneumoconiosis, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that it should be his intention. He should amend the Act so that he can do this. I should like to know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s feelings are on this matter. As far as I am concerned, I think it would be a good thing if we started to study this subject to see whether we cannot establish a department of industrial medicine. It is especially important that diseases which are due to occupational hazards should be included. If he could do that then, in due course, we can take away the control of pneumoconiosis <span class="col_893-894" refersTo="page_0459"/>from the Department of Mines and bring it within the ambit of industrial legislation, which I think will be a good thing and it would at least obviate a lot of the anomalies which are at present in existence. I pointed out some of these to the Minister last year, I think. I told him how a man working in a mine and one working on the roadside chopping stones could both get pneumoconiosis, with the difference that one is covered by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act and the other by the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act. If he had a department of industrial medicine, all these would be covered on an equal basis.</p>

<p>Now I want to say a word or two about the money which has been accumulating in the Fund because it has not been claimed, particularly as far as the Bantu is concerned. I know there are great difficulties in trying to trace the Bantu after he leaves the mine. Something has to be done about it, because this amount of money is growing over the years. I do not know what steps the Minister has taken, but he said last year that he would take steps to have as many of these people traced as quickly as possible, and that they would get their money. Is it not possible for a central bureau to be established where all Bantu labourers who leave the mines must register so that they can be informed in writing where they can claim their money? If that is done, and they can keep this little document, they are going to know where to go to get their money. I do not know what happens to-day to those labourers who come from Lesotho or Malawi. How are they traced? What happens to their money? Who pays them out? I wonder whether the Minister knows how much is outstanding in those accounts. I think it is something which the Minister ought to look into. He should see that this account is diminished as soon as possible and that the rightful owners of the money shall receive it. According to clause 17&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> require all persons, other than Bantu persons, who perform work at controlled mines, other than work in a dusty atmosphere, to present themselves at such places and at such intervals as may be specified in the notice, for the purpose of undergoing medical examinations.</block>

<p>I want to know why the Minister excludes the Bantu. Is there a special reason? The Minister did not mention this in his second-reading speech, but if he does not know, perhaps he could find out and let me know. I should very much like to know why the Bantu is excluded in clause 17. Let us take the question of the Bantu to-day working on the mine dumps. He exposes himself to a dusty atmosphere, but he may be a gardener. He may be employed by the department of gardening of the Transvaal Chamber of Mines and is thus, as with the messenger who goes up and down outside the mine property, especially on a winter&#x2019;s day on the Reef when the wind blows, always exposed to a dusty atmosphere. These people also should come under first examination. If it becomes necessary for them to receive a pension, they should get it, or a lump sum, whatever the Minister decides to do.</p>

<p>There are several other matters which we can discuss during the Committee Stage. I think it would be better to do it then. The Minister will then have an opportunity of replying immediately to the matters that are raised. As I have said, we are going to support the Bill, but we do not like the discriminations that have taken place and I do think especially that those people who are suffering from pneumoconiosis in the 20 to 50 per cent group should also receive the same 20 per cent increase as the others.</p>

<speech by="#rossouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is with particular pleasure that I congratulate the Minister of Mines on this legislation he wants to place on the Statute Book. It is also with pleasure that I find that there is to-day so much support on the part of the hon. member for Rosettenville.</p>

<p>When we came here in 1966 the Opposition were as silent as the grave, but suddenly in the year 1969, just before the House prorogued, they came to light as the champions of the mineworkers under all circumstances. Consequently it is also a pleasure for me today to hear from that hon. member that he wants certain ideas, good ideas, which he expressed here to be put into effect, if those changes could be made. I thank him for that.</p>

<p>On behalf of the mineworkers in my constituency, and probably on behalf of many other constituencies as well, I want to express my thanks to the Minister. This is a need which arose. Then I begin with those unfortunate persons who have been certified below 20 per cent at post-mortem. The widows of those persons received a single amount of R1,150. This is now being increased to R1,380. We express our thanks for that. What I should also like to see, and I would be neglecting my duty if I did not say that this is what I should also like to see in future, i.e. if the funds can be found to do so, is that a monthly pension be paid out to those widows.</p>

<p>There is the other case of a person who was certified at 20 per cent and above. Under the 1968 adjustment that person received no additional compensation apart from their pensions. I am grateful for the fact that file Minister has now seen his way clear to increasing the pensions of those persons as well. Hon. members will recall that with the 1968 adjustment they did not receive this. But then we must add that these are persons who, according to medical reports, are able to carry on normally with their work. The idea that all mineworkers who at the slightest sign of pneumoconiosis, should be certified and taken out of the mines, is perhaps a very good idea. But we ask ourselves whether this could be applied. We are particularly grateful for the concessions which have been made in the form <span class="col_895-896" refersTo="page_0460"/>of an increase in the pension allowance for widows and dependent children. In the past it was felt, when widows received R42 in the 1968 application, that this amount should be increased to R45. This would have been the same increase as that received by other widows. However, I am grateful that this pension is now being increased to R50 and that the allowance for every dependent child is being increased from R21 to R25. I want to say thank you very much to the hon. the Minister for that, for it is after all the widow who suffers when the breadwinner falls away. Care is in fact being taken here of her and her dependants now. Widows are the persons who suffer the most. They do not have such a hard time when the breadwinner is still working or when he is still able to supplement a portion of his income. I am also grateful for the fact that the old age pensions of these persons, or any other pension, will not influence the pension they are receiving as a result of this legislation in any way.</p>

<p>In particular I should like to address a word of thanks to the hon. the Minister and the Department for the wonderful new building which has been built for the mineworkers and which will shortly be opened by the hon. the Prime Minister. I pay frequent visits to the Bureau and the new building is a tremendous improvement on the existing one. I go among the mineworkers every day and I know that they are highly appreciative of the facilities offered to them in the new building. I am speaking in particular now of the persons who formerly had to climb up the numerous steps, but for whom there are now sufficient lifts available in the new building in order to convey them from one floor to the other.</p>

<p>In regard to pneumoconiosis I should today like to put one question and I am addressing it in particular to the medical practitioners. Can it be precisely established, or is it mere guesswork when a person is certified as having suffered from pneumoconiosis to an extent between 20 and 49 per cent. When is a pneumoconiosis sufferer certified below 20 per cent, and when is he certified above 50 per cent? I can understand that it would be easy to certify a person at 75 per cent and above, but this is one question which causes a great deal of concern. I do not want to sully this fine legislation and this wonderful gesture on the part of the State with a complaint, but in respect of this matter I should like to inform the hon. the Minister and the members of the medical profession who are sitting in this House to-day that we as laymen and particularly the mineworkers have doubts in regard to that system of certification.</p>

<p>We are also very grateful for the increases which have been granted. They alleviate hardships and help those persons who are struggling to keep their heads above water. I also want to say thank you for the alleviation which has been introduced in respect of burial costs. I trust that this will not be the end now of changes and amendments in this connection and that there will always be concessions. If concessions are made which make it easier for the mineworker or his dependants, I shall always be grateful. On behalf of my constituency I want to extend my sincere thanks to the hon. the Minister for these concessions. I have not yet heard what my voters have to say about this, but I have every hope that they will again, as in the past, trust this Government and return the National Party to this House. After all, the National Party is the party that, since 1922, has faithfully looked after the interests of the mineworker. This is also the party which did not only make promises when they suspected in 1969 that there was going to be an election. It is however the party which has always done everything it could, to the best of its ability, for the worker. We have every confidence that wherever mine-workers, through their votes, must prove the decisive factor in the coming election, they will prefer the National Party because they know where they stand with it. I do not think the mineworkers will buy a horse, or bet money on one they do not know, and which is in such a condition as the United Party is.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I refer in particular to the type of action the hon. the Minister is now going to undertake in terms of clause 16 of the Bill before us. He has always had the power and why is he suddenly taking up the substances, many of which have very little connection, if any, with mining. What type of medical examination is the hon. the Minister going to carry out? This applies particularly to the medical examinations which are carried out by his Bureau for Industries other than mining industries. What is overlooked completely in this regard is that the great value of the examinations carried out by the Bureau is the pre-employment examination. It gives the Bureau a permanent picture of the man&#x2019;s chest before he is employed at work in a dusty atmosphere. This examination allows the rejection of people whose chests are medically considered to be unsuitable for work in a dusty atmosphere. The main thing is that the man who becomes a miner is rated as having a normal chest which gives the Bureau a chance of seeing changes that take place. The whole key of the Bureau&#x2019;s examination rests on that first examination. They can defer a man and tell him to come back later or they can completely reject a man. In these other examinations and in the examinations which have been carried out for industries there was no pre-employment examination as a rule. It may be there exceptionally, but I doubt it. The absence of this examination vitiates largely the examinations at subsequent stages. Particularly in certain industries which have dusty atmospheres it is a very serious matter. I hope the hon. the Minister will follow the advice given by the hon. member for Rosettenville, namely to create, as it were, a thorough universal bureau for the examination of workers in dusty atmospheres. The hon. the Minister has taken the power to order the <span class="col_897-898" refersTo="page_0461"/>medical examination of workers who work with power. I can understand it when he orders the medical examination of workers who treat minerals, who do the crushing, cleaning and washing of minerals. The hon. the Minister can order the medical examination of workers who are concerned with the generating of any form of power and the transmission and distribution of the power. This is being done, but of what value is it compared with what should be done in other industries? The whole problem of these examinations should have been realized by the hon. the Minister if he had personally, apart from opening i.t, attended the conference which he called in Johannesburg last year. Most of this conference&#x2019;s attention was devoted actually to what happened to the person who came in contact with asbestos. Firstly, I want to thank the hon. the Minister for the invitation the extended to my colleague and myself. But what happened to the resolutions which the final meeting of that conference made? When are they likely to be published and how far have they advanced with the editing of the proceedings of this particular conference? One lesson the hon. the Minister would have learned had he attended the conference is that, if he was going to do a public duty &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>That is what he is trying to do here perhaps. I do not know. The hon. the Minister, especally in his capacity as Minister of Health, has a duty to the country, namely to make an investigation into the dangerous dusty minerals which have done so much harm, particularly asbestos. If he will do that, he will be doing a great service. I should also like to know why the hon. the Minister is taking on these works. It is true that they were thought of in the original Mining Act. Like my colleague, the hon. member for Rosettenville, I cannot see why the hon. the Minister separates the sheep from the lambs when it comes to the people who get 20 per cent or 10 per cent instead of getting the position uniform. It is quite true that if a man who suffers from pneumoconiosis is knocked down by a car, it would be difficult to say that pneumoconiosis contributed to his death. Nevertheless, a man&#x2019;s working capacity and his length of life in general are seriously concerned by the fact that he has dust in his lungs. With the introduction of the 1954 legislation on pneumoconiosis, the main complaint of the miners at that time was that there were among them men who were receiving quite high pensions, even up to 75 per cent, whilst they showed exactly the same symptoms as other men who were passed as normal by the bureau. That was the trouble at that stage. It was found that too much attention had been g&#x2019;ven to the X-rays and not enough to the clinical material available and the clinical examination. I mention this because one of the hon. members on that side of the House spoke earlier about the injustice of some men receiving higher pensions than others. It is because medicine is not infallible. One cannot always measure exactly the percentage of loss. It became necessary to introduce better tests at that time so as to try to sift the sufferers from the non-sufferers, the malingerers from the genuinely unhealthy people. I hope the hon. the Minister will continue to use these methods and be generous towards those whom the X-rays do not show suffering from this disease.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (Central) should in fact look for any deficiencies in the clinical identification of, say, 5 per cent pneumoconiosis sufferers among members of the medical profession. The medical Profession should be blamed for this, and not the Minister. I should like to associate myself with the hon. member for Stilfontein where he expressed appreciation of this legislation. This is something special for the workers in South Africa. I note that in this legislation there is no reference to the mine-workers of South-West Africa. I can give the hon. the Minister the assurance that the mine-workers in South-West Africa would very much like to participate in this wonderful legislation. They would also, like other workers in the Republic of South Africa, like to have the security which this pneumoconiosis legislation offers. Of course, it is only a National Party Government that could place such legislation on the Statute Book. I am aware of the fact that the Department of Mines keeps a vigilant eye on the health of our mineworkers in South-West Africa, but I should nevertheless like to know from the hon. the Minister, if South-West Africa does not fall under this legislation, what the reasons for that are.</p>

In this legislation there is not one single clause which <span class="col_899-900" refersTo="page_0462"/>testifies to discrimination. It is a fact that those persons who are certified between 20 and 50 per cent, are only receiving a 10 per cent increase, and that all other benefits are being increased by 20 per cent. Since I became the head of this Department I have consistently adopted the attitude that when an overall amount of money is available, as in this case, my point of departure should be a sympathetic one, i.e. that in the first place those who need it most should be looked after. I think that we should always accept it like this. I am glad that in this respect the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union understands my point of view, i.e. that when money is available it should in the first place and to a generous extent go to that man who is no longer earning what he earned before. Then it must go, to an even more generous extent, to the widow and the orphan. In the Bill it is specifically provided that that person who is certified between 50 and 75 per cent and above can no longer work in the mines. There are mineworkers above 75 per cent who are bedridden. My heart will always go out to them to give them that extra little bit, in the future as well. I think the widows and children of deceased mineworkers can accept it as axiomatic that as long as I am Minister in this Department I shall always do my best to give them in the first place, together with those who can no longer carry on their occupation as in the past, a little bit more of what is available than to those people who can still carry on their occupation to the full. That is the whole premise of this Bill. The fact of the matter is that on this side of the House there is more sympathy towards those who need it than the hon. member for Rosettenville implied in his speech. He has equal amounts of sympathy for all. He says so. I am prepared to say that there are people who are entitled to more sympathy and that we should show this in a tangible form by giving them an increased pension. The hon. member also referred, almost derogatorily, to the increase of R4.40 per month. But if it is considered that this specific person, who is certified between 20 and 50 per cent, is still in full employment and is earning his full daily wage and is now at one go receiving an additional R52.80 per year, this is not something to be scorned. This is over and above his earnings. That is why I want to make it very clear that I think this principle, or rather this method which we have adopted, i.e. of giving more to those who need it more than to those who are still in full employment, is entirely justified.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member also made the point that the widows of mineworkers who were found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis at post-mortem and certified at less than 20 per cent, should also get a pension on the same basis as those certified between 20 per cent and 50 per cent. But we must remember the history of this Act. We know that in the beginning there was no question of giving a pension to those who were found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis at post-mortem and certified at less than 20 per cent. Therefore we decided on one amount which is payable to the widows of these people. I should like to remind hon. members, and also mineworkers, that in establishing a less than 20 per cent pneumoconiosis at post-mortem, it could not have been done whilst the person was alive. It cannot be done on clinical examination. It can also not be done on X-ray examination. It is only done on microscopic examination and with the aid of other apparatus that we have at our disposal at the moment.</p>

<p>*In other words, Mr. Speaker, the certification of 20 per cent at post-mortem is a microscopic presence of some sign or other which could possibly have been caused by working in dusty mines, f think that we should never lose sight of this fact., I cannot possibly have any influence on the working ability of any person. It cannot possibly have had any influence on his way of life, his domestic life, or his work. That is precisely why this has been provided. In other words, during the lifetime of that person that wife and children never suffered in any respect as a result of the fact that he showed less than 20 per cent signs. In addition it cannot have been the cause of his death. In such a case this would have been established by other methods. I think we must see this matter very clearly.</p>

<p>The hon. member also put a question in regard to the Bantu. He must not concern himself about that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The Department of Bantu Administration and Development is administering the aspect of pensions for our Bantu people in a very satisfactory way. I had discussions as recently as during the latter half of last year with my colleague over here together with members of our two departments. We are quite satisfied that they are doing this in an admirable way. That is also applicable to Bantu from other territories, such as Lesotho and Malawi. The arrangements are satisfactory from our point of view as well as from that of those countries and it is seen to that they get the money that they are entitled to. I therefore do not intend to make any change in so far as this particular issue is concerned.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me about clause 17. He wanted to know why Bantu are excluded. The simple reasons is that Bantu, as the hon. member knows, are not examined at the medical bureau as in the case of white workers. They are, however, periodically and systematically examined clinically at six-monthly intervals in any case.</p>

<p>Does that apply to Bantu working on the surface as well?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It applies to every Bantu worker on a mine, whether he works underground, on the surface or whether he is a messenger. He is examined and properly examined every six months. It is therefore not necessary to make this compulsory legislation in so far as the Bantu are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="col_901-902" refersTo="page_0463"/>*In the space of a few minutes the hon. member for Stilfontein left this entire House at least with the impression that he is a person who has not only worked in a mine but who understands and comprehends the conditions of the mineworker in South Africa. I am glad we have people like him&#x2014;and there are others as well&#x2014;who are not only sympathetic towards the mineworker, but who are also experts in the field. They can advise us. In fact, file hon. member came to my Office only last week to put questions to me and to explain what the problems of our mineworkers were. Other members also do this. It is to me as Minister, as well as for the officials in my Department, a very great help that members, such as he <i>inter alia,</i> are of assistance to us in this regard. The hon. member referred to the pneumoconiosis bureau and the new building. The Prime Minister has kindly consented to open this new building officially on 19th March this year. I hope that on that occasion we will be able to show the representatives of our mineworkers and their wives what we have established there, not only for their health in the form of examinations, but also for their convenience. I hope that there will be many people present on that day.</p>

<p>In regard to the question the hon. member for Sttilfontein asked, i.e. whether we could establish precisely what the percentage was, whether it was 20, 49 or 50 per cent, I can only tell him that we are unable to establish this. Medical science, with all its wonderful aids, is not an exact science. This arrangement is a practical arrangement which up to now has worked reasonably well. Distinction must be drawn between the man who is no longer physically capable of working and the man who can still do the work. In other words, we cannot establish this precisely. Not only is use made in practice of radiological examinations or of medical examinations by means of other apparatus and breathing tests, but also of clinical examinations which play a tremendously important role. The clinical examination enables the panel of doctors and the other bodies which have been established, including the reviewing authorities, to establish with a reasonable amount of certainty and a reasonable amount of exactitude what the condition of the patient is, so that the Act can be properly implemented. I may just say that the apparatus at these new clinics is of the very best and Professor Oosthuizen, my medical advisor, has also been instructed to purchase any new and improved apparatus immediately it is available. In regard to the apparatus which is being used in the interests of the mineworker and the patient, the costs of that apparatus may play no part whatsoever. It may not be taken into consideration to the detriment of the mineworker. In regard to a further question from the hon. member for Stilfontein I may also say that it is the intention to review this entire Pneumoconiosis Act, it is hoped in 1971. This will also be done pursuant to the conference mentioned here by the hon. member for Durban (Central).</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then the hon. member for Durban (Central) raised a point in regard to clause 16. I think that the points that he has raised are very important; in fact those particular issues pertain to my portfolio as Minister of Health, and not as the Minister of Mines. As is stated in the clause, certain works can be classified and treated in a certain way on the recommendation of the Government Mining Engineer and the Director. In general we have here in mind those works which perform a function which causes dust. Therefore it pertains to the Pneumoconiosis Act and that is then the reason why it pertains to this particular Act. Perhaps it is a start in the direction of a department for industrial medicine. However, this pertains to work in dust.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Etosha raised the question of South West Africa. I may just say that South West Africa is not included under the Pneumoconiosis Act of 1962, and that is why it has not been included in this Bill either. But with this rearrangement it was indicated in the White Paper that it would be desirable to make this Act applicable to South West Africa as well. This could be done in two ways, firstly, by way of a regulation promulgated by the State President, or secondly, by way of a statutory amendment. From the legal advice I have obtained it appears very clearly that by way of regulation justice will not be done to this matter. It is intended, after the entire matter has been taken into consideration, to make this Act applicable to South West Africa as well by way of legislation during the 1971 session. I may just add that the Chief Government Mining Engineer and officials of my Department in South West Africa have already instituted an investigation in regard to the mining industries, and it was found that the incidence of pneumoconiosis there is extremely slight. It is therefore not an urgent matter at present. The problems which do exist there pertain to toxicosis caused by other materials. This matter is covered by another Act, i.e. the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. I hope that with this all the questions put here have been answered.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This measure makes provision for the amend-ment of section 8 (11) of the Act in order to <span class="col_903-904" refersTo="page_0464"/>allow a member of the Post Office Staff Board to be re-appointed in the Department by the State President even after having voluntarily resigned during his period of Office and not only at the expiration of his period of Office.</p>

<p>The Act, as it reads at present, provides that a Staff Board member who, at the expiration of his term of Office is not appointed as a board member, can be re-appointed as an official in the Department if he has not yet reached the age of 65 years. This makes provision for the possibility that, because of the particular competence, background and experience of a Post Office official appointed as a member of the Board, it may be in the interests of the Department for him to be taken up once more into its administration at the expiration of his term of Office, rather than that he be appointed to the Board for a further period.</p>

<p>The duration of a board member&#x2019;s term of Office is determined by the Act as a maximum of five years. However, if a member is appointed for a full five-year period it means, under the present provisions of the Act, that he cannot be re-appointed in the Department before that long period of time has expired. In the meantime there could be complications necessitating the immediate re-appointment of an official who was appointed as a board member. One of the important administrative posts in the Department could, for example, become vacant, a post which at that time cannot be filled as adequately from the ranks of the available officials as from those of the Staff Board. officials appointed as Staff Board members are inevitably the most senior, most competent and most experienced officials in the Department. Under such circumstances it must consequently be possible to appoint a Staff Board member to the post, even though his term of Office as board member has not yet expired at that stage. Such an appointment would, of course, take place on the basis that the Staff Board member concerned is prepared to accept the post and resign his Office as board member.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the amendment envisaged by this Bill introduces no new principle, but is intended to bring about flexibility in the existing regulations. I trust that both sides of the House will support it, and I therefore move.</p>

<p>Sir, I was answering the hon. member for Brakpan, who is about to depart from this House and I wish to give him a soldier&#x2019;s farewell. Sir, there is one serious point concerning this one-clause amending Bill which I think must be placed on record, and that is that the original measure which is being amended was passed in 1968; it was section 8 of Act 67 of 1968. In 1969, a year later, it was amended by section 2 of Act 59 of 1969, and now it is being amended again by clause 1 of A.B. 22 of 1970. In other words, this hon. Minister introduced a measure which after one year had a weakness in it. Within a year of introducing an amendment to that Bill, which required printing, which required the time of this House to pass it, which required the attention of the officials to draft it, which required the services of the legal advisers to put it into legal language, which required the parliamentary draftsman&#x2019;s attention and which required the translator&#x2019;s attention, the hon. the Minister comes back to amend this Bill again. Is this an indication of the efficiency of the hon. the Minister? He now seeks our support for the passing of this Bill and we give that support willingly because it will make our task easier, but, Sir, why did he not introduce the correct amendment last year? The hon. the Minister owes us an explanation. Why did he not correct this measure properly last year? Of course, the position is that the people being dealt with here are senior officials who are being appointed to what is the equivalent in the Post Office of the Public Service Commission, which deals with the appointment of staff and with the promotion of staff. They are therefore people with very high, powerful authority within the department. They, Sir, will create, by means of other promotions, the vacancies which they themselves can now fill after resigning, and I think we must have an assurance from the hon. the Minister that if a member of the board resigns his Office on the board, it shall not be because of a vacancy which the board itself has created. We accept unequivocally that if you have a suitable person available on the board, that person, if there is a vacancy for which he is qualified, should be entitled to fill that vacancy, but it must be filled on the basis of qualifications, and the ability to fill the post, and not simply because that person happens to have blue eyes or curly hair. We do not want members of this board to be appointed in the same way as dismissed Cabinet Ministers are appointed to the S.A.B.C. We want people appointed on merit, and if Cabinet Ministers or others are dismissed from other posts, we do not want them appointed to these posts.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for the purposes of current expenditure the Fuel Research Institute is financed, <i>inter alia,</i> by way of a levy not exceeding .4167 cent per ton of coal produced and sold. This maximum levy was already fixed more than 20 years ago. To the levy received from the coal industry in this way, the State contributes on a R for R basis out of funds annually voted for this purpose by Parliament.</p>

<p>The current expenditure of the Institute exceeded its revenue by more than R3,000 during the financial year of 1967 and by more than R53,000 during the 1968 financial year. During these two financial years the levy was fixed at .375 cent per ton, and the deficit made up out of a reserve fund which the Institute had built up over the years. These reserves are now depleted. The latest available data indicates that the deficit in 1969 will eventually amount to about R56,000 despite the fact that the maximum of .4167 cent per ton was levied after consultation with the coal industry. Expenditure on increased salaries, which came into operation on 1st April, 1969, was not brought into account with this deficit.</p>

<p>The increase in the expenditure of the Fuel Research Institute is attributed to factors completely beyond its control. The most important of these is the increase in the cost of laboratory equipment, repairs to and maintenance of buildings, and salary increases which had of necessity to be granted in order to keep pace with other comparable organizations and in an attempt to retain the services of the existing staff at least.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here that during the past number of years the Institute has been under pressure from the coal industry to enter new fields of research, but that in view of its financial position and manpower shortage the Institute was forced to follow a more conservative and selective policy.</p>

<p>Despite this policy, however, the Institute could not, as I have pointed out, succeed in balancing expenditure and revenue during the past year, and after consultation with and the consent of the coal industry, the Fuel Research Board felt itself compelled to make representations to the effect that the Act should be amended so that a maximum levy of 1 cent instead of .4167 cent per ton of coal could be levied.</p>

<p>What is being envisaged with the statutory amendment now before the House is, to give effect to this request. It will create some scope for the foreseeable future, and I should like to point out that it is intended that the annual levy should continue to be fixed after consultation with the coal industry, and within the prescribed maximum of 1 cent per ton of coal.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>We support this Bill, Sir. The Fuel Research Institute has for many years rendered very valuable service, not only to the coal industry but also to the country through its research in coal. It is understandable that, like everywhere else, their costs have increased. Not only have their costs increased but the scope of the work which they have had to undertake has also grown larger. The problem of coking coal, for instance, is one which requires constant attention. The Fuel Research Institute is a subsidized body; I think the hon. the Minister said that the Government subsidized the Institute on the rand for rand basis, and the coal industry has been contributing on the basis of .4 cents odd per ton. I think it is very reasonable now, having regard to the importance of the coal industry, that the Fuel Research Institute should be properly financed. The suggestion contained in this Bill is that the contribution of the industry of .4 something cents per ton should be increased to a maximum of 1 cent. I understand that that is done in collaboration and agreement with the coal industry, which shows that the coal industry values the services of the Institute, and this justifies our agreeing to this proposal and we therefore support the Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we do not intend prolonging the discussion on this motion, but we are not impressed with the reasons which the Deputy Minister has given for introducing it. I think he would have expected us to oppose the motion, firstly because of the strong condemnation we expressed at the introduction of the legislation last year and, secondly, because we say that circumstances have changed since last year, and, thirdly, because it is not desirable to push a measure of this nature which is so vital through Parliament in this short session immediately before an election, more especially as the Bill will be repealed by the next Parliament. Very shortly, we are opposed to the far-reaching dictatorial powers which are given to this Minister. He can control the economic future of South Africa and that in fact means the well-being of the whole country. By a simple notice in the <i>Gazette</i> he can, without consulting anyone, prohibit the employment of Bantu in any specified area which he may choose, in any specified class of employment he may choose, in any specified trade or in the service of a specified employer or class of employers, and that means any employer; it may even be the Koornhof Construction Company, which may be told that it can no longer employ a Bantu. Although some of the Minister&#x2019;s predecessors may have wanted a power of this nature to force their policy on an unresponsive public, they realized that there were limits to which they could go.</p>

<p>We will, Sir. This measure can affect the lives not only of the majority of the Bantu but in fact of all groups in South Africa. The result will be general uncertainty in regard to the security and rights of the employer as well as those of the employee. What is more, this Bill threatens the security of the residential rights given to Bantu in terms of section 10 of the Bantu Administration Act. I know the Minister spent some time in the second-reading debate dealing with this point, and he said that if they wanted to take away those rights they would do so directly instead of in an indirect manner, but he did say that those rights given in section 10 are an obstacle to the implementation of the policy of the Government. One of the previous Deputy Ministers indicated in a speech made at Stellenbosch that the Government would like to do away with those rights, but he said you could imagine the fuss that would be made by the United Party if they did that. Of course that is not the true reason why they do not abolish these rights. They do not abolish these rights because Dr. Verwoerd was the man who granted these rights in 1952. So they avoid abolishing those rights directly, but are trying to do so by an indirect method in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>We object mainly to clause 11. I have stressed the importance of the effect it can have on the whole of the economic life of South Africa, but other clauses also contain principles totally unacceptable to us, as we stressed in the second-reading debate last year. Secondly, I think circumstances have changed to the extent that the manpower shortage has become more acute since Parliament met last year, and it is unwise to let one man, the Minister, control and exclude our valuable economic asset, namely a ready supply of manpower. It is also inadvisable because it will foster resentment amongst the Bantu and frustration and uncertainty among entrepreneurs and employers. It is unwise also because it will bring further condemnation from abroad at a time when our stocks are not standing high, and it will be an embarrassment to our friends overseas who try in every way to assist us where they can.</p>

<p>After this sports debacle, is it necessary to tell the hon. member that our stocks are not standing high in the international world? Of course they are not standing high. Surely there is no need for the Minister to rush the Bill through at this stage. The Minister said in his second-reading speech that clause 11 was under discussion as long ago as 1963, but nothing was done, and it cannot be so urgent now that it must be forced through. After all, it could have been <span class="col_909-910" refersTo="page_0467"/>passed last session, but it was left right to the end and was produced in the last week; in the last dying days of the session this Bill was introduced. If it was so urgent, if it is a matter of such vital importance, why was it not introduced earlier during the session and passed last year?</p>

<p>The thon. the Minister more or less admitted the far-reaching scope of this Bill, but he pledged himself to administer it sympathetically. He said &#x201C;a statute must stand on the Statute Book in the form of words, but it is the way in which it is applied that is important&#x201D;, and that is just what we fear. We are not prepared to give this Minister or his deputy the powers sought in this Bill, because we fear the way in which it will be administered. The Minister also said that the sole purpose of clause 11 was to put a stop to the work which was in the hands of the Whites passing into the hands of the Bantu, but he does not have to pass this Bill to do that if that is the only urgent feature of the Bill. He has the job reservation provisions. Why does he not proceed in the way the Government thought fit to stop work done by white men passing into the hands of black men? Why do they not proceed under the Minister of Labour? Why do they not let the Industrial Tribunal do it? I will tell you why they will not, Sir. It is because under that Act there must be consultation before a recommendation is made to the Minister. The Minister of Labour is sitting here. I wonder whether he will not get up and tell us why he cannot stop the work going into the hands of the black man from the hands of the white man. Why is it necessary to have two Ministers in charge? How will the industrialists, the financiers and the entrepreneurs or the Bantu, oi anybody, know where they stand when they have two Ministers who can control the employment of Bantu? And then we still have the Minister of Planning who can intervene as well.</p>

<p>I say it will lead to general confusion in the country, and this is not a fair answer to the problem. We do not need this measure in order to carry out the intention of the Deputy Minister. He said that this legislation is simply another brick in that building which we want to leave to posterity in order to ensure in white South Africa that we retain control. But we do not need this measure to ensure white control. The Minister himself has admitted that as far as the employment of black labour in the white areas is concerned, numbers are not decisive in the future of South Africa or for the control of the white man. Then why must he take power now to control the numbers if numbers are not decisive? And they admit that we will always have black labour integrated in our economy in the white area, so they do not need a measure of this nature to maintain white control. If they cannot maintain white control without such a totalitarian measure as this one, the sooner they hand over the better. We know it is said that those whom the Gods wish to destroy they first make mad. Sir, the Gods have some design on the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei said: &#x201C;We do not need this measure to ensure white control.&#x201D; I think he wanted to say, but was afraid to do so, &#x201C;That we do not want any measures aimed at ensuring white control.&#x201D; That would indeed have reflected the drift of his party&#x2019;s approach more correctly.</p>

<p>Before going further I should just like to thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for this explanatory memorandum which he made available to all the members of this House before the time and which gives a very clear exposition of what is envisaged in this Bill. The Opposition is opposing this motion, and it was to be expected that they would do so, although there are no objections in terms of the Standing Orders, or no technical objections. On the contrary, the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s motion is altogether in agreement with section 71 (1) of the Standing Orders, which deals with such matters. This boils down to the fact that the House should continue with a Bill, the Second Reading stage of which has already been dealt with. At that stage, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, there was about 10 hours of detailed and exhaustive debate about the principles contained in this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did not have an opportunity to speak about it, and I am not speaking about the Bill now, but about the motion before the House, and that is that the Committee Stage should be continued with. That Second Reading was approved here; the whole principle of the Bill was accepted here. We may therefore ask why the Opposition is now opposing the Committee Stage, because the Committee Stage is no longer concerned with the principle; it is simply concerned with the clauses severally. Everything the hon. member for Transkei said here about one or two clauses he could indeed have dealt with effectively in the Committee Stage. But this specifically is just one of the things characteristic of this Opposition. They repeat themselves in every debate in this House with monotonous regularity, and the hon. member for Transkei and other hon. members opposite are going to be singing the same tune they are singing now when they get to those sections in the Committee Stage, merely for repetition, because they have already talked themselves out. <span class="col_911-912" refersTo="page_0468"/>This is the actual reason why they are against this motion, because they have nothing more to say about the whole principle of separate development; because it is not this Act they do not want to see implemented; it is the whole idea of separate development, the principle of separate development, which they want to delay. They want to put a spoke in the wheel of legislative and policy implementation.</p>

<p>But let us look for a moment at what it is they are trying to oppose. It is concerned with important aspects of housing which are urgently necessary.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>As it pleases you, Sir. I am merely trying to indicate what the effect of their resistance is, but I leave the matter there. I think that another reason is that there will be a wasting of time if this motion does not go through, a wasting of the Government&#x2019;s time, the country&#x2019;s money and also the time of this House. If this Bill is not passed now, an additional 10 hours will have to be used for a Second Reading debate after this House of Assembly meets again after the election. Sir, it will in any case be the same Government assembling here after 22nd April. It will then mean that 10 hours of this House&#x2019;s time, of its money and of the taxpayer&#x2019;s money will be wasted. For me this is one of the most important considerations why this motion should be accepted.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei alleged that circumstances had changed since the introduction of the Bill during the previous Session. He did not succeed in indicating any changed circumstances. He said that when they came into power they would not continue with this Bill. We are glad they adopted that standpoint. We shall go and tell the voters what this means, if this Bill must once more be submitted <i>de novo,</i> it will mean that the entire discussion will have to be repeated.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. members of the Herstigte Party that we shall see whether they vote for or against this motion, because they walk out when voting takes place, do they not? We shall see whether they are going to vote with their allies and protectors, because a few months ago they voted for the principle of this Bill. They will have to indicate whether they have now gone so far as to be against the implementation of this legislation, and are going to vote with the Opposition against its continuation. Sir, there is no reason why this measure should not be continued with, and I therefore support the motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Waterkloof actually used the argument that if the House rejects this motion proposed by the Deputy Minister, it will mean that an additional ten hours in debating time will be wasted. He said that these ten hours would cost the country and the taxpayer money. Sir, I can only tell the hon. member that if anybody has been sitting in this House, adding up the time wasted by the internecine warfare, between his own party and the Herstigte Party, which he started again tonight, they would be much more concerned about that waste of the country&#x2019;s time and the taxpayer&#x2019;s money than about an additional ten hours debate which might be very advantageously spent for South Africa in once again asking this House to reconsider a thoroughly undesirable Bill. South Africa stands to lose a great deal if in fact the Government does not have second thoughts about this Bill. It is perhaps significant that it never occurs to the hon. member for Waterkloof or to any other member of the Government side that there are any arguments which could be advanced from this side of the House, which might make them change their minds about legislation they have introduced. In other words, Sir, the Ministers come to this House with their minds made up. Most Nationalist members come to this House and vote without knowing what they are voting about. I want to say that I can think of no better advantage to this House and to South Africa than if we did waste an additional ten hours in rediscussing the basic principles of the Bill.</p>

<p>I would imagine that the constitutional brains that drew up the rules of this House and framed Standing Order No. 71, must have had certain things in mind when they decided that a measure which had proceeded up to a certain point in one session, should, by motion of the House, be allowed to be continued with from there at a subsequent session. I can only imagine that there were two main reasons why the framers of the rules thought up Standing Order No. 71. The first is that the measure concerned was an especially desirable measure which would benefit the country and the second was that it was an especially urgent matter which had to be rushed through the House. Looking at this Bill, which the hon. the Deputy Minister proposes that we proceed with, we find that neither is it especially desirable nor especially urgent. Indeed a positive case can be made out for delaying the passage of this Bill. In every major respect this Bill is a disadvantage to South Africa. The hon. member for Transkei has mentioned that it gives the Minister exceptional powers. It certainly does. It gives him the power to control something like 75 per cent of the labour force of South Africa. It gives him power over and above the powers enjoyed by the Minister of Labour, and it gives him powers greater than the powers enjoyed by the Minister of Planning.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister should be worrying about the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, because the powers the Deputy Minister is taking supersede his own powers. He should be watching very carefully because the hon. the Deputy Minister is now infringing on the powers of the Minister of Planning. He certainly has much wider powers than that Minister took for himself under the Physical Resources and Planning Act. The powers he is taking are, of course, also much wider than the powers enjoyed by the Minister of Labour in terms of section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Transkei mentioned, we have ministerial assurances that, despite the wide nature of the powers being taken, the intentions are good and that these powers will not be used in their widest sense. I have sat in this House for a number of years now, and I have observed the way in which ministerial good intentions get lost over the years. Sooner or later power breeds a desire for more power and Ministers start using the power that they have taken unto themselves.</p>

<p>This Bill interferes with local authorities. It whittles away the already attenuated rights of the small privileged group of urban Africans. It creates the most complicated machinery to replace a system which has been working reasonably well, in terms of Nationalist policy anyway, as far as the rights of migratory workers to return to jobs within a year, are concerned. The most complicated machinery is created. The Bill, if implemented immediately, will create the greatest difficulties for labourers wishing to return to former employers, and for employers who wish to take on this labour. This is the old, familiar pattern of Nationalist legislation, introducing new systems without ensuring that the administrative machinery has been adequately created, and can function properly. At the same time, it blithely destroys existing rights. I say that this Bill conflicts hopelessly with the realities of South Africa of the 70s. It is not a Bill that is designed to meet the needs of industry in the 70s, the needs of a modern, industrial economy. It is a Bill, Sir, which harps nostalgically back to the days of the Stallard Commission 50 years ago, when the pattern of industrial development in South Africa was merely beginning. For all these reasons, I think that this Bill is not desirable, because I believe it is not urgent, because I believe it is a fantasy, based on false premises, and because I believe that it will bring in its wake disruption, misery and dismay. I think that the House should take advantage of this opportunity of having second thoughts about it. I shall certainly object to the motion proposed by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are busy here with very important legislation, the Second Reading of which was dealt with last year. Now we are engaged in a discussion which causes me to think that the demonstrators have now come on to the field. They just want to impede the normal and proper course of events without having very clear reasons for doing so. I do not want to label the hon. member for Houghton a demonstrator. She is actually a political &#x201C;can-can dancer&#x201D;, a high-kicker who just always protests, but members of the official Opposition definitely acted the role of demonstrators. Everyone indicated that during the Second Reading a great deal of attention was given to the Bill. To say now that there is no vital necessity for continuing with it is beyond my understanding, because the people do not understand the basic policy approved of over many years by the electorate of this country. They made a great fuss about the increase in the Bantu population of our urban areas, and where we have important legislation here to counteract those numbers they want to put a spoke in the wheel.</p>

<p>That is not relevant now. I did not speak then, but I am speaking now. Those hon. members are now becoming emotional and hysterical, but this was already happening last year as well. Before the discussion of the Bill last year the &#x201C;Commercial Opinion&#x201D; of March 1969 spoke of &#x201C;frightful power&#x201D;. That is the kind of approach we get. They do not go through this legislation step by step and see what is envisaged. There are 16 clauses in this Bill, but the hon. member for Houghton and the official Opposition refer only to clause 11. All the other clauses which are also in the interest of the Bantu, as far as his housing, the regulation of his work, etc., are concerned, receive no attention. Nothing is said about profits that can be transferred and about all the other aspects of the Bill that are in the Bantu&#x2019;s interests. They think only of clause 11 and of the &#x201C;frightful powers&#x201D; the Minister is now going to obtain. That is why I say that the demonstrators have come onto the field. I feel that if they cannot make use of better arguments they must stop wasting time; they must come to light with constructive proposals. At the Committee Stage they can argue about each of these clauses on its merits and <span class="col_915-916" refersTo="page_0470"/>suggest something, but simply to say now &#x201C;We are against the Bill because there is one clause we do not like&#x201D;, is a poor case. In an article I read I saw that in 1960 there were about 30,000 Bantu men of working age and 432,000 Bantu women in the white cities who were not employed. These are the kinds of problems the Government wants to solve in the interest of White South Africa and in order further to counteract integration in the labour market. They indicate that the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Planning do, in fact, have legislation to do this, but that is legislation covering only certain aspects of this problem. Now the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development wants to take action to carry this mandate through consistently in the interests of both White and non-White South Africa, particularly the Bantu. I want to content myself with that, because I do not want to waste time unnecessarily. I want to ask the Opposition please to relinquish the role of demonstrator and to act constructively.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Nelspruit has referred to us on this side of the House as a bunch of demonstrators. I just wish that the demonstrators overseas could be as responsible as those of us on this side of the House have been with regard not only to this legislation but also to other legislation introduced by this irresponsible Government. We are here as the watchdogs of the public of South Africa and that is the job we are doing. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, that noise does not worry me in the least. If we are regarded as demonstrators in the eyes of those hon. members when we carry out this duty as the watchdogs of the public, we shall continue to be the demonstrators in this Parliament. The hon. member says that all we are worried about is clause 11. I do not want to go into the whys and wherefores of clause 11. He has quite rightly said that we will have the opportunity to do this in the Committee Stage whether it comes in this Session or the next Session. I doubt whether it will come in the next Session. I wish the hon. member for Nelspruit and the hon. member for Waterkloof had really paid attention when the hon. member for Transkei put his case to the House. He made a very strong case. He produced evidence of other facts which must be taken into consideration. The hon. member for Houghton made the same case. Surely, those hon. members should have listened and paid attention before they got up and spoke as they did? Let me say that perhaps the most damning evidence against the acceptance of this motion is the figures quoted by the hon. member for Nelspruit. I do not know where he got his figures from; we have been unable to elicit any figures from the hon. the Minister. He tells us that 30,000 Bantu males and 420,000 Bantu females were unemployed in the urban areas of South Africa. I do not know where he gets these figures from but is this not the most damning evidence which should make us reconsider this whole matter in the light of this fantastic number of unemployed Bantu in the white urban areas? We have at the moment in South Africa the situation where an artificial shortage of Bantu labour is being created deliberately by this Government by means of legislation which is in force to-day. Now the hon. the Minister, in terms of this legislation which we are being asked to give a free passage, is to take further powers to further aggravate this artificial shortage of Bantu labour. I think this is the strongest evidence and evidence which this House should consider to-night for the rejection of the motion of the hon. the Deputy Minister that we should allow this Bill to go &#x201D;head from the stage which it had reached during the last session. If the hon. member for Nelspruit is correct when he says that there are more than 450,000 unemployed Bantu in the While areas, and they must obviously be there with some authority, and this hon. Minister asks for powers to create even more unemployment, surely we have here the strongest point in favour of the rejection of the motion by the hon. the Deputy Minister. The House is being asked to-night to allow the proceedings on the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill to be resumed from the stage which was reached during the preceding session. There is provision in the rules of this House for the House to adopt such a motion.</p>

I would say that under normal circumstances this is a very wise provision because it would be a waste of valuable time to re-argue all the matters which had been debated previously. In this case we find that the Second Reading has been completed and that the principle of the Bill has been accepted by a majority vote of this House.

<p>I hope that some hon. member on that side, or perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister, will tell us why this unseemly haste to place this Draconian measure on the Statute Book of South Africa. I wonder if it is not perhaps merely a further manifestation of the megalomaniac tendencies cf this Government, particularly of this hon. Minister and his two Deputy Ministers, to whom we affectionately refer as the &#x201C;three blind mice&#x201D;. I wonder if this is not the reason for this unseemly haste to place this Bill on the Statute Book, that this hon. Minister is determined, even if it is only for three months before they lose power on the 22nd April, to have this power to control the lives of the non-White population of this country. Are they rushing this legislation through because they are afraid of the outcome of this election? Arc they afraid that they are going to lose their right wing votes? Is this legislation a stop to the ideological verkramptes in their party in an attempt to win a few votes? I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to take serious cognizance of what I am going to say. Is this hon. Deputy Minister prepared to risk upsetting the whole economy of South Africa in order to win a few votes from the verkrampte right wing of his party? Is this Minister prepared to risk even the internal peace of South Africa&#x2014;and how, Sir!&#x2014;just before an election to win a few votes? I have warned this hon. Minister and his deputies before that they touch the section 10 rights of every Bantu at their peril. The Bantu are extremely jealous of these rights. These are the only remaining rights of the urban Bantu under this Government. This Bill is merely a subterfuge to infringe those rights. It is especially dangerous in the light of development since the last session of Parliament when the Second Reading of this Bill was adopted and the principle was accepted by a majority vote, because of the development of nationalism among the Bantu. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development would pay attention, because these words are particularly directed to him in all good faith and in the hope that we might be able to do something for the good of South Africa. The development of nationalism among the Bantu people in this country has manifested itself more and more since the close of the last session.

It is produced with an urgency and must now be passed in this pre-election session, when matters of extreme national importance only, I would submit, and matters which are necessary for the continued effective running of the country only, should be presented.</p>

<p>I am wondering, and once again I am thinking aloud, why there is this urgency and I wonder if the reason is not perhaps that there is a power struggle within the Cabinet. This Bill cuts right across the job reservation regulations. It also cuts across the Industrial Conciliation Act, once again affecting the hon. the Minister of Labour. It also cuts across the Physical Planning and Utilization of Natural Resources Act, affecting the hon. the Minister of Planning.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since 1966 the hon. member who has just resumed his seat has habitually been making a fool of himself in this House. To-night he most certainly presented himself as a champion among fools. It is also to be regretted that the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks in respect of a senior Minister of the Government and his two deputies reached such a pedestrian level. It is clear that the months the hon. member spent on the railway lines, jumping between the two in order to ensure that he kept his one ear on the railway line, also affected him in other places. I leave the matter there, but the hon. member laid such emphasis on the changed circumstances since the prorogation of this House last year that it puts one in mind of the changed circumstances he has experienced in his constituency.</p>

<p>There is only one cardinal matter on which the entire argument of the Opposition centres. And that is the difference between the policy of the United Party and that of the National Party. The hon. Opposition is opposing the proposal for the continuation of the discussion <span class="col_921-922" refersTo="page_0473"/>of this Bill, because their point of departure is an economic one. Their point of departure concerns what there is in the pockets of those rich friends of theirs. Their point of departure is not concerned with the position of the white inhabitants of South Africa and with the progress of its non-white inhabitants. That is the basic difference. Our policy is based on the protection of white civilization and on the development of the non-white peoples. The United Party sees this matter from an economic point of view and for that reason they hammer in their arguments on the disruption to the economy should the discussion of this measure be continued. All their arguments are centred on that. My standpoint in this matter is that specifically because of this basic difference in policy it is so vitally necessary for this legislation to be continued with and for this measure to be placed on the Statute Book. The Opposition are simply concentrating on clause 11 and it is very clear that they are too afraid to continue this discussion because they know what happened to them precisely as a result of their basic political view, which rests on economic considerations. In 1938 30 per cent of the South Africans voted for the National Party. In 1966 58 per cent were already voting for the National Party, and then the hon. members opposite still speak of "watchdogs&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! This is irrelevant.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>I should just like to qualify the reason for my reference to this. The previous hon. member said that the United Party members were the &#x201C;watchdogs&#x201D; of South Africa. With respect to the Chair I want to say that South Africa has been rejecting that party as &#x201C;watchdogs&#x201D; for the last 25 years. That is the fear of hon. members opposite. However, I find the whole matter a very simple one. The entire wording of section 71 points to the intention that if a Bill has progressed as far as this Bill during the last Session, that Bill can be continued with. If that were not the case this section would surely have read differently. I am supported in this connection by a comment of an hon. Speaker in this House on the 8th February, 1950 (Hansard, column 949), where he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The object and intention of the Standing Order was clearly to prevent a repetition of debates and proceedings in regard to a matter which has already been dealt with up to a certain stage and in this way to save the time of the House. There is no possibility of any other reason for this Order.</block>

<p>Chiefly for this reason, and without going into all the other aspects which the previous speakers dealt with and which one would very much like to comment upon, something I am deliberately not doing, I gladly support the request of the hon. the Deputy Minister for the continuation of the Committee Stage of this legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>The matter is being discussed very broadly now and I want to appeal to hon. members to curtail their discussions so that a decision may be arrived at.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to deal with the motion before the House and I can assure you that I intend to speak within the framework of that motion. The whole purpose of our objection to this motion is that we seek the opportunity to discuss again the principles of this Bill. Therefore there is no point in our to-night trying to discuss the principles of the Bill. We are asking, by opposing this motion, for a further opportunity to discuss those principles. The hon. the Deputy Minister gave seven reasons why the motion should be accepted. I submit that unlike the &#x201C;vier dwergies&#x201D; of the Prime Minister, these were seven dwarf reasons why we should pass this motion. The first of his reasons was that this Bill had been throughly discussed during the last session of this Parliament. His words were &#x201C;deeglik bespreek&#x201D;. But I made a particular point, by way of interjection, asking hon. members who spoke on this motion whether they had an opportunity to speak during the Second Reading debate on this Bill. I have since checked in Hansard and not one of those hon. members had an opportunity to speak during the Second Reading debate on this Bill. When I asked the hon. member for Water-kloof directly, namely &#x201C;Het jy gepraat&#x201D; he replied &#x201C;Ek het nie kans gehad om te praat nie&#x201D;. Those were his words. It is not that he did not want to speak, it is not that he had nothing to say&#x2014;&#x201C;Ek het nie kans gehad nie&#x201D;, were his words.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with respect, the hon. the Deputy Minister said the first reason why this motion should be passed was that the House has had ample opportunity. However, I am quoting an hon. member who states that he did not have an opportunity to speak.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The second reason which I want to give is that since this measure was introduced last year there has been a vital change in the background against which we should review legislation of this nature. That vital change has not been mentioned in this debate. That background wat that at the time we considered this measure last year the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2014;it is here recorded in Hansard&#x2014;had before him a picture of population figures and population movements against which, he believed, this measure was necessary and could be implemented. Since that time that background has changed to such an extent that none of the arguments used in June last <span class="col_923-924" refersTo="page_0474"/>year, can be applied to-day without review, because when we are dealing with 28 million people and 40 million people, the mechanics of handling the difference between 28 and 40 million &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This measure was designed to meet a set of circumstances and a certain situation. We submit that since those circumstances have changed, we in this House should have the opportunity to discuss it again. The third reason against passing this motion is the atmosphere in which this measure was debated last year. We started the debate on the 18th June. On that day the hon. the Minister introduced the measure and we discussed it until the conclusion of the debate on the 18th June. The debate was then broken. We came back to it after having dealt with other urgent matters. We started to discuss it again at column 8628 of Hansard. We then broke off again and dealt with other matters. We came back to it only on the 20th June at column 8667 of Hansard. In other words this measure was debated last year in an atmosphere of broken debate. There was no opportunity for this House to give proper continuity to its consideration because we were debating it in an atmosphere in which there was a deadline for this House to rise. A deadline had been set; certain legislation had to be passed. Against that deadline this measure had to be fitted in. It was not debated in the spirit in which a fundamental Bill is debated. It was slipped in in bits and pieces as other legislation created gaps in the programme. Any hon. member on that side of the House will know that there was no opportunity for this House to deal with this measure with the serious consideration which it deserves. We feel that when South Africa is being asked to pass a measure of this nature it should be given the opportunity to give proper deep and unbroken consideration to its principles.</p>

<p>I want to give a further reason why this motion should not be passed to-night. From approximately the end of this month until the 22nd April the Government will be engaged as the Opposition will be&#x2014;but I speak of the Government because it is their responsibility &#x2014;in fighting an election. That will mean that until approximately the end of April no thought or consideration can be given to the implementation of this measure. I have seen the programme of meetings that the hon. the Minister and his Deputy will hold. They will not have time to give consideration to the implementation and the regulations required under this measure. They will then have 21/2 months from approximately the end of April until the 17th July. They will have <i>21/2</i> months, if they should by accident and by tragedy win the election, in which to implement this measure. I do not want to repeat the arguments which were made earlier, that we in fact will repeal this measure, because that is what will happen. However, if it should happen that the Government returns, we submit that it could not in fact apply or create any effect out of this Bill. My sixth reason why we should not pass this motion &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>What were the other five reasons?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member was rot listening, I am not going to repeat them. My sixth reason is that if we accept this motion, we are accepting a measure which transfers from seven Ministers of State powers which are spread amongst them into the hands of one Minister. The seven Ministers are the Ministers of Bantu Administration, of Planning, of Labour, of Water Affairs, of Economic Affairs, of Transport and of Finance. At the moment, in order to implement what this measure is aimed at, those seven Ministers must work together; their departments must co-operate through a committee and there must be consultation between them. Now we are being asked to transfer from those seven Ministers an overriding power to the hon. the Deputy Minister who is before us here.</p>

<p>Finally I should like to say that this measure which we are being asked to deal with here is a measure which can do South Africa infinite harm in the atmosphere in which we live today. Of all times when the hostile eyes of the outside world are on us, this is not the occasion io introduce legislation which rightly or wrongly will be interpreted by the hostile Press of the world as dictatorial, as totalitarian and as oppressive. Whether that be right or wrong I am not entitled to debate. I do not want to. I say that at this time with the hostility against South Africa, this is not the time to hand a weapon to our enemies. With an election ahead of us, after that election when we can become the government, we can deal with measures of this sort. I promise hon. members that there will then be no need for this measure. I oppose the motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by referring to <span class="col_925-926" refersTo="page_0475"/>the hon. member for Durban (Point) who has just said, <i>inter alia,</i> that the atmosphere in which this Bill was discussed towards the end of the session last year was supposedly not the right one. He said: &#x201C;By bits and pieces this Bill was slipped in between us&#x201D;. However, I have the Hansard report of last year&#x2019;s debate here with me. I just want to point out to him that the Second Reading of this Bill was taken on Wednesday, 18th June. That evening a long discussion was conducted about it in this House. It was then continued immediately the following day, Thursday, 19th June.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What happened in the interim?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>On Friday, 20th June I replied in this House to the assertions made by hon. members on that side of the House. The assertion which he made here that this Bill was passed in bits and pieces is therefore completely incorrect. This is how many Bills are piloted through this House.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I really take amiss of him. Perhaps it was because the hon. member was not prepared. During the Second Reading last year the gist of my reply was that the United Party was conjuring up spectres in connection with this Bill. I think I mentioned 71 spectres which they conjured up in this way. In the meantime a few months have gone by. What strikes me, is how one speaker after another on the United Party side got up here again to-night and had the most glaring and blatantly ignorant things to say about this Bill. I do not want to go into details now. You would not permit me to do so, Sir. I promise to cover this field thoroughly during the Committee Stage. Hon. members want to create the impression that this is a complicated Bill, despite the fact that a comprehensive White Paper has already been laid upon the Table months ago. I myself took the trouble to table another White Paper, in case they had thrown away the original one, as so often happens. Despite that, and because they are unprepared, the hon. member for Durban (Point) spoke very verbosely of &#x201C;dictatorial powers&#x201D;. In addition, he still had the audacity to tell the Chair that he did not know whether he might use those words. But he nevertheless used them. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) spoke of a wicked Bill and said, &#x201C;this is going to do South Africa&#x2019;s name overseas irreparable damage&#x201D;. This is the type of thing that was said. I want to point out that when this Bill is being discussed in the Committee Stage, hon. members will find out how completely mistaken they are. Although the following charge was levelled against us, i.e. that this Bill &#x201C;will damage South Africa&#x2019;s good name overseas&#x201D;, the true position is that they are the people who are damaging and prejudicing South Africa&#x2019;s good name overseas, because they conjure up spectres without truly realizing what is going on.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I take the strongest exception, Mr. Speaker, to what the hon. member for Durban (Point) said about dictatorial powers. The same goes for the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). The words which he used, will definitely damage South Africa&#x2019;s name overseas. Every speaker on the opposite side of the House put forward, <i>inter alia,</i> as reason why the Bill should not be proceeded with the fact that it was being done before the election. Surely a more nonsensical reason does not exist. They themselves discussed this Bill for 10 hours during the Second Reading. I want to point out that the maximum duration of time for a Second Reading debate is 12 hours. Last year when there was no talk of any election they discussed the Bill for 10 hours. The Second Reading was also agreed to. Now hon. members on that side get up and advance as argument the fact that we are coming forward with this Bill right before the election. Surely that is completely untrue and nonsensical.</p>

<p>Then hon. members allege further that &#x201C;changed circumstances&#x201D; have supposedly arisen. I listened very closely to what those &#x201C;changed circumstances&#x201D; supposedly were. I was very surprised, because I did not know what those &#x201C;changed circumstances&#x201D; could be. I found out what they were, however, when the hon. member for Durban (Point) spoke. He was the only person who tried to show what &#x201C;changed circumstances&#x201D; had arisen between last year and the present. It was the so-called numbers aspect, which is also devoid of any truth. At that time it was already being mentioned in certain circles that there would be 40 million and not 28 million Bantu by the year 2000. Consequently that argument does not hold water either. If they want to advance the argument of &#x201C;changed circumstances&#x201D; in regard to this Bill, I shall tell you what the &#x201C;changed circumstances&#x201D; really are. The &#x201C;changed circumstances&#x201D; are the fact that the United Party has landed itself in a terrible predicament with this Bill. The predicament they have landed themselves in is the fact that they are really facing an election now, and that, with a view to the election, they do not know how to handle this Bill, or what defence to put up. There are &#x201C;changed circumstances&#x201D; which have arisen. I noticed how hard they were trying this evening to turn this very important matter into a light-hearted debate.</p>

It is something which cannot simply be left at that. [Laughter.] But of course. It is according to a resolution adopted by the Cabinet that this Bill is being passed.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As a result of certain criticism of our apprenticeship system, I requested the National Apprenticeship Board as far back as 1967 to give its attention once again to this important system of training and to submit recommendations in regard to any improvements to be effected. The Board&#x2019;s unanimous finding was that our apprenticeship system was inherently sound. However, the representative on the Board of SEIFSA, that is, the Iron and Steel Federation, submitted details of a scheme designed to stimulate the training of apprentices by means of a levy system. The Federation hit upon this idea because certain employers were training apprentices at great expense, while others were avoiding the responsibility of providing training and were enticing trained staff away from firms which provided training.</p>

<p>In principle, the National Apprenticeship Board was favourably disposed towards the Federation&#x2019;s proposal, and it appointed a special committee to investigate the matter and to report on it.</p>

<p>SEIFSA&#x2019;s representative on the Board was sent overseas by his organization to study the training schemes which were applicable in, <i>inter alia,</i> the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The finding was that those training schemes were aimed solely at enabling industries or groups of industries to establish training boards and to impose levies on employers, matters which here in the Republic can be handled as well, if not better, under the Apprenticeship Act and the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>On the basis of these findings the National Apprenticeship Board recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that industrial boards should themselves, by means of their agreements, take the lead according to their own requirements as far as the introduction and financing of training schemes were concerned.</p>

<p>As apprenticeship training forms only part of the larger whole, it was also recommended that industries which undertake training schemes should be encouraged to extend them to all levels of work activity.</p>

<p>The recommendation about th&#x201C; introduction of training schemes amounts to this, that employers in any particular industry will contribute towards a training fund according to a prescribed formula and will be entitled to be compensated in terms of that formula for the training which they undertake. In this way employers who provide no training will be obliged to help to defray the costs connected with training. This recommendation requires no amendment of the existing Act. Such funds are in fact in operation under the Industrial Conciliation Act, e.g. the National Development Fund for the building industry.</p>

<p>Workers who are trained at great expense in one industry or area are, however, often enticed away by employers in another industry or area who spare themselves the trouble and expenditure connected with training. In order to combat this tendency, clause 2 (a) provides that an industrial council agreement which makes provision for a training scheme in respect of any particular industry, can also be made applicable to another industry and to the same industry in another area. Such application will mean that all employers in the industry concerned or in the same industry in different areas who require the services of a particular category of worker, will have to contribute towards the training of that class of worker. However, the Bill provides that before the levy system of one industry can be made applicable to another industry or in an additional area, the Minister must consult any industrial council registered in respect of such additional area or in respect of such other industry.</p>

<p>It is further provided that the Minister must publish a provisional notice in order to afford interested parties an opportunity to lodge objections, should they have any. The period within which objections must be lodged is 90 days.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for the appointment of persons by the Minister to represent the parties in the other industry and area on the body which is responsible for the administration of the training fund.</p>

<p>In clause 3 of the Bill provision is made for training schemes and levies in industries which do not have the machinery of industrial councils. The clause provides that when any group or association of employers have arrived at a training scheme in respect of employees who are not subject to a scheme in terms of an industrial council agreement, the first-mentioned scheme may be declared binding for all employers in the same industry and area, provided that the Minister is satisfied that the group or association concerned is sufficiently representative.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for such scheme to be extended to the same industry in another area if unfair competition exists, on the same basis as the extension of agreements in terms of section 48 (1) (c) of the existing Act. However, it will not be possible to extend such scheme to another industry as in the case of industrial council agreements. Most employer organizations are opposed to such extensions and it is the view that in such cases the employers concerned should proceed to the establishment of an industrial council, which will then have the necessary authority.</p>

<p>These, Mr. Speaker, are the main provisions of the Bill. The amendments contained in the other clauses are consequential amendments which arise from clauses 2 (a) and 3, and have <span class="col_931-932" refersTo="page_0478"/>already been set out in the explanatory memorandum which I laid on the Table last year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to point out that a draft Bill was published on 22nd January of last year for general information and comment. From the comments which have been received, it appears that the proposed measure enjoys general support, and apart from certain amendments which have been made to give effect, as far as practicable, to representations which have been received, the measure is largely the same as that which was published for objections. The most important amendments which have been made are the extension of the period within which objections may be lodged in terms of clause 2 (a) from 30 to 60 days and the insertion of a new requirement in the same clause to the effect that before a training scheme of one industry may be applied to another industry or area, the Minister must consult any industrial council which is registered in respect of such additional area or other industry.</p>

<p>I may add, Mr. Speaker, that the principles of this measure also have the full support of a sub-committee which was appointed by the Economic Advisory Council to investigate the matter. The Economic Advisory Council has already approved that the committee concerned should continue in existence and should report on the progress which is made with the introduction of levy and training schemes. The committee is empowered also to bring into the matter groups which as yet have no representation on the committee.</p>

<p>I trust, Mr. Speaker, that the measure will meet with the general approval of this House as well.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House, as the official Opposition, will support this measure. We do so because the main principle of this Bill is to make further provision for the better training of manpower. I believe that at this stage in South Africa&#x2019;s history, the start of a new decade, the decade of the 1970s, it is appropriate that this House should be asked to consider the problem of the better training of manpower to enable the country to face the coming decade and the challenges which this will provide. We on this side of the House have for long been drawing to the attention of the Government the problems which are arising as a result of the manpower shortage in this country. In particular, last year, through the hon. member for Hillbrow, we introduced a private member&#x2019;s Bill, which is even more important than a private member&#x2019;s motion, dealing with this subject. Therefore, Sir, we are pleased to see that this Government has at last taken a step in the right direction, a step towards providing some machinery for the better training of our workers. Because we consider this measure a step in the right direction we shall be supporting this Bill.</p>

<p>However, for reasons which I shall elaborate in a moment, we consider this Bill to be completely inadequate for the task which lies before us at the start of this new decade. We know, Sir, the strides that have been made by this country in the last 30 years, the strides which have been made because of the tremendous human and natural resources at our command in this country, and the strides which have been possible because of this, despite&#x2014; and I should like to emphasize this point&#x2014;the many restrictive policies of this Government. We know, Sir, that economists and industrialists, in increasing numbers, have been drawing attention to the fact that the greatest obstacle to economic advancement in this country is the shortage of skilled workers, technicians and other highly trained personnel, not only in industry but also in commerce. In increasing numbers, knowledgeable persons have been drawing attention to this fact. In increasing numbers, these people have been describing this as a manpower crisis. Now what do we find the hon. the Minister of Labour doing? We find that he is obstinately refusing to see this problem as a crisis, despite the fact that at least two of his colleagues who sit in the Cabinet have described the position in these words. One of them is no less a person than the hon. Minister of finance and the other a somewhat lesser person but one whom I am sure would not like to be considered as being too much less a person than the hon. Minister of Finance, namely the hon. Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, who is not in the House this evening. Whether or not the hon. Minister of Labour is prepared to accept the problem as a crisis, the fact of the matter is that there is a serious manpower shortage and that much the hon. the Minister must accept.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to point out with respect that the whole object of this Bill is to provide for better training of workers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I have allowed the hon. member to make these general remarks but I hope he will come back to the Bill now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The problem of a manpower shortage must be seen in relation to South African conditions. An insufficient number of people are being trained to meet expanding demands for labour and to meet the increasing complexity of modern industry and modern commerce. Bearing this fact in mind I should like to look at this Bill. Mr. Speaker, I submit to you and to the House, and this is also the contention of this side of the House, that while this Bill of the hon. the Minister helps in some respects to provide other methods of training, it will be completely inadequate for the needs of the coming decade. In our opinion it will be inadequate for several reasons. Other reasons will be submitted to the <span class="col_933-934" refersTo="page_0479"/>House by other speakers on this side of the House. I wish to refer to a few reasons only.</p>

<p>Many parts of this Bill are extremely obscure in phraseology. For example, Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will be interested to learn that one clause in this Bill contains a single sentence which runs into 235 words.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Will the hon. member rather try to amend that during the Committee Stage?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I assure you that we have no intention whatsoever of trying to amend this Bill. This is the responsibility of the hon. Minister of Labour. We are supporting the Bill because its main principle is to take a few steps forward in the training of manpower. However, we consider it to be so inadequate that we do not propose to introduce any amendments. Mr. Speaker, my hon. Leader points out that the inadequacies of this Bill are no doubt due to a shortage of manpower in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. This is the first inadequacy, in our opinion, of this Bill. The phraseology is obscure. In some respects it makes it extremely difficult to interpret what is intended. I am referring to the proposed amendment of subparagraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 48 in clause 2. But there are other parts of this Bill that are also obscure.</p>

<p>The second reason why in our opinion this Bill is inadequate, is that it does not provide for advanced training over a wide range of industrial and particularly commercial activity. It has no relation to commercial activity at all. I will come back to this aspect a little later.</p>

<p>The third reason why we regard this Bill as inadequate, is that there is no provision in the Bill for the proper training of the staff who will be required to train the workers. There is not a single clause in this Bill dealing either with the staff which is to be required, i.e. where they are to be obtained, what qualifications they are to have or, above all, what training they themselves are to have to provide the training which is envisaged for the workers. This, in our opinion, is a very serious deficiency in this Bill.</p>

<p>The fourth reason why this Bill is inadequate, is that it links training to Industrial Councils. In our opinion, if this problem of the proper training of manpower is to be tackled in the way in which it should be, there is only one way in which it should be done, and that is by a separate measure to provide separate manpower training, free of the provisions of the Industrial Council. We say this because, first of all, the Industrial Conciliation Act is limited in its application. It does not deal with all workers at all. It does not deal with Bantu at all, for example. And, above all, it does not deal with all the white workers. Now, surely, a Bill which is aimed at the proper training of manpower for the future needs of South Africa should include the proper training of all workers in commerce and industry. The hon. member who sits behind the hon. Minister of Labour&#x2014;I am not sure of his constituency&#x2014;when I referred to the fact that the Industrial Conciliation Act did not refer to Bantu, immediately said &#x201C;Daar&#x2019;s hy!&#x201D; I can anticipate what is going to happen in this debate. All the speakers on the Nationalist side are going to turn this into a &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D; debate. They are going to make the allegations against this side of the House that all we are concerned about is the proper training for non-Whites. What nonsense! Even they on that side of the House have said time and time again, through the hon. the Minister of Labour and also through other Ministers, that they themselves stand for the better training of the non-White races, not only the Bantu but also the Coloureds and Indians. Are hon. members opposite going to deny now that they stand for the better training of all the non-White races? Of course they will not.</p>

<p>The fourth reason why we consider this Bill to be inadequate is that it links training to industrial councils instead of dealing with itas an entirely separate issue under an entirely separate bill. What do we need? In our opinion we need, as I have said, a separate bill which will deal with the problem as a separate issue, because, in this way, we can then ensure that proper provision will be made not only for the workers who are covered by the Indus-trial Conciliation Act, but also for all workers in industry and all workers in commerce. The hon. the Minister seems to look at this simply as an extension of the present apprentice training schemes. He seems to look at it in this narrow framework. We on this side have a far more broader vision when we speak of properman power training in South Africa. We look at it not only from the point of view of industry, but we also look at it from the point of view of commerce; we look at it not only from the point of view of apprentices, but also all other categories of workers within these industries. The objectives which this Bill requires in our opinion are basically, first of all, to ensure that an adequate supply of trained men and women at all levels of industry and commerce can be provided to meet the needs of the decade that is before us, namely that of the 1970s. We believe that that cannot be done in terms of the amendments which are proposed by the hon. the Minister and which have a very narrow limit indeed. We believe that the second objective should be to en surean improvement in the quality and efficiency of training. It is only by improvements in these two regards that productivity, which we have been hearing so much about, can be improved. Where is there one single word in this Bill which has to do with this aspect of the matter,namely with the improvement of the quality and efficiency of training? There is not one word. The third objective, of course, is that the Bill should deal with the sharing of the cost of training more evenly between organizations in the same industry. It has been the experience that some industrialists are conscientious about <span class="col_935-936" refersTo="page_0480"/>this matter of training their workers and are prepared to spend money on it. Very often the result is that within a short time they lose the personnel that they have trained to their competitors or to other industries. Some provisions must, therefore, be made for reasonable contributions within an industry so that there will be a fair sharing of the costs amongst those who undertake the task of training. This Bill makes most inadequate provision in this respect. I agree with the hon. the Minister that it does refer to some form of sharing of levies, but it is in a most inadequate way with which we can deal more fully when we come to the Committee stage.</p>

<p>We have yet another reason for suggesting that this is an inadequate Bill. Nowhere does this measure give the impression that it is designed to thrust South Africa well into the technological era of the 1970s by providing the fully trained workers which will be required both in industry and commerce. It is a Bill with a very narrow vision. We see this problem on a much broader front. We see this problem as a measure which should be related to the age in which we live, which is the jet age. The hon. the Minister and his Government appear to look at this measure still from the point of view of a slow moving economy, an economy where steps can be taken gradually. This is not our vision of this problem at all. It will be our task when we take over the Government of this country, to place before this House and before the country a measure which will deal with this problem, with the responsibility, the courage and the vision which are required in this day and age. It is for these reasons that we shall support this measure but we shall draw attention to its inadequacy.</p>

<p>Before I sit down, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister how he can reconcile the introduction of this Bill with the way in which he and the hon. members on that side of the House acted when the hon. member for Hill-brow introduced his Manpower Training Bill last year? This was a measure with precisely the same basic principle, i.e. the training of manpower. What did the hon. the Minister and the hon. members on that side of the House do? They voted against the measure at its Second Reading. They voted against the principle of adequate proper training of manpower.</p>

<p>I do not wish to pursue this. However, I wish merely to place on record the reference to that debate, i.e. column 1663 of volume 25 of the debates of 1969.</p>

<p>I wish also to refer the hon. the Minister to one further matter before I sit down. I want to refer him to the fact that when this Bill, the one which is before the House to-night, was introduced last year, we on this side of the House asked the hon. the Minister to refer the Bill to a Select Committee before the Second Reading or if he preferred it, to a commission of inquiry so that it would be possible to provide the best instrument to meet the needs of manpower training. The hon. the Minister told us that this could not be accepted because the measure was so urgent that it had to be passed immediately. Now, Mr. Speaker, it was not passed last year. A whole year has elapsed, a year during which, had a commission been appointed, this important question could have been thoroughly canvassed and we could have placed before the House to-day a measure which would have adequately dealt with the needs of this country regarding manpower shortage, instead of the measure which we have to-day which we, on this side of the House, are convinced will not meet the requirements and which will have either to be amended in the future or will have to be superseded by an entirely new measure such as the one which we suggest.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that that was what we did not have. It would have been very foolish if this side of the House accepted the Bill which the hon. member submitted, a Bill he copied from the British Industrial Training Act, instead of this Bill with which we could introduce much better legislation by amending six or seven clauses of the Industrial Conciliation Act. The hon. member says it was foolish of us not to accept it. That hon. member never took the trouble to investigate and to study our own existing legislation properly. Had he done so it would not have been necessary for him to go and ferret around in the British statute books and to do all the translations necessary to make this Act comprehensible to this House. I told the hon. member last year that he was displaying his ignorance here with the Act to which he referred. He is nothing more than a &#x201C;copy cat&#x201D;. To-day we have legislation here before the House which we shall discuss further in the course of time. This legislation is altogether acceptable and I am therefore grateful for the fact that the hon. Opposition will support it. However, the hon. member has quite a few objections to the legislation which they want to support. We shall certainly come back to those objections. The hon. member for Musgrave said here that the legislation placed before the House did not meet with the requirements of our demands for trained manpower. We shall most certainly also come to that aspect of the matter, in order to prove the contrary, i.e. that this legislation makes much better provision for that than the legislation that was submitted to us last year and about which the hon. member had so much to say. We shall prove this. Our industrial conciliation legislation makes provision for the fact that with very small amendments we can change the legislation to meet the requirements. The hon. member jumped the gun and said that the legislation did not make provision for the training of the Bantu. That is the crux of the whole matter. They want the kind or Act that will flood the labour market with black workers because they do not care about the white worker. That hon. member could not help himself and had to let the cat out of the bag.</p>

<from>Mrs. H. SUZMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Health:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to reports of serious malnutrition in some parts of the Republic;</li>

<li>(2) whether he has given consideration to again making kwashiorkor a notifiable disease; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_health" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF HEALTH:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) No. Notwithstanding the fact that kwashiorkor is no longer notifiable, information about the incidence of this malady is obtained from local authorities, district surgeons and hospitals. This information is sufficient to extend the Department&#x2019;s preventive measures. Wherever the incidence increases, attention is directed towards general promotive measures for the particular community concerned, including nutritional guidance as well as specific treatment of cases showing symptoms of malnutrition.</li>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>In the Bill now under consideration, Parliament is asked to make provision for the financing of Government expenditure as from 1st April, until such time as it is possible to pass the main Appropriation Act for the 1970-&#x2019;71 financial year.</p>

<p>An amount of R1,140,000 is asked on Revenue Account, R390,000,000 on Loan Account, R30,000,000 on Bantu Education Account and R40,000,000 on South West Africa Account. These amounts may only be spent on services already approved by Parliament under an Appropriation Act or on services for which statutory authority exists.</p>

<p>Hon. members will notice that the amounts asked for under the various Accounts are considerably higher than those normally provided for. The reason for this is that the Appropriation Bill will not be introduced during this Session and sufficient provision should, therefore, be made to cover Government expenditure for at least 7 to 7+ months.</p>

<p>Since Government expenditure fluctuates from month to month, the amounts requested under the various Accounts cannot be taken as an indication of the possible expenditures for the 1970-&#x2019;71 financial year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is not normal practice for a Minister of finance to anticipate his Budget speech when he deals with the Part Appropriation Bill. However, in view of the fact that the Budget statement will only be delivered during the next session of Parliament, I wish to avail myself of the opportunity to raise a few fiscal and financial matters and to make a brief statement on our economic position.</p>

<p>It is still too early to make an accurate estimate of our revenue and expenditure for the current fiscal year. The indications are, however, that expenditure on revenue account will be higher than the amount originally appropriated, largely because of increases in salaries, in provincial subsidies, in university grants and in certain other services for which provision will be requested in the Additional Estimates. Revenue will probably also be higher than originally estimated, mainly be cause of higher receipts from those taxes which are associated with the high level of prosperity in our country.</p>

<p>Expenditure from Loan Votes is expected to be about the same as the amount originally appropriated, apart from an amount to be included in the Additional Estimates to which I shall refer later. Receipts on Loan Account have, however, been adversely affected by the tightness of the local capital market, but the shortfall may be met to some extent from additional foreign borrowing at present under consideration. Any remaining deficit can be easily met from the opening balance on Loan Account and by transfers from the Revenue or Stabilization Accounts.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the relaxations of sales duty recently announced. In my Budget speech last year I pointed out that it was very difficult to be sure that the yield of sales duty had been estimated with reasonable accuracy and that the application of the duty would not result in certain anomalies. For this reason I was given the authority to reduce the sales duty on any article at any time, in anticipation of subsequent parliamentary approval. It was not possible before the closing months of the year, however, to obtain a reasonably reliable estimate of the revenue from the sales duty. As soon as it became clear that a somewhat higher yield than the original estimate could be expected, I instructed my Department to explore the possibility of reducing the rates of duty where the concessions would most benefit the lower income groups and where it would remove administrative difficulties or anomalies. The Department submitted its proposals and the reductions were announced at the earliest possible date. I must also emphasize once again that, while the interests of the lower income groups will always be taken into account, it is simply not possible to confine the duty to pure luxuries if the necessary revenue is to be raised. In my Budget speech last year, I clearly stated that the basis of the duty would be domestic consumption, but that items which play a large role in the expenditure of the lower income groups would be excluded. I shall always be ready to consider the reduction of any duty which presses unduly hard on the less fortunate members of the community. The fact that file duty is estimated to be responsible for a rise of only 0.7 per cent in the consumers&#x2019; price index&#x2014; a once-for-all rise&#x2014;is an indication that its burden, even before the recent concessions, was not unduly severe.</p>

<p>I have to announce an administrative change which should facilitate the payment and collection of the sales duty. Shortly after the introduction of the duty it was decided that manufacturers should pay the duty quarterly, during the month following the quarter to which the payment related; for the last quarter of the financial year, however, it was laid down that payment had to be made before the end of the quarter, the payment in respect <span class="col_967-968" refersTo="page_0496"/>of the last month of the financial year being based upon an estimate of the amount due. It has now been decided to dispense with this latter requirement; in other words, payment of sales duty by manufacturers in respect of the quarter January to March, 1970 need only be made during April. This should be of considerable assistance to manufacturers, to the Department of Customs and Excise, and also to the banks who might otherwise have been called upon to finance the earlier payment of the duty.</p>

<p>Hon. members will not expect me to deal in any detail with the fiscal prospects for the next financial year, but there are a few points I wish to mention.</p>

<p>The first concerns concessions to social pensioners. Although the Budget for 1970-&#x2019;71 will only be introduced during the second Session this year, I do not think it would be fair to ask social pensioners to wait until then for the relief which the Government has found it possible to extend to them. I am therefore glad to announce that the Government has decided to increase social pensions and grants payable to white persons in the Republic by R2 per person with effect from 1st April, 1970. This increase applies to old age pensions, war veteran&#x2019;s pensions, blind persons&#x2019; pensions, disability grants, maintenance grants and family allowances. At the same time, the bonus payable, which amounts at present to R5 per month, will be consolidated with the basic pension or grant. As a result of these concessions the maximum basic pension will amount to R35 per month per person and R43 per month in respect of war veterans. Consolidation also brings about an appropriate adjustment in the means plus pension limitation and in the maximum assets allowed to qualify for the minimum pension.</p>

<p>Settlers&#x2019; allowances and veterans&#x2019; pensions payable in South West Africa in terms of the German War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions Ordinance of 1965 will be increased correspondingly.</p>

<p>It has further been decided that, in cases where maintenance grants or family allowances are paid under the Children&#x2019;s Act, the basic children&#x2019;s allowance and bonus should be consolidated. In addition, the difference in the allowances payable in respect of the first two children and that payable to the third child will be eliminated, and the allowance payable to school children, amounting at present to R2 per month in respect of each child attending primary school and R4 per month for each child attending secondary school will be increased to R5 per month in both cases. A widow with three school children will henceforth receive R90 per month compared with R83 per month at present being paid to a widow with three children in high school. The children&#x2019;s allowances payable to settlers will be similarly increased. All these concessions will apply <i>mutatis mutandis</i> in respect of the children&#x2019;s allowances payable in South West Africa.</p>

<p>As a further concession, the capitation grants payable to children&#x2019;s homes and foster parents will be increased by R2 to R22 per month. This increase, however, does not apply to grants payable to foster parents in the territory of South West Africa, as such grants are already higher than those payable in the Republic.</p>

<p>The increase in social pensions and grants nccessittes a corresponding increase in the minimum pension payable to ex-employees of the State. It has accordingly been decided to increase the minimum pension payable to a single person from R50 to R52 per month and that payable to a married person or unmarried person with dependants from R100 to R104 per month.</p>

<p>It has also been decided to provide relief to war pensioners by increasing the bonus of 10 per cent at present being paid to them to 12&#x00BD; per cent.</p>

<p>The concessions mentioned above are those applicable to white pensioners, but corresponding increases are also being made in the social pensions and grants payable to Coloured, Indian and Bantu pensioners.</p>

<p>All these increases will, as I have mentioned, take effect from 1st April, 1970, and the total additional cost will be approximately R10.5 million for the year 1970-71.</p>

<p>There are also two tax matters to which I wish to refer, since they will affect tax assessments for the current tax year ending on 28th February, 1970. The concessions to married women announced in the last budget do not apply to the earnings of a married woman from a partnership of which she or her husband is a member, or from a private company of which she or her husband is the sole or one of the principal shareholders. This seems unduly restrictive and legislation will be introduced next session, with retrospective effect, to extend the concession to the earnings of a married woman from a partnership or private company except when her husband is a member or a sole or principal shareholder. The second concession concerns medical expenses. The amount allowed is R150 for married and R75 for unmarried persons. An unmarried person who is the sole support of a dependant is, however, entitled to R150. I feel that the same should apply to a divorced person who maintains a child out of his or her own resources, without assistance from the other parent. Here again legislation will be introduced with retrospective effect.</p>

<p>I should like now to give the House a brief picture of the economic and financial situation of the Republic as it has developed over the past year. Comprehensive statistics for the year 1969 are not yet available so that the picture is not in all respects completely clear.</p>

<p>It seems reasonably certain, nevertheless, that the real gross domestic product increased during 1969 at a rate well in excess of the target growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent. Moreover, all components of gross domestic expenditure increased at a relatively high rate during the <span class="col_969-970" refersTo="page_0497"/>first three quarters of 1969 and this trend probably continued during the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Private fixed investment showed a distinct upward trend during the first nine months of 1969 and was 12 per cent higher during this period than during the corresponding period of 1968.</p>

<p>This vigorous growth was reflected in the index of the physical volume of manufacturing production which, during the first ten months of 1969, was on average 10 per cent higher than during the corresponding period of 1968. The physical volume of mining production, on the other hand, increased by only 2.1 per cent, despite a sharp rise in gold mining production.</p>

<p>While good rains have fallen over many parts of the country, especially during the earlier months of the summer, the position in other parts is less favourable and in some areas the farming community is facing a grave situation. The Government is giving urgent attention to this problem.</p>

<p>Another factor which is at present causing difficulty to many sectors of the farming community is the prevailing high level of interest rates. The Government has decided to include in the Additional Estimates for the current year an amount of R15 million as a loan to the Land Bank, at 2 per cent interest, in order to enable the Land Bank to assist more farmers at a low rate of interest.</p>

<p>Most economic indicators confirm the strong upward movement of the economy. For the corresponding period of 1969 compared with 1968, merchandise imports increased by 14 per cent, sales of new commercial vehicles by 30 per cent, new motor cars by 18 per cent, value of wholesale sales by 9.5 per cent and value of building plans passed by 26 per cent.</p>

<p>The acceleration in economic activity led to an all-round increase in salaries and wages. Salaries and wages per white employee in manufacturing, for example, increased by about 7 per cent and in construction and the railway service by about 8 per cent during the first ten or eleven months of 1969, compared with the corresponding period of 1968.</p>

<p>Employment in manufacturing, construction and especially in the Post Office increased substantially during the first ten months of 1969. This, in turn, led to a further decline in the number of unemployed Whites, Coloured and Asiatics from a seasonally adjusted total of 11,740 in December, 1968 to 9,359 in November, 1969.</p>

<p>This vigorous expansion in the economy was achieved with a comparatively moderate rise in prices. The seasonally adjusted index of consumer prices increased by 3.3 per cent during 1969, compared with 2.9 per cent during 1968. If the effect of the sales duty is excluded, the increase in 1969 was 2.6 per cent. Wholesale prices rose by 2.3 per cent in 1969; if sales duty is excluded, the increase was only 1.4 per cent.</p>

<p>The acceleration in economic activity during 1969 resulted in the appearance of a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. Preliminary estimates indicate that the deficit for the year was in the vicinity of R140 million, compared with a surplus of R90 million in 1968. Imports rose from R1,930 million in 1968 to about R2,200 million in 1969, and while net gold output increased, merchandise exports remained at about the level of R1,500 million reached in 1968.</p>

<p>The net capital inflow declined substantially in 1969 but still amounted to about R70 million as compared with R446 million in 1968.</p>

<p>Total gold and foreign exchange reserves therefore declined by approximately R70 million during 1969.</p>

<p>The deficit on our balance of payments helped to reduce the excess liquidity in the private sector. On the other hand bank credit to the private sector increased by R493 million or 17.7 per cent during 1969. Bank credit to the government sector increased only slightly over the year, a decline in the first half being followed by a substantial rise in the second half. The net result of these and other factors was that the total quantity of money and nearmoney increased by 10.3 per cent during 1969, that is, at a considerably slower rate than the 20.7 per cent of 1968. The greater part of the increase in 1969, however, occurred during the last five months of the year.</p>

<p>Surplus liquid assets of monetary banking institutions still amounted to some R286 million at the end of 1969, but seasonal factors will probably cause a tightening of their liquidity during the early months of 1970.</p>

<p>The very strong position of the economy is not reflected in the Stock Exchange, and I wish to emphasize once again that the level of share prices should not be regarded as a barometer of our economic position. After climbing to unprecedented heights during the early months of 1969, the prices of industrial and commercial shares have, on the average, now fallen to approximately the levels which obtained about the middle of 1968&#x2014;i.e. still substantially above the level of two years ago. Gold mining shares have fluctuated less widely but also show appreciable declines.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that in October last year I instructed my Department to investigate the conditions prevailing on the Stock Exchange and the circumstances which gave rise to the decline in share prices. Senior officials of the Office of the Registrar of Financial Institutions interviewed representatives of the Stock Exchange and of the most important financial institutions in the country. Among these men of divergent interests, but all in close touch with the Exchange, my officials found a remarkable consensus, from which it is possible to form a balanced view of the course of share prices during the past 12 months.</p>

<p>The main conclusion was that share prices during the second quarter of 1969 reached un <span class="col_971-972" refersTo="page_0498"/>realistic and unsustainable heights, and that a corrective decline was inevitable. Among the factors responsible for the excessive rise in share prices were: the high degree of liquidity in the economy associated with the inflow of foreign capital; the substantial volume of credit granted by banks and other financial institutions which went to finance, directly or indirectly, the purchase of shares; the administrative dislocation in the Offices of brokers and transfer secretaries caused by the tremendous volume of business which led to delays in requiring payment of minimum cover from clients and consequently to the unofficial extension of a huge volume of credit to such clients some estimates put the figure at hundreds of millions of rand; the lack of knowledge and sophistication on the part of many newcomers to share investment, who were sometimes misled by overoptimistic Press reports; and lastly, the heavy investments by unit trusts at the time when prices were climbing steeply.</p>

<p>All these factors helped to create a situation where a reaction was inevitable. The reaction, when it came, was intensified by a number of other factors. Firstly, the movement of the balance of payments into deficit reduced the liquidity of the economy and also created an unfavourable psychological climate since many investors seem to believe, irrationally, that there is a necessary correlation between share prices and the level of our reserves of gold and foreign exchange. The lessening of pressure in brokers&#x2019; Offices made it possible for brokers to catch up with their work and so reduce the unofficial credit to which I referred earlier. Banking institutions also tended to be more restrictive in extending credit. A special factor which may have had some influence was that certain unit trusts at that time attracted a large volume of money from the public in connection with an issue of shares by the management company, thus withdrawing these funds from the market.</p>

<p>My officials found no evidence that bear speculation played an important part in the fall of share prices. It was pointed out that bears may fulfil a useful function in eliminating extreme price fluctuations. Furthermore, any shareholder may sell shares on a falling market and buy again when prices have fallen still further, and it is not clear that anything could or should be done to curb such operations.</p>

<p>Another factor which intensified the reaction on the Exchange was the large number of small and relatively unsophisticated investors who&#x2014;despite warnings from the authorities&#x2014; had plunged into the market when it was rising steeply. The shock and disillusionment among these investors, some of whom could ill afford their loss, created a psychological climate in which the decline could not easily be checked. The Press also received some blame in this respect.</p>

<p>Financial institutions, particularly insurance companies and banks, did not contribute to the fall in prices since they did not sell in the falling market. Many of them, in fact, had not bought for a considerable time before prices reached their peak, but some are now selective buyers.</p>

<p>A final factor contributing to the decline was the fall in share prices on the London and New York Stock Exchanges. Considerable falls were experienced on both these exchanges during 1969 and this doubtless affected foreign interest in South African shares.</p>

<p>The results of the inquiry are not startling and indeed reflect what responsible and knowledgable observers have been saying for some time. The basic fact is that share prices rose too steeply and to too high a level, and that the reaction has naturally been sharp. Whether the present general level can be considered the correct one is obviously a question on which I cannot express an opinion, but in view of the country&#x2019;s strong economic position and of the good profits shown by many companies, responsible investors are considering a resumption of selective buying. Such selective buying is, in the long run, much healthier than the irresponsible and indiscriminate scramble of last May.</p>

<p>It is often said that a relaxation of the credit restrictions would have a favourable effect on share prices. Perhaps it would, but the Government cannot consider the interests of the Stock Exchange alone. The picture which I sketched earlier shows an economy poised for rapid expansion, and it would be irresponsible of the authorities to risk renewed inflationary pressures by relaxing restrictions prematurely. To do so would be to gamble with the welfare of hundreds of thousands of wage-and salary-earners, pensioners and all those who stand to lose from rising prices. It is for this reason that it was announced earlier in this session that no further general relaxation of credit restrictions was considered advisable at present. I emphasize the word: &#x201C;general&#x201D;. In other words, this does not mean that specific relaxations will not now be considered. The authorities will watch the position closely and further relaxations will be made whenever this can be done without the risk of stimulating inflation. Yesterday already the Reserve Bank was able to announce a relaxation of the liquid asset requirements and a raising of the ceiling on investments by monetary banks, designed particularly to enable the banks to grant more medium-term credit to industry in the form of debentures.</p>

<p>I wish now to say a few words about the recent understanding with the International Monetary Fund regarding the sale of South African gold. I have already commented on this understanding in public and I do not wish to burden the House with excessive detail, though I shall be happy to answer any questions on the new arrangements.</p>

<p>Since the inception of the two-tier market for gold in March 1968 the problem of the disposal of South African gold has been an unsettled question. Although we were able to <span class="col_973-974" refersTo="page_0499"/>sell enough gold, on the private market and to monetary authorities, to meet our requirements of foreign exchange, we did not have an assured market as we always had in the past. In this connection I think a word of tribute is due to the Reserve Bank for the ingenuity and resourcefulness which they displayed in these unfamiliar and difficult circumstances. The uncertainty surrounding the marketing of our gold clearly made it desirable to reach some agreement on the matter, and discussions with the American authorities, the International Monetary Fund and others continued over many months. We found it difficult, however, to find a formula which would meet what we regarded as a fundamental condition, namely, that the position of gold as a monetary metal should be recognized and that there should be a continuing possibility of a significant flow of gold into monetary reserves.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, I think the factor which eventually made it possible for us to reach a satisfactory understanding was the decline in the gold price on the private market towards the end of 1969, since this increased the pressure on the other countries concerned to reach some agreement.</p>

<p>For South Africa, the new arrangements have the advantage that they establish a &#x201C;floor price&#x201D; for South African gold of just under $35 per fine ounce.</p>

<p>Secondly, South Africa will never have to sell more than its current gold production on the private market though it may do so if it wishes. Since South Africa has in fact been selling very nearly its total output on this market in recent months I do not foresee great difficulty in meeting this requirement, especially in view of the prospective increase in the industrial demand for gold to which I shall refer later. Furthermore, when we have a surplus on our balance of payments, we need not sell our full current gold production but may add the surplus to our monetary reserves.</p>

<p>Thirdly, South Africa obtains an additional measure of elasticity in marketing its gold through the provision allowing it to sell to monetary authorities approximately 1 million ounces per quarter out of its gold stock as at March, 1968, subject to certain deductions.</p>

<p>Fourthly, South Africa may use its gold in certain I.M.F. transactions, as for example when it repays drawings from the Fund, when it increases its quota, when it is &#x201C;designated&#x201D; to receive Special Drawing Rights from other countries and must acquire convertible currency to pay for them, and when South African rand are drawn by other members of the Fund and converted into gold.</p>

<p>While sales of gold to monetary authorities under these arrangements will normally take place through the Fund, South Africa has not bound itself exclusively to this channel.</p>

<p>By removing the uncertainty which until recently surrounded the disposal of our gold, the understanding will give us much greater flexibility in framing financial policy. In other words, we can now formulate policy without having to ask ourselves the question: &#x201C;Will we be able to sell our gold, or not?&#x201D;</p>

<p>The arrangements represent a compromise and naturally do not give us the full freedom which we should like in disposing of our gold. They are, nevertheless, more advantageous than any which we could have obtained at any earlier stage of the negotiations. Basically, whereas before March, 1968 we had both a floor and a ceiling price for our gold, now we have a floor but no ceiling.</p>

<p>The medium-and long-term prospects for the gold price on the private market are, in my view, quite bright. Recent studies indicate that current gold output is already exceeded by industrial and other non-speculative demand and that, even when account is taken of possible speculative sales, there is likely to be substantial upward pressure on the price in the private market within two years. Furthermore, the re-introduction of what amounts to an effective &#x201C;floor price&#x201D; may well stimulate new speculative buying of gold, especially if currency uncertainties should recur, and this would make an earlier price rise probable.</p>

<p>Up to now gold speculators have mainly bought in the hope of a rise in the official gold price. With the prospective increase in industrial and hoarding demand within two or three years to levels well above current production (at the $35 price), however, there is a real possibility of a quite substantial rise in the gold price on the private market arising from this class of demand alone, and this in itself may elicit a strong speculative demand at an earlier date.</p>

<p>This is not to say that a rise in the official gold price must now be ruled out or has been rendered significantly less likely by the new arrangements for the marketing of South African gold. It is true that the introduction of Special Drawing Rights has made it less probable that the official gold price will deliberately be increased in order to augment international liquidity&#x2014;desirable as that would, in my view, have been. Given the present attitudes of the United States and other major countries, however, it has long been clear that a rise in the official gold price is&#x2014;unfortunately&#x2014;not likely to come about in this way, but would more probably emerge from some currency crisis&#x2014; as it nearly did in March, 1968. The currency realignments of 1969 may indeed ensure some degree of monetary tranquillity in the months to come. If account is taken of such factors as the large prospective deficit in the American balance of payments, however, it is by no means impossible that currency crises will occur again and that the official gold price will again be called in question. In such a crisis, the system of Special Drawing Rights would be of little avail.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have tried in this &#x201C;little budget&#x201D; to give the House an account of some of the financial developments of importance to South Africa in recent months. The picture which emerges is not that of a country <span class="col_975-976" refersTo="page_0500"/>without financial problems. A country without financial problems is a country which is financially and economically static. In our dynamic economy, problems must arise. We have shown in the past that we can solve these problems, and our basic economic strength, vitality and stability leave no doubt in my mind that we can continue to solve them in the future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has made an unusally long speech for a Part Appropriation Bill. I think the House appreciates his object in making it under the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day. He has given us to-day what one might call a fair run over the course, an outline of how he sees the position and a reiteration of the optimism which he has always felt in considering the economic and financial position of the country both now and in the future. Apart from the overall review of the situation, there are two things he said which I should like to comment on briefly.</p>

<p>The first is the immediate concession to pensioners, the small increase to social pensions of R2 per month, which, of course, small though it is, is welcome and will be welcomed by all those due to receive it. It only amounts to an increase of about six cents a day in those social pension, and whether that will be sufficient to achieve the desired object of attracting votes to the Nationalist party for the coming election, remains to be seen. Apart from the timing of it, the concession is welcomed.</p>

<p>The other point which the Minister made was his confirmation of the statement of the Governor of the Reserve Bank yesterday in regard to the relaxation of certain restrictions in credit control. This again will be generally welcomed by financial institutions and by people generally. Important sections had been pressing for some relaxation for some time. Of course, the scope and effectiveness of this lifting of certain restrictions remain to be seen. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister two questions in this connection. First of all, I should like to ask him why this announcement was not made here in Parliament instead of being made outside. The first most of us learnt about it was when we opened our morning papers to-day. The Reserve Bank made the announcement yesterday. It did not appear in the papers last night. Credit control and currency control are matters of national importance at the present time. I maintain that if Parliament is sitting, Parliament should be the first body to be informed of changes in this direction, whether the restrictions are to be lifted or whether they are to be increased, especially in this particular case when the hon. the Minister was due to make a statement on the very subject this morning. I think it is little less than a slap in the face of Parliament to act in this way&#x2014;not in that of the Opposition. It can only have been deliberate neglect of the rights of Parliament, or is it bad staff work? I acquit the hon. the Minister of any intention of treating Parliament with a lack of respect. I have always found him an upholder of the rights and the dignity of Parliament and I do not believe that he will do such a thing. That only leaves us with the alternative, namely bad staff work. It might have been accidental, but how did it happen? I do not know. Is it possible that the hon. the Minister forgot to tell the Governor of the Reserve Bank that the speech he was to have made yesterday was not going to be made until today. I do not know. I do not think that any ill-effects could flow from this, but it is disturbing to think that leaks of this kind can happen through bad staff work, because it could happen that the consequences might be very serious.</p>

<p>I would also like to ask the hon. the Minister a second question. In his speech he referred to the question of what was said in the State President&#x2019;s speech and what was said by the Governor of the Reserve Bank yesterday. The hon. the Minister tried to differentiate between a general lifting of credit restrictions and a selective one. With all due respect I think that is only playing with words. There is no doubt that the speech made on the 30th January which was prepared by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department for the hon. the State President said the following: &#x201C;The economy, however, remains very liquid. Because there are many visible signs of an increased growth rate no further general relaxation of credit control is considered advisable.&#x201D; There is not the slightest doubt that the general impression throughout the country was that there was not going to-be any further relaxation of credit control in the near future. This immediately led to a further depression of the stock exchange which is, whatever it may or may not be, to a certain extent the barometer of the day-to-day feeling of the financial houses as to the state of affairs. One would have thought that the hon. the Minister would have learned a lesson from last year, if he had not learnt it before. We all know what happened last year, and we on this side of the House will have more to say about it in the course of the debate, but it does show how very careful the hon. the Minister has to be in the responsible position he is with the statements he makes and when and where he makes it. The popular phrase to-day is the &#x201C;credibility gap&#x201D;. I am afraid that the hon. the Minister in his capacity as Minister of finance is gradually acquiring the position of being a prime example of the credibility gap. It is very serious when people start to question the extent to which statements made by the hon. the Minister can be relied upon as accurate, binding and reliable. The statement the hon. the Minister made to-day certainly reveals a lack of co-ordination. The hon. the Minister must have known that what was said in the State President&#x2019;s speech was going to leave the impression throughout the country that a further relaxation of credit control was not contemplated.<span class="col_977-978" refersTo="page_0501"/>If the hon. the Minister did not know that, he should have. If he did not know that, he is not fit to hold his job. However, we will have a good deal more to say about this question of the credibility gap in the course of the debate. Meanwhile I move&#x2014;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while replying to the second-reading debate, the hon. the Minister answered many of our problems. I was particularly pleased to see that the hon. the Minister maintained a very high tone in his answer on that occasion and I should like to express my appreciation in respect of that. It makes it possible to one to debate in the interests of the case which one wants to promote. I think it is always useful if one can measure one&#x2019;s mind against another without trying to hurt each other.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that I realized from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply that he took it amiss of me becausse I had said that I was sorry he had not availed himself of the opportunity to express sympathy to the close relations of the children who were involved in the accident near Meyerton. I want to give the hon. the Minister the assurance, and I hope he will accept it, that it was not my intention to imply that he was unsympathetic or had not expressed the necessary sympathy at the time. My intention was to point out that I had hoped that he would express his sympathy on that occasion by some announcement or other and that he would take more intensive steps tc reduce accidents, especially level crossing accidents. When the hon. the Minister sees how I followed it up, he will understand. I trust that the matter has now been cleared up, because I do not want the idea to get about that the hon. the Minister is unsympathetic in these circumstances.</p>

<p>I hope that in his reply to the third-reading debate, the Minister will do what he omitted to do in his reply to the second-reading debate. I hope he will reply more fully to matters which were raised in all seriousness by hon. members on this side. In some respects he did not reply to problems at all.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>For this reason I should like to raise a few matters which are of real importance to us again, so that the hon. the Minister will know to what we should like to have replies. Firstly, there is the question of pensions. I want to say at once that I do not find the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reasons for his being unable to introduce a non-contributory pension fund, in any way convincing. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s main reason was that railway workers are to-day contributing about R221/2 million, if I remember correctly &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_sport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SPORT</person>:</from>

<p>That is what the Administration contributes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that the Administration would then lose these contributions. However, the Administration will not lose everything, because there is a Superannuation Fund which must be used only for pension purposes. That fund will not cease to exist, but what will in fact happen is that it will be unnecessary to increase that fund. The principle will be that the Railways will be responsible for the pensions of the people who draw pensions at the time. Therefore an Actuarial Fund will not really be necessary. The contributions to the fund will therefore be terminated, but the interest from that fund will then be available to meet the costs of such a non-contributory pension fund. I think that since it is the tendency in the world to-day to switch over to non-contributory pension funds and since there are already signs that the public service has accepted this new principle by reducing the contributions of civil servants to their pension schemes, the Administration under the guidance of the hon. the Minister should give more attention to the matter. I hope that it will be calculated how much it will cost and how much money will be available from the Superannuation Fund to support such a noncontributory scheme and that the hon. the Minister will give us a fully-reasoned reply to the matter. This is important. It is one of the benefits to which workers in a stable organization such as the Railways should be entitled. Also owing to lack of time probably the hon. the Minister did not react to the proposal that all the widows of pensioners who went on pension prior to 1951, should be placed on the same basis as those who went on pension subsequent to that. We made the point that after 19 years there cannot be very many of these people left. Therefore it cannot place a tremendous burden on the Railways. I shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister would react to that proposal and give us his opinion in regard to it. I was glad that the hon. the Minister gave us the assurance that he would continue with his policy to change the labour pattern on the Railways where necessary. I would like to say that the hon. the Minister is a refreshing phenomenon in the Cabinet in this respect, because the policy which he is following for the Railways is in many respects diametrically opposed to that which is being <span class="col_979-980" refersTo="page_0502"/>prescribed for private undertakings by other hon. Ministers. The standpoint which we have consistently adopted and which was supported by a very important speech by the former General Manager, the late Mr. Hugo, is that where a shortage of manpower exists, it affords the community the opportunity to place our white workers in better avenues of employment as non-Whites are taken into service. The non-Whites then also benefit by being offered the chance to do less lucrative and inferior work. I was glad to hear the hon. the Minister say that he was engaged in elevating the Whites, for example, so that there would be no need for them to do so much pick and shovel work in future. But the hon. the Minister will admit that there is much which can still be done in this respect. There is also much which must be done in order to overcome the labour problems of the Railways, ft is very striking that the number of Whites and also the number of Coloureds and Asiatics which are in the employment of the Railways, has remained static for a number of years now. It is not really increasing anymore. I have figures which show that in 1967&#x2014;I took the month of June as an example in the case of each year&#x2014;there were 115,000 Whites in the service of the Railways. In June 1968 it was still 115,000. In June, 1969, it was 114,000. Admittedly this is not a significant decrease, but what is significant, is that the number of employees remained virtually static. In the case of Coloureds and Asiatics it was 16,000 in 1957, 15,000 in 1968 and 15,000 in 1969 as well, in other words the amount remained more or less static. The number of Bantu increased from June, 1967, when there were 90,000&#x2014;I must add that it moved up to 93,000 during other months in that year&#x2014;increased to 94,000 in 1968 and 96,000 in 1969. This is a considerable increase if one takes into consideration the fact that the other numbers remained static. The point I want to make is that we cannot bluff ourselves that a problem does not exist and that changes are not taking place in the labour pattern.</p>

<p>Should we as a country want to continue our present-day prosperity, it will be necessary to make further adjustments in the labour pattern. The hon. the Minister says that the adjustments which are made, must be done in conjunction with a standing committee of the workers&#x2019; societies and of the administration. Nobody can find fault with that. It is the policy of the United Party which the hon. the Minister said a few years ago he did not understand. He said at the time that it would create problems, because what would one do if the people did not agree. Now he is in fact carrying out the United Party policy as so many of them do when they have no other alternative, when the interests of the country demand it. I want to congratulate him on that. I do not wish to make too much political capital out of it. However, the little to which I am entitled, I want to take. Indeed I know that when that hon. Minister was still clear-thinking, when his powers were at their peak, and when he was a fiery young man, he was a United Party member. He then sat on this side of this House. That is, however, just in passing.</p>

<p>I am also glad to hear, although he did not say so directly, that although he must now expect attacks on political exploitation of the policy which he is carrying out so sensibly, he will not be deterred by the propaganda which will be made by the new party, the Herstigte Nationalist Party. He must not allow the past of the Nationalist Party which lives on in the Herstigte Nationalist Party, to impede and weaken him in his determination to persevere with a new direction in the Railways. I want to commend the hon. the Minister. I want to say that it is correct that he does what we tell him to do and that he gradually wants to elevate Whites from the pick and shovel work as far as possible, taking into account the circumstances of some of the people who do this type of work. This forms a shrill contrast with the policy of the hon. the Minister of Labour who, in terms of section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, Whites remove the night soil in Durban for all races. This hon. Minister&#x2019;s policy is however the opposite. He wants to elevate the people and give them better provisions. The hon. the Minister of Labour, probably with the best intentions, thinks he is protecting people by keeping them on the bottom layers of the labour front. I just want to say that we are on the side of the hon. the Minister of Transport in regard to this matter. If he continues with this policy, he may rely on the support of this side of this House. I only hope that after the 22nd April, when we come into power, we will be able to rely on his support in this connection.</p>

<p>I am also very sorry that the hon. the Minister replied only very briefly to our request that he should consider whether the rebate on rentals, which was abolished in the 1950&#x2019;s, could not be reintroduced. I do not think it is necessary for me to stress this. When we read that the price of land has doubled in some of our cities during the past few years, then we know what is happening. The considerations which applied when this rebate was abolished, do not apply to-day. Only a small number of railway officials today own departmental houses. I think the hon. member for Durban (Point) said that only about 20 per cent of the railway officials own departmental houses. There are tens of thousands of people who, during this period of exorbitant prices on the market, have to obtain houses. This applies especially to the young people who reach the stage where they get married and want to raise a family. Most of them must rent houses to-day, because buying is out of the question. They have to pay an exorbitant proportion of their earnings on the Railways for house rent. I think the hon. the Minister will agree when I say that it is a healthy policy that, if possible, no citizen of <span class="col_981-982" refersTo="page_0503"/>South Africa should pay more than 20 per cent of his income towards house rent.</p>

<p>But the hon. the Minister took it amiss when some of us said that the large amount of overtime which is being worked on the Railways, is attributable to the fact that the railway worker feels he does not receive enough money. However, I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that the necessity for paying house rent which applies especially in our cities, forces many people to work overtime beyond their physical capabilities. This creates an unhealthy situation. The example was mentioned of the man who earned only R70 a month, and who has to pay up to R50 in house rent. This is perhaps an exaggerated example, but it nevertheless happens. The hon. the Minister heard about this matter in another capacity. He knows that the house rent of new houses in particular results in houses being virtually unobtainable to-day for people who live under the average income level. I want to plead with him in all seriousness that he give this matter further consideration and investigate the financial implications. I wonder if he has done that. In his reply it was not apparent that he had in fact investigated the financial implications. But let him at least ask his officials to investigate the matter so that thorough consideration can be given to it. It is a problem which is increasing at present and which causes hardship for many people in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister did not react to the question of manpower either. I had asked him what his standpoint was in regard to the military training of many of the young men in the service.</p>

<p>But surely the hon. the Minister has a standpoint. If the hon. the Minister feels that he does not want to talk about this, I shall not carry the case further. I shall introduce the matter to the Minister concerned on another occasion. From the point of view of the Railways I believe that misuse is being made of our manpower. The Railways are being asked to do without employees of theirs for periods of one year and in some cases for ten and 16 years after that because of military training. Everyone concerned in this matter, will testify that the time of those persons is not being utilized as effectively during the training period as could be expected! I shall not discuss this any further. II is also the standpoint of the Opposition in the interests of the Railways. Although the hon. the Minister will not talk about it, we can only hope that he will discuss the matter with his colleague or the Cabinet.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I am very glad. The hon. the Minister says he is going to persevere; he is therefore going to persevere with the injustice towards the domestic consumers of fuel. The profit on the pipeline was R20 million last year. One would expect that it could contribute R52 million or even more as a result of the addition of new pipelines. In general it is the Railways that benefits from that. However, we feel that it is a strain on a section of the population and that it is a strain on the production costs in our industries and on the distribution of our consumer goods through the trade in South Africa. It is a fact which has an influence on the production costs of the goods which are used by people. There are other methods of obtaining the money. We do not want only the people of the Witwatersrand and of Transvaal triangle to benefit from that. It can go to the consumers of petrol in the whole interior of South Africa. At the moment I do not have the time or the desire to say more in this connection. We shall however have to return to it if something goes wrong and a better government does not come into power after the 22nd April. Then we shall have to raise the matter again. We shall have to point out the tremendous portion of the cost of each gallon of petrol which goes to the State and to the Railways. It is out of proportion and exorbitant. We shall continue to raise pleas in spite of the fact that the hon. the Minister has already said what his reply is. I want to make it clear that it is a policy of the Opposition that this benefit should go to the consumers of petrol, and that it could be used, <i>inter alia</i>, for the construction of roads and freeways in our cities. It would solve the problem. It is absolutely necessary. It is unfair that the people of the coast should be the only ones to benefit from the fact that this pipeline is so profitable.</p>

<p>There is a final question which I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. His reply was not very clear. When can we expect to get further information or reaction in connection with the report of the Marais Commission about the co-ordination of transport in South Africa?</p>

<speech by="#der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since I just want to speak about one specific matter I shall no doubt be excused if I do not react to the previous speaker&#x2019;s speech.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that one is compelled to speak about something one would prefer to remain silent about. This is the position I am in this morning. During the second-reading debate on the Railways, repeated reference was made, sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly, to the bus disaster in my constituency. I say again, out of a feeling of piety, commiseration and almost holy respect towards the broken-hearted parents who have remained behind, I would rather not speak about this. However, I feel myself compelled to do so. This dreadful disaster took place, not only within the boundaries of my constituency, but also on the outskirts of my own hometown, Meyerton. The 23 children, young boys and girls who were on the threshold of their lives and who fell like green corn before the sickle, are children who grew up before my eyes. These broken-hearted parents who remain behind are my voters whom I know by name. If the hon. members who touched upon this matter had known the circumstances, the background and the people as I do, their feelings of piety would have been deepened and they would have preferred not to have spoken about this. There is, for example, the case of a father and mother who had four small children, two girls and two boys. This is a well-to-do father who probably looked forward to one or both of his sons possibly following in his footsteps one day. After the disaster only the two girls remained. They were seriously injured and taken to hospital. There is also the case of a father and a mother who only had two children, the elder 13 years old and blind, and the second, who came along seven years later, without any physical defects. After the disaster the second youngster was no longer there. The parents, therefore, have only die first youngster left. Many of these people are not well-off. Their greatest asset was their small children. In a few cases their only assets were their children. Those have now been taken from them. Had you known that, you would have been able to understand how it hurt me to hear it referred to casually here in a political debate.</p>

<p>What are the actual facts and what is the actual background? That is why I am compelled to speak about it. I am doing so to put this matter in its true perspective. The Dr. Malan High School, one of the three schools involved in the disaster, which was the most seriously affected had 985 pupils on its register on 28th January, 1970. 700 of them go to school each morning and return home in the afternoon by bus. It is indeed a proud record for all of us, connected with this school in one way or another, to know that in all those past years not a single accident occurred in this fleet of school buses serving our school and our children each day. But then on 28th January, 1970, after many years, it happened. At five past two in the afternoon that dreadful disaster took place at a railway crossing where there was a very good view for both the bus driver and the engine driver. If there is one person who wished that there had been a flyover bridge it was I, but unfortunately the bridge was not there. This accident was an accident in every sense of the word. It should be clear to us that as long as there are people there will be accidents, because the one factor, human fallibility, will always be present.</p>

<p>But amidst all this sorrow I also saw a ray of light during that dreadful disaster. This was the way in which our people have at their command in a time of crisis an inborn resilience to work, to help and to translate words into deeds. We saw that within 30 minutes there were 17 ambulances on the scene to save what there was to save. Within 40 minutes the scene had been cleared. That evening and that night at the hsopital we saw our Afrikaans-speaking doctors, English-speaking doctors, Jewish-speaking doctors and all roll up their sleeves and work on unceasingly to save those lives that could possibly still be saved. We saw housewives coming along with coffee and tea to assist the parents. We saw undertakers coming forward to provide everything free of charge, a question of thousands of rands. I was then reminded of the inherent strength our people have at their command. In a time of crisis our people have an almost Biblical Samaritan charity, and I thought further that our leaders need not fear the difficult times that possibly lie ahead for us. I thought, too, that when things are going well with us as a nation we fight and argue among ourselves, but when it is dark and times are difficult, as we saw there, one can see the strength of our people, of our nation.</p>

<p>Those unhappy events are past, and we are grateful to know that before the disaster it had already been decided to replace the crossing with a fly-over bridge. We are grateful for that and we look forward to the day when it will happen. That is all past, and what is one to say now. One can express one&#x2019;s deepest commiseration for the parents, one can say <span class="col_985-986" refersTo="page_0505"/>that one hopes that the children who are still sick will fully recover, but I consider it more important for all of us in South Africa to say that in future we shall intensify our human co-operativeness to such an extent that such a thing will never happen again. We in South Africa must all keep watch and pray that something like this will never befall our lovely country, South Africa, again.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Yeoville has expressed the sympathy of this side of the House to those people who were affected by the disaster at Henley-on-Klip. I think it has had the effect that there will be a speed up in the elimination of these level crossings. However, it does bring to mind the change in the public outside, the type of apathy which seems to be growing. I suppose the disasters which we are experiencing all over the world to-day are responsible for the fact that a certain amount of apathy has been born in the minds of the public. If this had happened years ago one could imagine all the towns folk closing the crossing. It once happened at Springs. That is how the attitude of the public has changed. I can only express my sorrow to these people and I just want to say that we must learn from this tragedy and get a move on. I think these crossings should be manned and properly protected where buses and public transport are being used. It is all right to say that the driver bears the responsibility and should stop, but the lives of the children and the lives of the public are worth more than that, and therefore we should take every possible step to see that our level crossings are protected, especially crossings such as these where public transport is involved. I am sure that this school and the other schools where there are traffic scholar patrols, will make it their business to protect these crossings if the Railways or the Police cannot do it. However, I am fairly certain that the hon. the Minister has taken note of the public reaction to what has happened and that we shall see a speedup in the elimination of these crossings.</p>

<p>We listened to the hon. the Minister when he replied to this debate. His attitude was that of a person who is well satisfied. He was satisfied with his Budget speech and after he had listened to us, naturally it was his attitude to brush any opposition aside by saying, &#x201C;we, the Nationalist Party, have done this, we have done that&#x201D;. Of course, that is not so. The Railways do not only consist of Nationalists working for the Nationalist Government. He has come here with claims of what the Government has done during the past 21 years. Actually, all that has been achieved, has been achieved by railwaymen, namely Whites, Blacks and Coloureds. The hon. the Minister has never told us at any time that the Railways as such never make a profit. Although the Administration tries to run the Railways on business lines, they have run consistently at a loss. The Railways are dependent upon the profits which are being made in the Harbours, the pipeline and the Airways. Various speeches have been made here in regard to the division of the various services. In regard to that, we were asked how the Railways would pay if the services were to be split up, and that was not in the spirit of the Union. Of course, when the Union was formed there were no Airways or pipelines, and the Harbours only came in later. We must keep everything in its true perspective as far as such issues are concerned.</p>

<p>We have had a look at the running of the Railways and we are aware of the difficulties. The hon. the Minister has told us of the progressive planning of the Railways, but if one looks back over the past 21 years during which we experienced the shortage of coal when there was a breakdown in the coal service to the Reef, and the trouble with the transport of iron ore to Port Elizabeth, it seems that the hon. the Minister and this Government must be jolted into doing something. For example, it took the Japanese some time to jolt this Government into action to do something about modernizing the Port Elizabeth line and to have an ore-delivery port built in Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The Minister seems to be tied up with Railway red tape and unless he is jolted into action, nothing happens. We saw what happened in Cape Town some time ago when we wanted an oil port. The Minister was inclined to drag his feet but when he saw that the matter was urgent and that a refinery was going to be built here, we had a new basin built overnight. That is what happens; you have to jolt this Minister into doing something. Sir, I want to come nearer home. The hon. the Minister referred to my speech about Montague Gardens line. I thought he knew the Peninsula, but apparently he does not. As you know, Sir, we have a very old-fashioned, out-dated line that runs to Saldanha Bay. In order to go to Saldanha Bay from Cape Town you have to go some 21 miles to Kraaifontein and then come back on to the Malmesbury line, notwithstanding the fact that you could go up the coast by a very much shorter line. During the war years, a line was surveyed to replace this out-dated line; the war ended and this line was never built. Strange as it may seem, after the closure of the Milnerton suburban line and with the building of the present guaranteed line that runs through the refinery to Montague Gardens, the suggestion was that the new line to serve Saldanha Bay should go through there. The potential of Saldanha Bay was seen then. Admittedly this line at the present moment is a branch line; it is a guaranteed line which has now been extended to the refinery. On top of that, there was a suggestion from the former member for Maitland&#x2014;the present member for Maitland is apparently not very interested&#x2014;in this House that the big township of Bothasig which was developing there could be served by this line.</p>

<p>Furthermore, beyond the refinery, another large township is going to be built shortly; <span class="col_987-988" refersTo="page_0506"/>thousands of people will be housed all along there; and with the development of these areas and with the development of the big atomic power station further on, one would have thought that the Railways would do something about building a modern line there, instead of forcing people to go to Kraaifontein on their way to Saldanha Bay. The Saldanha Bay line is completely out-dated. The Vredenburg line, which carries a large amount of coal and other goods to the big fishing factories, is actually a branch line. The train has to back into Vredenburg because the Vredenburg station is on a branch line. Sir, I know this area well. I happen to have served there during the war and I know the importance of this whole area. The hon. the Minister, for some reason or other, has his eye on Richard&#x2019;s Bay. The Richard&#x2019;s Bay line and the Richard&#x2019;s Bay harbour will serve their own purpose but this harbour of ours for the West Coast could and would open up this area. One can visualize large steel works being situated in Saldanha Bay at some future date because it is in the vicinity of the big ore concentrations in the Northern Cape.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he is not tied to a 3' 6" gauge line. The Japanese are not tied to their 3' 6" gauge lines; they have built the most wonderful passenger service lines of very much wider gauge. A line to Saldanha Bay to transport ore should be of very much wider gauge. Sir, the hon. the Minister has been in Office for about 21 years; I think he must be just about tired of it; possibly he wants to get out and retire, and I would like to say this to him. Let him ask himself during his retirement after the 22nd of April whether he has done all he could have done for the S.A. Railways: whether he is as progressive as he pretends to be? I know that he runs his railway service well.</p>

<p>I do not know whether he is &#x201C;verlig&#x201D; or &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D;. I do not know what his position is in the party but I know that he is very powerful. He was able to decide that we would have a general election: I do not know whether he fixed th&#x201C; date but apparently he is a very powerful man within the party framework. (Interjections.] Unfortunately I do not attend their meetings, so I do not know the inside story. However, to come back to the Railways, in every debate on railway matters throughout the years the hon. the Minister has told us about the shortage of labour, but at no time has he been able to put forward a scheme to this House to overcome this labour shortage. We have never had any scheme from the Nationalist Party to overcome the shortage of labour. They have, it is true, reintroduced our immigration scheme, but that alone is not going to overcome this shortage. What are they going to do? It is not good enough to say that the private sector is in competition with the Railways and that the private sector is able to offer better salaries. That is rubbish. As far as professional men in the railway service are concerned, the Railway Administration will have to wake up otherwise they will lose all their top professional men. They must bring the salaries of professional men and their working conditions into line with those prevailing in the private sector. We cannot afford to lose these people. What is happening is that our best, top-line men in the railway service are leaving and going to the private sector, and what does the Railways Administration do? They have to give contracts to private firms to get their work done and the men who originally worked for them then come back and do the work for the Railways on contract.</p>

<p>The Railways must realize that if they wish to retain the services of their top-line men they have to treat them well and pay them well. Do not let us have this continuous plea that the Railways cannot compete with private enterprise. After all, the opportunities offered in the railway service and the fringe benefits are really first-class. All that is needed to retain these people is a little bit of imagination and a business-like attitude. As far as labour generally is concerned, Sir, the one fear of the Government is that the black man is going to take over the white man&#x2019;s job. We have produced figures here to show that that has been happening in fact under this Government; you cannot help it and the hon. the Minister is not ashamed to say it. He consults with the unions and gets their permission to employ non-Whites and the unions know what is happening. Sir, the hon. member for Yeoville has said that it is high time we re-examined the whole position as far as the various grades in the railway service are concerned and that we found out how we can uplift the white man in the railway service and give him a better job. Sir, let us make economic use of the population of this country. Where are we going to get the labour that we require? Or are we continually going to say that there is a manpower shortage? We must face the fact that we have to live with this problem and that we have to solve it. When the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has had his way&#x2014;if he lasts as long as that&#x2014;and the Government has divided up this country into separate states, the Railways will have to be run entirely by white people. We simply do not have the population to do it. The Minister has never told us how he intends to run the Railways when all the Bantu are in these eight Bantu states.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>We must face the fact that that is their policy. When that happens, where is he going to get the white people to run the Railways? Sir, when you go to the docks in Cape Town you find white men <span class="col_989-990" refersTo="page_0507"/>on the tugs doing work which normally in other ports is done by Blacks. Why must we waste that valuable white manpower? Is it not time that we re-evaluated these particular jobs and filled the vacancies in the railway service?</p>

<p>Then I want to say a few words about the Disciplinary Code. The hon. the Minister shrugs off the complaints in this regard. Evidence has been brought here concerning various cases. One does not like to read out letters in this House concerning individual cases, but there is this feeling amongst railwaymen that they do not like the administration of the Code and they feel that something should be done about it. The hon. the Minister talks about having to compete with commerce and industry. Let him ask our big national industries whether they have a disciplinary code that is applied in a similar manner as in the Railway Service. Of course not. You could never retain any of your employees if you applied the disciplinary code which the Railway Service has at the present moment. Sir, the Code is not applied by judicial Officers; it is applied by people who have no judicial experience and who has the power to penalize persons charged before them. I brought a case to the hon. the Minister where a person was penalized for having been a minute late. There are other cases where promotion has been withheld from people. You have too many people in the Railway Service to-day walking around with a chip on their shoulder because they have not been able to get on. Railway servants, in order to comply with the disciplinary regulations, have to go through the prescribed channels in submitting their representations, on appeal and many of these people are not capable of doing it on their own. They have to sit down and write out the whole history of their case, usually in long hand. I have read numbers of these case histories. These people have no idea of the way in which the Code is administered, and very often when you have read the case on appeal submitted by them in writing you find that they have not been able to put their evidence properly to the Administration. Surely if the Code is to remain, something should be done to assist these people to put their cases to the Administration. You find that people who have been in the service for years are fined for some contravention and de-graded. They cannot afford to lose this money. They have wives and families to support and they cannot afford a reduction in their wages. I wonder whether the Minister realizes the terrific financial penalty that he inflicts upon some of his servants for the most minor offences. Does the Minister realize what a terrific financial burden he imposes upon a man who is fined R25 or R30 and de-graded on top of that? This sort of thing would never happen in a civil court. The individual who has been penalized in this way never seems to have any redress. Sir, these are the items that are worrying the railwaymen; these are the things which will turn the railwaymen against this Government. As I said in my Second Reading speech, it is up to us to build up the morale of the railwayman. Let them feel proud once more to be railwaymen. Let us get back to the position that we had in the good old days where railwaymen were proud to be railwaymen. The hon. the Minister reminds us from time to time that he served on the footplate; he is proud to have been a railwayman, but things were different in those days. To-day when you talk to a man who is on the footplate he tells you that he cannot wait for the day when he retires. I have often talked to these people and asked them whether, if they could choose their career all over again, they would join the Railway Service and the reply invariably is: &#x201C;That will be the day!&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I would like to make a plea to the hon. the Minister with regard to railway-men who have retired and who wish to come back again, not so much because they like the Railways, but because they have been trained for that specific job. These people find that it is not so easy to get back into the Railway Service again. They have to fill in an application form and they have to have certain qualifications if they wish to be re-engaged. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could not streamline the procedure as far as the reemployment of railwaymen is concerned. Even younger people who have left the Service and who wish to return are put off. There have been cases, admittedly, where young members of the Service who have kicked over the traces and have been dismissed and have sought reemployment but the Railway Administration decided not to re-employ them. I feel certain that in many of these cases the people concerned have learnt their lesson and they are now anxious to come back again.</p>

<p>Why do they want to come back?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>They want to come back because that is the job in which they have been trained. They have been railwaymen for a long time and they have had no other training. As you know, Sir, a railway clerk, for instance, is trained in a particular way. That is why these people want to come back. After all, they have to earn a living and they must have a roof over their head. These are the things to which the hon. the Minister should give his attention if he wants to solve his labour problem. But, as I said, the Minister has not come to this House with a blueprint telling us what he intends to do about this. He has never told us how he is going to succeed in running the Railways with White labour once the Bantu states have been created. He has never been able to tell us where he is going to get this white labour. Are we going to become a small state with a handful of Whites? Then we will never be able to run the Railway Service that we have to-day. Behind the Minister&#x2019;s political facade, he is an understanding person and he realizes that he has to face up to the facts and make the best possible <span class="col_991-992" refersTo="page_0508"/>use of the population we have here to-day. I would say from Press reports the he is powerful enough and he should tell the Cabinet and his party: This is my plan; this is my blueprint in regard to the Railways, and if you do not like it, find another Minister, but I cannot run the Railways under those circumstances, without having the labour available. As a former Minister of Labour he knows that there are clauses in the Factories Act protecting workers against overtime. They are most strict on these items, but on the Railways he allows his staff to work excessive overtime to the detriment of their health. The Factories Act particularly protects the workers against excessive overtime, and in the industrial agreements they take a very strong view about this matter. They even restrict overtime to 10 hours a week, and if you want to exceed that you have to get the permission of the local industrial council. But the hon. the Minister of Railways just carries on. But he has to face up to the fact that he cannot go on like that indefinitely. If the Railways are going to continue with the growth he anticipates, he has to ask himself where he will get the staff, and if he has the staff, how will he use them. That is one of the things he has to do. We can say that over the 21 years, in spite of this Government, this country has prospered, but the Railways have just jogged along. We had to jog them into building a pipeline and we have had to jog them to do this and that, and we had to jog them to give the staff better salaries. The Minister said in his speech that he is always prepared to meet and to help the railwaymen, but we know that we have had a railway debate in this House and at the same time railwaymen have also been sitting in conference with the Minister&#x2019;s staff in Cape Town asking for higher salaries and the Minister decided not to give them a rise. And when the railwaymen threatened to take strong action, he came to this House with a Bill restricting them from taking that action. We know all that. Do not let the Minister pretend that he has not had to have his arm twisted very hard by the railwaymen and the railwaymen know that. When you talk to them outside, the railwaymen say they know Ben Schoeman too well, and unfortunately that lowers the whole morale of the service.</p>

<p>At the present moment you think they are all paid well, but they cannot live on an overtime economy. If the overtime disappears tomorrow you will see that a lot of people will absolutely starve, and people who have been living on a higher standard should not be asked to lower their standard of living. And that is the trouble. The hon. the Minister has created an overtime economy and he has to face up to the fact that there must be some sort of consolidation of overtime with wages when it comes to reducing their salaries. I would say to the Minister and the government: Let them come forward with a blueprint for their labour policy on the Railways, to show how they will overcome the difficulty, and what they intend doing when they break up this country into separate Bantu states. Where are they to get the labour to run the Railways then? Are we going to bring the Bantu in on a temporary basis, as migrant labour? Let us hear something concrete from this Government. Do not pretend that you have done so much in 21 years when you have done nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>I have just listened to the hon. member for Salt River, who has apparently once more tried to make political capital out of the Railways. He spoke continually of this manpower shortage, but we surely know for a fact that there is a manpower shortage in this country. Surely the hon. the Minister has repeatedly stated very clearly that for the interim period the Railways was doing everything possible, and that through additional mechanization of the Railways we can indeed expect this manpower shortage, this string the United Party has now got to strum on, to be solved effectively in due course. All these people think of is solving this manpower shortage by pushing in non-Whites, and they say so themselves.</p>

<p>Just this morning the hon. member for Yeoville stated here, very clearly and straightforwardly, that it was the only solution, and we say that it is not. I expected this large-scale courting of the railwaymen to take place here before the election, but we Know the railway people very well. We have contact with them. I myself was a railway doctor for many years and I know those people intimately. I may as well tell the United Party that they would do as well to save their breath because they will not be able to exploit these so-called grievances of railway people, as they would like to do.</p>

<p>But let us have a brief look at the so-called grievances. I would be the last to say that all the railway people are altogether satisfied. On the contrary, then I am not recognizing the human element present in any department as a matter of course.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that it is not 25 per cent; it is not 5 per cent, and I know what I am talking about. I want to say that because there is of necessity a manpower shortage here, the Railways is inevitably very dependent upon its senior officials to get the best out of each employee, and the railwayman was not found wanting. He tackled this task, which he saw waiting for him in the Railways, with enterprise, and to-day we can merely attest to the tremendous work these people do, under difficult circumstances in many respects and without a murmer. On the contrary, I think that in many respects the railwayman is also glad of <span class="col_993-994" refersTo="page_0509"/>the privilege to supplement his salary by overtime.</p>

<p>Our railway system in this country is a nationalized system and I want to tell you that to-day it is indeed one of the things of note throughout the world that a transport system that has expanded, as our Railways has done, can operate on an economic basis. I want to mention that there is no place in the world where such a transport system really operates economically, and I think that we can only thank the hon. the Minister of Transport for setting us this pattern throughout the years according to which this system could function.</p>

<p>Now I just want to put forward another matter which also links up with the so-called manpower shortage that is now being puffed up to such an extent. I should like to ask hon. members to make a point, on some occasion, of going to see how the C.T.C. system, the centralized traffic control system, works. That is what the Railways has created for us in this country. Since this system came into operation the Railways have in consequence employed between 50 and 60 less people on a short section of line between Newcastle and Volksrust. This is one of the ways in which we shall solve the manpower shortage. The hon. member for Salt River tried to create the impression that there was nothing but a decline in respect of the planning and modernization of the Railways. I want to tell you that in this country to-day we have some of the most modern systems in the world, where a responsible official can sit at a switchboard and see how the trains move on the panel, and through the manipulation of small knobs control one train after another with greater safety than 50 to 60 staff members. I think we can be proud of the Railways for having been so far-sighted as to establish that system for us.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to a few remarks which I made here in respect of grievances. I want to tell you that when I was elected to the House of Assembly I made a point of going into any possible grievances thoroughly. The hon. members opposite have now tried to make political capital out of quoting me when I mentioned the matter at the National Party congress. I just want to say that this bit of political capital they have tried to make out of that is not worth the effort, for the simple reason that the National Party ascertained for itself that all the channels for dealing with grievances exist, that these are among the best channels in the country and that the channels through which grievances can be dealt with in the Railways are even better in many respects than those in the Public Service. While I was in Pretoria to see the hon. the Minister about certain problems, I also ascertained that there were no fewer than 21 cases of Railway people of the lowest grade having the right to appeal even to the Minister himself. I ask you what other system in the world gives the man on the lowest grade and with the lowest wage the right to appeal to the highest authority. These are the actual facts. [Interjections.] Those hon. members want all the discipline in the railway system to be broken down, so that they may say once more: But what are you doing now? But we shall not allow the discipline in the Railways to be broken down altogether, and the present system of discipline is welcomed by the railwayman. That is my experience of this matter.</p>

<p>But we have a sympathetic Minister and we know that we can go to him with each of these problems, and the railwayman knows this to be so as well. I want to ask the United Party to mention a single instance where a man did not have the right to appeal by way of all these channels. On the contrary, I think the hon. the Minister is probably one of the most popular Ministers in his Department, and the railwayman speaks of him with the greatest esteem and respect.</p>

<p>To-day I should also like to express my appreciation to the Department of Transport in respect of the improved medicinal facilities and the medical services which we have received in the last few years. I want to say that to-day the railwayman is in the fortunate position of having one of the best medicine lists that any medical aid fund or other body could offer its members. In earlier years it was thought that medicines obtained in the Railways were not of the best, but I want to tell you that the Railways&#x2019; medicine list contains all the modem antibiotics, steroids and everything one needs in this modern day and age. I would still like to see what other medical aid fund offers its members the same facilities as this Railway medical aid fund does. It is only right that in this debate we should note this fact with appreciation.</p>

<p>Sir, allow me also to mention another small matter. We in Newcastle are now on the threshold of great development. There are great developments taking place in the Northern Cape. Near Richard&#x2019;s Bay there is large-scale planning in progress. The hon. the Minister pointed out that the railway line from Vryheid to Richard&#x2019;s Bay was now in an advanced stage of completion. However, the question now arises whether the Department of Transport is going to give greater attention to rail connections in the Northern Free State and Northern Natal, particularly with a view to this development. We hope the Department is already planning this to a certain extent. At Frankfort recently a conference was held at which various interested bodies came together to discuss the merits of such a request. It appears that a great need exists for such rail connections in those areas, because inevitably, as a result of the development in the Vaal Triangle and in Northern Natal, one can expect transport bottlenecks to develop. I do not want to claim now that I should act as a railway planner. I am mentioning this matter because I think that it justifies our serious consideration. Sir, we should like to conclude by saying that we &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall not deal at length with the hon. member who has just spoken. We all know that he represents a Natal constituency. I think that many of us will agree that, during his speech, he very often went off the rails. Being a member from Natal, that is not surprising, because the whole Railway department is going off the rails in Natal, according to a reply I received from the hon. the Minister this morning. He indicated that in the latest year for which statistics are available, there were no less than 118 derailments in Natal. Now we have had the 119th one in the speech of the hon. member for Newcastle.</p>

<p>Sir, I stood up to issue a protest against the lack of action on the part of the Railways Administration in regard to the appalling state of affairs on the Witwatersrand, where there is a concourse, during peak periods, of Bantu labourers, and where totally unnecessary accidents have occurred as a result of the terrific pressure of the huge crowds which mass on the bridges across the railway stations during these peak periods. We had an appalling instance of this yesterday. We read in this morning&#x2019;s paper that another three Bantu had been crushed to death at a railway bridge near Industria in Johannesburg. This was a totally unnecessary accident, which could have been prevented. Three people were killed. I believe that 17 to 20 of them had to be taken to hospital. I am quite sure that many others were injured more or less seriously. It is quite clear to me that the facilities at these bridges during peak hours are totally inadequate. There is no excuse for the hon. the Minister, because he has been warned by similar serious accidents in the past. The hon. the Minister will know better than I do what the real reasons are. Are these bridges badly constructed? Was that responsible for the collapse of the railway bridge at Dube? We have had a statement in this regard. Are the bridges too narrow? Why can more bridges not be built? Why treat these passengers in the same way that cattle are treated? Surely they are one of the greatest sources of income to the Railways? The Minister himself has admitted that third-class passenger traffic is one of his greatest sources of passenger revenue in the whole of the country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, have you ever heard anything like that? Yesterday&#x2019;s accident did occur during a rain storm. I admit that, but must the hon. the Minister now put a red skull and crossbones on every passenger bridge for Bantu and say: &#x201C;Unsafe in rainy weather&#x201D;? Must he put a notice up saying &#x201C;fatal during rush hours&#x2014;you may be killed if you use this&#x201D;? What a callous attitude! What an inhuman attitude to say: "Do not do anything about this. There will be rains again. People will be killed again. They will simply have to keep away from these bridges during the rain.&#x201D; Sir, something has to be done about this matter. I demand that the hon. the Minister make a much more intensive survey than he has done of all the stations in the Witwatersrand complex where the danger of these crushes occurring exists, because these crushes can lead to this sorry loss of human life. As we saw again yesterday, this is an unnecessary loss. It is not that the hon. the Minister has not been warned about this. We remember the tragic accident at Dube last year, when several Bantu were killed, and 400 were injured, when that railway bridge gave in and proved inadequate. Surely he should have learnt a lesson? Surely he should have taken adequate steps to ensure that such an accident does not recur? Look at the accident which happened at Jeppes. These things are becoming far too frequent. I maintain that far too little is being done. We on this side of the House have done our duty. We have voted the necessary capital, but the Minister has not been doing what he should have been doing. If proof of this is needed, then it is the accident which occurred yesterday, and of which we heard this morning.</p>

<p>I trust that the hon. the Minister will also ask his officials to go and look at the crush one finds on occasion at the Johannesburg Railway Station. It has been reported to me that there is a crush of Bantu during the peak hours. It is expected that, sometime or another, due to that crush, a fatal accident may occur. I say that I blame the hon. the Minister for negligence. If an accident of this nature occurs again, we on this side of the House, and the country, will be justified in accusing the Minister not only of negligence, but of criminal negligence.</p>

<p>There is another matter I should like to deal with. We listened a few minutes ago to a speech by the hon. the Minister of Finance. We were most impressed by what he had to say about pensions. If the hon. the Minister of finance can use the occasion of the Second Reading of an Appropriation Bill for such a purpose, I should like to persuade the hon. the Minister of Transport to use the occasion of the Third Reading of this Appropriation Bill to say something about pensioners of <span class="col_997-998" refersTo="page_0511"/>the South African Railways. If ever there was a group of pensioners who deserve better treatment these are the Railway pensioners. I know that the hon. Minister of finance referred largely to social pensioners. That is so, but there is a large group of Railway pensioners whose income at the moment is so low that they can be classified with social pensioners. They have a hard life. They have difficulty in making ends meet since the cost of living rose by an unprecedented 3 per cent, as we heard some time ago. These things affect them. Their ordinary livelihood is threatened by a sales tax on everyday necessities. These people are entitled in their old age, in the last days of their lives, to some consideration from the hon. the Minister. That is the second point I want to deal with.</p>

<p>I come now to my third point. When I started speaking I replied to the hon. member for Newcastle and I mentioned the very large number of derailments we have in South Africa. This fact was underlined this morning particularly by a reply which the hon. the Minister gave to me in regard to the number of derailments on the South African Railways during the last financial year in respect of which statistics are available. That year is the year ended on 31st March, 1969, almost a year ago. I would not be surprised if the state of affairs is even worse to-day, but certainly it is a matter of concern when you have to hear from the mouth of the hon. the Minister himself, as we did this morning in reply to my question, that during that financial year there were no less than 451 derailments on the Railway systems of South Africa. That is not good enough. There is something wrong somewhere. I am not blaming the railway workers. As a matter of fact they are the last people who are to blame. They are overworked. I think of tired-out drivers and firemen. I am not blaming them in the least. It is not the personal factor that is to a large extent responsible for the derailments but the hon. the Minister must surely know what the reasons are. Is it the fault of the track? Are the speeds that are maintained too high? Whatever the reasons are, 451 derailments a year is a serious matter. It is a serious matter too when you consider the appalling costs of these derailments to the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, do you know that those 451 derailments resulted in damage and subsequent repairs which cost R916,000; that is almost R1 million which was unnecessarily wasted through these derailments. It is a shocking state of affairs, something which deserves the attention of the hon. the Minister. I am particularly concerned about the figure in respect of Natal, where 118 derailments took place. I do not know what is happening on the Natal Railway system. There are twice as many derailments there as in the Northern Cape and five times as many as in the Cape Western system. It seems to me that when a locomotive on the Natal Railway system goes round a curve, the fact that it and the curve go in the same direction is merely a coincidence. These are matters which have to be investigated and I trust that the hon. the Minister will do so. As my hon. friend said, this is not the time for making political speeches. These are serious issues affecting the lives of the railway workers and the income of the taxpayers.</p>

<p>I conclude by also referring to one other issue, that is the fact that the profits made on the oil pipeline are not used for the benefit of the users of the oil. the petrol and other fuel in South Africa. If there is an overtaxed community it is the taxpayers of the Witwatersrand. They deserve some form of relief, since their transport costs are higher than in 90 per cent of the rest of the country. They contribute more actual revenue for maintaining roads in the country than the people of any other town or city in South Africa. Surely, even if a proportion of the profits made on the pipeline were to be granted to the motorists on the Witwatersrand it would be some recognition of the fact that they are the greatest contributors towards our road system in South Africa and towards tax in South Africa.</p>

I therefore want to conclude with this appeal to the hon. the Minister: Please do something about this matter. He must remember that it was the United Party who drove him to build those two pipelines after he had refused to build them for years and years.

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to set myself up here as an authority on railway and transport matters. I do not need to be one either to react to the requests and discussions from the other side of the House. Firstly I want to refer to what the hon. member for Orange Grove said. He immediately tried to take political advantage of yesterday&#x2019;s events, when a large group of Bantu simultaneously tried to cross a bridge in a rainstorm. If he wants the Railways to plan in such a way as to make provision for the nature and character of the Bantu under all circumstances he would, in my opinion, have to go altogether beyond the limits. I just want the hon. member to realize that one also has to be realistic in these matters. I cannot see how the Railways could plan for such exceptional events. As far as the railway bridge is concerned, technical faults probably crept in and one could perhaps still argue about that.</p>

<p>After that he raised the question of the railway pensioners, and that is something the hon. the Minister will probably reply to. It is probably <span class="col_999-1000" refersTo="page_0512"/>a popular item before an election. The hon. the Minister of finance has made concessions, and now the hon. member for Orange Grove also wants to intercede for railway pensioners. I do not begrudge him this because it is always pleasant to intercede for deserving people. He said that during the past financial year 451 derailments took place, with 118 in Natal alone. I just want to dwell on that briefly. He compared that figure with the figures for the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape. If he were to analyse the traffic there he would find that accidents are in proportion to the amount of traffic on the particular section of line where the accidents take place. It is not because Natal in particular is more poorly administered than other parts of the country. I want to suggest that this is perhaps the reason why the number of accidents in Natal are greater than in other places. But in proportion to the traffic there it is probably no greater than in other places.</p>

<p>He also touched upon the question of pipeline profits. This is a broad policy matter, and I think the hon. the Minister will reply to him about it. I now want to go back to the hon. member for Salt River. I do not think I can simply let his speech pass, because it appears to me as if the salt in Salt River has become quite useless. To say, when one is dealing with an organization such as the Railways with its large staff, that the discipline is too severe and that the disciplinary measures applied are too strict is in my opinion altogether unrealistic and an argument which we cannot leave at that. He must first try to determine the extent of this organization and the size of the staff, at all levels, working there. But now he comes along here and says that the discipline is too severe and that the disciplinary measure should not be applied. How can one maintain so important an organization as the Railways without proper discipline and disciplinary measures. I want to state very clearly that I think that here the hon. member was particularly at fault, even more so than in his plea for a railway line from Cape Town to Saldanha Bay.</p>

<p>I just want to refer briefly to the developments in my own area, the Eastern Lowveld of the Transvaal, where many perishable products are produced and where we frequently also have bottlenecks in respect of transportation. I want to express my appreciation for the excellent service we have had in the past years, while such rapid development took place in that area in respect of our citrus and perishable products intended for export as well as for the local market, including the Cape market. A number of years ago, in the digging season, we had to make use of cattle trucks to transport citrus products. We held discussions and I can tell hon. members that annually in my area we meet many railway officials. I want to make special mention here of the courtesy and obligingness displayed by them to that community. I cannot think that it would be different elsewhere in the country. They cannot always meet all the demands made, particularly by the farming community, because the farming community, I know from experience, can frequently make unpractical and unrealistic demands. But, seen in the light of the tremendous service given us by the Railways, I feel that we have had good cooperation and exceptional progress in that area. The electrification of the main line to Louren&#x00E7;o Marques definitely contributed to that. I also want to mention here the improvement in the passenger service on that section of line. A number of years ago I had reason to complain, but for the past four years I no longer have reason to do so. There has been a very fine improvement in the service there and we have the co-operation of the staff in continuing the improvement. As far as I am concerned we therefore feel proud of the railwaymen in the Lowveld, of whom there are large numbers.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to another argument. Hon. members say that the people are dissatisfied. But I say that a dissatisfied man is a good man. A satisfied man is, in my opinion, a United Party member, because he is going downhill. No one is satisfied with his position and his salary, nor ought he to be. But this is not of such a nature that people will be unrealistic about it and even go as far as to be unrealistic enough to support the United Party, because they do at least display the responsibility and insight to realize that there is nothing for them in wanting to place a United Party Government in power. I do feel it necessary for those hon. members to reflect on that.</p>

<p>I also want to express a particular word of appreciation in connection with the rapid progress in respect of the Metz-Kaapmuiden line which is there chiefly to deal with the exports from Phalaborwa. I am very glad that the Minister mentioned in his speech that there was such good progress. I trust that we shall also get the adjustments there for the benefit of our agricultural products. The present position is that large quantities of perishable products in the Hoedspruit area must go via Komatipoort <i>en route</i> to the market, or via Soekmekaar in the north. There will now also be a considerable improvement in that direction.</p>

<p>However, there is one small matter that I want to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention, a matter in respect of which we are experiencing problems at the moment. This concerns the question of certain types of mechanical refrigerator trucks for the export of avocado pears. As I have said, we have a large export market for citrus products from that area, but the avocado export market is increasing annually. We experienced problems last year. The Lowveld Agricultural Association and the Transvaal Agricultural Union claim that they were promised that a certain number of the L.A.S. mechanical refrigerator trucks would be made available for the export of avocado pears. Then last year they had to make use of the ice-cooled L.A.S. refrigerator trucks. The Perishable Products Export Control Board indicated <span class="col_1001-1002" refersTo="page_0513"/>that the avocado pears arrived here in a very good condition, even in the ice-cooled trucks. But I nevertheless want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that a test of the product here at the docks is not a final indication of its condition because it still has to go overseas. Avocado pears must be transported at a temperature of about 40 degrees Fahrenheit. But if there were to be a fairly substantial increase in temperature for a period, the detrimental effects would not be visible here. Those products still have to go overseas, where it may still take quite a while before they are sold. Then the detrimental effect of a high temperature are first visible. It could very detrimentally influence the marketing of our products from South Africa, since markets to-day are fairly competitive. I do, however, want to mention that the Railways undertook that some of these trucks would possibly be available, but I nevertheless feel that it is important for me to mention it here and to draw attention to that specific point, particularly because organized agriculture claims that a promise was made which was not kept. As far as I could determine these trucks have indeed been brought into circulation and put into operation. But there was such a demand for other products, such as fish, ice-cream, meat, etc., for which these trucks were used, although the avocado pear farmers had envisaged that they would, in particular, be able to make use of them.</p>

<p>I now want to touch upon something else in connection with the Railways in my area, particularly as a result of the tremendous development and the greater production of perishable products and wood. I want to suggest that in respect of long-term development we obtain an alternative to the single railway line to the Witwatersrand and the line to our nearest Republican harbour, Durban. We also export a large number of goods through Lorenzo Marques. I do not want to discredit those people or to offend them, but we find that in respect of our perishable products we do not receive the standard of handling in Loureno0 Marques that we would like to have. They also find difficulty in making available the cold storage facilities they promise us and to have these available at the specified times. We would prefer it if we could perhaps get a better flow to Natal, and if thought could possibly be given to the new harbour at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. It could perhaps be considered now whether a railway line from Barberton via Carolina to the new harbour would not also give very good service. Of course, I feel that because of our obligations to Mozambique we should also bear them in mind, but that we cannot make ourselves too dependent on other people as far as transportation is concerned. Therefore I want to leave the hon. the Minister with the thought that we should give some consideration to that aspect. The transporting of wood from the Lowveld is also increasing annually. It was mentioned to me that it would probably be necessary to lay down junction lines from either Barberton to Carolina or from Graskop to Lydenburg in order to relieve the pressure on the main line. It would perhaps be difficult to double the existing line, hence the idea of an alternate route.</p>

<p>Sir, as an agriculturist I once more just want to emphasize this question of the importance of the transportation of agricultural products for the farming community. I cannot neglect to come back once more to emphasize the very good co-operation we get from officials at virtually every level. Nelspruit is becoming a large transfer centre for products from various parts of the Lowveld. The farmers would like to have their products at the market in as fresh a condition and as quickly as possible.</p>

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the speech of the hon. member for Nelspruit. I think he stated his case very well. He pleaded for the interests of his people and for improved facilities for the farmers in his constituency. I think that this is the duty of each and every hon. member here. I am still waiting for other hon. members of the House to join me in my plea to the hon. the Minister for the reduction in the high price people have to pay there for petrol. This does not apply only to hon. members from the Reef, but also to those from the Transvaal country districts and from the Northern Free State. We all have to pay this burdensome amount, hut we do not hear a word from those hon. members in this connection. I am also still waiting for hon. members opposite to support us in our pleas to the hon. the Minister to care for railway pensioners as well. However, they have not said a word in this connection. As one of my colleagues once said, they are &#x201C;zipped&#x201D; and are not allowed to say anything.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite claim that we are courting the railway people, but it is not necessary for us to do so. Hon. members opposite tell us they can do what they want to with the railway people and that the latter will still vote for the Nationalist Party, but it is not going to work this time. This time they are not going to support the Nationalist Party. The railway people will remember that the improvements to salaries, conditions of service and pensions which took place during the last few years were the result of the pleas of hon. members on this side of the House.</p>

<p>I am actually getting up in order to bring the complaints we hear about, in connection with the Airways, to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. I think we have already had this experience, and from the start I want to say that I think they are complaints that can he rectified administratively. This has nothing to do with the safety of the Airways or with its pilots. I am now referring to complaints we all receive in connection with overbookings and underbookings. <span class="col_1003-1004" refersTo="page_0514"/>It frequently happens that persons with properly booked seats have to wait at airports because an aircraft is full. At times they have to wait for a later aircraft and at times they cannot get away at all.</p>

<p>However, what happens more frequently is that when, days ahead of time, one tries to obtain a seat on an aircraft one must hear that there is no seat available. A few weeks ago I myself wanted a seat on a seven o&#x2019;clock flight. I tried to book on the Thursday, but there was no seat. I tried again on Tuesday morning, but there was no seat then either. I then went to the D.F. Malan airport and did, in fact, obtain a seat on the seven o&#x2019;clock flight. This is understandable, but what is beyond comprehension is the fact that on the same aircraft I counted 19 empty seats which had not been occupied. I am sure that steps could be taken to discourage people who cancel bookings at the last moment. This causes the travelling public a great deal of inconvenience and also causes the Railways heavy losses. On that one flight alone the Airways lost about R700 because seats were not taken up. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister could institute an investigation to determine how the matter could be rectified. I think it can be rectified, it is merely a matter of how to do so. I am thinking, for example, of persons who book seats having to pay deposits which are then forfeited when the seats are cancelled, or of a portion of the fare being forfeited in such cases. However, something must be done to solve this problem. This happens on virtually every Airwavs&#x2019; flight and it is seldom that an aircraft is altogether full. One then hears of other people who tried to get on to that same flight, but who could not do so. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to do something for us in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for North Rand made a plea for cheaper petrol for the Witwatersrand complex as well as for an improved pension scheme for railway workers. I regard this merely as cheap politicking at this stage, and we on this side of the House will not pay much attention to it.</p>

<p>This morning the hon. member for Yeoville spoke in a vein very different from that during the Second Reading debate. In his previous speech he was so aggressive that it seemed as if he would attack someone physically, but today he is altogether docile. He has apparently also learnt his lesson. I want to refer to the Railways as one of the largest businesses in the world. I think it is my duty, on behalf of this House, to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister for what he has done for South Africa&#x2019;s transport. The hon. the Minister is a person who has made a tremendous contribution on behalf of the South African Railways. Just this morning we heard of our economic growth rate of 51/2 per cent per annum. The Railways, in its turn, has kept pace with the economic growth of South Africa. In other words, there is no backlog in the economic growth of the Railways as compared with that of the South African economy. I should like to refer to what the hon. member for Salt River said. He pleaded for the relaxing of discipline among the staff of the South African Railways. Is the hon. member aware of the responsibility resting on his shoulders in this House?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Not relaxation, but for the sake of justice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>There is justice in the South African Railways, just as there is justice in any other sphere of the South African economy. The Railways has its own disciplinary measures and why would there not be fairness? I really think that it is irresponsible to plead for the relaxation of the discipline on the South African Railways. Something like that cannot be allowed or tolerated in this House. This plea is linked to the promises made in this yellow United Party booklet. On page 26 of this booklet &#x201C;You want it? We have it! &#x201D; it is stated, <i>inter alia</i>, that the United Party will ensure that the system of discipline on the Railways will be re-examined to remove sources of injustice and irritation. Where is the injustice and the irritation on the South African Railways? How many hon. members opposite realize what problems railwaymen in general really have? How many hon. members on that side of the House have ever taken the trouble to determine what the position is in respect of our railway labourers. The third United Party policy statement in respect of railwaymen in this booklet reads as follows: No railway employee will be punished for alleged offences once found not guilty of them by an independent court of justice. In other words, it boils down to the argument raised here the other day, i.e. that the so-called bush courts would be done away with. Departmental hearings would therefore no longer take place. I do not think that this is something that can be allowed, and I think that the Railways has functioned very well in the past.</p>

<p>I should just like to mention another matter, i.e. the labour shortage on the South African Railways. Is it not distressing that at a Port Elizabeth congress in 1948 the United Party decided that the white railwaymen should systematically be replaced by Coloureds? Is that not true? Could the hon. member for Durban (Point) reply to that?</p>

<p>Well, then, we accept it. At a later stage we shall prove that it was, in fact, true. This is to-day still the policy and the <span class="col_1005-1006" refersTo="page_0515"/>trend of the United Party in general. They want more and more non-Whites in the service of the Railways. They want to shift the Whites into higher posts and then fill the lower posts, which have consequently become vacant, with non-Whites. Thus they will eventually bring about fully-fledged integration. That is the United Party&#x2019;s policy. That is also why they are concentrating to such an extent on the manpower shortage. Every day they harp on this manpower shortage in the Railways. The manpower shortage is not only being experienced in the Railways; it is a general manifestation in South Africa as a result of our tremendous economic growth and industrial development.</p>

<p>Hon. members spoke a great deal about the railway crossings that must be eliminated. I too would very much like to see this done. In the future millions of rands will be spent on the elimination of railway crossings. On the other hand I want to point out that millions of rands are being spent on the building of roads in South Africa. The better South Africa&#x2019;s roads become the greater is the accident rate. The railway crossings will be eliminated, but accidents will still always be happening. One day I stopped at one of the many railway crossings in my constituency. While my motor car was standing there another motorist drove past me and over the railway crossing without stopping. The primary responsibility rests with the individual driving the motor car. If the public disregards the rules of the road, no law or government can ever do anything about it. The responsibility rests with the public. The public must ensure that they do not act injudiciously at railway or road crossings, because it is dangerous for anyone to ignore these aspects.</p>

<p>I should just like to refer to a few matters in my constituency. Firstly I should like to refer to a very important question. It has already been discussed repeatedly at agricultural congresses and I think that it has also been raised here in this House several times. I should nevertheless like to draw the hon. the Minister of Transport&#x2019;s attention to it to-day. I am referring to the railway junction between Maclear and Matatiele, a distance of 86 miles by road. In the past the agricultural economy offered no justification for the construction of that junction. But when the Hendrik Verwoerd project is completed that area will have to have an outlet. The obvious outlet for this area is, of course, the Natal complex in the east&#x2014;the Hendrik Verwoerd complex outlet will never lie in the south. Neither could it ever be in the north. It can only be in the east, i.e. Natal. I therefore feel that planning should be made along these lines and that a junction should be laid down sooner or later, particularly with a view to a future outlet for the Hendrik Verwoerd complex, the Central Karoo, the Southern Free State and the Northern Cape. This entire area could then be served. The marketing of livestock from certain parts of my constituency, for example Barkly East, necessitates at present the use of railway lorries. These lorries are at our disposal and we are grateful to the hon. the Minister for them. But the roads are in such a condition that the livestock get badly bruised. The weight of the livestock consequently decreases if they are transported along these roads. However, when one wants to make use of the railway service for the transportation of livestock from Barkly East, this must be done via Bloemfontein and Kroonstad to Durban. This is a tremendously roundabout way. On the other hand, Barkly East lies only a short distance from Maclear. Thence the livestock can be transported to Matatiele. This is a very important matter. We shall have to bear it in mind when planning is done for the future, because when the Hendrik Verwoerd project is completed we shall need that junction to serve the outlet in the east.</p>

<p>Another matter I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to is the condition of the goods shed in Matatiele. According to the Durban System Manager the new goods shed was to have been built there in 1969. We do, of course, understand the circumstances. We know, for example, that credit restrictions were imposed and that the Railways does not have unlimited funds. But there is actually chaos at that goods shed in Matatiele as a result of the fact that all the goods received there cannot be stored. I therefore want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister that the construction of a new goods shed be speeded up.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to thank the hon. the Minister, the General Manager and the staff of the South African Railways most warmly on behalf of my constituents for everything they did for us and for what they are still going to do.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if there was one aspect of this debate which will interest railwaymen and those employed in our harbours, it was the continual reference, as the hon. member who has just sat down has made, to the fact that their conditions of employment give no ground for complaint. According to those hon. members, these people have no complaints and the conditions under which they work are happy, and we are merely attempting to make political propaganda by suggesting that there are grounds for improvement. If the hon. member says that I am correct in saying that there are grounds for improvement, surely the responsibility is as much his as mine to raise these matters in this House and to raise them with the hon. the Minister. The hon. gentlemen on that side of the House seem to wish all the railwaymen to believe that, in so far as the Government is concerned, there are no improvements necessary. I think that is what the railwaymen can fairly deduce from the contributions to this debate which we have had from that side of the House.</p>

<p>There is another matter which the railwaymen <span class="col_1007-1008" refersTo="page_0516"/>will notice. That is the agile manner in which the hon. the Minister moved his train onto the side line instead of keeping it on the main line of the accusations which we made against him. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister was giving us a demonstration of the agile use of points so as to avoid any head-on collision with the arguments of hon. members on this side of the House and to get us side-tracked onto some issues which he found suitable and convenient to raise. I say that because I want to come back to one or two matters which I have mentioned to the hon. the Minister; matters which I had hoped would have his attention and which I hoped he would deal with. However, he came back with an attempt to give an entirely different interpretation of what I actually said.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, he started with a somewhat specious argument that I had attacked the efficiency or otherwise of the union executives representing the workers on the Railways. What I in fact said to the hon. the Minister was that the union representatives who put forward the complaints and requests of their members are frustrated by the fact that the only answer they seem to get to most of their representations is that the time is not opportune.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I asked whether you received representations from the union officials.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I had it from the members of the unions to whom their officials had reported as to why these matters had not been rectified. They are then entitled to say that their officials had come back to them and said that they could not get anywhere because the Minister or the heads of his departments said that the time was inopportune. For that reason they come then and see us in regard to these particular problems.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister attempted to indicate that I did not know what I was talking about when I spoke about special overtime allowances. But surely the hon. the Minister knows that there was a regrading and readjustment of the salaries of certain grades in the Harbours Administration. Certain staff were given a special overtime allowance so that they would not have to be faced with a reduction in wages. It was called a special overtime allowance to compensate for what they had been earning on overtime. Many of them are still getting that. I put a very simple request, a very simple statement to the hon. the Minister, namely that the time had come for that special overtime allowance to be incorporated into the basic wages of these men so that it would count for pension purposes. The hon. the Minister pretended that there was no such thing in the service. He tried to suggest and indicate that I did not know what I was talking about. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that there are many employees who are concerned about this matter. It is a similar type of allowance to that which was previously introduced when the cost-of-living allowance for civil servants was incorporated into their basic pay so that they could have the advantage of it when they retire on pension.</p>

<p>A third point which I trust the hon. the Minister will deal with when he replies to this third-reading debate, is the question I raised in regard to the manner in which recommendations of the Pensions Select Committee are dealt with by the Administration. I gave the hon. the Minister one example. He only has to look through the recommendations of the Select Committee on Pensions to this House over the last few years to see what slight and scant regard has been had by the Administration to those recommendations. The hon. the Minister uses the procedure to refer the recommendations of the Pensions Select Committee in so far as they affect railwaymen, to the Administration for attention and decision and then these recommendations do not form part of the Bill which is normally passed by this House dealing with all the other recommendations which have reference to State employees in all other Departments of the State. One wants to know why this procedure is being followed. Why does the hon. the Minister request this House&#x2014;and he gets the support of the House&#x2014;to sidetrack the recommendations instead of giving effect to them when they come from the Select Committee? The hon. the Minister will know that those recommendations of the Select Committee do not come here without a thorough investigation. They do not form part of the report of the Select Committee without having been thoroughly investigated and discussed with the officials of the Railway pensions section. They appear before the Select Committee. I have indicated one case because that unfortunate man has now left the Service due to injuries sustained on duty. But there are many others in the Service who are rankling over the injustices which they feel have been meted out to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we received on our desks this morning the annual report of the S.A. Railways and Harbours for the financial year 1968-&#x2019;69. I should like to deal with one aspect of that report which brings up to date some of th&#x201C; comments which have been made from this side of the House in regard to the staff position. I want to do it because I believe that one is facing a situation in the Railways when, as yet, the hon. the Minister has not indicated any method whereby he intends to deal with this particular problem. I want to read from the report on page 90. In dealing with staff shortages the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despite the salary and wage improvements granted to the staff and the department&#x2019;s intensified efforts to attract more candidates to the Service, the shortage of staff in certain key grades such as station foremen and signalmen, guard, shunter, firemen and driver&#x2019;s assistant continued to be a cause for concern.</block>

<p><span class="col_1009-1010" refersTo="page_0517"/>I mention this because those are, as have been correctly stated in this report, the key personnel without whom the Railways cannot function safely and efficiently. There is no indication in the report as to the steps that are being taken to fill those particular positions. I know that for the advanced technical positions on the establishment of the Railways there are bursaries and opportunities for study which are given to Railway employees. But what plan has the hon. the Minister to fill these positions, these key positions of shunters, firemen and drivers&#x2019; assistants in the Railways. It seems to me that the problem which presents itself, as indicated by this report, is the same one that appears in other industries when there is not a sufficient intake of apprentice staff to replace those on the permanent staff who will be retiring in due course. I think we will be indebted to the hon. the Minister if he could indicate to us what steps are being taken to deal with a problem of this nature. It is not merely a matter of the recruitment of personnel. Is it not really a matter of which one can say that these positions should no longer be occupied by Whites and that they should now be occupied by non-Whites, as is happening in other departments of the Railways? Is that in fact what the Minister sees as the only solution to this particular problem? We would be grateful to him if he would in this debate indicate to us what is being done other than the normal attempts at enlistment of additional and new members to the Railway Administration.</p>

<p>I should like to mention one final matter to the hon. the Minister in respect of which we would appreciate some report from him. One is aware that the reconstruction of the Cape Town docks has been undertaken and phased. The hon. the Minister through his Department was kind enough to give me a 1967 programme as to how that reconstruction was being planned and phased. That appears also fully in the General Manager&#x2019;s report. With the pressure that is building up in the docks in dealing with ships arriving in Cape Town, I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether the programme of reconstruction is proceeding according to plan and within the time limit that has been set down. I understand that there have been certain practical difficulties connected with the reconstruction work. Certain difficulties have arisen which were perhaps not anticipated. It would be reassuring to know that this programme of timing will be adhered to. The hon. the Minister will be aware of the fact that the first stage was due to commence in September of last year. The first stage is to be undertaken in certain phases. The first one was the providing of the new A-berth inside the eastern mole. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give us the assurance that the work is proceeding according to plan.</p>

<p>Then there is another development which, according to my observations, is taking place. This concerns what is happening in and around the Table Bay Docks. Because of delays which do occur, and by that I do not for one moment suggest that the dock staff are not turning around the ships in the shortest possible time they can, and because of the fact that this harbour is still under construction, it would appear that an increasing number of vessels do not enter the Table Bay Harbour area. That is, they do not enter the limits of the Robben Island-Mouille Point line and by doing so they do not have to pay dock fees. However, they are still being supplied from the Cape Town docks area by means of a helicopter service. They seem to make more and more use of this helicopter service in order to keep outside the Cape Town dock area. Is no revenue being derived from those vessels that are being serviced in this way? These ships are supplied in the roadstead at some distance outside the demarcated liability line of entrance to the Table Bay harbour. As I was saying, it is only my own observation, but nevertheless there seems to be an increasing number of ships that are not availing themselves of the Cape Town harbour facilities but are being serviced by this helicoptei service. If this tendency does grow, it can have a considerable and adverse effect upon the revenue which is accruing to the Cape Town harbour. This revenue will be sought after when this additional capital work has been completed. I do not wish to take the matter any further but to inquire what is envisaged and what is the policy in regard to this new method which is developing of victualling ships outside the harbour area.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying to the hon. the Minister that I would like him to specifically deal with the recommendations of the Pensions Committee. I hope it was an oversight when he did not deal with it during the Second Reading and that he will deal with it now during this Third Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I also represent a constituency which has many railway voters. At the same time South-West Africa&#x2019;s economy is very heavily dependent upon the efficiency of the railway network in the territory. One thing has become very clear to me in this debate and that is that I shall not be able to serve those interests to which I referred in South-West Africa by approaching the matter as the hon. members of the Opposition did. I want to concede that the Opposition is correct on two points: firstly, that one cannot seek perfection in the South African Railways, Airways, etc., either. The simple reason being that one cannot establish perfection there. Listening to the criticisms of the hon. members of the Opposition, I felt that the second point I wanted to concede to them was that it could rightfully be expected of an Opposition to be critical in their approach to these matters. However, setting this consideration off against what we actually had, I would have been very offended had I still been a railwayman to-day. In the first place, a great deal of the criticism was devoted, not <span class="col_1011-1012" refersTo="page_0518"/>to attacking the hon. the Minister and his policy, but to attacking the railwayman himself and his performance as an employee of the Railways. Numerous examples were mentioned here which were absolutely just a case of human fallibility and with which the hon. the Minister and his policy had absolutely nothing to do. For instance, examples were mentioned of wrongly consigned trucks that were delayed for nine days. Then there was also the example of a package that went to Windhoek instead of to Durban. Many similar instances were mentioned. This is a complaint against the railwayman and cannot, under any circumstances, be a complaint against the policy of the hon. the Minister and against the way in which the Railways is administered. If the hon. Opposition had come and said that these instances of a truck wrongly consigned, of discourtesy, of a package wrongly addressed, were on the increase on the South African Railways, it could have become a complaint. Then it would have meant that something was going wrong. However, this was not done and in that respect the Opposition has, in my opinion, failed altogether. In other words, they did not lodge a complaint against the administration of the Department and against the hon. the Minister, but they did lodge a complaint against the individual railwayman. They tried to exploit the quite ordinary fallibility of the individual with, I surmise, some or other political objective.</p>

<p>That hon. member who is now interrupting me will not even find perfection on his own farm which he himself manages from day to day. There will be mistakes and there will be disillusionment for him. What does he then expect from the South African Railways and from the Department of Transport? The second aspect of the Opposition&#x2019;s actions which would have shocked me had I been a railwayman to-day is the way in which they stormed down on the railwayman in this debate for the sake of his vote. When a gentleman courts a lady he does so with at least a certain measure of circumspection. He does not rush at her, because she could take to her heels or be frightened. That is precisely what the hon. Opposition did. For the sake of a vote they rushed recklessly at this &#x201C;lady&#x201D;, the railwayman. The hon. members of the Opposition know, in the first place, that if in this debate the hon. the Minister of Transport had offered the railwayman those improved conditions of service, for which they pleaded so assiduously to-day, they would have accused the hon. the Minister of exploiting a Government Department for the sake of votes. In the light of the economic considerations at stake here they would have said that he was disregarding very important economic concepts in the process of that exploitation.</p>

<p>What is their standpoint? They say that the conditions of service of the railwayman must be improved considerably. Overtime must be eliminated; staff shortages must be settled and this must then be done through a considerable improvement in the conditions of service of the railwayman. Sir, I want to make this statement: Even if the hon. the Minister were to improve the railwayman&#x2019;s conditions of service by 100 per cent and to double his salary he would still want to make use of the opportunity to work overtime. It is only human.</p>

<p>If that method of clearing up the shortage is to succeed I would want to know from those hon. members where they want to get the manpower from for clearing up this shortage. Do they want to draw that manpower from the rest of the Public Service? Sir, l want to predict that when we come to the Public Service, to the Department of the Interior, we shall hear the same plea and the same solution to eliminate the shortages there. Do they want to supplement those staff shortages from the private sector? Are they really recommending that in this process the hon. the Minister should bid against the private sector for the labour forces, which the private sector is as short of as the State and its Departments? Sir, you may go to any employer of importance in this country and he will tell you of a manpower shortage, in spite of the fact that the private sector, as we know, already bids higher than the Government Departments. The Government Departments must, of necessity, be the stabilizing factor in this situation in our country. If, as far as salaries, etc., are concerned, the Government Departments were not the stabilizing factor, who would be? Must we expect this of the private sector? The State is in a very strong position to bid against the private sector, but this would not be beneficial, and the railwayman who thinks about this realizes it. In the present economic conditions, inflationary as they are, the Opposition comes along and, without demonstrating any discrepancy between salaries and living costs, pleads for a general improvement of conditions of service. If the present economic trend were to be reversed&#x2014;and it could happen to-morrow or next year&#x2014;and if the present upward trend were to be a downward trend next year, would they come and plead for the opposite to what they are pleading for to-day? This would only be logical. Would they come and plead for a decrease in wages? No, when our economy shows an upward trend they plead for higher wages, but when it shows a downward trend we can, according to what they have indicated here, expect the Opposition to plead for even higher wages. Would this then be consistent? <span class="col_1013-1014" refersTo="page_0519"/>I can lay this charge against the Opposition: If, under these circumstances, they come along to plead for increased wages on the merits they have advanced, they will have to plead for a reduction of wages when the present economic trend is reversed and we have, not a labour shortage but a labour surplus or unemployment. That would be only logical. {Interjection.] I do not know whether the hon. member is trying to tell me that my statement is correct or incorrect; I cannot understand him too well, but I would like to know what they are going to plead for if the present picture is reversed&#x2014;-and it is not unreasonable to expect this.</p>

<p>If there is a manpower shortage, what do you recommend other than an increase of salaries?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. H. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>What I recommend in the case of a manpower shortage is a level-headed approach, such as we have today, and if there is a manpower surplus I recommend the same. In what position are we going to land ourselves if, in order to draw more people, we pay higher salaries and all the other Government Departments and the private sector also do so? The cost structure shoots up and the manpower shortage increases because the economy is being increasingly overheated under the circumstances which the Opposition want to create. Where are we heading then? The railwayman is intelligent enough to know in present-day circumstances the State is the stabilizing factor. He knows that his Minister is taking into account that his salary must keep pace with the cost of living and the responsibilities resting on his shoulders, but he also knows that when the wheel turns one day the public servant and the railwayman will not be dismissed casually and that the State will not lightly curtail salaries, while the man who is to-day flourishing in the private sector, because of the private sector&#x2019;s competition with the Government Departments, must know that the day this wheel turns the entrepreneur in the private sector will not hesitate for a moment to dismiss surplus staff; to drastically curtail the salaries of staff he cannot afford.</p>

<p>The railway worker knows this. Therefore, irrespective of the election and of the rush to court the &#x201C;lady&#x201D; that we have seen in this debate, I feel that I can adopt this standpoint since I also represent a railway constituency: I know that the Department&#x2014;it has proven it repeatedly in the past years&#x2014;take the railwayman&#x2019;s position in respect of the cost of living into account. This is taken into account and adjustments are made periodically, as in the past years. But we also know that the Department adopts an attitude which offers the railwayman security, stability and a future, even when the picture changes and the wheel turns.</p>

The hon. member for Newcastle said that the railway worker was completely satisfied with the system of appeal which takes him direct to the hon. the Minister.

Yes, he was the Railway doctor in Newcastle, and I should like to tell him what some of the Railwaymen in Newcastle had to say about their medical treatment and the whole scheme, including the availability of treatment. I raised it with the hon. the Minister in regard to Glencoe, where there are more than 5,000 Railwaymen and their families, and there is one Railway doctor. The Minister knows it. He knows that the Railwaymen will sit in the consulting room for hours and when the doctor has to give up late in the evening, people have to go home without having been attended to; and he is a first-class doctor, but he is a human being. He is the railway doctor and the district surgeon and the medical Officer of health at Glencoe, and he has to treat all the complaints of the railwaymen at Glencoe. This is the hon. member who says, having been a medical Officer on the Railways, that he knows how satisfied they are. I have taken it up through all the channels available. I have pleaded that the Glencoe railwaymen should be allowed to go to Dundee, where there are many doctors, because they cannot always get medical treatment available at Glencoe.</p>

Does this hon. member expect us to build two hospitals, one at Dundee and one at Glencoe? Anyway, the hospital is right on the Glencoe side of Dundee, so it is probably not even five miles away. I ask whether that hon. member or his party have made any representations for a hospital at Glencoe. I challenge him to name any occasion on which he or his party has asked for a hospital at Glencoe.

<p>Yes. Does that hon. member deny it? That shows the colour-blindness of that hon. member. When he thinks of railwaymen, he thinks only of white railwaymen. The 80 per cent includes all races, but of the Whites it is 64 per cent. There are 64,000 railwaymen earning less than R200 a month, and 12,000 earning less than R100 a month, which is slightly better than the position was three years ago, when 93,000 were earning less than R200 a month. I ask any hon. member on that side of the House to tell me how a person can rent a house and clothe, feed and educate a family on R200 a month, and maintain the standard of living which is expected of a country with the riches South Africa has; and R200 is the maximum. Mostly the basic wages are between R160 and R180 a month. That is where the large mass of that group falls. Then we will be told yes, but look at the overtime they earn, and all the Minister says is that there is a job to be done and they must get on with it. Sir, I made a mistake in the Second Reading. I spoke of somebody who was working 130 hours a week. Obviously I meant 130 hours a month&#x2014;130 hours overtime. What does that mean to the family life of a man? But there is no answer from the Minister except a shrug of his shoulders and he says the work has to be done and they have to do it. Our case is that if you are making demands of that nature on people, then they deserve recognition for what they are doing, and the railwayman is doing the work and he is making that sacrifice. But he has to live at an unnatural tempo and work unnatural hours, and it has an unnatural effect on his whole life. The hon. the Minister gave no answer other than a shrug of the shoulders in regard to the problem of overtime and low wages, the first of the four factors.</p>

<p>When it comes to the question of discipline, it is on record and it stands in Hansard, and we will use it, that Government members state that railwaymen are perfectly satisfied with the disciplinary system. I want to deal, firstly, with the one case with which the Minister dealt, the only point on which he replied to what I had to say in the Second Reading. His reply consisted of personal abuse and then he dealt with the one point. I leave the personal abuse aside; we are getting used to it from that hon. Minister.</p>

I want to say, and it stands on record, that the Minister accepts that the opinion of an official shall be the basis on which a man may be fined.

It is not only the legal position, but it is what js done in practice, that an official can determine on the evidence placed before him by the railways police or by some other complainant.

I am dealing with the principle of punishment in the opinion of an official and I say it is wrong that an official in his opinion, without hearing evidence and without investigation, should be entitled to come to a decision.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No investigation was held. No hearing was held. That person did not state his side of the case. Whatever the reason for his leaving may be, that is his business. The fact is that he was not heard. This is typical of the attitude of this Government in so many fields: &#x201C;We will determine what is right: we will do what we think is right and we will try you and we will act as prosecutor and as judge, and we mil act as policemen and we will sentence you and we will act as gaolers and <span class="col_1019-1020" refersTo="page_0522"/>we are not interested in the rights of individuals.&#x201D; If the hon. the Minister of Transport has a claim against a person, he has machinery for it. Why did he wait seven months before taking disciplinary action? Why, if a crime was committed, even after the person resigned, did he not charge that person with committing a crime? If a crime is committed there are courts. He claimed that theft had been committed. Why did he not lay a charge of theft with the police, because theft remains theft, whether the person is a railway servant or not. Sir, the answer is that Railway justice is a different sort of justice from court justice, which is the justice which is granted on the basis of the traditional approach of South Africa to the rights of an individual. Railway justice appears to be different. The hon. the Minister and his department did not charge the man. They simply fined him administratively in their own right.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to spend all my time on that case. There have been many others. We have stated, and it has not been proved otherwise, that punishment for minor offences is becoming a bone of contention and a course of dissatisfaction in the Railways. Petty offences are being treated with far more severity than they should be. Last year I said this and the hon. the Minister jumped on me from a dizzy height. He challenged me to quote cases. Unfortunately for him I could quote cases of people being punished for refusing to do overtime work, and of people being punished for late arrival at work after they had done long stretches of overtime and had had only a short time off. In this House, for political reasons, the hon. the Minister attacked us. He attacked me and he attacked others, but what did he do then? He has now accepted that our case was justified. An instruction has been issued that people shall not be charged and disciplined for reporting late for duty. In other words, we were right, but for political reasons the Minister attacked us in the House. Now seven or eight months later an instruction has been issued as an experiment that action should not be taken in terms of disciplinary procedures against people reporting late. That is our duty as an Opposition, but I want to go further and say that when we are the Government in April, we will see that true justice is brought into the Railways. [Interjections.] If the hon. the Minister or any members on that side of the House have trouble, I am sure that we shall have jobs as wheel tappers for them. I think we shall be able to find the sort of job for many of them where one has to go around tapping wheels with a hammer. They will then make another sort of noise out of those wheels.</p>

<p>One of the other complaints I only dealt with at the end of my speech is what I call administrative bureaucracy. I mentioned to the Minister that 23 servants of the Railways had had their status changed. In the process they did not lose a single day&#x2019;s service, but simply because their status was changed, they were penalized and have not yet received their double Christmas selection bonus. These were I.C.C.&#x2019;s&#x2014;intermittent casual clerks. I addressed the Minister in this House for five years in connection with these people, and every year he pooh-poohed me, until eventually he took action and did what I have asked. Those intermittent casual clerks who were suitable had their status changed to temporary staff last year. After being given the status of temporary staff they continued to do the same jobs without a single day&#x2019;s break. These people had not served a full year as temporary servants, so they were not paid their Christmas bonus. Is that the sort of fair play in the Railways? Two people received their bonuses and 23 did not. If the hon. the Minister wants the details, I shall give them all to him. In terms of weekly notice No. 4384 of 24th November, 1969, which deals with the conditions of their transfer, they had to do 313 shifts, I think it was. but because they had been transferred during the year and had continued to do the same work in the same Office with no break at all, they were classified as not being entitled to their bonus. If they had stayed as I.C.C.&#x2019;s they would have received the bonus and if they had spent the whole year as temporary staff, they would also have received it. However, because they changed their status during the year, they were penalized. The matter has been referred to the System Manager and to the General Manager. What is happening is that a bureaucratic argument is going on, and nobody will make up his mind. The result is that it is now February and that, since November, 23 people have been denied what is their right. That sort of issue the hon. the Minister does not answer. He can tell me that I am full of wind, but he cannot deal with facts. However windy it may be for the Minister, it is that sort of gale that is going to blow him out of Office in April, because he will not listen to the reality of the problem.</p>

<p>If it does not happen, it will be a sad day for South Africa, because South Africa deserves a change. It deserves better than it has at the moment. I raised the question of the promotion system. It is interesting, Sir, that we are told that the Government is always right. I remember the hon. member for Yeoville some years ago questioning the promotion of a certain person who had been jumped up way above other people. The hon. the Minister got up in the House and said: &#x201C;You do not know what you are talking about. This man has been promoted on efficiency. He is a first-class man. He has all the qualifications. He is being promoted because of pure ability and efficiency. That is why he has jumped over all the others.&#x201D; Last year, Sir, a very senior position became available, almost at the fop. I challenge the hon. I the Minister to deny that that certain person <span class="col_1021-1022" refersTo="page_0523"/>came to him for an interview because he did not get the job.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I shall send the hon. the Minister a note. I think he knows about this. This is the sort of thing that happens. If the Minister wants to defend his action in promoting someone, he says that that person is outstanding, but when it does not suit him to do so, he says that the applicant does not have the necessary qualifications or the necessary ability for the position. I have now quoted an example of someone at the top. This sort of thing happens at all levels. One of the things that causes dissatisfaction is that people so often act in a higher position than the one they are in fact occupying. Sometimes they receive acting-in-grade pay, but sometimes they do not. However, when such a position is filled, it is filled by someone from outside, who supersedes them. I have had cases where people have acted on and off for more than half their careers in higher positions. Then somebody is brought in from outside and promoted over them. I quoted, for instance, the case of the sailor in the harbour service, who was a deck helper. This person sometimes acts in as high a position as master, but he cannot be promoted because he does not have the seniority. He eventually left the service after two years of pure frustration, then found that he was at heart a seaman and that his life was on the water. He then returned to the service. He has now had another two years service, but he does not have any chance of promotion because others with more service are brought in. They do not know the work and he has to teach them, but they get the position.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Windhoek said that one could not bid against private enterprise, but the conditions under which people work also make a difference, ff we acceded to the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2019;s request and subsidize rentals, it would make a big difference. Here I have a letter, dated 6th February, which I received yesterday in connection with a case I was dealing with.

<p>In the same house I am living in now. The hon. member once again spoke about the pensions. He again pleaded for a non-contributory pension scheme. Sir, I really cannot understand the United Party now. They recently have had a great deal to say about the so-called credibility gap. This is another word they have borrowed from America, for while President Johnson was president, all the newspapers referred to his credibility gap. This is where they got it, but now I want to refer to the credibility gap of the United Party. The hon. member for Yeoville pleaded here for a non-contributory pension scheme for railway workers, but in this yellow booklet of theirs they plead for &#x201C;a national contributory pension scheme free of the means test&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<p>A national contributory scheme, as recommended to the previous government by the Sullivan Committee, will cover everybody. In a speech the hon. member himself said that the pension schemes had to be combined. He advocated this himself. He himself said that it was so easy to have a non-contributory scheme for the whole country by combining all the pension schemes.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If this is not the position, if such a scheme will only be for social pensioners, I do not know how it will function, because all of us will be old one day and those who comply with the means test will be able to apply for an old age pension, whether or not they were railway workers. Even those railwaymen who receive pensions to-day, are receiving supplementary allowances in order to bring their minimum income up to R100. Those people would then be excluded from the scheme advocated by the hon. member according to this yellow booklet.</p>

<p>The hon. member should merely try to understand this correctly. They say that the old-age pension scheme should be a contributory scheme, not as it is to-day where there is no contributory scheme and pensions are being paid out of the Treasury. They say all the aged should now contribute to that scheme in the beginning.</p>

<p>The young people have to contribute, but surely they will be old one day. The trouble is that those hon. members do not know what they are talking about. The contributory scheme includes everybody. The object of a contributory social scheme is that when a person reaches a certain age, he has to receive a pension. Is this the case?</p>

<p>In other words, he must have contributed to this scheme over a period of years and then he receives his old-age pension, unlike the position to-day where he receives it from the Treasury without having made contributions. They want to change this. They say that every person in this country who is a worker, has to contribute to that scheme. They did not say that railway workers or public servants would be excluded. Every worker has to contribute to that scheme, and when he reaches a certain age one day, he receives a pension, whereas at present elderly men and women receive pensions which are paid out of the Treasury, without their having made contributions for that purpose in the past. That is the difference.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It concerns the Railways because the railwayman is also entitled to a free old-age pension to which he did not contribute anything.</p>

<p>Quite correct.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>These hon. members are now saying that he must make contribution in respect of that pension, but not in respect of his railway pension, because that will be noncontributory-In other words, in order to receive a railway pension one day, he does not have to pay contributions for that purpose, but in order to receive an old-age pension, he must in fact do so. That is what they are advocating. Those hon. members have never given proper consideration to this matter; otherwise they would never have come up with this scheme. [Interjections.] I should very much like to argue this matter with the hon. member when there is time; at the moment we do not have the time to do so.</p>

<p>Now I come to the question of a non-contributory pension scheme for railwaymen. The hon. member said that it should not be a contributory scheme, but that it should be converted into a trust fund. After all, any pension fund must be sound actuarially. In asking for this, the hon. member does not know what he is talking about. The only fund which is not sound actuarially, is the parliamentary pension fund, because it is paid out of State revenue and if there is a deficit, it will be made up. Any fund must be sound actuarially, otherwise one has to contribute in order to make that fund sound. The latest finding of the actuaries is that, after the latest increases that were granted last year, there is an actuarial deficit of R396 million in the present Superannuation Fund. That is the position.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>*The MINISTER The hon. member&#x2019;s trouble is that he talks about matters of which he has very little knowledge. His trouble is that he is too superficial He has never investigated any matter properly. He refers to a noncontributory scheme. In other words, the State has to accept the responsibility for all deficits that may arise in such a fund. The State has to make all the contributions and ensure that pensions are paid out of that fund. That is what they are asking for.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, does the hon. the Minister want to deny that actuarially a pension fund is based on the idea that if the undertaking is abandoned, there should be enough money for paying out pensions. May I also ask the hon. the Minister whether he thinks the Railways will go out of existence?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from><span class="col_1025-1026" refersTo="page_0525"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If this were the case, the Railways would never have appointed actuaries to examine the Fund, and yet this has been done all these years. This is not the only basis on which an actuary examines a fund. They also take into account what the future obligations of such a fund are going to be. They take these things into account and they base their actuarial report on them. I repeat that the hon. member has not given attention to this matter. They are making all sorts of promises whilst they do not investigate the matter properly.</p>

<p>I want to mention another matter merely to show how little thought they are giving to the matter. The hon. member said that the Act of 1951, in which provision was made for widows whose husbands retired from the service before 1951, might also receive pensions. Once again he failed to remember that in 1951, when this provision was made, it was also provided that the contributions of the members of that fund had to be increased by 2-) per cent. For Heaven&#x2019;s sake, how can these husbands who died before 1951, now be asked to make a contribution of <i>21/2</i> per cent so that they may again qualify in some respect or other. This is indicative of the way they investigate matters, and then they still come along with all sorts of promises.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>How many people are involved?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The number of people involved in this, is 5,000. I have dealings with the members of that fund, and that fund is controlled and administered by the staff itself. The Superannuation Fund Committee makes recommendations on what is to be done, but the hon. member wants to go over their heads. They are so concerned about the workers, but they nevertheless want to deprive the workers of the right to decide about their own fund. That is what it amounts to. I hope that in future the railwaymen will take note of this.</p>

<p>In addition, the hon. member spoke about the housing rebate scheme again. Such a scheme would be a very fine thing, but it would cost a lot of money. The staff association has not asked me again to introduce such a scheme. I have only been asked by the Opposition to do so. I do not make promises before an election, and therefore I am saying now that I am not prepared to introduce it. As far as it is financially possible. I would rather provide my railway people with housing at low rentals, and I have already indicated that the Railways suffer an annual loss of R10 million on these departmental houses. In other words, a subsidy of R10 million is granted to those railwaymen who live in departmental houses. They must also bear in mind that at present it is not only railwaymen living in departmental houses who are enjoying this benefit. What about the house ownership scheme? They did not take this into account at all. In terms of this scheme loans at an interest rate of 4 per cent per annum are being granted to railwaymen, and at present thousands of them are living in such houses. That story with which they came forward to-day, i.e. that merely 20 per cent of them are receiving assistance, is therefore the biggest nonsense in the world. This simply is not the case.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member can place that question on the Order Paper and I shall reply to it then.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member once again raised the pipe line story. The question here is not whether we are making a profit of R22 million on the pipe line. A very important principle is at stake here. If I am to abandon the fundamental principle of rating, i.e. what the traffic can carry, and take into account the actual cost of the transport as well, it would mean that the Railways would have to reduce all its rates in respect of high-rated goods. Over all these years it has been the position that high-rated goods have to help to pay for all those goods which are transported at low rates and on which losses are often suffered. This is a principle which has been a generally accepted one ever since the Railways came into being and not only of late. Pipe-line transport is high-rated transport. That money is used, in turn, to subsidize the low-rate goods &#x2014;such as agricultural products, foodstuffs and coal conveyed to the Cape&#x2014;and to help to make it possible for the Railways to transport them at a loss. Therefore, apart from the amount which is fixed, it is a sound principle. As one says in English, &#x201C;what you lose on the swings, you make on the roundabouts&#x201D;. That is why I am not prepared, in spite of all these pleas made by the Opposition, to give consideration to reducing the rate on such pipeline transport. That money is urgently necessary for helping the Railways so that lowrated goods can in fact be conveyed.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Salt River, I can only say that I am not prepared to follow him on all those devious routes where he wants railway lines constructed. The hon. member again spoke about the disciplinary code, as did the hon. member for Durban (Point). I wonder if these hon. members really know what the disciplinary rode is. It is not a code that has been established or instituted by this Government. It has been there since 1910. I shall explain the system <span class="col_1027-1028" refersTo="page_0526"/>to the hon. members. Any servant who is guilty of disciplinary infringement can be charged in terms of the Act. That is an Act that has not been introduced to-day. It has been in existence for many years. He can be charged. If found guilty, he is punished. When he has been charged, he has the right in certain circumstances to ask for an inquiry. There is no such thing as a court. Then an inquiry is held. In certain cases of disciplinary infringement an inquiry must be held. In certain others a servant who is charged, has the right to ask for an inquiry. If that inquiry is held, witnesses are called and evidence is given. The disciplinary Officer sends a report to the head of the department to say whether in his opinion he finds that man guilty or not. Then the head of the department decides to mete out the appropriate punishment to that particular employee. When he receives notification of punishment, he has the right of appeal. He can appeal to the disciplinary appeal board on which he is represented. The chairman is a judicial Officer from outside the service. He is usually a magistrate.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In any case he can appeal, if he wishes, to the disciplinary appeal board. On that disciplinary appeal board he is represented. If the disciplinary appeal board&#x2019;s finding is unanimous and accepted by the head of the department, there is no further appeal. But he also has the right to decide not to appeal to the disciplinary appeal board, but to appeal to the head of his department and then to the General Manager. If he is not satisfied yet, he can then appeal to the Railway Board. If it is a case of dismissal, he has the right, together with his representative of appearing personally before the Railway Board, to plead his case. That is the procedure that has been in existence, not since to-day, but for all the years since the Railways was established. I have received no complaints from the staff organizations in regard to the disciplinary code. Of course, every man who is punished is dissatisfied if his appeal does not succeed. Those are the people who complain. That happens. It will always happen. I want to say that the Railway servants are more privileged than the civil servants. There is no system of appeal in the Civil Service, none at all, whereas the railway servants have the right of appeal. They have the right to appeal in regard to promotions. They have the right of appeal in terms of the disciplinary code, either to the Appeal Board, or to the Minister eventually and the Railway Board. They can appear personally in the case of dismissals. This is the procedure which has been in existence, not since this Government came into power, but since the days when the United Party and other parties were in power. The staff organizations accept that. Of course there is dissatisfaction. Obviously many appeals do not succeed. Possibly the majority of them do not succeed.</p>

<p><span class="col_1029-1030" refersTo="page_0527"/>The hon. member for Salt River spoke about young people wanting to come back again after having been discharged or having left for other reasons. We take them back unless their records are so bad that one really cannot take them back. There are many of them wanting to come back who have been in the service five or six times. We still take them back even then. Very often they have been discharged for serious offences. But after they have rehabilitated themselves, we give them an opportunity again of coming back to the Railways.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Newcastle said that some attention had to be given to a new railway link between the Free State and Natal. Attention is given to all these requests, but at the moment there is as yet no justification for spending many millions of rands to construct such a new railway line. At the moment there is, of course, the link which goes through Bethlehem to Danskraal.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Nelspruit, I may just say that 400 of these mechanized refrigerator trucks have been ordered. We hope that when delivery takes place, it will be possible to make more of them available to the farmers, especially those in the Lowveld area.</p>

<p>He also said that we had to give thought to a railway link between Barberton and Richard&#x2019;s Bay. This is once again a question of whether or not it is economically justifiable. We may not construct railway lines which are not economic. But any railway line which will in fact be economic&#x2014;in other words, which will at least be able to cover the working costs and the interest on capital&#x2014;will always receive favourable consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand referred to over-bookings on the Airways. This is an old complaint. This is done by all air-lines, and the reason for this is that the approach of the passengers is totally different from that of passengers on trains. As regards the Airways, they think they can book and then stay away. If they stay away until after a certain time before the departure of the aircraft, they are penalized. But there are scores of them who stay away in spite of that penalty. After all, the aircraft cannot fly half-empty; consequently it often happens that people simply do not turn up whilst there are others who could not secure seats, and that when such persons reach the aircraft, they find that there is quite a number of empty seats. But sometimes it also happens that there is so much freight to be conveyed that certain seats have to be left empty. I know this is a problem and we are trying to surmount it to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Aliwal spoke about a railway junction between Maclear and Mata-tile. This is once again a question of whether or not it will be an economic undertaking. We should very much like to provide this junction if the traffic on this route will in any way cover the working costs and the interest on the capital expenditure. As regards the goods-shed at Maclear, I want to say that I shall go into the matter and that I shall ascertain when the construction on a new shed will be commenced.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Green Point said that the Employers&#x2019; Union was frustrated about the fact that when they make representations I turn them down. That union did not make representations in regard to the particular matters which the hon. member raised. The Federal Council of Railway Staff Associations made representations to me, however. This council is not the union, but the union is represented on the council. I want the hon. member to get his facts right. I turned their representations down because I said the time was not opportune. The hon. member again insisted that there is such a thing as a special overtime allowance. There is no such thing as a special overtime allowance and the hon. member&#x2019;s facts are completely wrong. The hon. member has heard something about it, but he does not know what it really is. What I think the hon. member was referring to is a standard wage enhancement that is paid to certain grades. That is paid to servants when we revert from a daily-paid to a monthly-paid system. There is no such thing as a special overtime allowance and I want the hon. member to remember that when he goes back to the people who complained to him. He must tell them that he has heard the right name for what they have in mind, namely a standard wage enhancement.</p>

<p>I replied to that matter in my reply of the second-reading debate. Servants are paid 11/3 their normal rate for overtime and they want their pension contributions based on their basic salary as well as their overtime. I have explained to the hon. member why it cannot be done. The hon. member also wanted to know why I do not accept the recommendations of the Select Committee on Pensions in regard to certain cases that came before them. I had very good reasons for doing that. The Select Committee on Pensions is informed by my department why they are not in favour of a special petition succeeding. In spite of that the Select Committee might make a recommendation.</p>

<p>I have to run the Railways and I cannot create precedents. Very often the recommendations of the Select Committee can create precedents, the consequences of which I cannot foresee. I would like to give an example in this regard. In the past the Select Committee on Pensions has frequently recommended that the service of a servant with broken service should be linked up. If I agree to that I will create a precedent and open the door. I cannot possibly accept such a recommendation. That is the reason that when recommendations of this nature come before the House I move that it be referred to the Government. In other words, it is a nice way of turning it down.</p>

<p>I am also very sympathetic towards this man. Does the hon. member think that I deliberately rejected the Select Committee&#x2019;s recommendation because I do not like the man? Surely the hon. member realizes that I only act when I think it is the interests of the Administration not to accept the recommendations.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about ships lying in the bay which are victualled by helicopter. He asked if the Administration could not get revenue through this service. I am afraid that we cannot, because we have no control over it.</p>

<p>I have dealt with the disciplinary system to which the hon. member for Durban (Point) referred. The hon. member also made a very serious attack on the Sick Fund. The hon. member spoke about one railway doctor for 5,000 railwaymen at Glencoe.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know what the hon. member said. I am not taking him up on that. The hon. member also asked why these railway servants could not get to doctors in Dundee. I take it he means private doctors.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>Private and provincial doctors.</p>

<p>None.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member tells me that he is continually in contact with railway-men and surely they must have told the hon. member at one time or another that the Sick Fund is controlled by the railwaymen themselves. Does the hon. member not know that? Does he not know that the Minister has no control and no say over the Sick Fund? Does he not know that the Sick Fund appoints their own doctors? Does he not know that the Sick Fund decides where doctors must be appointed? Does he not know that there are local Sick Fund boards and also a Central Sick Fund Board with overall control? Does the hon. member not know that the Sick Fund makes recommendations as to the amount of contributions that have to be made by railway-men? Does he not know that they take disciplinary action against railway doctors if it is necessary? In other words, does the hon. member not know that the railwaymen control their own sick fund? The only time the Minister comes into the picture is when there is a deadlock on the Selection Committee in regard to the appointment or the dismissal of a certain doctor, and then he must act as arbitrator. The only other time the Minister comes into it is when he has to agree to increased contributions.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, but surely they are also railwaymen? It is not the Administration that is represented, but the management. Does the hon. member not know that there is a difference between the Administration and the management? I and the Railway Board are the Administration and the General Manager and his officials are the management. Does the hon. member not realize that the General Manager and his officials are also railwaymen? Of course they are. Hon. members opposite plead for the railwaymen on the one side and on the other they attack them. The railwaymen administer their own Sick Fund.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know. It may be. The Sick Fund is administered by railwaymen themselves. The hon. member may be right and I do not deny it for one moment. If the hon. member wants to blame anybody, he must blame the railwaymen. It is their fund and they administer it. They have to decide if there should be another medical district. They can decide if they want to appoint additional railway doctors in Glencoe. The hon. member&#x2019;s complaint is therefore against the railwaymen he purports to represent.</p>

<p>The hon. member again spoke of the Meyer case. If Meyer wanted to clear his name, he should have remained in the service. It was not seven months after the disciplinary infringement that this servant was charged. He was charged immediately on the basis of the Police report. In a similar case he would probably have been arrested. He was charged immediately, after which he said that he wanted an inquiry. That inquiry <b>was arranged, not</b> seven months later, but two months later on the 13th November. The offence was committed on the 17th September.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, the offence took place in May.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The offence took place in May, but he was charged on the 17th September. He was, therefore, charged four months later and that was done to ensure that no injustice was done to him.</p>

<p>After everything is completed and all particulars have been gone into by the officials concerned, such a person is charged. This man was charged on the 17th September. When he received his charge, he said that he was not guilty. So it was arranged that an inquiry would be held on the 13th November, two months later. If the hon. member reads the Service Act, he will see that certain periods are allowed within which appeals must be lodged, in which charges must be made, in which the servants concerned have their right to say that they are not guilty and that they want an inquiry. In this case an inquiry was set down for the 13th November. Then he complained of a headache and took leave from the 13th November to the 28th.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This man was found guilty and charged. He was given the opportunity of an inquiry to prove his innocence. However, he made excuses because he did not want to appear before the inquiry. Eventually he resigned because he knew he was going to be punished. All these years the position has been that when a man resigns in order to avoid punishment or to avoid being charged, he is penalized as this particular man was penalized.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In this Bill a total additional amount of R9,797,350 is being requested to make provision for increased salaries and overtime rates for Post Office officials which were granted last year, for price increases, increased rentals and maintenance costs, the costs of telecommunication apparatus on order which could not be delivered during the previous financial year, speeding up of the Department&#x2019;s expansion programme, and other additional expenditure which will have to be incurred during the present financial year. R8,613,200 is needed for additional operational expenditure and R1,184,150 for additional capital expenditure.</p>

<p>Details of the additional amounts required under the various heads of the Estimates, appear in the Estimates of the Additional Expenditure, which has been laid upon the Table.</p>

<p>It is probably not necessary for me to elaborate any further on the details at this stage, except perhaps to explain that approval for the 12 new building operations for which nominal amounts of R50 each were requested, is now necessary in order to prevent delay in calling for tenders for these works.</p>

<p>Of course I can also discuss the reasons and criticize them not so? The reasons furnished by the hon. the Minister are in my opinion completely inadequate.

The reasons advanced by the hon. the Minister here are in my opinion completely inadequate. More money is being requested here, but the hon. the Minister does not explain precisely how that money is going to be applied. I want a complete statement from him in this connection, for we are spending a great deal of money on this Satellite Communication System and on our membership of COMSAT. This is a good thing. We support it, but we want more information in this regard from the hon. the Minister. How is this additional amount going to be utilized? Is it simply money which is being thrown down the drain and from which we are going to derive no benefit? What benefits are we going to derive from this additional amount of R62,000.

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, of course it is here in fact that the achievements of the Post Office during the present financial year in respect of the expansion of our telecommunication services are reflected. The hon. member will know <span class="col_1037-1038" refersTo="page_0531"/>that last year we had R39 million with a view to spending on our telecommnication services. Then R52 million was placed on the Estimates in respect of the present financial year. That amount has been exceeded. Despite the fact that the expansion programme for the present financial year was increased by 33 per cent, it was nevertheless exceeded by the amount as indicated. The total amount in respect of telecommunication expansion consequently totals R54.2 million. This was brought about chiefly as a result of an acceleration of the telecommunication expansions. Then, too, there is still equipment on order which could not be delivered during the previous financial year. Provision has also been made for higher prices of materials, as well as for labour saving devices. This also represents part of the expansion which has to be paid for.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that the increase which is being requested has something to do with the acceleration of the communication expansion. Does he mean by that the acceleration in the reduction of the shortage of telephone services in this country? Surely not. The hon. the Minister must furnish a better explanation of what precisely this means. The additional amount being requested now brings the total up to R52 million. According to the financial statements of the Post Office up to November, the hon. the Minister was not really spending each month what had originally been budgeted for. Does this additional amount which is being requested mean that we have the assurance that that R54.262.200 will really, or virtually, be spent on this particular item? I should also like to know in regard to sub-head No. 4 in respect of buildings, where an increase of R600 is now being requested, whether the total amount of R7.619.550, or a more or less equivalent amount, will be spent on buildings. In this case as well the figures indicate that up to November an average of 50 per cent of the amount which had been voted had been spent.</p>

<heading>PNEUMOCONIOSIS COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday I asked the hon the Minister whether he could not give us the reason why he has differentiated between the two classes of pneumoconiosis sufferers, namely those suffering from a disability between 20 and 50 per cent and those above 50 per cent. Those above 50 per cent are going to get a further 20 per cent increase in their pensions but those below 50 per cent will only get a 10 per cent increase. The hon. the Minister gave us the reasons and said it was because he was much more sympathetic towards those people who are unable to work on the mines because of their disability. He thought that in those cases he ought to give them a 20 per cent rise whereas the miner with a disability up to 50 per cent can still work. For that reason he was not entitled to get the same uplift in his pneumoconiosis pension. I want to remind the hon. the Minister again that the reasons for giving the pension in the first place are twofold. In the first place he is being compensated for his dis ability. The second reason is that increases in the disability pension come about because of the stresses and strains that that miner has because of the continual rise in cost of living. Now. the cost of living for the man who suffers from a disability of 20 to 50 per cent rises in the same way as it rises for the man with a disability of 50 to 75 per cent and more.</p>

<p>I cannot understand the reasoning of the Minister. He is firstly compensating, and differentiating, the disability because of the extent of the disability. That we can understand, but where it comes to a rise, surely the rise because of the circumstances which prevail at that time, must be the same. If he says to the House that those people suffering from a disability of 50 per cent or more are basically going to receive more money because of some reason, I can understand it, but he is giving a general increase in pensions. He says that the man who is suffering from the same disease but to a lesser degree, is going to get less rise in pension. I am not satisfied with the Minister&#x2019;s reply and I wonder if he would not reconsider this position at a later stage. As the Minister knows, we cannot make any amendments at the moment, but I should like to ask him to reconsider this position. Perhaps he might find it possible to make the increases on a uniform basis for all the miners suffering from disability, so that all dependants will enjoy the 20 per cent increase.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I gave the reasons yesterday during the second-reading debate on this Bill. I may just remind the hon. member that the pensions which are being paid at the moment and which have been paid over the years are also differentiating. The person who is certified as having between 20 to 50 per cent disablement gets a much smaller pension than those who are certified between 50 and 75 per cent and over. Therefore, the differentiation is inherent in the whole system as we have known it over the years. In regard to his plea that I should reconsider this at a later stage, I must say that I have certain difficulties which would keep me from doing so even if I was prepared to accept it, which I am not. That means we have followed the practice over the years to consult with the mining houses if a change is considered necessary, because they are also affected. I followed that practice very scrupulously also in this particular case. I think it would be totally wrong to agree now to something which has not been discussed in full with the mining houses.</p>

<p>I want to make the point again that it is only right and proper, and it should also be done in future, that if a global sum is available, it should first be seen to that the widows and the orphans of the deceased miners, and those who are prohibited by the Act to work in a mine and who cannot earn the living they have earned before, get the better deal out of the amount of money available. I may say that I have discussed this matter with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union and they have full sympathy with and understand my point of view. If the hon. member reads <i>The Mineworker</i>, their official organ, of last week, he will realize how happy the miners are and how grateful they are for what we have done in this particular case. They fully accepted the fact that this one category, those who must earn their full living on the mines, should be given a 10 per cent rise while the others get a rise of 20 per cent. Therefore, I am sorry, but I cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestions for those very reasons. I think that we are very fair to those who need it most.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry to say that, although I can see the point of the hon. the Minister as regards the practice that if you have a global sum available, it should be used to the best advantage, I do not agree with him that by doing this he is necessarily using it to the benefit of the greater number of the people. Last night the hon. the Minister explained that these post-mortems usually reveal microscopic evidence in the lungs and I accept that part of his explanation. In other words, these are the people whose disease was overlooked in life and who <span class="col_1041-1042" refersTo="page_0533"/>later were examined post-mortem. It does not follow that their disease was overlooked because it was microscopic. It frequently is but there may be extensive degrees of the disease which are not recognized in the person who is still alive. The fact that the man himself was suspect to the extent that a post-mortem had to be carried out on him, shows that he had at least complained. I do not know whether the post-mortem was carried out because he was a miner or an ex-miner or whether the post-mortem was carried out because he had complained to the bureau and was suspect although not having been granted a pension. The assessment of his working capacity is relative because it depends on clinical grounds and it does not necessarily follow that it is accurate. A man may have much more disability than that found by the bureau. Under those circumstances I can easily see that there are many cases or could be many cases where it would be justified to provide the little extra that my colleague is asking for.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I now fully understand the Minister&#x2019;s difficulties in acceding to my request. Following upon what I have said, could the hon. the Minister then tell me how long pneumoconiosis sufferers would have to wait if they were in the 50 to 75 per cent disabled category and have to go into the next category? Will such a person get an amount which he is entitled to if it is found that he has been in a different category? In other words, the border lines between the categories must be so fine, as it was explained by the hon. member for Stilfontein. that you sometimes find a person who is 49 per cent disabled getting a 10 per cent increase, or his dependants are going to get it, whereas if he had been 50 per cent disabled he would have been entitled to a 20 per cent increase. If such a person goes for an examination, there is a six months&#x2019; interval, at least, between the examinations and what I want to know is. what happens in that interim period? Say a person goees for an examination in January and is certified as 49 per cent disabled, but when he goes for another examination in June, he is certified as being 51 per cent disabled, what is going to happen during that six months interim? Is he still only going to get the 10 per cent or will he go into the higher grade? I am trying to get as much as I possibly can for the miner who to-day classified under 50 per cent. I want him to get as much as possible and for that reason I say that his classification should start at his previous examination and not at his immediate examination.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to the point raised by the hon. member for Durban (Central) I would point out that a postmortem examination of all deceased miners is compulsory. It is laid down that the cardiorespiratory organs of any miner who dies, of whatever cause, must be forwarded to the Pneumoconiosis Research Institute, and that is why these cases where there is a microscopic presence of pneumoconiosis are picked up. The post-mortem is not done for any other reason. I think this is a very important point, because our miners have the absolute assurance that a post-mortem will be carried out. It is also, of course, of great assistance in the research work that is going on continuously at this particular unit, which I think is doing wonderful work in the interests of our mining community. So the point made by the hon. member that there might be much more discipline is not a valid one, I think, because during his lifetime the miner is examined periodically as a matter of right. He can go to the Bureau and ask to be examined, and as a matter of right he can also take the report of his house doctor and even the house doctor himself along to testify in his particular case.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville would like to know how long it takes for a person certified to be 20 per cent to 50 per cent to move into the next category. There again it is laid down in the Act. He moved into the next category, as far as the amount of money payable is concerned, from the moment of certification. It is also laid down that there is no such thing as back-pay. That applies to all cases. It is the only practical way of doing it. But there again the miner goes up for periodic examination and of right he is entitled to these examinations and to the whole procedure which is laid down. I should like to take this opportunity, since this matter has been raised, to make an urgent appeal to miners all over the country to avail themselves of these examinations, because there are miners who neglect to go to the Pneumoconiosis Bureau. This is to their own detriment, so I think they should take note of the discussion that we have had here and make quite sure, in their own interests, that they go to the Pneumoconiosis Bureau periodically for examination.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<block name="quote">A separate record shall be kept of any benefit or amount or part of any benefit or amount which has not been disposed of under subsection (1).</block>

<p>This disposal of the amount is something which I think needs investigation. I wonder if the hon. the Minister could tell the House briefly what methods are used to trace the pneumoconiosis sufferers in this category specifically and to inform them exactly how much is due to them and whether any funds have accumulated for their benefit. I want to say that it is no good putting this sort of notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> because the average person does not even look at the <i>Government Gazette</i>. How would the man know that <span class="col_1043-1044" refersTo="page_0534"/>he was entitled to an amount of money which the fund may have on his behalf, or how would his dependants know?</p>

<p>That is the important point, because we have the difficulty of tracing these people. Yesterday the hon. the Minister told us that in his opinion it was good and sufficient to leave it in the hands of the Department of Bantu Administration and that he was satisfied that they would carry out the investigation and dispose of the money in a proper and reasonable manner. I want to read out to the Minister what the Auditor-General had to say about this; he said under the heading &#x201C;Benefits to Bantu labourers: Financial Statements&#x201D;:</p>

<block name="quote">The Secretary of Mines has now informed me that since it is apparently impossible for the Department of Bantu Administration and Development to comply with the provisions of section 84 of the above-mentioned Act, as amended, the Act will be suitably amended.</block>

<p>I will not repeat this when we come to clauses 5 and 6. What other methods can we use to ensure that the Bantu knows that he is entitled to go and collect his money? I say that some sort of document ought to be given to the Bantu when he leaves the mine. He will be informed in this document which he carries with him that he must go to the commissioner. He will have the details in this document. What is happening now, I think, is that some of the Bantu working in the mines do not know, when they return to their homelands, that they can go to the commissioner periodically. They are lost sight of while the money owing to them is accumulating. The Auditor-General has remarked on the fact that the disposal of this money has not been satisfactory. Perhaps the Minister could give us his ideas on this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Together with the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, I paid specific attention to this matter during the recess last year. I want to draw the hon. member&#x2019;s attention to the fact that this clause 4&#x2014;and the same applies to clauses 5 and 6&#x2014;resulted, as he said quite rightly, from the observations made by the Select Committee on Public Accounts in 1968. But this relates only to the bookkeeping system, and we are now rectifying it. The second point is that there are no accumulated funds with the Department of Bantu Administration. The arrangement is that we make advances to them from time to time. As regards the question of payments to the Bantu, I can assure the hon. member that I am extremely impressed by the way in which Bantu Administration is handling this matter purely and solely in the best interests of the Bantu. The Bantu is entitled to a certain lump sum of money, whatever it may be. Hon. members can appreciate that if this were given to the Bantu in one payment, it would be wasted. Before leaving the mine, he is notified that he is entitled to it: he is aware of it, and he has been identified by Bantu Administration. They know where he is going. It is therefore not a question of tracing them; the Bantu comes forward of his own accord, because he knows that he is entitled to certain moneys. Bantu Administration then arranges for this money to be paid to him in certain amounts according to his needs in the area in which he may be living, so that it actually takes the form of a pension. In certain cases, where such a Bantu for example wants to build a house or buy cattle, a larger amount, according to his needs, is made available to him on a single occasion. I am just giving hon. members these details in order to show that in this regard great care is exercised in the interests of the Bantu. I want to assure the hon. member that this amendment is merely aimed at rectifying the bookkeeping, etc., and that there is no accumulation of funds. In regard to the Bantu, those in our neighbouring states as well, I just want to add that our arrangements are such that the money is paid out there, or, in certain cases, here; it varies from state to state. The arrangements are not exactly the same. For example, we do not have exactly the same arrangement with Zambia as we have with Malawi. But the money is paid out in consultation with the various states. Although the Bantu are entitled to the money here, it is usually paid over to those states. The Bantu is aware of this; he knows where to go; he is identified and the money is paid out to him there according to the best judgment of the persons who know his needs. I want to give the hon. member the <span class="col_1045-1046" refersTo="page_0535"/>absolute assurance that we have given this specific matter the closest attention in the very recent past.</p>

<p>There is just one slight alteration I should like the hon. the Minister to make in the Other Place perhaps. Sub-section (2) reads that whenever the Bantu Affairs Authority discovers a Bantu person who is entitled to any benefit, certain things must be done. I think this word &#x201C;discover&#x201D; is a bad word. You do not discover a person. I think we should rather use the word &#x201C;find&#x201D; or &#x201C;locate&#x201D;.

I recommended that the Minister should consider giving to that widow, or the dependants, a pension of not less than two-thirds of the amount which would have been given to the widow if her husband died and was suffering from 20 per cent to 50 per cent disability. I do not want to elaborate on it. I think it is a matter which could perhaps be pursued further. I feel strongly about it.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to the implications of this clause, because if you look at it you will see that not only may the ex-miner unfortunately have had pneumoconiosis, but he may have had tuberculosis as well in some instances. This is more serious and should justify something being done for the widow, because after all the miner, while alive, did not receive any compensation for his tuberculosis or his pneumoconiosis, but I am emphasizing the tuberculosis aspect of it. Tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis together constitute an extremely serious illness. To pay the funeral expenses is. of course, a gracious act to the widow and the children.</p>

<p>I am talking about the medical expenses, because I want to emphasize the seriousness of having the two diseases together, and how much more compensation the man would have been deprived of by the fact that it was not discovered earlier. That is what I really want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to, namely that he must not overlook the gravity of this situation merely because in some cases, in fact in most cases, the discovery is only made by means of a microscopic test. Tuberculosis, anyhow, is a very grave illness, particularly when it was not recognized during life. Then it was and remains an even greater threat to the man&#x2019;s family.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>May I point out that this clause merely deals with funeral costs. Those widows or dependants who after the amending legislation of 1965 got the one sum because the husband was found at the post-mortem to be suffering from pneumoconiosis to the extent of less than 20 percent were not entitled after 1965 to the R170, as it was then, and which is now R180. for funeral costs. This is merely to put it right so that they will also benefit. In other words, it is an extension of this particular question of funeral costs, and that is all this clause deals with.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>We will support this clause because it merely gives the Bantu Trust authority to utilize this money for the purpose of taking over townships from the minucipality and to take liability for the housing loans which the municipality has incurred. I think a discussion of this would probably be more proper under clause 2, and therefore we will not oppose this clause.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>We have no objection to clause 2; but at the same time I should very much like, during <b>the course of </b> this short discussion in Committee, to get from the hon. the Minister what exactly he hopes to achieve by this clause. In his second-reading speech the hon. the Minister said, <i>inter alia</i>, that in implementing the policy of the Government it is desirable for these townships to be incorporated in the homelands. I would like him to tell us what exactly he hopes will be achieved in the furtherance of their policy in this regard. Of course there are two types of townships mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister in his second-reading speech, namely those Native townships which were in the homelands and which were convenient for serving urban areas situated in the white areas. I stress that they were convenient for serving urban areas situated in the white areas. I think a clear example of that would be Umlazi, which is in the reserve but conveniently situated for serving the urban area. The second class, of course, consists of places which, in the Minister&#x2019;s words, are situated in white areas but adjacent to Bantu areas. Here the Minister himself gives the examples of Durban and Rustenburg, and I take it that here he is thinking probably of Kwa Mashu in Durban. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell me what he thinks this achieves in the furtherance of his policy, what it truly achieves, apart from re-drawing boundaries. I can quite see that re-drawing boundaries of the kind we are having does enable the hon. the Deputy Minister or may enable him after the 1970 census to come along and say: &#x201C;You see, the rate of increase of the numbers of Natives in the white areas is slowing down.&#x201D; If this is an important objective of the Government, they are perhaps welcome to it, but I suggest that in fact there will be as much interlocking after the moving of this boundary for which this money is being made available, as there is at present. Sir, I received through the post a publication called &#x201C;The African Reserves of South Africa&#x201D; by Muriel Horrell, in which I find there is a map. It is interesting to note that on this map there are 71 townships referred to&#x2014;all the various townships in the Native reserves or, in some cases, just outside perhaps; I think they are all in the reserves. It is interesting to note that with practically no exceptions these townships, many of them established by this Government&#x2014;others have been there for years&#x2014;are right on the very borders of the reserves adjacent to a white area, adjacent to a place of activity under white control requiring labour. The point I want to make is that all these 71 townships, with very few exceptions, remain interlocked, if the Minister does not like the word &#x201C;integrated&#x201D;, with the whole white economy. As far as the Transkei is concerned, I do not think there is one new township inland at all. I think there is one very close to Queenstown, which is shown as No. 67, and which I presume is probably Ilinge. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if he can name one town or village which is really deep into the interior of these reserves and which has an independent life force of its own. I think the whole idea of the Government&#x2019;s policy, with the creation of these townships, was that they should have a life force of their own, quite independent of the white economy. But I cannot find one, and I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister, when he replies to tell me of one which has an independent life force of its own. It is not only persons like myself that have worries in this regard. No less an authority than Professor J. H. Moolman, <span class="col_1049-1050" refersTo="page_0537"/>speaking to Sabra, in October, 1967, had something to say about this type of township right on the border which is either incorporated or not incorporated. He was speaking about the number of these townships. When he spoke four years ago, he referred to 39 new townships, or &#x201C;dorpe&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are here being asked to approve a clause to make it possible to incorporate areas presently in the so-called white part, into the reserves. I suggest that, seeing that we are spending this money, we are entitled to know what the Minister hopes to achieve by this action. I am asking the hon. the Deputy Minister to indicate what he hopes to achieve by doing this. His reply could well add to the justification for supporting this clause. Sir, I hope that you will not be severe on me in this regard. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will have an opportunity to advance reasons why we should vote for this clause. I have said that we will indeed support this clause but, at the same time, it would be very interesting to have him advance his reasons.</p>

<p>Sir, I shall not delay the House with a long quotation from Professor Moolman&#x2019;s speech, save to point out that he emphasizes that we are here involved in a considerable effort of physical planning. He too is looking for villages which have an independent life force of their own. He asks whether we are not simply concerned with negative planning rather than positive planning. I end by simply saying that, while we are supporting this provision, neither we nor the Government are hereby in fact separating one single Native by one yard from the white areas. Although we are authorizing this incorporation of areas, these people are as close as ever to the white areas.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to suggest that we do not in any way reduce the numbers actually circulating in the white areas, in the parks, the shops, the streets or the railways or wherever else you like. I therefore feel that it would be most helpful if we could hear from the hon. the Deputy Minister what in fact he is positively achieving with this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to the Opposition for supporting clauses 1 and 2. The hon. member for Pinelands has asked a very fair question. He wanted to know what we were going to achieve after we had placed clause 2 on the Statute Book. I want to mention a few very important considerations to him, in order to show what we are in fact going to achieve. Firstly, we are, to put it in general terms, now reaching a position where the policy of separate development, with the emphasis on the word &#x201C;development&#x201D;, is being implemented further along these lines. This point will be made clear when I mention the other considerations. As I explained in my second-reading speech, we find, in the second place, that the Bantu Trust cannot undertake development in a white area, but the Bantu Trust can in fact undertake development in a Bantu homeland. There is therefore a second great advantage in this. If this clause should become law, Kwa Mashu could, by means of this, be incorporated in the Bantu homeland, or the Bantu area near Brits can be incorporated in a Bantu homeland. Here we therefore see a second great advantage, because the Bantu Trust could then undertake development in those areas. As Kwa Mashu is situated now, i.e. adjacent to a Bantu homeland, the Bantu Trust from the nature of the case cannot undertake such development.</p>

<p>There is a third advantage, which in fact is the most important of all. The third advantage is that in a Bantu township in a white area the Bantu have no proprietary rights. In the Bantu homeland, however, the Bantu certainly do have proprietary rights. Therefore we find, again in terms of a practical example, that in Kwa Mashu as it is situated now, i.e. adjacent to the reserve near Durban, the Bantu have no proprietary rights. If, however, this clause becomes law, and this area is incorporated, the Bantu in Kwa Mashu will obtain proprietary rights. This is very important.</p>

<p>There is also a fourth very important advantage which will be gained. Of course, in this process hon. members will see for themselves how sensibly this policy of separate development unfolds itself here, and that is why I am so glad the hon. member asked me the question. The fourth advantage is a very, very important one. It will perhaps be precisely this fourth advantage which the Opposition will find the most important of all. The fourth consideration is that, in a white area, our policy is aimed at settling Bantu there on a migratory labour basis, whereas, in the Bantu homelands, the Bantu are settled on a proper family basis. To take another example, we find that if Kwa Mashu were incorporated, the Bantu could be settled on a family basis much more easily than the case would otherwise have been, because it would then be inside a Bantu homeland. There are other conditions I can add which are less important and which arise from the four most important ones I mentioned, but with these four advantages I have mentioned, I think I have answered the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me a second question. I want to reply very frankly to that as well. He wanted to know whether I could name a township where the Bantu were completely independent economically. The fact of the matter is simply that we have always been saying that we are working in the direction of reaching a stage where every Bantu homeland, and therefore the townships in those Bantu <span class="col_1051-1052" refersTo="page_0538"/>homelands as well, would as far as possible and as soon as possible attain economic independence to the extent which is possible in a country such as South Africa. This, we said, we want to achieve through activating the Bantu authorities, with which we have made good progress, and through our general development policy in the homelands. But we have always added that at the same time we, as practical people, accept that there is such a thing as economic inter-dependence. In this connection I can refer hon. members back to Dr. Verwoerd and Minister M. C. Botha, as well as to the speeches I myself have made in this connection. We have never evaded it, nor do I intend evading it now. Having said this, I can reply further to the question put by the hon. member for Pinelands. I may tell him that in the vicinity of King William&#x2019;s Town and Pretoria there are in fact areas where we are rapidly reaching a stage where we are able to effect, to the extent in which it is possible, a certain measure of economic independence. Temba is such an area where we are now making good progress with the agency basis. This is my reply to the two questions put by the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you have just ruled that we cannot discuss the reasons given by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I submit that we are entitled to find out how this clause would be administered, and what the intention of the Government in fact was. The Deputy Minister has said that one of the intentions is to be able to give the African home ownership. Once the Trust takes over this land from the municipality, it will then be able to allow home ownership. That is one of the reasons he gave. That, in fact, is one of the main reasons why we give our support to this clause. This matter actually arose during the discussion on another Bill last year, when the Minister said that it was the intention to give home ownership to the Bantu. That influenced us in accepting this clause.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister also said that the African would now be able to enjoy a family life in these townships that will be taken over, because it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to allow the Africans in the reserves to enjoy family life. That is one of their aims.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly, but I should like to ask him how an African living in Kwa Mashu is going to be any better off once Kwa Mashu is acquired by the Bantu Trust. Will the African be any better off than he is to-day? He is enjoying his family life there to-day, and working in Durban. I am afraid that I cannot quite follow the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s point. In any of these townships which the Bantu Trust is going to take over, the African is in fact enjoying family life at present. Is that not so? It is so. The Deputy Minister gave that as the most important reason.</p>

<p>That is not the point, Sir. These Africans who are living in Kwa Mashu now, are working in Durban. They are enjoying a family life. When the Bantu Trust takes over Kwa Mashu those Africans will still be living there, they will still be working in Durban and they will still be enjoying a family life. I really cannot see the point the Deputy Minister was trying to make. What I do fear as a result of the remarks made by the Deputy Minister, is that the Government will now use these figures in respect of Africans living in Kwa Mashu, or near Rustenburg, or in any other township which may be taken over by the Bantu Trust, and add those figures to the Africans who have moved into the reserves. That is what I am afraid they will do. He has already indicated that&#x2026;</p>

<p>Then he should not talk about being rude. He should in fact apologize. If the hon. the Deputy Minister now has the correct reference I will proceed. I refer to proposed paragraph (ii) which starts with the words &#x201C;it shall be no defence for such owner to allege or aver.. That is the paragraph with which I am dealing. Its full reference is 3 (c) and starts in line 44. The position seems to be that if Bantu are illegally squatting on land or have settled on that land in terms of what goes before this, the owner himself can find himself in trouble and can himself be charged for permitting those Bantu to squat there. He cannot go to court and on oath say that they are there without his permission. He can go to court and prove &#x201C;to the satisfaction of the court that he has instituted and is actively pursuing an action for the ejectment of such Bantu from the land&#x201D;. This is one half of the picture. What about the other half, i.e. what the owner does? There are numerous cases where Bantu do squat without the owner&#x2019;s knowledge or approval. This clause puts the onus on a man who as far as he is concerned has remained within the four corners of the law. The hon. the Deputy Minister is right when he says that that is the law at the present moment but it is being re-enacted here and we want to know what the position is going to be. We on this side of the House are now investigating a case where precisely this position has arisen. The magistrate has said that he will not grant an eviction order because he has nowhere to put these people.</p>

This onus is now placed upon the Bantu but what will a Bantu have to do in terms of the new subsection 1 (c)? I refer especially to line 23. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister tell us what such a Bantu must do? To-day the white man can do nothing because the Government will not assist him by giving eviction orders.

<p>Mr. Chairman. I should like to reply to both the hon. member for South Coast and the hon. member for Houghton in this connection. However, I should first like to rectify something else. I honestly did not intend being rude when I wanted to correct the hon. member for South Coast. Now I quite understand the problem which the hon. member has, and I should very much like to try to reply to that in detail.</p>

<p>Briefly, the position is this. In terms of the Trust and Land Act of 1936 the onus rested solely on the farmer. We are simply adding two small things in this regard. We are now making provision for a prohibition and a presumption. Should this clause be enacted, the prohibition provision would mean that the onus would rest firstly on the Bantu who is in fact lawfully on a farm and secondly on the Bantu who is found on the farm and may not lawfully be there. This is the first step we are taking. That is the prohibition provision. In other words, we are extending the responsibility which has rested solely on the farmer up to now, to these two categories of Bantu as well. Then we are taking a second step.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I refer to the point made by the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member for Houghton spoke about the question of a presumption contained in this provision. In terms of this part of the provision we presume that the Bantu legally there, in the event of a court case, will have the onus to prove that he has not given the necessary permission to a Bantu who is found on those premises. This is specifically to meet the point made so validly by the hon. member for South Coast, namely that the farmer is not always on his farm. We have experienced in practice that that gives rise to a lot of problems. We have included this provision to place the onus also on these two categories of Bantu, that is both the Bantu who is legally there and the one who is illegally there. That is the position. As far as the point raised by the hon. member for Houghton is concerned, I want to say that it is basic to the criminal law system that an accused is always deemed to be not guilty until it has been proven beyond all reasonable doubt that he is in fact guilty. The State is however not expected to prove his guilt beyond all doubt but in civil litigation a litigant need only prove his case beyond a balance of probabilities. Thirdly, the whole conception of having presumptions in our criminal legislation is an aid, and is to aid the State in providing a set of circumstances. It would be foreign to our much cherished criminal system in that it militates against the cardinal principle set out above, which I have just mentioned. Yet it is not unusual to find these presumptions in our present day legislation. We have them, for example, in section 9 (5<i>)bis</i> of the Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act of 1945. The courts have, however, ruled that after such a presumption applies, i.e. where the onus is on the accused to prove his innocence, the same rule applies as in civil litigations. That is to say, the quantum of evidence required to shift the onus or to rebut the presumption is proved by way of a mere balance of probabilities. He may, for example, merely deny a certain state of affairs under oath and then it is for the State to prove that he told the untruth, or that the circumstances in fact exist.</p>

<p>Lastly, Mr. Chairman, the presumption is nevertheless of great value to the prosecutor, as it assists him to finalize an action without a host of witnesses. So the point I am trying to make is that, where we now place the onus on the Bantu, the position in the existing legal system of South Africa is that this is considered to be very, very fair justice indeed. I therefore do not think that the hon. member made a valid point a moment ago.</p>

<p>Everything the hon. the Deputy Minister has now said strengthens my determination to vote against this clause. First of all, as I understood the clause, and he has in fact borne out everything that I did understand by this clause, what really should be the responsibility of the absentee landlord, the farmer who is not on his land and ought to be on his land, is now placed on the African. He has to show that any illegal squatters who come on to that land have done so without his permission. How will he be able to stop people from squatting on the land? These may be enormous farms. In South Africa there are farms of 5,000 and 6,000 morgen. Why should an African living legally on that land, who has been there as a labour tenant or in any other legal capacity, be held responsible for any illegal squatter that comes and settles on any corner of this land? It is the farmer who has to look after his land, not the labour tenants, who have no authority anyway.</p>

<p>The point is that an African does not have the authority to kick another African off the land. The only person who has the authority is the legitimate owner of the land, who is the white farmer It is on him, fairly and squarely that the responsibility of getting rid of illegal squatters should rest. I am against this removal of the responsibility from a man who is in a far better condition to look after himself and his land than is the African labour tenant. All the other arguments the hon. the Deputy Minister has used about onus of proof, probability and all the rest, weigh extremely hard on a rural African who has no knowledge of the law and is unlikely to be able to afford any defence whatever. He probably does not even know, since nobody is likely to tell him that all he has to do is to deny on oath and the chances are that the magistrate will accept this as being sufficient proof that he is innocent. He has to face a trained prosecutor. He has no legal defence. There he is, hauled into court, and the onus of proof of innocence rests on him. I think this is taking an unfair advantage of a man who is least able to defend himself. He is not in any condition whatever to be able to stand up to a law of this kind. I am certainly going to vote against it.</p>

If a Bantu is found on the farm, it is one thing; but if a Bantu is found in the dwelling of a Bantu who has been there legally, then surely the onus must be on that Bantu in whose dwelling this Bantu is illegally found.

<block name="quote">No Bantu who lawfully occupies a dwelling on such land shall allow any Bantu who is by or under any law prohibited from presiding upon such land or occupying any dwelling on such land, to occupy such a dwelling.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member is really being somewhat mischievous, because in interpreting a clause she is venturing into the field of law. With the best will in the world one surely cannot read into this clause anything which makes it applicable to land. The entire clause deals with residence. It does not deal purely with occupation. If it were occupation, then it would refer to land. Here there is talk of &#x201C;residence&#x201D;, and residence refers to a building. This entire provision concerns residence in a building which may be on that land. This is where the hon. member misunderstands the matter. I think if she would just appreciate this, she would realize that she has completely misinterpreted it. Therefore her argument is also wrong.</p>

<p>Yes, I have looked at line 26, but the hon. member is wrong. The hon. member is also wrong in regard to the onus. None of us in this House likes the placing of onusses on accused. This has been said repeatedly in this House from the Government side. But where it is essential, it is a <span class="col_1059-1060" refersTo="page_0542"/>recognized part of our law of evidence. Here it is essential. What is the problem of the police or any person who wants to investigate this Bantu&#x2019;s actions there? He arrives at this dwelling and finds the permanent lodger there. He asks him: &#x201C;What are you doing here?&#x201D;. He then replies-&#x201C;No, I am just visiting here&#x201D;. The owner of the land perhaps says so as well. That is about as far as that prosecution can go. All the thousands who live there illegally, make use of this excuse and the State simply cannot prove its case against them. They get away with those excuses. The one protects the other. It is high time that this legislation was introduced to clamp down on those people who want to get away with those excuses. The only way in our law of evidence in which one can succeed in a prosecution, is to place the onus on that accused. It is correct, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, that the onus is the same as in a civil case. In other words, he must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. But that balance of probabilities does not mean that he can get away with any nonsense in court. If he can say, &#x201C;But I am only a lodger with this other person&#x201D;&#x2014;in terms of the first clause the onus is placed on the owner as well, the Bantu who is allowed to occupy that dwelling&#x2014;then he cannot get away with this kind of story. Therefore the onus is essential to obtain a conviction in this case. This is virtually the only way in which one will be able to achieve it. If this article appears on our Statute Book, I am convinced that these geographic problems would very soon be solved. I think the hon. member is off the mark in regard to those two matters. This is why she raised this argument.</p>

I should like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister who is responsible when some other person occupies a house if the owner is not there. There is no definition of the word &#x201C;occupied&#x201D; in this legislation. A person may stay two, three, or eight days at a place. We do not know what &#x201C;occupied&#x201D; means. In this connection I should like to mention an example. If the owner of a house is away on leave and his brother comes to stay in that house for ten days, is his brother then occupying that house? What is the situation then? Should the measure not be more clearly defined in respect of what occupation means? Must one hold a person responsible when someone is staying in his house if we do not have a definition of &#x201C;occupy&#x201D;?</p>

This legislation does not in any way define what &#x201C;occupation&#x201D; means.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The generally accepted meaning of &#x201C;occupation&#x201D; is that if a person should remain in that house for a day or three, that person is then occupying that house. For that reason it was not deemed necessary to define occupation here, and for that reason, too, it is not being defined in the Bill. I think there was a court decision in this regard. The court stipulated simply that &#x201C;occupation&#x201D; in the accepted sense contained in the dictionary means occupation. That is the reason why my Department has never yet deemed it necessary to come forward with an amendment in order to give a more detailed definition of occupation. I can give the hon. member the assurance that we have not yet experienced problems in regard to the definition of occupation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, surely it is not the intention of the hon. the Deputy Minister to create a situation which could create suspicion. Do we want to hold such a person responsible at all times for who lives in this house? After all, one can now have the situation that a person is charged when, for example, his brother stays for a few days in his house in his absence. Surely that is not the intention of this measure. I am of the opinion that the term &#x201C;occupy&#x201D; should be defined in this legislation. Surely the term &#x201C;occupying&#x201D; can never mean, apart from the dictionary definition, that when a member of a family of a person visits that person for a few days, even without the permission of such a house owner, the house owner can then be charged.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the position in this regard is very simple. That is precisely why, in the prohibitory provision in this clause, we have two categories, i.e. the Bantu residing there legally, and those who may be found on the premises. In addition hon. members must understand that proceedings have to be instituted and that those persons must then appear before the court. The court will then have to decide whether the person was able to occupy such a place legally, or whether he had no legal right.</p>

<p>No, because this is so, the hon. member can think for himself that there is no question of any person being charged and having to appear before the court if he happened to be away for a few days and subsequently returned.

<p>Clause 4:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when he introduced this clause during the Second Reading debate, the hon. the Deputy Minister said that this clause was not a very material amendment to the existing section. There are many word changes in the clause, but the amendments are material, however. In subsection (2) of section 3 of the Act the word &#x201C;except&#x201D; is inserted before the words &#x201C;upon such terms and conditions&#x201D; and the word &#x201C;if any&#x201D; are inserted after the word &#x201C;compensation&#x201D;. I do not know why it is necessary to insert these words. I take it it is done so that the Minister does not have to give any compensation. I think there is a subsequent amendment which states the case where no compensation will be paid. I will be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister will explain why these amendments to section 3 (2) of the Act is necessary, because I cannot see the full implications of them at the moment. Our main objection to this clause is the amendment deleting the necessity for a public enquiry where the Minister wishes to abolish a location, Bantu village or Bantu hostel as the case may be. Quite rightly the law as it is now lays down that the Minister should hold an enquiry before he instructs a municipality to abolish or remove a location or Bantu hostel. I do not want to repeat all the institutions every time, but the hon. the Deputy Minister will know what I am talking about. The point is that it is not only at the request of the local authority concerned, that this Bantu village, location or hostel may be abolished. It may be at the request of some other authority. A neighbouring authority may request that the location under it&#x2019;s neighbour&#x2019;s authority should be abolished. During the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister said that the enquiry was necessary because representations could be made to the Minister and that the Minister, in any event, would consult with the local authority concerned. We submit that that is not sufficient. As the law now stands, when a local authority applies for the removal of such a location, Bantu village, or Bantu hostel, all the parties concerned, for example the Bantu themselves, or their employers are entitled to appear at the public enquiry, and to be legally represented, to put their case. The public can then see what the objections to the removal are or why it must take place. I submit that the provision should be retained. It is not sufficient merely to allow the Minister to consult with the municipality concerned, because that is all the Minister will be required to do. As far as we know, the Minister has not had any trouble in this regard so far. I will be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell me when there has been undue delay because of a public enquiry. Where has the hon. the Deputy Minister had any undue delay in removing a location, Bantu village or Bantu hostel? The hon. the Deputy Minister told us, when dealing with clause 5 during the Second Reading debate, of the trouble they had at Windhoek and at Harrismith. But that had nothing to do with the necessity of holding a public enquiry and I will be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell us why he has found it necessary now to do away with this safeguard the public has enjoyed.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the first reason why we should like to abolish this enquiry&#x2014;and this is a very important matter&#x2014;is that we find that there are, for example, old houses the owners of which we cannot trace at all. Consequently it is a long and laborious process to have a Bantu village removed in this way. I promise the hon. member that I will reply to his question in full. In amending this clause we proceeded on the assumption that there may be cases where compensation really cannot be payable, such as in the case of old houses the owner of which cannot be traced with the best will in the world. This causes the process to be very seriously delayed.</p>

<p>Now I actually come to the hon. member&#x2019;s second question. The hon. member referred to the proposed deletion by clause 4 of certain words in section 3 of the Act, which amounts to this, that in future an enquiry will no longer be held. As I said in my second reading speech, the position is such that in practice we have found that that enquiry has simply become a dead letter, because the parties do not turn up, often because they are not interested, or because of other reasons, and consequently the proceedings are delayed. If one finds that such an enquiry has become a dead letter in practice because of the reasons I have furnished, why should one continue to hold this kind of enquiry?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I shall give you an example. In the case of Sheshe vs. Vereniging there was such a court case. Now I must be careful how I express myself. I could mention other examples as well, where no one even went to court, but where certain parties, a few malicious parties which are really problem cases, enlisted the <span class="col_1063-1064" refersTo="page_0544"/>services of attorneys and even advocates and by doing so placed the others, who were quite willing, in a very awkward position. By doing so they seriously delayed the entire process. Because it has been proved in practice that this method has become redundant, but nevertheless lends itself sometimes to exploitation by a few malicious parties, it has been decided to abolish it, because as a result of this exploitation others who are quite willing to cooperate have to suffer. This is very unfair. I want to point out to the hon. member for Transkei that we want to be very fair in our actions towards and treatment of the Bantu. I always aim at that. I want to be very fair in this clause as well. That is why the hon. member will see, if he reads this clause, that we just want to abolish something here which has become awkward in practice and which, moreover, is of no value to anyone concerned. As the Act is going to read now, it will not mean that there will be no enquiry in future, because it is explicitly provided that there will be consultation with the local authority and there will also be consultation with, as the hon. member called it, the &#x201C;neighbouring authority&#x201D;, if any neighbouring authority is involved. In this clause we therefore do not want to deprive anyone of the opportunity, if he has a case, to state that case. The hon. member for Transkei himself will know that we find in practice that the local authority and its officials know best what is happening in that area, because they come into contact with the Bantu all the time. It is therefore our honest opinion&#x2014;and I am very sincere when I say this&#x2014;that by deleting these words we are not depriving the Bantu of any privilege which he possesses in a case where an old Bantu township or building has to be removed. These are more or less the reasons for the proposed deletion of these words. I could mention other reasons as well, but I do not think it is necessary for us to go into them. If I should mention other reasons, we would come to policy aspects and I want to try to avoid that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister gives a very smooth explanation of all of this. He assures us that there is no intention of being unjust. He says that the reason why he wants to do away with the public inquiry, is that it has been found to be useless, delaying and time-consuming. However, there are people concerned with this. It is all very well for the hon. the Deputy Minister to say that he does not want time to be taken up, he does not want delaying tactics and so on. But if one looks at clause 5, which goes very closely with clause 4, one finds it has very serious effects on the people concerned. Because simply after consultation, without any searching enquiry, without giving interested people the right to appear before him, he can take a decision. The immediate consequences are that the people are moved lock, stock and barrel. As soon as the decision has been taken to move the location, power is taken under the next clause to take a man&#x2019;s personal belongings and move him off to some place where the Secretary decides he should go. We have had ample experience of other types of removal in this country where people are moved lock, stock and barrel, where illegal squatters are told to go somewhere else, usually back to their homelands. They arrive there with very scant provision having been made. However bud these slum dwellings are that they have left, they are at least structures that these people had lived in. There had developed some sort of community life around these structures.</p>

<p>Clearing up slums? How can the removal of these two provisions have anything to do with the clearing up of slums? The hon. member for Brakpan must not make irresponsible statements like that. Let us, first of all, take the first amendment which is proposed and which will make it possible for the Government not to provide any compensation if a dwelling is removed. This has been done simply by the addition of the words &#x201C;if any&#x201D;. What does the hon. the Deputy Minister give as a justification for this? The only justification he has offered to this House has been that sometimes it happens that the owners of old dwellings cannot be found. Surely that is no justification for giving a discretion to the hon. the Minister to remove dwellings without giving any compensation whatsoever. If he is not able to find the owner, surely a reasonable compensation can be assessed and the amount placed in a Guardians Fund in case the owner comes forward at some stage.</p>

<p>That is precisely what the Guardians Fund is for. Large amounts are deposited by various Government departments in this fund. These amounts are required to be deposited in Guardian Funds, as will be the position in cases of this sort where the owners or persons entitled to these moneys cannot be found. It is no justification whatsoever to say that the Minister may be given the right to award no compensation at all simply because he cannot find the owner at the time. If that is the only reason which the hon. the Minister can give to this House to justify this amendment, then we are perfectly within our rights to say to him that we will oppose him tooth and nail. That deals with one aspect of this clause.</p>

<p>The second aspect of it is equally unjustified in terms of the explanations and reasons given by the hon. the Deputy Minister. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the words used by the hon. the Deputy Minister when he introduced the Bill at its Second Reading last year, as reported in Column 8473 of Hansard, amount to misleading the House. He was talking about the doing away with the requirement of a public inquiry and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The omission does not prejudice anyone, as it will still be possible for representations to be made directly to the Minister by interested parties and there will still be consultation with the local authority concerned.</block>

<p>How can the hon. the Deputy Minister have the effrontery to say that when you do away with a public inquiry you do not prejudice anybody, even if there is still consultation with the local authority and the Minister? There was consultation with the local authority in terms of the law as it now stands. I am not sure that there is consultation with the Minister, but I will deal with that in a moment. There is certainly consultation with the local authority and a public inquiry. He now does away with the public inquiry and he still says there is no prejudice to anyone. This is misleading the House. Anyone who is versed in legal procedure will know the benefits of a public inquiry. There are numerous benefits of a public inquiry which you do not get simply under the procedure of consultation. First of all, these things are aired in public, and that in itself is a very important factor. It is very important in its tendency to restrain Government bodies and departments such as this department from acting to the prejudice of persons concerned if they know that their actions are going to be placed under the spotlight of a public inquiry.</p>

<p>The well-known principle of law that justice must be seen to be done is a very important one, which this amendment transgresses.</p>

<p>Now, let us deal with the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reasons for justifying this. He said that it has not worked in practice. He has given us no explanations to justify this, none whatsoever. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that it tends to waste time. Obviously a public inquiry of necessity takes longer than the procedure which is now suggested, namely that of consultation with the local authority. It is a very much easier and quicker procedure. But is it fair and just? When steps of this nature are to be taken to remove locations, Bantu villages and Bantu hostels, they are in fact very serious steps. Surely, the fact that you have to take a little longer before the matter is finalized is important. It is also important that the persons involved are given a proper opportunity to air their views, even though that procedure may take a little longer. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that there will still be consultation with the local authorities concerned. In terms of the law as it will read, that is correct. But that is not the same thing as a public inquiry at all. The hon. the Deputy Minister also suggested that representations may be made directly to the Minister by interested parties. I am very interested to hear about this. I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to tell us where there is provision for making direct representations to the Minister b/ interested parties. Unless I misread this clause, that does not appear there at all.</p>

<p>I should now like to refer to the White Paper on this Bill and to make certain comments on it. First of all, I think that the White Paper is most misleading.

<p>I just want to reply in a few words to the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member made the point and asked how this particular clause is going to be applied. I should like to tell the hon. member that my conscience is a very good girl and that I can always come to terms with her. That will certainly be the case in connection with the way in which this would be applied.</p>

<p>*I want to tell the hon. member for Musgrave that he has really exploded a stink bomb here in a discussion which up to now has been quite pleasant and rewarding. I take the strongest exception to the fact that he accuses me of trying to mislead the House. Why should I try to <span class="col_1067-1068" refersTo="page_0546"/>mislead the House? In the second place, I take very strong exception to what the hon. member then went on to say. It is one thing to blame me if I had misled the House. I can deal with him myself in regard to the things he said. But the hon. member went further to cast the scandalous reflection upon my officials by saying that they were misleading the House through the White Paper which had been laid upon the Table and had been drawn up by them. Yes, they were supposed to mislead the House and on top of that they were doing so in writing. It does not become that hon. member to make remarks of that nature.</p>

<p>He was casting a serious reflection on the officials. Nobody can deny that. I hope the hon. member for Transkei will reprimand him, because I am sure that hon. member will not put up with such things. If the hon. member had a leg to stand on, he had all the right to make that speech. However, he did not have a leg to stand on. What is the factual position? I stand by what I said during the Second Reading debate. I also stand by what is stated in the White Paper. I want to repeat emphatically that, in terms of the provisions of this clause, no Bantu is being deprived of the right to receive compensation. Shall I repeat it for the information of the hon. member? No Bantu is being deprived of the right to receive compensation. If that is the case, why did the hon. member make this scandalous remark? I shall try to give the hon. member the true state of affairs. If one has a few tins and sacks for which nobody wants to pay as much as a cent and if one has to pay somebody to cart it away on top of that while with the best will in the world and with the best detectives in the world one cannot find out to whom the sacks and the tins belong, who will determine what compensation should be paid for these articles, and to whom?</p>

<p>The point I want to make is that the hon. member has no idea of and does not appreciate the practical problems my officials and I have to deal with as regards the moving of locations. If that hon. member had paid a visit to Windhoek and seen what the position was there, he would not have made these silly remarks. If he had visited Harrismith and seen the conditions prevailing there, he would not have made that speech.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made another point. He said: &#x201C;Everybody accepts and everybody knows the importance of a public inquiry&#x201D;. I am not so stupid that I do not know that a public inquiry, may have advantages. It could, indeed, be an important instrument to ensure that justice is done to all. I would be the last person to refuse to give my approval for a public inquiry to be instituted when such an inquiry is merited and could benefit the people concerned. In practice it has, however, been proved beyond a doubt over a long period that such a public inquiry would have served no purpose in this case because, to start with, the parties do not turn up. In practice it has become merely a dead letter. Hon. members can take my word for it. I would not have given the House this information if it was not true. And, in the second place, there is the important point with which even the hon. member for Houghton cannot disagree, and that is that I have seen to it personally that the provision which has been included in the clause will not remove any rights to receive compensation. This position will be made even more clear when clause 5 is discussed. The hon. member for Musgrave should therefore not make the allegation he made here this afternoon. Neither should he repeat his statement that we, and particularly my officials, are misleading this House.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to let the hon. the Deputy Minister know quite clearly that it does not bother me in the least if he is upset at the fact that I have accused him of misleading the House during his Second Reading speech in regard to this clause. I repeat that allegation. If the hon. the Minister proposes, as he does in this amendment, to do away with a public hearing, then it is irresponsible in a Second Reading speech to say to the House that by doing so he is not prejudicing anyone.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has been on his feet supposedly to reply to the arguments I put forward a moment ago. But of course he has not done so. Let us take the question of compensation. The argument which I presented to this House was simply that even if you are not able to trace the owner of the dwelling, you can still assess reasonable compensation and place that in a Guardian Fund. This has been done continually in terms of all sorts of laws. It has been done by other departments of his own Government. He has not told this House why it cannot be done in regard to these proposed removals of locations, Bantu villages and Bantu hostels. In order to justify himself, the hon. the Deputy Minister gave facetious examples. He gave examples of a lot of sacks and other worthless things. In other words, it means articles in dwellings. This is not what he has to pay compensation for; he has to pay compensation for the dwellings that he has removed. Even if the hon. the Minister was meaning that the dwelling was merely a shack and was not worth anything, then if it was not worth anything, no compensation would be payable. There is no need to amend the clause to give the hon. the Minister a discretion not to pay compensation in every case. This is what is being done. He is now given a discretion not to pay compensation in any case <span class="col_1069-1070" refersTo="page_0547"/>that he chooses. The case that the hon. the Deputy Minister has mentioned is no justification for amending this clause. If the dwelling is worthless, then no compensation is payable.</p>

<p>The hon. the member for Prinshof is an advocate himself and now he is asking me to give him examples. Does he not know about the Guardians Fund? I am certainly not going to waste my time in telling him what it is. He should ask his colleagues in Pretoria. Then the hon. the Deputy Minister said that no rights were being removed. How can the hon. the Deputy Minister make a statement like that? Here again I say that he was irresponsible when he said it. If a public hearing is required of the clause as it stands, and that is removed, it is a very real right that is removed. A public hearing is a very real right that the persons concerned have. That right is now being removed. The hon. the Deputy Minister has repeated that this procedure of a public enquiry has become a dead letter, but he gives us no examples to justify this contention. He states no cases to enable the House to judge whether it is reasonable or not to do away with this procedure. I again refer to this White Paper. In the White Paper a similar statement is made and it is said that this right is being removed because &#x201C;it has been found to be unpractical, cumberous and does not actually serve any useful purpose&#x201D;. Not one single example has been given to this House to justify statements of this nature. While I am on my feet, I would again ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to justify his contention that in terms of the clause as it will be amended, that is if the amendments are passed, interested parties will have the right to make representations directly to the Minister. I raised this question when I spoke last time and I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister to justify this statement of his. However, he has not done so. I again want to ask him to do so. In our opinion the amendments proposed in this clause seriously transgress the few existing rights which persons who are subjected to removals have. The hon. the Deputy Minister has not justified these amendments. Unless he can do so, we are perfectly within our rights to say to him that he has not made out a case and that we shall oppose this clause.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in order to get more clarity about this matter and view it in a better perspective, I think it is necessary for us to note that we are dealing here with the &#x201C;removal, curtailment or abolition of locations, Bantu villages and Bantu hostels&#x201D;. One aspect of this is that of compensation. Under the present circumstances a local authority or all interested parties may lodge objections or appear at a public hearing. I also want to point out the fact that not only Bantu will be concerned with this, but also local authorities with their ratepayers. There may be traders and many other persons whose rights may be involved here. As was done by other speakers, I shall therefore emphasize the position of the Bantu in this matter, although I want to stress the fact that very few Bantu will be concerned with this. The Minister says that he wants to be fair towards these people and I accept it. His justification for the abolition of the public hearing is mainly because it is a laborious process and because the parties do not turn up. If the parties do not turn up, it cannot delay the hon. the Minister at all. While we are now dealing with the rights of human beings, I think it is very easy to use the procedure which is so often used as regards the re-zoning of stands and so forth. When rezoning takes place, the interested parties are requested to submit reasons on a certain day why this, that or the other thing cannot be done. I should think that the hon. the Minister would find the procedure quite easy particularly since the hon. the Minister says that people do not turn up. All he has to do is to give notice that a hearing will take place on a certain day and that interested people should come and present their case. If matters are as the Minister tells us they are, we can expect very few people to turn up. If the people do not turn up to state their case, it is their concern, but their interests have nevertheless been taken into consideration. I would say that a measure of this nature would make for better relations. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that they come and complain to the Minister hut I should like to know what is better: to hold a meeting at a place which is probably situated within the location or Bantu village where people can lodge their claims for compensation and air their grievances, or for the people to go and complain to the Minister? I cannot see that it will be easier for any of these people to go and complain to the Minister. I think it would be much easier for them to present their case in the Bantu village or location, particularly, as the Minister says, since so few people actually turn up.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill because the Government has consistently neglected the interests of every citizen, <i>inter alia</i>, by&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) pursuing a policy of deliberate overtaxation in order to produce large surpluses;</li>

<li>(b) failing to make proper provision to protect die fixed income group, and particularly pensioners, from the continual increase in the cost of living;</li>

<li>(c) the ill-considered and unnecessary scope and severity of the sales duty;</li>

<li>(d) its indecisive management of credit and currency control&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>Before I come to the amendment, there are a couple of matters I should like to mention to the hon. the Minister. The first refers to the oil find on land, what Dr. Kuschke has referred to as the first tangible result of the continuing search for oil on land. Soekor has issued a carefully worded statement to the effect that a small quantity of crude oil had been found at a depth of 7,400 feet at Colchester in the Port Elizabeth area. The statement further said that further tests were being carried out to establish the extent of the find, which at this stage seemed unlikely to produce oil in commercial quantities. On Friday morning the Press reported this and the Government Press in particular had banner headlines such as &#x201C;We Have Oil&#x201D;, etc. Naturally this statement produced tremendous interest in the country. We all know that oil is the Achilles heel of the country and this discovery naturally raised hopes in which we all share. But I do think that if is important to keep a proper perspective on the matter before the public and I hope that the hon. the Minister or his colleague the Minister of Mines will come into this debate to make an authoritative statement on the matter, showing how much importance can be attached to the find, which undoubtedly is an important one.</p>

<p>The other point I want to raise with the hon. the Minister is this. There has been talk recently and comment in certain newspapers of the Government Press of the possibility, or even the desirability, of an early devaluation of the rand.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<p>Which paper was that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p><i>Dagbreek</i> was one. [Interjections.] It does not really matter which paper it was, but it has appeared in the Press which is commonly regarded as supporting the Government. When discussions of that kind occur in papers supporting the Government, the public are liable to say that there is no smoke without fire; and goodness knows our money market is nervous enough without the idea of devaluation hanging over its head as well. I expect the hon. the Minister to deny it. I believe that if he did intend to devalue, it would not be announced in that way well in advance. [Interjections.] My reason for mentioning the matter is that I hope the Minister will do more than that and that he will declare emphatically that he can see no sound reason or necessity for devaluing the rand, and I hope he will be able to make such a statement in his reply to this debate, which will effectively stop such speculations or rumours.</p>

<p>I now come to the amendment I moved. In regard to taxation, over the years the Government has accumulated surpluses which are gradually amounting to nearly R1,400 million, and I find it impossible to believe that this continued accumulation of surpluses is due to anything but a policy of deliberately underestimating revenue in order to produce large surpluses without openly saying so. I believe that this is a wrong policy. I believe it is wrong, in the first place because it places an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer, and, secondly, because it creates an impression that money is no object, and it increases pressure on the hon. the Minister to make money available for unnecessary things. Under &#x201C;unnecessary things&#x201D; some people might include a Cabinet of 24 Ministers and Deputy Ministers. I think the hon. the Minister knows that pressure will be brought to bear on him to make funds available for things which cannot possibly be regarded as essential.</p>

<p>Sir, when the hon. the Minister introduced his Budget last year, he estimated that his surplus would be about R58 million. We tried throughout the session, right up to the end of last session, to find out what it actually was, but the Minister did not tell us; he did not reply to direct questions on this subject, so we did not know. We now have the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, in which we find that the surplus was not R58 million but R75 million, very big increase in customs duty. Under Ex-As a consequence, the hon. the Minister has at his disposal the Stabilization Fund, amounting to R341 million; surpluses over the past <span class="col_1173-1174" refersTo="page_0549"/>two years, up to March of last year, amounting to R105 million, after allocating RIO million to the Economic Co-operation Fund, and then there is the Taxation Equalization Fund, started by his predecessor, the late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges, which now amounts to R45 million. That means that the hon. the Minister has R491 million tucked away in one fund or another. As far as the Taxation Equalization Fund is concerned, it is an interesting point that there was put into that Fund over two years, up to 1965, an amount of nearly R38 million. It has earned interest amounting to R7 million since then; that takes it to R45 million. This R38 million was given by the Government to the Public Debt Commissioners. The Public Debt Commissioners presumably invested most of that money in Government stocks, and the question arises: Who pays the interest; where does the R7 million interest come from? The answer, of course, is that it comes from the taxpayer, so you have the interesting position that the taxpayer, who saved R38 million, which the Government is using, is now being called upon to pay R1 million interest a year on its own saving, which seems rather a peculiar state of affairs.</p>

<p>Sir, this year&#x2019;s Estimates bear looking at because they are typical of the way in which figures are put before this House. I am going to quote from the latest Government figures in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 7th February. According to those figures the Government&#x2019;s revenue for the 12 months was estimated at R1.661 million; that was an increase of R158 million over the previous year. In the first nine months&#x2014;these are the latest figures we have&#x2014;revenue has amounted to R1,277 million compared with R1,046 million in the previous year, an increase for the nine months of R231 million over the previous year. In other words, Sir, in nine months the hon. the Minister has collected R73 million more than he budgeted for by way of increase for the whole year. One wonders what his surplus is going to be at the end of March. Of course, we still have the Additional Estimates, of which he has given notice this afternoon; we do not know how much they are going to be but I expect they will be pretty big. and I have no doubt that he will make them as large as he can. In addition to that, he has told us that the sales tax in respect of the last quarter, the last three months, is being held over to be paid in the next financial year. Sir, this increase is not fortuitous; it is not due to an increase under any particular head; it applies to almost every head of taxation. Take customs, for instance. The hon. the Minister expected to get R4.7 million more customs duty in the whole of this year than he got the previous year. Well, in the first nine months he got not R4.7 million; he has already got R26 million. Then with reference to sales duty on imported goods, I should like to ask the Minister: Is that duty credited to Customs or is it credited to Sales Duty? Otherwise it seems a very big increase in customs duty. Under Excise he budgeted for an increase of R19.6 million; in the first nine months he has got R23.4 million. In regard to Inland Revenue he budgeted for an increase of R48 million and in the first nine months he got an increase of R122 million. Under Income Tax he expected an increase of R35 million for the year and he has already got R87 million in the first nine months. Under Stamp Duties he hoped for an extra R5 million; he has got R17 million in the first nine months. Under Marketable Securities he wanted R10 million more and he got R17 million more in the first nine months.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I think the hon. the Minister feels a little guilty about this. But he said, of course, that these increases in taxes are associated with a high level of prosperity. Surely, Sir, that is a platitude. All taxes depend on the rate of prosperity and the ability of the taxpayer to pay. Surely the hon. the Minister will not really argue that the level of prosperity is nearly twice as high to-day as it was last year when he was preparing his budget figures?</p>

<p>No, Sir, I think these figures simply reinforce our argument that what the country needs is a government which deliberately and honestly aims at a balanced budget. Talk about the credibility gap, Mr. Speaker! When it comes to the Minister&#x2019;s estimates the gap is as wide as False Bay; it is nearly as wide as in the case of the weather forecasts. I am reminded that the late Mr. Eric Louw, when the weather forecasts were stopped during the war, called on the then Government to restart the weather forecasts with the sole object of misleading the enemy. It almost seems that the hon. the Minister of finance regards the unfortunate taxpayer as his enemy instead of being his best friend. I wish I could say that the taxpayers regard the Minister as their best friend.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of the sales tax. The hon. the Minister said that this tax increased the cost of living by only .07 per cent. No tax, either in its scope or in the severity of its application, has, I believe, caused more resentment since Mr. Burton&#x2019;s famous patent medicine tax way back in the early twenties. That tax, incidentally, lost the government of the day the next election. In his Budget Speech, the hon. the Minister, referring to the sales tax, said that &#x201C;if the income tax &#x2026; is reduced, and if the sales duty is applied in a selective manner, namely not on basic necessities, then the case for it is even stronger&#x201D;. We know what happened. When the list appeared, we tried to reconcile it with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement. We found, for instance, <span class="col_1075-1076" refersTo="page_0550"/>that the Minister does not regard soap as a basic necessity. I wonder whether his family agreed with that. Talk about the credibility gap, Sir! We hear a good deal about the permissive society. In this case it seems as though the hon. the Minister is preparing us for a &#x201C;muishond&#x201D; society. That was typical of the list we received.</p>

<p>Sir, we accepted the principle of the sales tax, but we urged that it should be confined to a small tax on luxury and semi-luxury goods. We believed that with that, he would be able to balance his budget. Surely events have proved that we were quite right. The hon. the Minister now says that he discovered towards the end of last year that the tax would have a somewhat higher yield than he expected. Sir, we told him that a year ago. If only the hon. the Minister would more often take the sound, constructive advice of this side of the House, what a lot of trouble he would save himself and the country! Now, having come to that belated conclusion, he has made a few reductions. He has reduced the tax on soap from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. Apparently he is now only half convinced that soap is not a basic necessity. But why not abolish that tax altogether? Why merely reduce the tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent? I wonder whether the hon. the Minister, between attending high society weddings, ever spares a thought for the unfortunate man who has to eke out a living on R35 a month, and who has to pay 10 per cent tax on every cake of soap he buys.</p>

<p>The Minister, in addition to reducing the sales tax, has now announced that the sales tax for the last quarter will be collected in the next financial year. He says that he is doing this out of consideration for the taxpayer and the officials in his own department. It will suit everybody, he said. I cannot accept that. Sir. I think that the Minister is taking this step out of shame for the surplus with which he is con-confronted. It is quite obvious to any objective observer that all the fuss and bother over this tax would have been quite unnecessary had it been properly handled. This tax could have been imposed in such a way that it would balance the Budget. That is the very reason why it was introduced, and not to produce a large surplus. After the 22nd April, we shall abolish the sales tax on all real necessities. We shall confine this tax to luxury and semi-luxury items. We shall make it possible and we shall interpret the term &#x201C;real necessities&#x201D; in a sensible way and not in the way in which it has been interpreted by the hon. the Minister in the present list of dutiable commodities.</p>

<p>I come now to section (b) of the amendment in which we charge the Government with not having made proper provision for pensioners and the fixed income group. Other speakers will deal with this point in more detail. I should like to observe that we now have the Minister coming here with a proposal to give R10 million in a full year. Here we have the Minister with a nest egg of nearly R500 million. Mr. Speaker, that is some nest! He has a nest egg of nearly R500 million, the prospect of a substantial surplus in the current year and every indication that revenue will continue to be buoyant, but what is he doing? He is offering social pensioners 6-t cents per day. That little more than covers the increase in the cost of living. Does the hon. the Minister really think that an old age pensioner can live decently on R35 per month to-day? Does anybody in this House think so? [Interjections.] It is becoming more and more apparent that the only solution is a contributory pension scheme without a means test that will enable our old people to live decently in their declining years.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, listen to that hon. Minister. I can only say in conclusion that it appears to me that the hon. Minister of finance&#x2019;s handling the finances of this country is on a par with the general mishandling of national affairs by this deplorable Government of which he happens to be a member. This is a Government which is obsessed with ideologies, careless of the needs of the people and blind to the collision course with the rest of the world on which it has set the country, and which should be removed without delay if South Africa is to continue to live in peace and to prosper.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what we have been hearing here to-day is in point of fact a repetition of every speech usually made immediately prior to an election. The years have taught us that with the approach of an election there is one thing which the United Party can do very well indeed without its having the necessary means at its disposal to carry that through, and that is to make promises to the electorate. It promises the voters to do more for them and to take less from their pockets by way of taxation. These two promises cannot be reconciled with each other in the first place. We have learned that as soon as the election has been held and the United Party has been given a sound beating, these promises disappear one after the other until they are again served up with the same sauce and in the same way five years later. I shall come to several of the points raised here to-day by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p><span class="col_1077-1078" refersTo="page_0551"/>Let us first go back to the speech he made here on Friday. At the beginning he put two questions to the hon. the Minister. Any reasonable person may expect that if one person puts questions to another, that person should wait for the replies to those questions before taking up a standpoint. But the hon. member did not do so. He put two questions and immediately proceeded to furnishing the replies himself. At the same time he launched an attack on the Minister.</p>

<p>The first question was why the Minister had not made the statement in Parliament that had been made by the president of the Reserve Bank the day before in connection with the relaxation of credit control. Why had he detracted from the rights of Parliament? Sir, we know that the hon. the Minister is a man who upholds the rights and the dignity of this House at all times. But what surprises me is that that question and statement came from a person who was a Minister himself in his time and who ought to know better than the ordinary member of Parliament. Parliament has empowered the Reserve Bank to bring about relaxations in credit control or to tighten such control further in consultation with the Treasury. This is a power that has been laid down in law. Now the hon. member wants to withdraw those powers and return them to the hands of the Minister so that announcements may be made not by the president of the Reserve Bank, but by the Minister here in Parliament. Throughout the years it has been the practice that announcements of this nature of which this was, what is more, not a very important one&#x2014;it was a very small concession&#x2014; are made by the president of the Reserve Bank. Therefore this charge levelled by the hon. member was completely unreasonable and unfair. I may say that it was false.</p>

<p>The second charge was of a more serious nature. He referred to the so-called &#x201C;credibility gap&#x201D;. He said the Minister had made one statement in the House of Assembly and had made another statement in the Senate that evening. In the second place he referred to what the State President had said in his Opening Address and alleged that the hon. the Minister had subsequently made a different statement. These are the two examples he quoted to prove that the hon. the Minister was a &#x201C;prime example of a credibility gap&#x201D;. This is a serious accusation. If only the hon. member had waited until he had received his replies! But he did not wait. Firstly, the hon. the Minister said in this House that he did not expect a relaxation of exchange control as he would not solve the gold marketing problem within the foreseeable future. The hon. member ought to know that things move quickly on the economic scene. The information one has that day and the day after is not that which one has that evening. To me the United Party seems to think very slowly and move even more slowly. After the hon. the Minister had made the statement in this House, he received information that very day that negotiations in connection with gold sales which had been in progress for many months had been successful. The Minister was then faced with the question whether he should first wait before making a statement in that regard which would enable exchange control to be relaxed slightly or whether he had to make the statement immediately. What is in the interests of the country? It is in the interests of the country and of the public that the hon. the Minister should make a statement immediately when a new situation arises. That very day a new situation arose and he fulfilled his duty towards the country by making a statement immediately and by doing what he had wanted to do for a long time, i.e. to announce a small relaxation of exchange control. In this way he wanted to prevent share prices from climbing even higher and people from burning their fingers even more.</p>

<p>Why did he not give an explanation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visser">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>When a statement is made it is not necessary to give an explanation as well. The hon. the Minister did what the interests of the country required him to do, but hon. members on that side of this House do not realize this. The State President said in his Opening Address that he did not foresee a general relaxation of credit control. What is the difference between saying that a general relaxation of credit control is not being foreseen and that a relaxation of credit control is not being foreseen? There is a big difference between these two statements. Hon. members opposite should develop their powers of comprehension to some extent. If the word &#x201C;general&#x201D; does not have any meaning, why use the word? We who are familiar with these words know that there is a big difference between those two concepts. Hon. members opposite speak of a &#x201C;credibility gap&#x201D;, but I wonder whether they do not have an &#x201C;intelligence gap&#x201D;. We on this side of the House object most strongly to the words used by the hon. member for Constantia, i.e. the so-called &#x201C;credibility gap&#x201D;. These are words which do not suit the hon. member and which are not worthy of him.</p>

<p>I now come to another idea mooted by the hon. member. The hon. member spoke of the possible devaluation of the rand. It is true that when the United Party handed over the reins of government to the National Party in the forties, the position of our monetary unit was such that it had to be devalued. The country was in financial difficulties, there were large balance of payment deficits and our monetary unit had to be devalued.</p>

<p>Your fault. Let us examine the position of our monetary unit under the National Party rule. To-day the rand is one of the strongest monetary units in the world. I am surprised that the hon. member <span class="col_1079-1080" refersTo="page_0552"/>for Constantia put such a question under the circumstances. Surely the hon. member ought to know this. I should like to quote what Dr. Pick, an international monetary expert in America, said about the rand. In a report he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa&#x2019;s currency, one of five at new heights. Dr. Pick, a currency expert, said yesterday in New York that the currencies of only five nations rose to new heights in free market value in the year that ended July 31st. He listed them as the units of China, West Germany, Japan, Rhodesia and South Africa.</block>

<p>This is a testimonial for the National Party; this is a testimonial for South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to Soekor. He virtually accused Soekor of not having made available to the public all the information it had at its disposal. However, the hon. the Minister informed me that that was not correct and that Soekor had, in fact, made available to the public all the information it had at its disposal at that time.</p>

<p>But we have also been hearing another story to-day. As is usually the case, this amendment has once again given rise to a whole number of anomalies. On the one hand we are being blamed for the conditions of inflation; on the other hand we are being accused of over-taxation. The first accusation that hon. member made was that the National Party was overtaxing the public of South Africa.</p>

<p>We do not make any apologies either to the Opposition or to the public because of these surpluses, because for the sake of the public these surpluses are essential. This is being done in order to restrict and to curb public spending which reached a peak in 1969; otherwise the rate of inflation would have been much higher still. Those hon. members speak of the balancing of budgets. But the budget policy is one of the most important measures in the hands of any government to bring about a more or less steady flow in the economy, to combat inflation, if necessary, or to stimulate the economy, if necessary. If to-day we were to allow that instrument to be taken from our hands by budgeting in such a way that the Budget would more or less balance, how would we be able to win the struggle against inflation? Every country in the world has two measures at its disposal, and they are, firstly, the fiscal policy, i.e. the taxes levied and, secondly, the monetary policy. And upon my word, the hon. member for Constantia comes along and says that one of the most important measures employed by every country in the world should not be employed. Can hon. members see what would become of this country if those hon. members were to come into power? We would head for bankruptcy. The hon. member for Pinetown spoke of the decay of the monetary unit under this Government&#x2019;s rule. But if ever they were to come into power there would be a decay of the monetary unit. At the moment, however, our monetary unit is one of the strongest monetary units in the world.</p>

<p>But I again want to refer to over-taxation. I have here with me an edition of the <i>Economic Journal</i>. In this journal details are given of the tax burden in the various countries of the world. A division is made into four or five groups. The first group is that in which taxation as against national income exceeds 25 per cent. Fifteen of the world&#x2019;s major industrial countries fall into this group. South Africa, however, does not fall into this group. The next group of countries is that in which taxation is between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, in other words, somewhat lower than in the case of the first group. In this group we have ten countries and South Africa is not one of these either. Then there is a third group in which taxation amounts to between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. South Africa is in this group. But in this last-mentioned group there are only two countries that are regarded as industrial countries. The first country is Japan and the second is South Africa. There are other countries which fall into this last-mentioned group, but their levels of development are much lower than those of Japan and South Africa. These countries are: the Argentine, Ireland, Finland, Chile, Uruguay, Greece, Algeria, Malaya, Brazil and the Congo. These are the countries in which the tax burden on the public is the same as it is in South Africa.</p>

<p>The ratio of tax to national income of the industrial countries is 31.8 per cent. And what is that of South Africa? It is 16.5 per cent, or virtually one-half. It is interesting to note that the tax burden in 1968-&#x2019;69 was still lower than what it was in 1947. In 1947 the tax burden was 18 per cent. That was in the days when the Opposition was in power, more than 20 years ago. To-day, in spite of the increased obligations of the State and everything it has done for the development of the country, the tax burden is, relatively speaking, still lower than what it was under United Party rule.</p>

<p>How is that!</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. members are as quiet as mice. They do not have an answer. They have made a false accusation against the National Party in this House. It is untrue and hon. members know that it is untrue.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the sales duty. Hon. members have been saying morning, noon and night, that the sales duty would yield an amount of nearly R200 million per annum. <span class="col_1081-1082" refersTo="page_0553"/>A few days ago the hon. the Minister told this House that his estimate, before he delivered his little budget speech, was R112 million. Hon. members must remember that when the hon. the Minister made the estimate of R100 million, that estimate was for 11 months. The amount of R112 million was for 12 months. Now it is true that the hon. the Minister has introduced tax relief amounting to R8 million. The amount of R8 million plus the amount of R112 million give us a total of R120 million. When we deduct one-twelfth, i.e. RIO million, from that amount it gives us a total of R110 million. Where do those hon. members get the amount of R200 million? When I put this simple question to the hon. member for Sea Point&#x2014;and I notice that he is not present here to-day&#x2014;he made a big fuss. They have misled the public. They have not made any calculations. Those hon. members have made a guess with the idea in mind that the higher the guess the greater the impact on the public. Hon. members will be surprised at the extent of which this sales duty is welcomed by John Citizen. This is one of the most equitable taxes that has ever been levied in South Africa. Everyone is very proud of this. For the first time in our history a just contribution is being made towards keeping the machinery of government in motion. Virtually all countries in the world have such a tax. We also know that the sales duty in South Africa is minimal in comparison with other countries. Most countries tax even food and clothing. In South Africa these items are mainly excluded. I am afraid that this story of the sales tax is simply being told in order to catch a few votes.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>Our public is much better informed than that.</p>

<p>I now come to the other point, the question of inflation. First I want to deal with pensioners. Last year an amount of approximately R125 million was paid out in pensions. This year this amount has been increased by virtually 8 per cent. This gives one a further RIO million, therefore a total amount of R135 million per annum. The Government gives a fantastic amount in pensions and this amount is adjusted virtually every year. A pension has never been intended to be the sole means of support of a person. This has never been the case. Do those hon. members want to make of our country and our people a servile people, a people of beggars? I am shocked to hear that they are of the opinion that the Government should make adequate provision by means of old-age pensions for every person who retires so that that person may live on that pension.</p>

<p>But does a person not save while he is working? Are there perhaps any of those hon. members who do not save while they are working? If there is one, let him get up so that I may see what he looks like.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the combatting of inflation. If there ever were deeds on which the Government could look back with pride, those deeds concern this very matter. A few years ago the cost of living in South Africa gave it the fourth and the fifth positions in comparison with other countries. South Africa subsequently moved up to the third position. In 1969 South Africa, as far as this was concerned, experienced a record year; it was one of the best years in our history. Other countries had a rate of inflation of 4 per cent whereas the rate of inflation of the United States was 6J per cent. The countries which had always been doing better than South Africa were Canada, Belgium, the United States of America and Australia, but all of them fell back in 1969. At the end of 1969, the new international year, South Africa, did second best in its struggle against inflation; the best it had done since 1963. South Africa occupied the second position after Germany. This is a testimonial for this National Party, this Government, this Cabinet and for our present Prime Minister. This is a testimonial which the United Party cannot conceal from the people. Listen to what was said by one of their own newspapers, and this will be fairly interesting to them as they never believe our newspapers; I am going to quote from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 31st August, 1969 &#x2026;</p>

<p>I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The brilliant performance of the South African Reserve Bank in gaining control of a runaway economy, holding inflation down to levels which make us the envy of most advanced nations of the world &#x2026;</block>

<p>Hon. member should take cognisance of particularly the last few words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and maintaining a relatively stable pattern of interest rates in contrast to the wild upward swings experienced abroad, serves to confirm the opinion of Will Rogers, the great American folk philosopher.</block>

<p>The <i>Sunday Times</i> says that our position makes us the envy of other countries and then those hon. members come along and accuse this Government! The Secretary for Finance of Western Germany recently said that his government was prepared to accept an annual inflation growth rate of 3 per cent per annum as the normal price for economic growth. <span class="col_1083-1084" refersTo="page_0554"/>Over recent years South Africa has been doing considerably better than that. But this is not all. At the same time South Africa has the highest economic growth rate after Japan. This is an achievement. If the economic growth rate of a country is stationary and in addition it is experiencing inflation, then that is very serious. If a country is developing an inflation in that country is at a high level, like in Japan, then that is fine, but if a country is developing fast and can keep inflation within limits, then that is excellent. These are the achievements of the National Party, [Interjections.] The hon. member cannot deny that.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to a few other points. I have already replied to the points raised by the hon. member for Constantia, but during the no-confidence debate and outside this House in the Press a great deal of criticism was levelled at the hon. the Minister of finance in connection with occurrences on the Stock Exchange. Time does not permit me to reply in great detail to that criticism, but I should like to make three quotations from their Press. The first quotation is from the <i>Sunday Express</i> of 2nd November, 1969, in which the following appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Opposition blames the Minister of finance, Dr. Diederichs, for having started off the recession by a partial lifting of exchange control and by the warnings that stock prices were far too high. It does not seem to us to be a valid indictment of the Minister; a correction was necessary and it was his duty to sound the warning.</block>

<p>The second quotation is from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 5th August, 1969, in which the following appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Looking for scapegoats is an unrewarding exercise and the United Party&#x2019;s efforts to score some points off the Government for the share price debacle would be more impressive if its financial spokesmen had been heard beforehand warning of the slump to come if certain things were not done.</block>

<p>The final quotation is from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 28th September, 1969, in which the following appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No reasonable person has blamed Dr. Diederichs for the stock market slump which followed his announcement of exchange control relaxation in June. Even if he had not made his statement it was inevitable that the market must suffer a severe setback following the credit-backed speculative orgy which drove yields down to ridiculously low levels.</block>

<p>Is it too much to expect that the United Party should also be reasonable people? Here their own newspaper condemns them as being unreasonable, and this is exactly how matters stand. They also know as well as any of us do that the Minister of finance did more than his share to warn the public. As a matter of fact, he could do nothing more. What he did, in fact, do, amounted to a small pinprick and that coincided with the turning point which came. I wish it could have come earlier. A rise and a fall on the Exchange form part of our system of private initiative. What is a fine thing is the fact that the Stock Exchange today is no longer so closely bound up with the course of the economy as it was before. The hon. member for Parktown himself spoke of a depression which would come when the prices were so high; he spoke of a recession and of people who would walk in the streets without employment. I have it all here in Hansard. Sir, the Stock Exchange is very low, and to-day we have the highest figure of employment in our entire history&#x2014;an unemployment figure of only .5 per cent.</p>

<p>Time does not permit me to quote the numerous testimonials I still have here in order to prove that in the economic and financial spheres this Government has been running this country as no other Government has; that to-day South Africa is an economic fortress in Africa and in the world; and that our population is prosperous. In this connection we need only look at the standard of living. During the 30 years from 1918 to 1948 it increased by 54 per cent and in the subsequent 20 years, i.e. from 1948 to 1968, it increased by 56 per cent&#x2014;virtually one and a half times more rapidly than in the days of the United Party Government. The data we have show that this Government is running this country well. For that reason the voters will tell the Cabinet and the National Party to-day, &#x201C;We have appointed you over many and over many you have been faithful; you have done well and have given a good account of your stewardship. We appoint you again to do as you have done up to now&#x201D;. Most people can bear failures, but few can bear success. As regards the National Party, it has learned to live with successes and to master its successes. The United Party, on the other hand, has experienced failure upon failure. On 22nd April, 1970. the electorate will return the National Party to this House &#x2026;</p>

And yet last September it was said that the impression was gaining ground that South Africa had an unstable Government. So, what is true: the hon. member&#x2019;s quotation of the confidence of the rest of the world in us. or what the Prime Minister said in September last year? Because it <span class="col_1085-1086" refersTo="page_0555"/>was the Prime Minister himself who on the 16th September, and later again on the 22nd September, said that the impression was gaining ground overseas that South Africa had an unstable Government.

<p>There again we have proof of the credibility gap. At the opening of this Parliament we had in the speech by the State President, in truth a statement by the Government, that &#x201C;the economy remains very liquid and because there are many visible signs of an increased growth rate no further general relaxation of credit control is considered advisable&#x201D;. And yet the hon. member for Florida takes exception to the hon. member for Constantia querying why the credit ceiling was improved to the extent of 15 per cent within a fortnight of the State President&#x2019;s address. Whom are we to believe? The one minute we had to hear that there was no need for further credit and the next we heard that the ceiling was raised. The hon. member for Florida also referred to the announcement of the hon. the Minister during last session and said that the speech he made afterwards in the Senate was based on news he received from overseas. Why then did the hon. the Minister in making his announcement in the Senate not give those reasons? He made a statement in this House and thereafter he made a statement in the Senate on the gold position without giving as an explanation that what the hon. member for Florida has just said. The hon. member for Florida has not had a word of cheer for the thousands who lost their savings, or a considerable portion thereof, on the Stock Exchange over the last few months&#x2014;not one little bit of cheer. If one looks over the past 22 years of Government finance, one realizes that the position to-day is not as good as it was 22 years ago when we were able to lend Britain R160 million in gold. While I do not propose to traverse the past 22 years I should like to remind the House that despite the optimistic views of successive Ministers relating to an increase in the price of gold, we are fortunate enough to have the floor price of gold fixed, let alone an increase in the price of gold. South African gold mines cannot expect additional revenue through free market sales for at least 18 months. Even a rise in the price of gold depends upon monetary unrest. At the beginning of this year the Minister announced a new agreement negotiated with the I.M.F. in terms of which South Africa received an allocation of paper gold of 33,600,000 dollars (approximately R24 million) in special drawing rights. It must be remembered that the recipients of allocations are bound to accept up to twice of the amount of the allocation from other countries. This means that South Africa is now bound to accept R48 million in addition to its own allocation. There is a strong section of American opinion which is in favour of the demonetization of gold, and the Minister is well aware of that. According to an article which appeared in <i>The Times</i>, as reported in <i>The Star</i> of 5th January, much of the credit for the gold agreement announced by the International Monetary Fund goes to Dr. De Kock, which says sufficiently much to create the widespread hostility created by the aggressive tactics of the Minister after the establishment of a two-tier gold price, and gives one to understand that this official realized that aggression does not pay and that cool-headed diplomacy can win better results. We realize that all the negotiations in regard to gold are difficult, but is it necessary for the Minister to make them more difficult, or is the report in <i>The Times</i> incorrect? We should like to know that. It is an unfortunate report Which appeared in <i>The Times</i>, which gives the credit to Dr. De Kock, and criticizes the Minister, and I would like to know whether the Minister agrees that this report is correct, or is it not? Both sides of the House are in favour of an increased gold price and both sides are in favour of maintaining the present price of gold and increasing it when the opportunity arises. But if the present price of gold is to be maintained, then if the gold reserves of the country are not to be eroded, it is essential that inflation be curtailed or curbed severely. Otherwise we will be eating into our gold reserves: because the increase in inflation puts up mining costs and the increase in mining costs reduces the value of the gold which is below the surface and shortens the life of our gold mines. Is the relaxation of credit which the Minister has announced going to start another wave of inflation, or how does the Minister propose to avoid it? Are the increased credit facilities not going to cause further inflation? If they are not going to cause further inflation, how does the Minister propose to control it?</p>

<p>I am in favour of additional relaxation, but I am asking the Minister how he proposes to control the position so that further inflation will be avoided. The country has been asking for the relaxation of credit. I am not quarrelling with that. Sir, but what I am asking is whether it will cause further inflation, or will it not cause further inflation, and what steps will be taken by the Minister to avoid further inflation. For <span class="col_1087-1088" refersTo="page_0556"/>that reason we ask the Minister to say something in regard to devaluation. I will support what the hon. the member for Constantia has said and I would not have raised the question of devaluation had it not appeared in one of the Government papers. I think it was most unfortunate that it did.</p>

<p>No, I do not have it in front of me. I think the Minister must accept that it appeared in <i>Dagbreek</i> and he will have the opportunity of checking it before he replies. The Minister admitted last session that the financial position of the world was uncertain, and when certain persons are flying kites about inflation I think it is as well that the Minister should discourage such talk as soon as possible. Devaluation will only encourage a further wave of inflation, which is already embarrassing the country.</p>

<p>Over the years the Government has failed in its administration of the finances of the country. We do not query that the economy of the country is sound, but our criticism is in regard to the finances of the country and the administration of the country. Its administration of the country has failed all along the line; it has bungled the boom, and I have a list often headings underlining that failure: (1) failure to provide adequate means for controlling the soaring cost of living; (2) a situation in which long-term interest rates, especially mortgage rates, have reached an all-time high; ask any young couple wanting to borrow money; they will confirm this; (3) the application of the sales tax to certain essential items in the consumer&#x2019;s budget, an item which has already been dealt with at length toy the hon. member for Constantia; (4) inadequate liaison with the Stock Exchange resulting in widespread and large losses on a scale quite unnecessary, even if it were deemed desirable to bring people to their senses or a price worth paying for the gold strategy. I suggest, Sir, that while the hon. the Minister was overseas gambling with the future of gold &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Is that how you see it&#x2014;gambling with the future of gold?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>As I see it the Minister was gambling in that while he was taking the opportunity overseas of trying to get an increased gold price, liquidity at home was increasing and becoming overheated, and as a result of the Minister&#x2019;s trips overseas he was unable to control the position at home. We want an explanation from the Minister as to why that excess liquidity became overheated and resulted in the Stock Exchange debacle with which the country is now faced. We would like to hear what the Minister has to say in that regard. Let met go on with the list of headings which underline the Government&#x2019;s failure: (5) a financial position which has resulted in insufficient housing for those who really need it; (6) a gold sales agreement which has now placed the South African economy in pawn with the International Monetary Fund and amounts to an extraordinary encroachment on our national sovereignty; (7) a manpower situation which is leading to a breakdown of essential services and is assuming the proportions of a national crisis; (8) factors adversely affecting productivity and efficiency in industry and commerce; (9) failing to provide adequate social services linked with sound finance; (10) entering into the Mutual Fund field through the I.D.C.</p>

<p>Sir, there is not time to deal with all these matters in detail. The past year has seen the effect of the Government&#x2019;s hesitancy in the finances of the country. While the Minister was overseas he was allowing excess liquidity to build up in South Africa, thus providing a climate for speculation. The building society movement was in dire straits a year ago, and it was only when they were on the brink of disaster that the Minister took steps to assist the building society movement. The embarrassment would not have been nearly as great had the Minister acted with more alacrity. As to whether the Minister is culpable, that was certainly the case when he spoke at the end of last session. The Minister then said this (Hansard vol. 27, col. 8385)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we were to succeed in solving the problem of marketing gold and if we would obtain the foreign exchange and by so doing relax our exchange control and send more money to countries abroad, I am convinced the share prices on the Exchange would show a downward trend. Once share prices on the Exchange show a downward trend, people would be more inclined to invest in fixed interest-bearing securities which include building societies. One of the reasons why the building societies are experiencing the difficulties to-day is the very fact that people do not want to invest in fixed interest-bearing securities because they want to play on the Exchange which is rising all the time.</block>

<p><span class="col_1089-1090" refersTo="page_0557"/>That was on 18th June, when the Minister was speaking on the last financial Bill dealt with in this House last session. On the same day and after he had made this speech in this House, the Minister made a statement in the Senate (col. 4164) and that statement included the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the first place the Exchange control will act more leniently in regard to the relaxations announced in my statement of 31st July, 1968, particularly in so far as foreign direct investment by South African residents and the transfer abroad of the local sale proceeds of non-resident-owned direct investments in South Africa are concerned. Secondly, the exchange control will now consider applications from recognized South African financial institutions to make portfolio investments in foreign shares and securities which are quoted only on foreign stock exchanges.</block>

<p>In view of what the Minister said, although he may not have had that intention, his speech certainly had the effect of accelerating the downward trend on the Stock Exchange. Is there any significance in the fact that the market started to go down about a week before the 18th? Certain big finance houses had started to sell. Did they know that the Minister was going to take steps to depress the market? Since last June it is estimated that the share market has shed a staggering R5,000 million. But that does not explain away the misery, the anxiety and the worry of thousands of South Africans who are not speculators on the Stock Exchange but who invested in mutual funds. Many put their life savings into these funds, because they thought they were safe. They were invited to invest in mutual funds as a cushion against inflation. A year or two ago I criticized the flamboyant claims of some mutual funds, and certainly criticized the wisdom of the Government in taking a direct interest in them. In the early days of the development of the mutual fund movement, the salesmen of one of the main funds, in which the I.D.C. had an interest, were quoting that particular fund as the safest fund to invest in because it was backed by the Government. It was not backed by the Government, Sir. but the Government had an interest in it. The glossy pictures of a board room with the directors of the I.D.C. sitting in it, must have had an effect on the ordinary investors. The ordinary investor was not speculating on the Stock Exchange. He was told that to invest in a mutual fund was to help curb inflation. It was made perfectly clear to him that the value of money was decreasing, that the cost of living was going up and that inflation was continuing. He was told that, to avoid inflation, mutual funds were the answer. Can one blame the people for investing in the mutual funds, after seeing the Minister&#x2019;s nominees on the Board, appearing on a glossy brochure, and encouraging people to invest in those funds? All that has been said this after noon by the Government side, has not given any encouragement to, or shown any sympathy for the thousands of persons who invested in the mutual funds, and for those many people who invested their life savings in those funds. We still have had no explanation from the Minister as to who they hold culpable.</p>

<p>The Minister indicated that there would be about six mutual funds. There are now ten or more mutual funds. I do not wish to mention these funds by name, but I should like to refer to the statement made recently by the Minister when he commented on N.F.I., and said:</p>

<block name="quote">With reference to the suspension yesterday of dealings in N.F.I. shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the acting Chairman of the Company explained to me that the Board of the Company has requested this suspension because of the uncertainty which might arise as a result of changes in the management of the Company. These changes occurred as a result of certain administrative problems which had arisen, but the Board is convinced that these problems will be resolved shortly.</block>

<p>Last year the Minister came to the rescue of the building society movement. I should like to know whether he now intends coming to the rescue of the mutual fund movement, or does he intend to come to the rescue of any particular institution? I have no quarrel with mutual funds, provided that they are on a sound basis. The public have been led to believe that this was a safe investment, and the public have been caught. I do not suggest that the I.D.C. is directly interested in the N.F.I. organization, but I do suggest that it is indirectly connected. People are concerned about the I.D.C. being interested in the private sector. I want to know how far this incursion into the private sector is going to continue. Can one blame the ordinary citizen who wishes to invest when he is assured by the salesman that the organization is backed by the Government and must have Government support because it has I.D.C. directors connected with the mutual fund movement? I cannot do better in this regard than to refer to a leading article which appeared in the <i>Daily News</i> a few days ago. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">If Johannesburg wishes to be taken seriously in world financial circles in future, it had better avoid any more fiascos in the National Fund Investments mould. Here is a sad tale of a company which derives its profits from the sale of mutual funds units embarking on a venture which disrupted the entire financial scene and brought about frustration and unhappiness to many.</block>

<p>One sees money flowing out of building societies into mutual funds and the stock market. Now we are finding that that money is either being lost, or coming back to the building societies again. We have been conditioned by <span class="col_1091-1092" refersTo="page_0558"/>the Minister to lose faith in money because it is steadily losing its value. The tragedy is that the ordinary man in the street suffers because he has so foolishly put his trust in investments which he thinks have the backing of the Government. The Government took an interest through the I.D.C. in a field which the I.D.C. should avoid. We find that no less a person than Mr. Barlow, the head of the Barlow Organization, has said: &#x201C;The Government must make up its mind whether South Africa has a free enterprise economy or one that will follow the European pattern of increasing Government interference in industry.&#x201D; He made several criticisms of Government policy in the annual report of one of the biggest industrial companies which has more than 11 thousand employees and 200 factories in Great Britain and South Africa. When a person of that calibre says that it is uncertain how one should invest in the future, because one does not know when one is going to meet the I.D.C. coming round the corner, I think it is time we took notice of that. What we are concerned about is not having so many persons making money. We need more people in factories turning out goods. To-day it is far easier to pick up a telephone receiver and telephone the Stock Exchange than it is to telephone Pretoria to try to query a permit about industrial planning or even to try to get a few Bantu for one&#x2019;s staff. It is a sad state of affairs at a time when the country should be producing more goods and services that in fact far too much time is spent upon those who try to make money out of money. To-day we are short of manpower. We know that the ordinary man sees his life savings disappear and faces the dilemma of a depreciating rand and the cult of the equity. The few may be happy with a few quick tax free profits but the man in the street feels that he has been cheated. It is time for a change and the sooner the change comes, the better.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pinetown, who has just sat down, had a long list of charges against the government. Before dealing with his list of charges, I just want to say a few words about the &#x201C;credibility gap&#x201D; of which the hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Pine-town spoke. They spoke of the credibility of the hon. the Minister of finance. The hon. member for Constantia spoke of the lack of credibility on the part of the hon. the Minister of finance because he had had it announced in the State President&#x2019;s Address that there would not be a general relaxation of credit control and then announced last Friday that there would be a further selective relaxation of credit control. Now, it so happens that the hon. member for Constantia probably reads only the English-language newspapers, and that certain newspapers omitted the word &#x201C;general&#x201D; in their reports on the State President&#x2019;s Address. But in point of fact the hon. member for Constantia has no excuse, because he had after all heard that speech himself and if he had forgotten it, he could simply have referred to his Minutes of Proceedings, in which that address is reproduced word for word. In the State President&#x2019;s Address it is explicitly stated: no further general relaxation of credit control is deemed advisable at this stage&#x201D;. What the hon. the Minister announced here last Friday, is a certain selective relaxation of credit control. There is a world of difference between this section of the State President&#x2019;s Address, which appears on page 4, should the hon. member want to know where it can be found, i.e. a general relaxation of credit control, and a selective relaxation. The hon. member for Constantia also spoke of the lack of credibility on the part of the Minister of finance because last year, when introducing the sales duty, he allegedly gave the assurance that it would not affect the necessities of life, and when the list of taxable items appeared, the hon. member did in fact find necessities of life on that list. But let us see what the hon. the Minister said in his speech when he introduced the Budget. The hon. the Minister said very explicitly (Hansard, 26th March, 1969, column 3249)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A broad tax of this kind cannot be painless &#x2026;</block>

<p>He elaborated on this and said that if he were to have introduced such a tax on luxury and semi-luxury articles only, the rate would have had to be too high and he would have frustrated his own object. Therefore the basis was a relatively broad basis of consumer goods, which would cause as few hardships as possible to the lower income groups. But he stated very explicitly, and I repeat it, that &#x201C;a broad tax of this kind cannot be painless&#x201D;. On the basis of these incorrect quotations of the hon. the Minister of finance by the hon. member for Constantia in two respects, the hon. member, as well as the hon. member for Pinetown, tried to make out a case that this Minister and this Government could no longer be believed. What a scandalous representation! These matters were completely misrepresented.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown elaborated very extensively on his ten reasons why the government had failed. He started by referring to the high cost of living. But after the hon. member for Florida had anticipated him and had proved in advance that the increase in our cost of living was among the lowest in the whole world, the hon. member probably paged hurriedly past that part of his speech. Then he came to the major topic which is now being discussed so widely, namely the severe losses which the general public have allegedly suffered as a result of the slump on the Stock Exchange. Then the hon. the Minister of finance was accused that his speech in the Senate on 18th June last year had started off this severe slump and had caused it to gain momentum as time went on. That is, of course, very far-fetched and entirely unfounded, because I do not think there is one economist, businessman or financial student of note in the <span class="col_1093-1094" refersTo="page_0559"/>country who would agree with the Opposition that it was this speech by the Minister of finance which caused the Stock Exchange to develop such a sharply declining tendency. Furthermore, this declining tendency on the Stock Exchange would perhaps have been firmly arrested three or four months ago already, had it not been for the appearance on the political horizon of a small party which has been blown up by the Opposition Press into something big. The Stock Exchange, as is known by everyone who occasionally has something to do with it&#x2014;including me&#x2014;is a very sensitive instrument which is very easily affected by, <i>inter alia</i>, political events. If hon. members would look at a graph of the Stock Exchange&#x2014;I have a copy here in front of me&#x2014;they would see that from the peak reached in May there was a constant drop till October. Then the Stock Exchange made a right-about turn. From October it started rising fairly sharply and in November the rise gained momentum. But in the second half of November it suddenly changed and then dropped further and further. If one examines this graph against the background of political events in our country, one finds that the Hertzog group was established in October. On 24th and 25th October they held a national congress in Pretoria. [Interjections.] Hon. members may become fidgety, but I shall prove with chapter and verse how such an event can in fact exert an influence on the Stock Exchange. I have here a very interesting letter which I shall read to this House in order to prove my statement. This foundation congress on 24th and 25th October was a fairly tame affair, but things did not remain so tame for long. In the meanwhile the English Press in South Africa blew up this small new party into something big. They vied to outdo one another in their eagerness to blow up this small party into something almighty. They hoped that the mighty National Party could be hurt in this way. A few weeks later, on 7th November, this small party produced its declaration of policy in that small 20 cent booklet of theirs. In this declaration of policy it is stated that Afrikaans shall be the official language of South Africa, with English as a second language. We on this side of this House received that announcement with a philosophical laugh up our sleeves. We were aware that we had entered a referendum contest nine years ago with the very explicit undertaking towards our English-speaking fellow-countrymen that they should help us to bring about the Republic with the explicit reaffirmation of the principle of equal language rights. Consequently we were not very worried about that declaration of policy. However, many English-speaking people read only the English Press, and the same applies to many investors on the Stock Exchange. They had a terrible fright. I should like to give hon. members an example of the bad fright they had. This morning I received a registered letter from a person in Pietermaritzburg. This person is English-speaking and, to judge from his handwriting, pro bably elderly. The letter was written in consequence of an article which had appeared in the <i>Natal Witness</i>. According to that report I had, at a meeting in Fish Hoek called upon English-speaking people to take part in the government of the country. In this letter, <i>inter alia</i> the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your party&#x2019;s policy is separate development and homelands. Dr. Hertzog and his followers are a proof of this desire. It could be brought about this way and still keep the country a unity. Keep bilingualism but zone the languages, Afrikaans in the west, historically settled by you first, and English in the east, where the English settled in numbers. The English-speaking zone would be Johannesburg, South-Eastern Transvaal, Natal and the eastern half of the Cape Province. West of this would be administered in the Afrikaans language, but the clerks at the railway ticket Offices, post Office counters and other Offices would be bilingual. The English section would be treated the same.</block>

<p>Then these remarkable words follow: &#x201C;This would eliminate the dominance of one language over the other&#x201D;. From this one can see into what depths of fear this English-speaking person has been plunged by that declaration. He already believes that Afrikaans will dominate his beloved English language. I wanted to show this House that the fear existing among the English-speaking people, also those on the Stock Exchange, is not so far-fetched. I must, however, admit that I do not know who wrote the letter, because it is unsigned. In the last paragraph of the letter it is merely stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am not signing my name. It is not the person that counts; the ideas are the potent things.</block>

<p>I therefore want to call on the <i>Natal Witness</i> to please assure this man that he has nothing to fear. I would be very glad if he would get in touch with me through the columns of the <i>Natal Witness</i> so that I may reassure him. I am very keen to have a discussion with him so that I may reassure him. In the meanwhile I should like to reassure all English-speaking people that, in spite of what this small party now has in its programme of principles, we on this side of the House shall never never commit a breach of faith against our English-speaking fellow-citizens of this country. I want to give the English-speaking investor, not only in South Africa, but also abroad, the assurance that this small party which wants to interfere with the language rights of the English-speaking people will most certainly be wiped out from the political scene in South Africa on 22nd April. Furthermore, not only will this little party disappear from the political scene in South Africa, but the National Party will emerge from this election as a stronger party. Nothing inspires as much confidence in the investing public as a strong government does.</p>

<p><span class="col_1095-1096" refersTo="page_0560"/>There are of course other factors as well which exert an influence on the Stock Exchange and which have contributed towards the slump which the Stock Exchange experienced. I should just like to point out one factor. In 1968 there was still a net capital inflow of R446 million into the country. In 1969, however, it decreased to R70 million. What caused this? Unfortunately, foreign investors in South Africa also draw their advice mainly from the English Press in South Africa. Need one wonder, then, why they lost their confidence in our investment possibilities and in our economic stability after they had heard about this little party, which is being blown up to such large proportions by the English Press? But I would much prefer to point out a few economic and financial factors which have led to this recession on the Stock Exchange. I cannot resist the temptation to refer to the attack which, a decade ago, was made regularly every year from that side of this House, and especially by the former member for Jeppes. I still recall very clearly how the then member for Jeppes as regularly as clockwork at every Budget referred the government to the fine example which America set in the form of their &#x201C;deficit budgeting&#x201D; and which was worth following. He referred to this almost as regularly as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition at that time held up the wonderful example of the political federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland to this Government. In every no-confidence debate the hon. the Leader of the Opposition held up to one government what a great success that Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was. Now we never hear about it any more, because it has been written off permanently. But just as regularly the then member of Jeppes held up to us the great advantage of &#x201C;deficit budgeting&#x201D;, which has now resulted in its being generally said that the average man in America to-day is living on the salary or wage which he will be earning in two years&#x2019; time, because that deficit budgeting has worked through to the man in the street. In our case, incidentally, it has been calculated that to-day the average man is living on the income which he will be earning in 14 weeks&#x2019; time. As I have said, it is calculated as being two years ahead in America. This house of cards must of course collapse sooner or later. This has resulted in inflation getting so out of hand in America to-day that the percentage for the past year was 6&#x00BD;, as against the 3.3 per cent of South Africa. The result of this is that the American Government now has to apply the strictest measures in order to check this tremendous inflation. All this means that money becomes more expensive. Only recently the American Government had to offer as much as 101/4 per cent on an 18-month loan, while a very large business undertaking had to offer 103/4 per cent for a short-term loan. All these factors are having a dampening effect on the Stock Exchange. As long as investors can obtain 10 per cent or more on their fixed deposits, the Stock Exchange is no longer so attractive to them. This is after all a perfectly normal economic fact, and this is precisely what is happening in our case. Hon. members must not think that the fact that interest rates are high in America at the moment, has no influence on our interest rates. As long as interest rates are high in one country, that country inevitably draws capital from other countries and drains them of the capital they require. For this reason the supply of capital in South Africa is so much less. The whole world is one economy to-day. Consequently the higher interest rates in America must necessarily influence us as well. They must necessarily have a dampening effect on our Stock Exchange as well.</p>

<p>Although I have said all these things which contain no message of hope for the investor on the Stock Exchange&#x2014;the hon. member for Pinetown said sneeringly that the hon. the Minister of finance had no message of hope for the investors who have lost so many millions on die Stock Exchange&#x2014;I nevertheless have a message of hope for those investors.</p>

<p>The hon. member next to me here has apparently lost money too. I have a message of hope for the investor on the Stock Exchange, and that is that after 22nd April we shall no longer have this impotent little party which wants to interfere with the language rights of the English-speaking people, on our political scene. [Interjections.] I want to repeat that I spoke of the impotent party. But much more than that, this country with its Stock Exchange and with its investors on the Stock Exchange will then enter a new period of prosperity and welfare, led by a very strong government. This is my message of hope to the investors of South Africa and, incidentally, also to foreign investors on our Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>I should like to conclude, but I cannot omit to address a few words of thanks to the hon. the Minister of finance for announcing in his Budget Speech last Friday that the bonus system in regard to old-age pensions will now be consolidated with basic pensions. As recently as the 8th of April last year I pleaded that the bonus system be abolished and consolidated. On that occasion I said, and I quote from column 3544 of Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The means and pensions limit must never be less than the pension received by a person from his basic pension plus bonuses. In other words, the bonus system must be abolished and instead of allocating additional bonuses, the means and pension limit must be adjusted each time a change is made in the pension.</block>

<p>I am very pleased to hear that these bonuses are now going to be consolidated with the basic pension and that an adjustment will also be made in respect of the means test. I understand <span class="col_1097-1098" refersTo="page_0561"/>that the R2 which will be granted with effect from 1st April will be consolidated together with the R5 which was granted in the past. I am also glad to hear that the new means test of private income plus pension is to be increased from R528 to R612. This is a very valuable concession, not only for our poorest people, but also for those who did not spend all their money in the course of their lives, but saved enough so that they would have something for their old age. Therefore I just want to emphasize again that I hope that in the future we shall do away completely with this system of bonuses in the case of old-age and other pensions. I also hope that whenever we increase the pension, we shall not do so by means of a bonus, but by means of an increase of the basic pension, with commensurate increases in respect of the private means plus pension limits. Then I foresee that our people will themselves save more and more, because when a man sees that when he saves he is never worse off than the man who has saved less or nothing at all, it will be an incentive for him to save enough for his old age during his working life. Then I foresee for this country not a nation of beggars to whom the Government must constantly distribute alms, but a nation of people who use their hands to work so that they may provide for themselves, their families and their old age.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I knew that my hon. friend the member for Paarl had a special interest in Herstigte meetings, but when he talked about the Herstigtes having been responsible for bringing down the share market since November and when he suggested that after April the 22nd if the Nationalist Party gets back to power, the market will go up, it seemed to me that he did not live with a credibility gap but with a credibility chasm.</p>

<p>I have been taken to task by some of the Nationalist newspapers for a statement that I made on the 25th May last year, in which I said that high prices on the Stock Exchange are here to stay and that prices will even rise higher. I said that, and I make no apologies for having said so. However, I did add that my projection was long-term and that the market was likely to drop if exchange control was relaxed, although probably only for a short period. But I made one serious mistake and I admit it quite frankly, and that is that I failed to take into account that the hon. the Minister of finance, whose clarion call to the country a short while before, was &#x201C;work and save and invest for prosperity&#x201D;, would decide just when the public did that, that he was going to bring down Stock Exchange prices so that funds could flow into fixed interest investments. I failed to take into account that in South Africa we have a Government which was incompetent, a Government which was far removed from realities, a Government which was determined to put impracticable ideologies before the well-being of the people, a Government which lived by <i>ad hoc</i> action and not by long term planning, a Government where a statement by one Minister was contradicted by the statement of another hon. Minister, a Government which blew hot one day and cold the next day, a Government which vacillated <i>ad nauseum</i>, and that this Government by its own actions could create a state of affairs which one would not have believed to have been possible. One would have expected the hon. the Minister to look after these small investors whom he had persuaded to invest their money in the market. Because they were small investors. They had heard not only every hon. Minister on that side of the House, but also every hon. member on that side, telling the country of the fantastic prosperity under this Government, and the man in the street wanted a part of this prosperity, so they took their savings and made the investments, and then the hon. the Minister of finance bust the market.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>We all know of the statement that was made by the hon. the Minister of finance in this House on the morning of 18th June, and the statement he made in the Other Place the same afternoon. I do not want to repeat them, but I do want to point out that in both these statements the emphasis by the hon. the Minister was that there could only be relaxation in exchange control if there were a gold marketing resettlement; and on the morning of the 18th the hon. the Minister told us in regard to the gold marketing problem that there was no imminent solution to this problem. But how could the hon. the Minister that same afternoon announce a relaxation in exchange control? How could he on the same day in the Other Place drop his bombshell by announcing that funds would now be allowed to leave South Africa for investment abroad? In the morning the Minister had the funnel tightly closed; funds would not be allowed out of South Africa, a bull point for the market, but some hours later the funnel was wide open and the market slide began. Did the hon. the Minister not know when he spoke in this House what he was going to do the same day in the Other Place? Now the hon. member for Florida says that the hon. the Minster got information from overseas that afternoon which forced him to make that statement. But the Minister had said in this House in the morning that there was only one set of circumstances under which he could change his policy of applying exchange control, and that was a settlement in regard to the sale of gold. Is the hon. member for Florida telling us then that in the afternoon the Minister had settled his gold problem, but did not tell the House so until 31st December last year? That was the position; it is as clear as daylight: no relaxation of exchange control unless there is a gold settlement, but in the afternoon he announced a relaxation of exchange control, and the hon. member for Florida says it was done because <span class="col_1099-1100" refersTo="page_0562"/>of information from overseas. Or was the whole operation designed to further the determination of the hon. the Minister of finance that the market had to be brought down? Why did the hon. the Minister of finance not tell the country what amount of foreign exchange he was prepared to allow to leave the country, thus leaving the people and the country under the impression that in effect exchange control had virtually been abolished? Because that was the impression, Sir. I think the answer is self-evident. The hon. the Minister had made up his mind that prices on the Stock Exchange were too high and that they had to come down, and he succeeded only too well. Since May of last year the index of the London Stock Exchange has fallen by 10.2 per cent; it went down and it went up again. The New York Stock Exchange fell by 12.7 per cent, and in South Africa it fell by 25.4 per cent. But to show the fruitlessness of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement in the Other Place, on 21st August, exactly two months later, the Minister re-imposed the full curb on foreign exchange leaving the country. So, what was the purpose of the statement in the Other Place two months earlier? Of course, we were not surprised, Sir. We have lived too long with a Government which changes its financial policies overnight. Its major achievement has been to create uncertainty permanently in this country, and the hon. the Minister knows it is true. He said so himself in an article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on the 8th of this month. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I feel, in any event, that industralists who feel uncertain can only benefit by promptly taking up their cases with the authorities concerned and clearing away uncertainty rather than remaining in a state of indecision.</block>

<p>How can the financier or the industrialist be other than in a state of indecision when changes in Government policy are taking place from day to day and from week to week, and they have to go to some Minister or to some official to find out what they can do and what they cannot do? Does the hon. the Minister not believe that industry is being affected by this uncertainty and that it is also affecting what the hon. the Minister has called the psychological drop in the market? The Government&#x2019;s tight control of labour is already confining our productivity, and now through the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill it will completely and utterly take control of all Bantu labour in South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration has wide powers already. How and when is he going to use his new powers? This is the vital question. The F.C.I. has already said that arbitrary control of labour, which has created localized critical shortages and escalating wages, threatens to put some industries on the scrap-heap. The Government had further warnings last week on the labour position in the publication of Union Acceptances&#x2019; &#x201C;Economic and Financial Review&#x201D;, and by Mr. Jan Marais of Trust Bank. With the new powers the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration is taking, things might be very much worse. Until last week there had been no meaningful relaxation in the credit squeeze, despite the comments of bankers and industrialists and economists, but in the short space of two weeks the hon. the Minister has changed his mind again, and quite frankly we are not impressed by dwelling on the word &#x201C;general&#x201D;, or &#x201C;algemene&#x201D;. Nobody to-day knows where he stands, neither the industrialist nor the investor. They have to try to assess from day to day and from month to month just what pace the hon. the Minister is going to set. No wonder there is a lack of confidence, psychological or otherwise.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s handling of the gold situation saw a rise in the price of gold from 35 dollars an ounce to well over 40 dollars an ounce, and a subsequent drop again to below 35 dollars an ounce, hardly a bull point on the market. Now it is easy for the Minister to say that the drop in the market is largely psychological, but I would say that the ineptness of the Government is the major contributing factor, and to illustrate this I want to deal in some detail with the gold agreement.</p>

<p>On 31st December last the hon. the Minister told the country that he had made what he called a new arrangement for the marketing of gold. We in the Opposition have been in a very difficult position in regard to the problems of marketing our gold. At no time during the long negotiations undertaken by the hon. the Minister did he really give us any information on the actual course of events, and I admit quite frankly that I did not expect him to. The hon. the Minister could not be expected to shout from the housetops what he was doing in his negotiations with the countries abroad. But in addition, because the issue was so vital to South Africa, we had to be more than circumspect in what we said. We wanted in no way to embarrass either the hon. the Minister or the Government. It was not in the interests of the country that we should rock the boat even if we disagreed with what the hon. the Minister was doing. The issue was much too big for South Africa to be made a political issue. The same applied to our bankers, our economists and our financial commentators. I think they are to be congratulated on the responsible way in which they dealt with this question of gold. Because of the complexity of the issue and its vital importance to the country the hon. the Minister was virtually given a free hand; he made the play without outside intervention. But it is abundantly clear now that the Minister failed in what he set out to achieve. He gambled and lost. His unilateral decisions misfired. Because what were the Minister&#x2019;s objectives? He spelt them out very clearly in a debate we had in this House last February. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1101-1102" refersTo="page_0563"/>South Africa has the right to buy foreign exchange from the Fund against payment in gold.</block>

<p>Clearly an unrestricted right&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The possibility of a further flow of newly-minded gold to monetary reserves&#x2014;irrespective of the price on the free market&#x2014; must be maintained. South Africa cannot undertake to refuse requests from other monetary authorities to buy gold at the official price. The attempt at divorcing so-called monetary and newly-mined gold permanently, must be reviewed.</block>

<p>At the time I reacted to the Minister&#x2019;s four conditions by saying that I believed them to be fair and reasonable. I added this one important rider, however,&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question is, when are the other monetary authorities of the Western world and the United States going to accept our views?</block>

<p>Here, Sir, we have the crux of the matter. We knew and the hon. the Minister should certainly have known that there was not the remotest possibility of his conditions being accepted, particularly by the United States of America. This does not mean, Sir, that the Minister was wrong in the validity of the objectives which he set himself and we as a responsible Opposition lent him our support. Let me be quite clear, Mr. Speaker. However critical we may be of the line which the Minister took over the past two years, this must in no way be interpreted as an acceptance of the attitude of the United States. If the view of the United States had prevailed, we might have been faced with a demonetization of gold, with the world on a dollar standard, and however much this might have suited the United States we, like the hon. the Minister, do not believe that such a step, certainly not at this stage, would have been in the best interests of the monetary system of the world. Where the hon. the Minister went wrong, firstly, was in setting himself objectives which he should have known were completely incapable of achievement, and secondly, in basing his whole financial strategy on his ability to attain a higher price for gold and so embarrass the dollar.</p>

<p>Let me finish, Sir. The hon. the Minister will have an opportunity to answer me. When the two-tier system was introduced in 1968 the hon. the Minister had two options, either freely to dispose of his gold on the free market as long as he received not less than 35 dollars an ounce or, alternatively, to withhold his gold from the free market in an endeavour to force the price of gold up as high as possible beyond 35 dollars an ounce. Those were the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s two options. The hon. the Minister chose the latter course. One would have thought that after March, 1969, the hon. the Minister would have gone overseas at the earliest possible opportunity for discussions with the monetary authorities and his own people so that he could assess the position for himself. But, no, he sat here in his ivory tower and relied on the homespun advice that if he was tough enough, he would get what he wanted. I believe that this was one of the main reasons for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s choice of options; I believe he was completely out of touch with the real position and that he was particularly out of touch with American thinking.</p>

<p>I also believe that he failed to realize how isolated South Africa had become from the listening posts of the world. We do not know to-day what is going on. I believe the hon. the Minister failed to realize that the European countries were really not on our side and that any opposition to United States policy was entirely in their own interests. They did not have the slightest concern for South Africa. I believe that the hon. the Minister, perhaps like many of us, had been propagating a rise in the price of gold for so long that he had become the victim of his own propaganda. He had talked himself into believing that a rise in the price of gold was inevitable. Sir, after the two-tier system was introduced and the price of gold rose to over 40 dollars an ounce, he believed that this rise was probably permanent, completely misinterpreting international opinion and having no regard to the facts of the international gold scene or to modern economic thought which was developing new monetary concepts such as S.D.R.s which we know the hon. the Minister did not like. I do not say that I blame him for not liking them. But the strangest aspect of all, Sir, is this: While the hon. the Minister was warning the clerks and typists against speculation on the Stock Exchange he was being the worst offender. He was not hedging his bets; he was gambling on a permanent rise in the price of gold. But there was this difference: While the clerks and typists might have burned their own fingers, with the hon. the Minister holding the flame, his gamble affected the economy of South Africa. Because we had difficulty in exchanging gold for foreign currency we had to live with tightened exchange control.</p>

<p>It was the strategy of the hon. the Minister that caused the hothouse conditions that led to the Stock Exchange boom which ended so disastrously for so many in June, 1969. Excess liquidity, as we all know, reached astronomical figures, but it did not find its way into private investment or consumer spending. The hon. the Minister told us this in a speech two years ago. It found its way into the Stock Exchange as a safety valve. It was the lifeblood that was pumped into the Stock market <span class="col_1103-1104" refersTo="page_0564"/>day after day, lifting prices higher and higher, despite the credit squeeze with which we are still living to-day. Sir, I accept the avarice of the Stock Exchange gambler, but the tragedy of the situation is that in tens of thousands of cases, it is the investor, not the gambler who is licking his wounds. And when I talk about the investor, I do not mean the capitalist or entrepreneur; I mean the little man to whom the hon. the Minister appealed not so long ago. Sir, there is no &#x201C;thank the Minister&#x201D; in this situation, except perhaps from the bears or the financiers.</p>

<p>Yes, I will come to that in a minute. The price of gold then dropped below the official price and now negotiating from weakness instead of from strength we had to capitulate, and all the sacrifices we had made in the two years to protect our gold position were in vain. Not a single one of the four objectives which the Minister set out to achieve has been attained in this agreement.</p>

<p>Instead we find ourselves no longer the gold monopolists of the world and we have lost our sovereignty in so far as gold is concerned. By our own actions we have shown the world that the one commodity in which we are vulnerable is our greatest asset, our gold. The prestige of gold has suffered a severe shock and its value in the world&#x2019;s monetary system is looking more than a little tarnished. I suppose that an official price of more than 35 dollars an ounce is today an exploded dream.</p>

<p>But what if the hon. the Minister had taken the other alternative and had fed the market with gold at 35 dollars or 36 dollars an ounce? It might well have been that we would have seen an orderly advance in the price of gold on the free market over a period of time, instead of a rapid high followed by a disastrous drop. If we had accepted a free market price of 35 dollars to 37 dollars an ounce, I believe there would have been no need to enter into the agreement which we have just entered into; we would have remained free agents and we would have been masters of our own destiny. If we had not by our own strategy forced the price of gold up to an unacceptable high price to the rest of the world, but had instead fed the free market freely, this would have caused no concern to the rest of the world. The fact that the hon. the Minister was completely out of touch with events is abundantly clear from the amazing statement which he made in his speech on Friday. This is what he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Strangely enough, I think the factor which eventually made it possible for us to reach a satisfactory understanding was the decline in the gold price on the private market to wards the end of 1969, since this increased the pressure on the other countries concerned to reach some agreement.</block>

<p>There was nothing strange about this, Sir. It is the basis of my whole criticism of the hon. the Minister. It is the one salient factor that the hon. the Minister failed to take into account, namely the fact that if the price of gold on the free market had been kept at a level near the official price, he would have had no problem. This the hon. the Minister says is strange. He says it is strange that he managed to achieve an agreement when the price was low. This is the very thing he should have done. Instead of pushing the price up to 40 dollars and then letting it drop to below 30 dollars, there should have been an orderly advance. He would then have had no problem. The arrangement for the marketing of gold clearly shows that the Western world, and particularly the United States, cannot at this stage tolerate a gold price which is less than 35 dollars an ounce. Their own vested interests make a price of under 35 dollars an ounce absolutely impossible. We could have exchanged an orderly advance of the free market price of gold for our own gold freedom, but we chose to act differently. Because the United States was concerned with its own position, with perhaps scant consideration for the rights and wrongs of the issue, we are now shackled with the restrictions of the December agreement. No credit is due to the hon. the Minister as a result of this agreement. He could and should have done better.</p>

<p>One of the nine points of the Nationalist election programme now makes strange reading. Let me quote it. It reads as follows: &#x201C;Hoe hy (they are talking about the hon. the Prime Minister) die neteligste ekonomiese vraagstuk, die goudvraagstuk, altyd in Suid-Afrika se guns gestuur het.&#x201D; I wonder whether the hon. the Minister of finance would to-day write this point into the Nationalist election programme. I wonder whether the country is not entitled to ask whether the hon. the Minister is the right man to be entrusted with the economic future of South Africa.</p>

<p>Like other members of this House, Sir, I am conscious of the fact that there is an election on 22nd April. The voters of South Africa will then choose the government of this country for the next five years. They will have a choice of five political parties, a choice of five political philosophies &#x2014;from the Progressive Party on the left to the Herstigtes on the right. When I am asked, as I am going to be asked: &#x201C;Why should I vote for your party?&#x201D; my answer will be a very simple one. It is this: In the world in which we live, there is one inexorable law, the law of evolution, the law of development by natural processes from a position that already exists. It is a fundamental law which is so <span class="col_1105-1106" refersTo="page_0565"/>commonly ignored, both by the conservatives on the right and the radicals on the left. The Nationalist Party live under the illusion that they can stop evolution and even reverse it. We know that they cannot be any more successful than were the efforts of King Canute when he demonstrated to his court his inability to stop the waves of the sea. The Progressive Party at the other extreme, live under another illusion, namely that they can start from scratch, ignoring the way of life and the conventions we have inherited from the past, endeavouring to impose a political system on the country that the electorate is not prepared to accept.</p>

<p>Our philosophy is a rational one. We accept that change will take place and that it should take place in time, to avoid crisis. We want the peaceful evolution of Britain, not the bloody revolution of France or Russia. At the same time change must not be so ill-timed as to create crisis itself. We do not want change based on immature and emotional impetuosity, ignoring the basic facts that exist. We will nurture change that in reality has become part of our way of life. We will not impede it with legislation that cannot be enforced. At times we will initiate change, but always mindful of the fears and the need for security of the individual. What we will not do is to propose change that is incapable of achievement, because of its unacceptability to the people. Sir, we postulate an orderly advance of change so that all the people of South African can move forward together, each with a sense of personal security to a better way of life, to a life free from want, to a life of opportunity, to a life of ever-increasing living standards, to a life where the human dignity of all is respected by all, to a life that is purposeful and meaningful for all the peoples of South Africa. That, Sir, is the real challenge to the leadership of the white man in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the three hon. members of the United Party who spoke this afternoon surprised me by what they said. I want to begin with the hon. member for Constantia. He swung into action here and spoke a great deal about the hon. the Minister supposedly overtaxing the people of South Africa. He hit out here at the fact that there is now R491 million that is being hidden away and with which our people have supposedly been over-taxed. He said that it was our nest-egg. What are those hon. members angry about then? They say that on 22nd April they are going to win the election, then surely they will be sitting with a nest-egg! But that is not all either. The hon. member for Pinetown spoke about inflation all the time. His greatest grievance is inflation. These two hon. members must now tell me how they reconcile these two statements. The hon. member for Constantia wants this R491 million pumped into the economy. Is that not inflationistic? The hon. member for Pinetown must answer me this question: Would it not be inflationists if that R491 million were pumped into the economy? No, hon. members must not come to light with such contradictory statements.</p>

</speech>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>That is not so. That hon. member knows very little about finance. If I were him I would not make interjections about financial matters. The hon. member for Pinetown surely knows better than to actually believe in what he came up with here this afternoon. If this additional R491 million were to have been ploughed back our people would have had that extra amount in hand to force up the prices in South Africa unnecessarily. With this amount there would have been additional speculation on the Stock Exchange and the catastrophe there would consequently have been even greater. The hon. member for Parktown can surely not dispute that. I want to ask those three hon. members. They have already made quite a few statements here to-day, but now I want to make one and I want to ask them whether they agree with it or not. I particularly want the hon. member for Parktown to reply. If the National Party had not reduced income tax to such an extent last year and if there had not been so many concessions, would our people have been able to speculate to such an extent on the Stock Exchange, thereby causing the absurd peak that was reached in May? Could it have happened? That was the sequel. The hon. member for Kensington, who has a great deal of knowledge about the Stock Exchange, can tell me whether this is so or not. The fact that so much inconvenience and misfortune was experienced on the Stock Exchange was one of the consequences of the National Party making so many concessions as far as income tax was concerned. Last year I expressed my personal view here regarding the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s recommendation, and the minority report that was opposed to it, namely that a capital gains tax should be introduced. I specifically went into greater detail about the Stock Exchange. The hon. Opposition did not support my point of view at all. On the contrary, they attacked me about it. Had that tax been levied at the time this would not have happened. If the hon. Opposition did, in fact, have South Africa&#x2019;s interests at heart, they should also have acknowledged that standpoint. We know that there were other reasons why the Government did not accept the recommendation. I fully accept those reasons, but the hon. Opposition must be very clear in their minds when they want to adopt a standpoint. They must tell us where they stand.</p>

<p>This afternoon the hon. member for Park-town had quite a lot to say about the question of gold. I think it is a case of it being easier to criticize than to create. Ultimately that hon. member&#x2019;s whole tirade boils down to the fact that he is angry because of the hon. the Minister of finance&#x2019;s gigantic success overseas in the sale of gold. He is angry about the fact, <span class="col_1107-1108" refersTo="page_0566"/>for example, that the hon. the Minister succeeded in not allowing the U.S.A. to demonetize gold and about the fact that the hon. the Minister succeeded in arranging for gold to retain its value in the commercial and financial world. It looks to me as if that hon. member is very angry about that. I think South Africa should be very grateful to this hon. Minister for what has been achieved and for what he accomplished for us, i.e. this new arrangement in respect of our gold. The member for Florida very cleverly drew attention to a few points. I therefore want to skip those points and make a few general statements here this afternoon. Since we are on the eve of an election there are, in my opinion, a few criteria against which the electorate of South Africa are going to test this National Party.</p>

<p>Which National Party?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The electorate is going to test this National Party on the way it has governed in the past few years.</p>

<p>In the first place this Government provided for order, peace and security in South Africa. It made opportunities for work available for its people. It took care of the health of this nation. It maintained a sound administration. I am now going to elaborate a little about the basic services, such as water, power, transport, communications and education, which this Government established. It is not the Government&#x2019;s job to do the work of businessmen for them, to carry on their businesses, to look after their profits or to see to their administration for them, but it is the task, function and duty of a government to ensure that that infrastructure, those basic services expected of a country&#x2019;s government, are established. I want to say that the Government has done this in a manner unequalled by any previous government, and in a manner in which no other government in the world has done so for its people and its country.</p>

<p>Lastly, this Government will be tested on the measures it took for the continued existence of the people. This Government has done its duty over the years for order, peace and security in this country. We have rooted out Communism in this country and the police are taking the lead in keeping the terrorists from our borders. If we look at last year&#x2019;s Estimate, when R357 million was budgeted for Defence, we find that this was 21.6 per cent of the total Estimate. That is what this National Party has done to make this country safe for its people. When this Opposition goes to bed to-night they sleep peacefully. They know that there is no internal or external threat here.</p>

<p>Let us just look at a few general points. As far as our communications system in South Africa is concerned, we discussed the Post Office Part Appropriation Bill last Monday. I personally pointed out very clearly what we had done in this country for both our internal and external communications systems. Another I important responsibility of the National Party is this country&#x2019;s transport. Here the electorate of South Africa can only give the National Party credit once again if we think, for example, that in South Africa we have 19,322 miles of single railway lines, 5,296 miles of which have already been electrified. Only the railways of the U.S.A. and Europe have been electrified to a greater extent than that of South Africa. I think this is an achievement. All the other countries, with which we cannot actually compete, are lagging behind South Africa. If we consider that the Railways&#x2019; revenue for the 1968-&#x2019;69 financial year was R668 million, that 493 million passengers were transported, that it gave work to its people and that R401 million was paid out in wages, we see that this Government has done its share in respect of transport. There is not a place in South Africa that is not served by either the Railways or our Road Transport Service. This is also the case in respect of the Airways. In the past year over a million passengers were transported. Not only did we bring our internal services to perfection, but also our external services, on which we have 11 flights each week. Then there is also a flight to North America via Rio de Janeiro. We do not have cheap internal water transport available. Therefore it is not so easy and convenient for a government to supply all these transport services. But as far as our transport in South Africa is concerned, it is only this party&#x2019;s past policy that can satisfy our electorate.</p>

<p>Apart from our transport, this Government must supply power. What have we done in that field? Let us see. Escom electricity sales have increased by 8.4 per cent and its capital expenditure on its expansion programme, i.e. for power stations that are to be erected, amounts to R70 million per year at present. From 1975 it will be R90 million and from 1980 it will be R100 million. In co-operation with the Government Escom has also made arrangements to obtain power from the Cabora Bassa scheme, the Oxbow hydro-electric project, the power station at Usutu in Swaziland and from the Ruacana scheme in South West Africa. In this way there is a saving on capital expenditure and we are also helping our neighbouring states. Owing to the policy of the National Party since 1960, our industries have progressed with rapid strides. In the past few years the industrial power consumption increased by 10.6 per cent. This could only happen as a result of the basic services and the guidance given by the National Party. For example, during 1968 power was supplied to almost 1,900 new farms, an increase of 7 per cent on the previous year. Matters have already progressed so far that the first nuclear power station will be established in the Western Cape by 1978. According to estimates the transmission lines to the Western Cape will be able to operate at their maximum safe capacity by 1978, and therefore it is also possible to provide this service. As a result of the <span class="col_1109-1110" refersTo="page_0567"/>National Party Government administration we also see that South Africa&#x2019;s power is among the cheapest in the world. In South Africa our power costs .48 cents per unit, as against Canada&#x2019;s .58 cents per unit, and the United Kingdom&#x2019;s 1,04 cents per unit. If this is not cheap, what is? Over the past 22 years the Government has also done its share in respect of fuel. We know how this Opposition fought the Government tooth and nail when it wanted to establish Sasol. At Sasol petrol is manufactured from coal. To-day this installation is the largest of its kind in the world and it furnishes 20 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s needs. I admit that there was a capital investment of R119 million in Sasol, but we see that Sasol saves South Africa about R50 million annually in foreign exchange. Apart from this goods to the value of more than R3 million are exported annually. Sasol also furnishes the chemical industries with a tremendous number of by-products which serve the industries as raw materials. And all this came about as a result of this Government&#x2019;s far-sightedness and as a result of what has been obtained for South Africa through the years by means of this party&#x2019;s policy. Sasol has not stood still either, because it posseses 50 per cent of the shares in Soekor, the company co-ordinating the search for oil in South Africa. We know that on 25th March, 1969, it was announced in this House that natural gas had been discovered 30 miles from Plettenberg Bay. On Friday, 13th February, 1970, a quantity of crude oil was discovered 20 miles north-east of Port Elizabeth. It is this Government that placed the country&#x2019;s industry on such a sound footing. To-day crude oil is transported by pipeline from Durban to the Rand. The hon. Opposition complains each year about the profits made on that pipeline. By now they are genuinely angry about the good profits this Government is providing for our country.</p>

<p>Let us now look at another important industry, i.e. Iscor. We also know that the establishment of Iscor was opposed by hon. members opposite. It is no use the hon. member shaking his head, because he ought to know that when his party was in power, South Africa had to buy its steel from England only, and that no other factory was allowed in South Africa. What do we have to-day? Iscor is now selling steel to the value of R220 million in South Africa. That is what we did for this country.</p>

<p>Mention was also made here of our human material and hon. members referred to the labour shortage. I should like to dwell for a moment on the question of our labour shortage. There are complaints in South Africa today about our manpower shortage. In talking of this manpower shortage everyone just wants our women to go out and work. However, as far as I am concerned this is not the solution. We must also think of the children. As far as I am concerned the child is our source of future manpower. Since we speak of a manpower shortage, why do we not then speak of a shortage of women in respect of their having to bring our children into the world? We have this manpower shortage as a result of the tremendous prosperity in this country. Because our country is so prosperous we have this manpower shortage. According to available statistics there were 1,074,000 economically active Whites of both sexes in 1963. As against this there was an estimated shortage of 28,600 workers at all levels, i.e. the professional, semiprofessional, technical and trade levels. The overall shortage was therefore 2.7 per cent. But if the productivity of every worker in this country were increased by only 3 per cent there would be virtually no manpower shortage to-day. According to the economic development programme for 1965-&#x2019;70 there was to have been a demand for 1,424,000 white workers this year. But according to the estimates by the National Bureau for Educational and Social Research there was to have been 1.457,0 white workers available. In other words, there was to have been a surplus of 33,0 white workers. However, we must remember that the economic development programme was drawn up with a view to 20,000 immigrants coming to South Africa annually, while the National Bureau for Education and social research proceeded from the standpoint that there should be 30,000 immigrants. In 1963 there was a 29.1 per cent shortage in professional, semi-professional and technical workers, while the skilled artisans evidenced a shortage of 25.8 per cent. Immigrants cannot supplement this shortage. I want to make it very clear that we cannot get these people from overseas. They must come from our own ranks. That is why I say we must have more children of our own and that we must train them, because this is the solution for the future. We can surely not differ on that question.</p>

<p>What is our natural growth? In 1911 the birth rate of Whites was 32.2 per 1,000. Gradually it decreased. For example, in 1936 it was 24.2. In 1946 26.9. Directly after the war it therefore increased by 2 per thousand. However, it decreased until it was 24 per 1,000 in 1963. In other words, from 1911 to 1963 it decreased from 32.2 to 24. According to an investigation carried out in Pretoria in 1953, the average number of children per family was 3.3. But the average number of children of the parents of those couples was very much higher. For the women it was 7.7 and for the men 6.7 children per family. This merely goes to show how great a decline there has been in our birth rate in South Africa. If one goes back even further one finds that during the middle of the previous century there were 9 children per family. At the end of that century it was a mere 6 children per family and in 1949 3.5. We must bear in mind that this is where our problem in South Africa lies. The Commission of Enquiry into Family Allowances points out that 26 per cent of the urban and 19.8 per cent of the rural families were childless in 1941 and that about half of all families had no children or else only one. We <span class="col_1111-1112" refersTo="page_0568"/>must, of course, also bear another factor in mind, i.e. the fertility rate which has decreased rapidly. Just look at the figure for legitimate births per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44 years. In 1911 it was 248.6 per 1,000, while in 1961 it was a mere 171. We therefore see that there was a drop here. The drop did not occur as a result of the unpopularity of marriage. It is occurring as a result of the deliberate birth control measures being applied.</p>

<p>There is another factor, i.e. the medium marriage age. In 1918 the average age at which men and women got married was 28.1 and 23.3 years respectively. In 1963 the average age for men was 25.2 years and that for women 21.9. This indicates that our people are getting married at a young age, but that starting a family is postponed to a later date. This is wrong. This is not only the National Party&#x2019;s problem. It is also the United Party&#x2019;s problem. This is a problem which will have to be given attention. According to an estimate by Dr. L. F. Badenhorst the white population stood at 3,067,638 in 1960. He said that in the year 2000 it would be a mere 4,917,000. This amounts to a growth of plus-minus 2 million in 30 years. This is not good enough for us. It is too little. If we compare the census figures for 1960 with those for 1951 in respect of all races in South Africa, we find that the increase in Whites was 1.69 per cent, the increase in Coloureds 3.43 per cent, Asiatics 2.97 per cent and Bantu 1.9 per cent. The present position in the Cape is already such that there are more Coloureds at school than Whites. There are also more Indian children at school in Natal than Whites. We must have more children. That is why, in this House and from platforms, we must ask people and encourage them to have more children. Every family in South Africa, which can do so, must present its country and its people with six children. There are problems such as the cost of living. One of the things I want to plead for to-day concerns the cost of confinements. This is something the Government ought to give attention to. It is to a large extent a provincial matter. Hospital costs for a confinement are at present about R40. Doctors&#x2019; costs amount to an additional R60. The total is about R100. It is these initial costs that put young people off. Of course, in the case of complications deliveries cost even more.</p>

<p>We must inform our people in this connection and give them the necessary guidance. It can easily be said that the world&#x2019;s birth rate has decreased and that South Africa&#x2019;s is still one of the largest. South Africa&#x2019;s present birth rate is 22.8, while that of other countries is as low as 15.2. How ever, this is a serious matter as far as I am concerned. We must encourage our young people. We know that when a woman is pregnant she must stop working. There is a great deal of expense involved in this. We know what this National Party has already done to keep the cost of living at a low level. We know what the National Party has done to provide our people with housing and to keep the interest rate at a low level. We know what has been done in that connection for our public servants, post Office and railway staff. But we want to make an appeal to the businessmen of South Africa, to the private sector, where the Government cannot intervene, to contribute their share. We must do something for South Africa in this respect.</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that what this Party has done in the past 22 years speaks volumes for any party and any government. When we go to the polls on 22nd April the voters outside will not pay any attention to what the United Party has said and will say at a later stage in this debate, but they will take note of the National Party&#x2019;s recent administration, of how it has ruled and what it has given to its people.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have heard from the hon. member for Sunny-side a ringing call to the womenfolk of South Africa to produce at least six children&#x2014;the married ones of course&#x2014;for &#x201C;volk&#x201D; and &#x201C;vaderland&#x201D;. This is a rather wry reflection, because it might well be that there are many of the womenfolk of South Africa who would be only too willing to have a few more, or at least one or two more children for &#x201C;volk&#x201D; and &#x201C;vaderland&#x201D;, if they were able to find housing and adequate accommodation in a place where they could rear a family of that size. I ask the hon. member how does one under modern conditions where, as it has already been pointed out in this debate, we are becoming a nation of flat dwellers, raise a family of six under flat conditions? I believe that it is one of the greatest trials for a young mother to have a troop of children living in a flat. This has been proved overseas to lead to tremendous tensions in the married life. That is the reason why houses are being provided for young married couples overseas, namely to avoid those types of tensions in marriage. It strikes me as a bit odd that some two years ago this member was a member who went to town against the mini skirts. We had a tremendous speech from the hon. member against the dangers and the moral conditions involved in the mini skirt. He said that it was dragging down the &#x201C;volk&#x201D; and &#x201C;vaderland&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am for the mini skirt. Let me say straight away that one of the factors which were involved in the case made by Lady Summerskill in the House of Lords against the proposal to lower the age <span class="col_1113-1114" refersTo="page_0569"/>at which a girl could become married without her parents&#x2019; consent was, &#x201C;because the young men of our country would be so totally defenceless against these lovely young girls with their lovely legs and their mini skirts&#x201D;. One should expect this hon. member to support earlier marriages and bigger families. I must say that there is one thing I want to thank this hon. member for. I must immediately confess one thing: Where we have heard speaker after speaker from that side launching a bitter attack on the four unfortunate members of the Herstigte Party, this hon. member forebore to do so. It might perhaps be significant that we have had no attack on the Herstigte Party by the hon. member who has sat down. I want to thank him from my side of the House.</p>

<p>Amongst the long list of successes of the Nationalist Party that he gave us, he mentioned water conservation. However, right at this very moment we have the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs touring the country to promote the Water Year, which will bring to the attention of our people how critical the water position really is in our country. I do not want to go on with this issue, because there are various other speakers who will deal with it, but I think the hon. member can hardly now come to this country and say how proud he is of what has been done and what a tremendous success the Nationalist Party has made of the conservation of the water supply in this country. The hon. member should not make such statements at a time when virtually every city to-day is in a state of utmost shortage of water supplies.</p>

<p>What I really want to speak about is the &#x201C;reuse sukses&#x201D; which, according to that hon. member, the Minister of finance has had overseas in relation to the gold price. I want to say straight out that I believe the hon. Minister took on the almighty dollar with the strength of South Africa&#x2019;s gold reserves and with the full pressure of the international speculation running against the dollar to a fantastic extent. He thought that everybody in the world would be betting on the devaluation of the dollar in relation to gold. However, the hon. Minister has come back to South Africa with a bloody nose, because I believe that we have been put firmly in our place by the almighty dollar. This has happened because America is a country with a gross national product of some 956,000 million dollars.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>It is not a question of patriotism. The hon. the Minister has made an attempt to force up the price of gold and has failed, if in doing so he jeopardized the position of gold in monetary markets throughout the world, does the hon. the Minister think that it will be patriotism on my side if I keep quiet and say nothing about this? Let us be quite clear about the fact that the United States has made it quite clear for a number of years that they intend to demonetize gold. For the hon. the Minister to pretend, as he did at the end of his speech, that because there was a balance of payment difficulty in the United States there might still be hope in the future for a rise in the price of gold, is merely deluding himself I think it is serious for South Africa that he should do so and it is important that he should not continue to do so. The Secretary to the Treasury of the previous administration in the United States, Mr. Fowler, made it quite clear that the U.S.A. Administration regarded South Africa as an unfriendly country, and because Russia, the other major producer of gold, is hostile to the U.S.A., he made it quite clear that as far as he was concerned the Johnson Administration would not consider a rise in the price of gold. What has happened in the last year or so is that the three major currencies, the pound sterling, the mark and the franc, either had to revalue or devalue in terms of the dollar. They have been forced to do so by the strength and the power of the American economy and the dollar. I think the Minister is deluding himself and he is building South Africa&#x2019;s future on a false foundation if he is going to continue to hope for a rise in the price of gold, unless it is done through an organization such as the International Monetary Fund. When I spoke in this debate last year I said that I thought that the way in which a new status could be found for gold was by including in the deposits made with the International Monetary Fund gold to the value of the credits which the individual countries have to make available to the fund. The Minister in his speech said that in fact we had done so; I do not know to what extent, but we had deposited gold with the International Monetary Fund in terms of the S.D.R.s made available to South Africa. This, to my mind, would have been the one way in which gold could have acquired an international status which would be outside the pressure of international politics, because to-day the gold price is simply a matter of politics; it is no longer a financial or an economic matter, but international politics with the U.S.A. playing the most vital part in fixing the gold price. Where you have a system such as the Special Drawing Rights, it is being done with one purpose only, and that is to do away with gold as currency. I think we in South Africa have to accept this. I do not think it is basically so important to us. I think if we can establish and maintain the price of gold at 35 dollars an ounce as long as our gold mines survive, that is the most important thing we have to do, but beyond that we have to look to the exports of our industries to build up our economic position on an export industry. In this regard I want to draw attention to something.</p>

<p>We have spoken here already of the plight of people who invested on the Stock Exchange, but I think it is wise to draw the attention of investors in South Africa to the deliberate policy this Government is following, which is to divert the whole future economic development <span class="col_1115-1116" refersTo="page_0570"/>of South Africa from the present metropolitan areas to the border areas and the Bantu areas. Let the hon. members not tell me that the emphasis, in terms of what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration said recently, is not going to fall on the development of the Bantu areas, something for which this side of the House has been pleading for so many years. But it is being done on the basis of subsidization, and the entire economic development of this country for the future is being affected by a deliberate act of this Nationalist Party Government through the Minister of Planning at the behest of the Minister of Bantu Administration, and it is being diverted from the present metropolitan areas to the border areas and inside the Bantu areas. It boils down to one thing only, that the Minister of Bantu Administration has become to-day the economic Tsar of South Africa, and he will decide how our economic development and progress will take place.</p>

<p>Yes, of course the Tsar was eliminated in 1917 and perhaps Commissar is a far better term to describe the hon. the Minister. The thing that worries me about this is that people are being encouraged to move to the border areas and into the Bantu areas, and they are being subsidized to do so. and the taxpayer is providing a great deal of the capital investment for the buildings in which these people house their factories, and the only capital investment of a great number of the people vesting their undertakings there is the machinery they put into those buildings and which they are allowed to write off at a pretty fair rate. I do not believe this is a sound basis on which the future industrial potential of South Africa can be built up. And basically, what are we achieving? The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration will tell you that what they are achieving is to prevent integration, but as far as I am concerned you are simply moving integration from one place to another.</p>

<p>You are merely re-locating the integration of Black and While, of capital and of labour, and you are doing it at the expense of White South Africa because you are taking it from the present centres of development where you have the maximum efficiency in terms of size, and you are fragmenting your economy and breaking it down to go to various areas on the borders and in the homelands.</p>

<p>The dependence is exactly the same. The hon. members have solved nothing. If they go into the Bantu areas, something which the hon. the Minister has learned from the United Party at last, it will be better and the Minister may learn as time goes on but of course he has not much time left in which to learn. The re-location of industries in the border areas is not solving the problem of integration, because you still have the white man there with all his capital and you have the Bantu who supply the virtually total labour force. The few skilled white workers have to travel to work by bus while the Bantu are located merely across the railway line. How a railway line can provide an effective border between White South Africa and Black South Africa, I do not know.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>We have already proposed quite clearly that South Africa shall remain one country under the control of white men. That is quite clear. Obviously the hon. member is going to Another Place and he will not be with us much longer. [Interjections.] The point is that we are now having to base the whole of our economic future on export industries, and I do not believe that we can benefit those export industries which we will have to build up in this way. We have been told by a recent trade mission that the world is wide open to our exports, and let me say that I believe our exports have to go to-day to the nations of the west and to the Americas, because we have heard about the vast market which exists in Africa. But I think one of the problems we face in dealing with Africa in terms of trade is the fact that so often one has to provide credit in order to be able to trade with countries which have virtually no resources with which to pay for the commodities they buy. But we have the ability, as was proved by the mission which recently went overseas, to exploit a ready market, and I think it is important to realize that we must get into the markets of Europe and the U.S.A. to an ever-increasing extent, if we are going to be able to survive economically. I think one of the great points in favour of South Africa is that in a normal year we are able to produce surplus food. I believe we have to realize that food is a tremendous economic weapon. If we <span class="col_1117-1118" refersTo="page_0571"/>have surplus food in South Africa, that food will open to us the doors particularly of Black Africa where we wish to penetrate. If we have surplus food that we can make available to the nations of Black Africa, then we have a very real economic weapon, something which can be of very great importance to us in our future trade relations with the rest of Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants to know whether I am advocating the production of surpluses. We have had surpluses in all normal years. To the hon. member a surplus is like holy water to the devil. If there is one word that really scares the Nationalist Party it is the word &#x201C;surpluses&#x201D;. But we must realize that surpluses are a real factor, a tremendous force that we can use in our foreign relations.</p>

<p>Another point that I wish to raise is the problem of stock theft. I wish to raise this in the knowledge that I will be interviewing the hon. the Minister of foreign Affairs in this connection. I believe that this is a matter which is of the utmost importance in view of what has happened in a neighbouring country where the government has been taken over. Sir, I raise this matter because I want the House to know and I want the Cabinet and the country to know how very serious this problem has become, particularly in view of the fact that where you have stock theft in the mountain areas alongside Lesotho, any action which is taken by the South African Government can only result in accentuating the difficulties which Chief Jonathan has in Lesotho at this moment, because it is precisely in those areas where this is taking place that he lost support, a loss which appears to have given the election to the Opposition party. Sir, I was in Lesotho last year in July. We met the Deputy Prime Minister on an election tour in the area and we had a tremendously interesting discussion with him on the problems in which we are involved. The problem that has arisen is this: We have found there that stock theft has almost become legalized by reason of the fact that straying stock can be impounded and the moment the stock are impounded they become the legal property of anybody who buys them, at whatever price that person wishes to pay [Interjections.] I assure you. Sir, that this is the legal position. This is a problem which is going to become more and more serious. I want to make it clear that I am not talking about our country; this is the situation across the border. I want to explain that because I want everybody to understand the nature of the problem that we face. It is becoming such a problem that people farming along the Lesotho borders are unable to farm and unable to sell their farms, because who is going to buy a farm in that area? I have taken this problem to the Police. I believe that we have a very able stock theft squad handling the matter but it is getting beyond control. Sir, my reason for mentioning it here is that I am perturbed that there might be an incident involving nationals of Lesotho along that border in the near future, and I wish to draw this to the attention of the House. I have asked for an interview with the hon. the Minister of foreign Affairs, and I hope we are going to be able to reach some kind of reasonable settlement with the Government of that country, because if that does not happen then I believe there may be the most terrible trouble along our borders with that particular country. I hope that when I have a chance to speak to the hon. the Minister of foreign Affairs we will be able to find some kind of solution to this problem which is becoming more and more serious every day.</p>

I shall furnish a brief reply to what was said by the hon. member who has just spoken, but before I do that I just want to say in general that I shall not reply in detail to financial points, except so far as the sales tax is concerned. This day, Monday, 16th February, we have been eyewitnesses here to the wonderful spectacle of those hon. members on that side, including the hon. member for Mooi River, professing to be the new gold experts in South Africa. I wonder what happened to them over the week-end. for I am calling the entire country as my witness that to-day is the first day that side of the House has saddled the gold horse.</p>

<p>We recently negotiated a gold agreement; this was publicized through Press statements; it appeared in all the newspapers. We have recently conducted a no-confidence debate in this House and one would have expected that this would have afforded the Opposition, through its Leader, to seize upon this matter and level crticism at the Minister, if there was any criticism to level. Mr. Speaker, throughout that entire debate they did not say one word about gold. But something happened to them over the week-end&#x2014;I do not know what&#x2014;and today they are the only people in South Africa who are criticizing that gold agreement. I almost wanted to say that they are the only people in the world who are criticizing it. I want to say to them what has already been said to them here by way of interjection, i.e. that they committed an unpatriotic act against South Africa here to-day.</p>

<p>I want to say to the other side that it is only with the greatest praise and appreciation that we want to speak of the sustained and persevering work done on behalf of South Africa by the hon. the Minister and his team of officials over a long period to bring this extremely serious and important matter for South Africa to a satisfactory conclusion and solution. We want to say to the Minister that we appreciate the brilliant way in which they <span class="col_1119-1120" refersTo="page_0572"/>dealt with this matter. It is not only we who want to thank him; I think the Opposition ought to thank him as well, and if they do not do so, they ought to feel ashamed of themselves. I am certain that I am speaking here on behalf of the whole of South Africa when I convey our gratitude to him.</p>

<p>Sir, this is not only the feeling in South Africa. In Europe, throughout the entire world, there was great appreciation for the absolutely correct manner in which these negotiations were conducted. Through this team, led by the hon. the Minister, South Africa won great and even greater esteem in the international world of finance. We appreciate this, and I want to say to the Opposition: I do not think one of the election horses they saddled during the past few days are going to run, but this one will not even leave the starting gate.</p>

<p>Sir, Stock Exchange matters were discussed here. I will reply to that for I am certain that on Wednesday the Opposition will have to take their medicine. I am certain that that medicine will taste worse than the worst castor oil they have ever swallowed. Sir, what is it in fact that we heard here? There was absolutely no scientific analysis; all we heard was politics. Even the hon. member for Park Town, who seldom does this, descended to the lowest level of politics today. The whole thing centred about two statements the Minister made; they spoke about absolutely nothing else. But the hon. the Minister had issued regular warnings. They did not mention that. The public paid no heed to those warnings, hut now those two statements are suddenly responsible for the collapse on the Stock Exchange, whereas the Minister had warned in advance: &#x201C;My friends, when circumstances allow, this will be the last deflationary step I am going to take; I am warning you that I am going to take it, and when I take that step, share prices are going to fall.&#x201D; That is recorded on black and white. But now hon. members bandy arguments about here in regard to these two statements. May I just in passing put this question to them: Suppose the hon. the Minister had made his second statement here that morning; would they then still blame him for the slump on the Stock Exchange? According to their own argument they would of course not blame him. Mr. Speaker, however sorry I am for people who have lost money on the Exchange &#x2014;and I am truly sorry for them&#x2014;I just want to remind them, as I also remind myself: Let us search our hearts. Who told me to buy shares? Who told me to invest my money there? It was not the Minister. On the contrary, he warned me against it. Did I not make that decision myself? Did I not listen to Tom who was supposed to have made R100 the week before, and to Dick who had made R1,500 the week before that. And then I took part in that mass stampede. If I must be angry at anyone, then I must also be honest. Regardless of how difficult it is, the only person I must be angry at is myself.</p>

<p>I appreciate the fact that I got it from the hon. member for Mooi River this afternoon on black and white that they are irrevocably opposed to our subsidizing industries to go to border areas. I shall hold this against him and that side of the House. I do not want to go into this now, but he went further and said: &#x201C;You are just moving integration from one part of the country to another&#x201D;. He criticized this, and I am glad that it has been recorded on black and white.</p>

<p>I want to return now to the question of sales tax. I want to tell the Opposition straight that they have no standpoint whatsoever in regard to sales tax. That is why the Leader of the Opposition, during the no-confidence debate, came to light with such an incongruous statement as the following when he said shortly before he concluded (Hansard, column 41)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We found that the hon. the Minister on a Sunday found it necessary to announce great changes designed to admit the correctness of every word or criticism voiced by the United Party.</block>

<p>Where did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition get that information from? Did he see the release issued by the Department of Information? I am now putting this question to him. Did he see it? If he did see it, he would have noticed that it was stated quite clearly there: &#x201C;Release midnight Sunday, 1st February on Monday 2nd February&#x201D;. Now he is laughing. Did he know about it, or where did he hear that the Minister had interviewed newspapermen on a Sunday? Where did he hear that?</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition may as well laugh some more, but I want to tell him that they have no policy whatsoever in regard to sales tax. The Leader of the Opposition said in Estcourt: &#x201C;The purchase tax must be abolished.&#x201D; This he said on 3rd November of last year. Did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition not say this? [Interjections.] Very well then, they misreported him. After the Leader of the Opposition had spoken in East London, a report was written under the hand of Donald Woods on 8th November. It is reported there that the Leader of the Opposition used the following words: &#x201C;&#x2026; more sensible taxation and abolition of the so-called sales tax.&#x201D; That is what the Leader of the Opposition said at a meeting in East London.

<p>We now come to the skunk standpoint mentioned this afternoon by the hon. member for Constantia. He said that this whole matter made him think of a skunk. The hon. member for Durban (Point) finds himself in the same company, for he said: &#x201C;It is an unnecessary, and unneeded and unwanted tax.&#x201D; Now what does that mean? If words have any meaning this means that they do not want it. But then the hon. member says that unfortunately he is sitting here in a half-washed state. He said that instead of being a messy, unwashed and dirty person, you can now be a half-washed person. His ideas and his opinions are not only half-washed; they are half-baked. I said the United Party did not have a standpoint on sales tax. They fought an election in Kuruman. There they issued a pamphlet in which they pointed out that they would abolish the sales tax on sugar. Since when is there a sales tax on sugar? But in that pamphlet they went further. They stated that they would also abolish the tax on candles. They probably thought the people of Kuruman did not have very many electrical installations on their farms. That is why they added candles as well. The hon. member for Durban (Point) must really give his people better advice. Canned fruit and vegetables were also included. The people there do not have a great deal of water with which to cultivate vegetables, and that is why they buy canned foods. Now the United Party was saying to the voters at Kuruman that there was a sales tax on canned fruits and vegetables. Is the Opposition not ashamed of itself? What is its policy? Sir, they went further, and said. &#x201C;The National Party Government is placing a tax on sweets.&#x201D; That hon. member was standing in his bench when he said: &#x201C;We agree, sweets are bad for children. Place a tax on sweets.&#x201D; Those were his words, Sir. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, so he was not talking about our children, but here they state in their pamphlet that this sales tax was even going to affect our children. They said to the people of Kuruman: Just think of the amount of tax which is being imposed on biscuits. [Interjections.] Then they also say: Just think of the amount of tax which is being imposed on mincers. There is in fact a tax on biscuits and there is a tax on mincers, but I am asking the hon. member for Durban (Point) again, to tell us why they did not move amendments in respect of sweets for children, biscuits and mincers.</p>

<p>I now come to the pamphlet &#x201C;You want it &#x2014;we have it&#x201D;. Here it is stated: &#x201C;The purchase tax will go from all but luxury and durable goods.&#x201D; I have the relevant Act here, with its schedule, in which the various items, on which purchase tax has been levied, are mentioned. I looked to see what &#x201C;durable goods&#x201D; are mentioned here. I found a whole list of durable consumer goods. I shall mention a few of them. There is for example all kinds of stoves, pots and pans, knives and scissors, shavers, refrigerators and grass mowers, or, as the hon. member for East London (City) says &#x201C;grasmaaiers&#x201D;. [Interjections.] Other durable goods mentioned here are sowing machines, television and radio sets, and furniture. Then they say: &#x201C;The purchase tax will go from all but luxury and durable goods.&#x201D; I also looked at the list of &#x201C;luxury goods&#x201D;. Sir, we have a sales tax on carpets. The Opposition proposed that that sales tax be deleted. Sir, there are carpets and carpets. One gets Persian carpets which cost up to R5,000. Surely those are luxury goods. When they hold a meeting in Dordrecht in my constituency they say: &#x201C;Oh no, it is those articles on which sales tax should be imposed. We are opposed to luxury goods.&#x201D; But then they go somewhere else and tell the people: &#x201C;The Government had introduced a sales tax on carpets.&#x201D; What is our standpoint? Then, on the other hand, they say: &#x201C;Oh no, we proposed in Parliament that your carpet should not be <span class="col_1123-1124" refersTo="page_0574"/>taxed.&#x201D; So I can mention one item after another. Take cutlery for example. One finds the most expensive cutlery made of silver. We have a sales tax on cutlery. The man who buys inexpensive cutlery pays a proportionately smaller amount in the form of sales tax, but the one who purchases the luxury cutlery, pays a larger amount in the form of sales tax. So I can mention one example after another.</p>

<p>I am mentioning this to indicate the position to the House and we will also tell this to the country, because we have every right to do so. The United Party does not have a standpoint in regard to sales tax. It is only this side of the House that had a standpoint. I want to go further and say that we will tell the country that it would not have been possible for us to have had this new tax structure if we had not introduced the sales tax. In terms of this new structure income tax has been reduced; <i>inter alia</i>, a concession of R500 has been made to married working women. These are two sides of the same coin. One cannot throw the one away and retain the other. We must either have the old system of income tax without the sales tax, or we must have the sales tax together with the new dispensation. We shall inform the people that we have introduced a new dispensation in terms of which it is no longer only 8 per cent of the population that pays tax, but that we have for the first time introduced a system in terms of which the entire population of South Africa pays tax. If at the outset it did not function properly and had its shortcomings then I call the hon. the Minister and myself to witness that we informed the people of South Africa that we would remedy this matter and adjust it as we went along. We kept our promise. We announced relief measures and we will in future adjust the sales tax from time to time. If necessary we shall reduce it further when and on whatever articles we may find this possible. We shall do so taking into consideration the most important interest and requirements of everyone in South Africa, including the lower income groups. We are giving South Africa this assurance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, every second day those hon. members make a gesture with which they want to indicate to me that my throat will be cut in Queenstown. [Interjections.] The hon. member for North Rand also said something. My time is running short, but I want to inform the House why I shall return to this House. Mr. Speaker, you are sitting in a very good position. Do you see those two swinging doors? I want to say something about those two swinging doors, but first of all I want to say that over a period of years the National Party has been working to get the non-Whites taken of the common voters roll. Over a period of years the National Party has been working at and establishing separate governmental institutions for the non-Whites. We will expand these further and follow that course, but the United Party wants to allow non-white people to enter through those two swinging doors to sit here with me and with them.</p>

<p>This is the case, but that hon. member does not want to know it. Mr. Speaker, just listen to the row he is kicking up. When I said this in Queenstown, a very high-ranking Office-bearer of that party shouted: &#x201C;That is nonsense.&#x201D; Do you know, Sir, even their own people do not know this, but I will go and make their own people understand this. That will be the first instalment of race federation. Together with that instalment eight representatives of the Bantu will enter this House. There will at first be Whites. We know the old story. We know what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Yeoville have said. We know what the hon. member for Durban (North), whom I do not even see here, wrote in the <i>Cape Times</i> and what Senator Horak wrote in <i>Week blad</i> when he was secretary of the party. We know that whole story and we shall tell it to the people. Who will enter through those swinging doors? I do not even have a word of comfort for the hon. member for Kensington and the hon. member for Durban (Central). Those hon. members must not think that the Bantu will elect them if they are thrown out by the United Party here. After all, they are completely tame.</p>

<p>The Bantu will not even elect Jan Steytler. They will elect the highest bidders. Those are the people who will enter through those doors. The people who will be able to offer the highest bid and who will promise the Blacks heaven on earth are the people the Opposition will let loose on this House. These are the people they want to let loose on South Africa and the Bantu. Nor will it remain at that. According to their own evidence it will remain at that, for under their policy the six Coloured representatives may be Coloureds. When we are level pegging they will say to the Coloureds: &#x201C;Vote for us.&#x201D; But with a coalition government they will want to come in on conditions. They will introduce a motion of no confidence in the Government. Those hon. members will want to do so with their help. Mr. Speaker, they will do this at a price. They will do this for a seat in the Cabinet, for the expansion of their representation &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want this afternoon to deal with water affairs. As far as the hon. the Deputy Minister is concerned I must say that I thought he made a most remarkable speech for a man who himself has such a peculiar political history. I hope that in the election of 22nd April, the voters of Queenstown will remember that he is a Nationalist for the purpose of this election that we are going to have now because otherwise they may vote for him thinking that he is a United Party candidate. He was a candidate for the United Party in the past, so they could be forgiven if they thought that he was standing for the United Party again now. That is the position. I merely want to say that the best reply to him will be the speech I want to make now dealing with the United Party policy, a speech which will also be repeated by the United Party Minister of Water Affairs when we meet in July. Hon. members opposite are given two guesses as to who he will be because my blushes and my modesty forbid that I should enlighten them as to who our Minister of Water Affairs will be.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. I am not in the Senate, however old I may be. Perhaps it is a hint to the hon. the Minister of Transport that he should leave the sacred precincts of this House and be elevated to another edifice altogether.</p>

<p>In dealing with this matter of water affairs in the short time at our disposal, may I say that one makes no apology for dealing with that matter in a debate of this kind. The State President only a few days ago opened the Water Year with due formality in Johannesburg. So let me at once come to the point that we on this side of the House accept the importance of this particular issue. We have drummed at it and repeated it over and over again for many years. I want to come very soon to some of the matters with which, in our opinion, the Government can be charged, and not necessarily this Minister only, who has only been here a short time, but the Government as a whole with the responsibility which it has as the Government of the country.</p>

<p>Before reaching that particular point, I should like to deal very briefly with the statement which was published in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> on the 5th of this month. It was given very great prominence by that newspaper. It is a statement by the Minister of Water Affairs, who was reported to have said in an interview the previous day&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government wants every local authority to introduce water metering as soon as it can, immediately if possible. Those who don&#x2019;t, will be forced to.</block>

<p>I think there is no doubt that if water meters can be installed, they will result in an overall saving of water. I am now talking about the municipal areas. But it cannot be done all at once. There are side effects which flow from the use of meters in the local authority areas. I suggest that the hon. the Minister go into some of those matters and discuss them with the Department of Health. He should have a look at some of those side effects. I have been involved in this matter since the days in the Provincial Council when there were suggestions that we should compel Durban to undertake metering willy-nilly. Long and fruitful debates ensued. But there is more to it than that. I think this is perhaps the appropriate moment when we could draw to the attention of the Minister the fact that the rise in the standard of living being enjoyed by more and more people every year, including the non-White races, means a greater consumption of water. This is one of the matters that we just have to face up to. There cannot be a rise in the standard of living and a reduction in the consumption per capita of water. I know the Minister has plenty of problems, but here I would advise him to go slowly and carefully into this matter before compulsion is used, taking into mind all the costs involved. He should take into consideration the people who <span class="col_1127-1128" refersTo="page_0576"/>have to be necessarily employed, the technical people, the artisans. The meters must not only be provided, but installed and maintained properly afterwards. It is a very big and costly project.</p>

<p>Then I want just for a moment to repeat the principles on which this side of the House stands and which the Minister of Water Affairs will repeat from that side of the House in July. Firstly, we stand for the safeguarding and the guaranteeing of the supply of water to existing communities, whether they are urban or rural. Principle No. 1 from this side of the House is that those existing communities must have their water supplies safeguarded. Secondly, we say that we should use the money that we have available for the purpose of developing our own South African water supplies before we embark on foreign adventures. May I say to my hon. friend from South West Africa who misunderstood me last year, that where water is necessary to protect, in terms of principle I, the supply to our existing communities, it is our principle No. 1 that their supply be preserved from wherever the water may come. Let us not spend millions of rand on foreign adventures when we are still waiting to develop to the limit our own internal supply. Thirdly, we believe that in the upper regions there should be adequate storing facilities so that water can be channelled from high snowfall areas, the areas where there is plenty of water, to drought-stricken areas or areas of low rainfall. To that we added last year the need to apportion the water. We believe the time has come in South Africa when there should be at any rate some form of apportionment. Industrial and urban development, big irrigation schemes, and so forth, should have some kind of a foot rule by which they can measure what water they are likely to get at any rate in the forseeable future. Some kind of apportionment should take place so that sporadic or unexpected development would not leave us suddenly without the necessary water.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that this is a water year and the interest the Minister is showing, I want to say that in our opinion, the Government has been woefully lax throughout the years in dealing with pollution. Here I have cutting after cutting from visiting scientists from overseas, engineers, and so on. I do not have the time to quote from them adequately, but one and all they come back to the same point that we must recycle and re-use our water. That is the basis. Let there be no mistake about it that we favour the installing of meters in principle. But it cannot be done at once and it should not be enforced in the manner apparently envisaged by the Minister. What is necessary, is the halting of pollution, and so far as it goes, the purification of that water so that it can be recycled and re-used. That is the point on which the Minister himself has spoken only recently. He has spoken on it from the point of view that he intends to have it done. But the backlog is terrific at the present time. Not only our rivers are being polluted, but the sea itself. There was a time, only a few years ago, when it was believed that the ocean was so large that the amount of sewerage, industrial effluence and pollutants of all kinds could just be poured into the sea. It would be washed away and one would see no sign of it. Sir, those days are gone. Over the last few years already we have seen that the pouring of industrial effluence into the sea can cause untold harm, not only to the marine life along the seashore, but also from other points of view, even to human health. It is because we are allowing pollution to take place. I want to quote from the American <i>News Digest</i> of 12th February. It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">President Nixon has taken a major step in his programme to eliminate environmental pollution. He has issued an executive order on Wednesday to end air and water pollution caused by agencies owned or operated by the United States Government.</block>

<p>I have used the word &#x201C;agencies&#x201D; instead of the actual word &#x201C;facilities&#x201D;, because while the word &#x201C;facilities&#x201D; may be good American, it is not very good English. The President of the United States himself has said that no government-operated agencies in the United States are to continue to pollute water or air. It is being stopped. In addition to that, he himself is actually the chairman of a committee that has been constituted of the top scientists in the United States to set about the recovery now of the rivers and lakes of America and to return them to their erstwhile freshness and purity, which is going to cost thousands of millions of dollars. We are facing trouble in this country. I have had from the Minister of Water Affairs on two separate occasions assurances in regard to a big proposed factory on the upper regions of the Umzimkulu River, a hundred miles away from the sea. He has given me those assurances. The hon. the Minister will forgive me if I come back and ask once more for those assurances. In the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 17th May, 1969, is a report from the village of Creighton which deals with the reverse of depopulation in Creighton. Creighton is a little village right next to the proposed side of the Mondi mill. This is a depopulation in reverse, in other words, an inflow of population. The Town Board are selling plots there at a price they would never have realized not long ago. Each buyer must build a house worth R6,000 within three years. The following is also said: &#x201C;The provincial authorities meanwhile have been asked to help with the layout of more housing land in time for the expected influx of European workers and their families when the Mondi mill is established.&#x201D; They ask for a school to be built, for certain hospital facilities from the provincial authorities, and so on. The whole thing is accepted as being matter of fact, and people are pouring in. They have to sign agreements to erect houses on those plots. The provincial authorities have been officially asked for school facilities <span class="col_1129-1130" refersTo="page_0577"/>and so on. I hope that when the hon. the Minister replies he will make it clear that until there is a cast-iron guarantee that no effluent will be returned to the Umzimkulu River, under any kind of pretext whatsoever, he will not permit the abstraction of water from the Umzimkulu for the purpose of founding this factory. It will be a fine market for the type of agriculture in which I myself am engaged. We would like to have that market, but no market for one section of the people justifies the pollution of a river which for its last 100 miles to the sea must be the lifeblood of the lower South Coast when the time comes. The whole of our industrial development in the future and the whole of our domestic supply will depend on it. This year the regional water corporation which supplies water to the lower 54 miles of the South Coast, is applying for a Water Court order to take water from the Umzimkulu. It has temporary permission and is putting a temporary plan into action now. The Umzimkulu River is the only source of water on which we can rely. If this factory is established 100 miles inland and it pollutes the river the generality of the people of South Africa, as in America, will have to put their hands in their pockets one day to pay for the clarification and the purification of the effluent that has flowed into the river. I have said in this House before that when we sat on the Select Committee under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Ermelo who was a very good chairman&#x2014;seeing that he is not here I can say that&#x2014;as a joke at that time it was suggested that the effluent from a factory should be returned to the intake of the water supply of that factory. That select committee sat for three years and an Act was passed in 1956. That suggestion is no joke now. I saw it professionally recommended the other day. It was suggested that we should have a law now that would demand that the effluent from a factory should be returned to the intake of that factory so that such a factory has to recycle its own water.</p>

<p>If such a factory cannot purify its own water so that it can use it over again, the answer is that it will have to close down. It will not need the hon. the Minister to step in. I know the burden that is on the hon. the Minister. These big factories have to be made to toe the line. They have to leave us pure water, not only in our rivers but also in the sea, as pure water is vitally necessary for our industrial and urban development. There is not a big town in South Africa, as my hon. friend for Mooi River has said, which is not to-day facing a shortage of water on a short-or longterm basis. On a short-or long-term basis every town in South Africa is facing a shortage of water. It is no good crying about the shortage of water when the time comes, if we do not have the water. The water is there if we recycle it and if we purify it when it comes from these factories.</p>

<p>One of the newspaper cuttings I have here refers to what was said by the hon. the Minister. This article appeared in the <i>Daily News</i> of 29th January, 1970, and the heading is: &#x201C;Industry warned&#x2014;Government to end river poison.&#x201D; It says the following:</p>

<block name="quote">In a major move against pollution of Natal rivers the Government has ordered Durban industries to stop pumping waste into the Umlaas River.</block>

<p>That is very good, but how far does it take us? Only to those factories which are pumping their waste into the Umlaas River. This is only one tiny fraction of the problem that we are faced with.</p>

<p>I want to repeat that what we have now come up against is the lack of vision, planning and appreciation of what we are faced with in South Africa since the 1956 Act was put on the Statute Book. During the last 14 years we on this side of the House have seen what was coming and have warned against it time after time. Now it is coming will such a rush that I do not know whether the professional people, the technical people and the money will be available to deal with this problem. But here I have a fresh slant on the matter. This is a report of a meeting of the congress of the South African Institute of Race Relations which was addressed by a Mr. Pepler, who is the Director of Bantu Development. He told this congress that there are coal mines in the Bantu areas and that there are other mineral deposits that can be exploited. He also said that there are various types of industries that can be established. I want to put a very clear and straight question to the hon. the Minister in this regard, because I am coming to one particular point in a moment. Who is going to control the pollution from mines or factories if they are situated in Bantu areas? Is the hon. the Minister going to have the last word as to whether water shall be abstracted from rivers for the purpose of those factories or mines, or is the Department of Bantu Administration, which as in so many other matters is becoming a law unto itself, going to determine that they can take water which runs through a Native area without reference to the Minister of Water Affairs? Who is going to have the authority? There seems to be certain very split authorities already in regard to other branches of Government service in South Africa. We want to have no split authority in this regard. We are ready to back the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs and he need have no qualms about that score. As we have pointed out before we will stand behind him and say: The authority of the Minister of Water Affairs is absolute in this regard and cannot be questioned. Whether the Department of Bantu Administration, or any other, is concerned the authority of the Minister of Water Affairs should be the top.</p>

<p>Why do I come back to this matter? I come back to it because after three years in this House the then Minister of Water Affairs, Mr. P. K. le Roux, under tremendous pressure the whole time, eventually grasped the nettle and <span class="col_1131-1132" refersTo="page_0578"/>closed down a factory on the South Coast which was dealing with ilmenite and other minerals on the Umgababa River. He refused to allow that factory to abstract water from the Umgababa River any longer. Mr. Pepler told this congress that there are about 2 million tons of ilmenite at this site on the Umgababa River waiting to be developed. He was talking about the very workings that the then Minister of Water Affairs closed down because of the gross pollution, not of the river, but of the Indian Ocean. I believe the then Minister flew over the sea at that time. I did, and one could see 5,000 to 6,000 acres of the Indian Ocean blood-red because of the pollution taking place from the ilmenite factory at Umgababa. Despite that Mr. Pepler made that statement before the congress. We want to know if the hon. the Minister is going to have the last word? If factories or developments of any kind that are going to pollute the rivers or our sea are proposed in scheduled Native areas, homelands, the Transkei or anywhere in South Africa, is the hon. the Minister going to be the man who is going to say that he will not give a permit for the abstraction of water until such time that he is satisfied that there will be no effluent, or is someone else going to do it? We would like to have a very clear answer on that point. Because I know the hon. the Minister is in difficulty himself I am going to sit down to give him an opportunity to reply.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for South Coast is a person who has been sitting in this House for many years now. He played a special part in the establishment of the present Water Act and also in all the committees which have been appointed by this House since he became a member. I am highly appreciative of the fact that the hon. member made this contribution in the past. But I cannot understand how the hon. member can maintain here that the government has failed to do those things he mentioned here to-day. Nor can I understand how the hon. member can accuse us of these things, knowing that since the National Party Government came into power in 1948, the foundation has been laid for the proper control of water in the Republic of South Africa. Prior to 1948 there was no such thing as proper water control in this country. But in 1956 an Act was passed which made it possible to exercise control, as the hon. member put it to-day, over all the spheres he mentioned. The hon. member was a member of the commission which undertook the inquiry in this connection. He was a person who displayed special interest. Subsequently the hon. member has served in each one of the subsequent committees appointed by this House. Therefore I want to inform the hon. member that his history is not entirely correct. Prior to 1948 there were no control measures as we have to-day. The measures we have to-day were in fact created after the National Party Government came into power in 1948.</p>

<p>One can judge this matter according to various norms. It can be judged according to the total amount which has been spent in South Africa on all kinds of water storage and water control. If we want to judge this on the basis of figures, we see that prior to the year 1948 the total amount which was spent per annum on all forms of water control and the allocation of water in South Africa was less than R4 million. Since then the amount which is being spent has increased to more than R80 million per annum. Between 1948 and the present not R33 but R300 million has been spent. As I have just said, we are now spending more than R80 million per annum in this regard. This curve will go up in the years which lie ahead. Soon we shall have to spend more than R100 million per year on this. If it is therefore to be judged in terms of spending, there is no comparison between the amounts which were spent before 1948 and the amount which is being spent at present.</p>

<p>If this can be expressed on the basis of what has been established in the form of machinery to be able to meet these problems, that machinery was in fact established in the Department of Water Affairs subsequent to 1948. Since 1948 we have had to see how water in South Africa became a restricting factor, how it became increasingly expensive to store, and how it became increasingly difficult to control wherever it was being used. The various sections of the State machinery which deal with this were created during the regime of this Government. I want to mention only a few. It is not possible to speak of water control and pollution control and omit to mention research. Research in this connection began after the establishment of the hydrological section of this Department. Research began since the C.S.I.R. made a start with the National Institute for Water Research. The research and application of the results of this research began after the 1956 Act provided that the Minister of Water Affairs shall issue a permit for every drop of water abstracted by every factory in this country in order to remain in operation and also for every drop of water flowing from that factory. Therefore, measures have since then been introduced with which we are able to exercise control. However. I also want to give the hon. member credit for the fact that he also played a part in the establishment of this control. If all the other hon. members on that side of the House were always to make such a positive contribution as this member, we would have gone much further by now. What has been done in South Africa to store water properly, allocate it properly, and ensure that the effluent can be controlled as far as the content and the pollution is concerned has been done since the National Party Government created this machinery for that purpose.</p>

<p>However, I want to return to the various points mentioned by the hon. member. The <span class="col_1133-1134" refersTo="page_0579"/>hon. member stated that his party advocates the provision of water to existing communities. I take it that what the hon. member means by that, is that if a choice should be made in South Africa between the allocation of water to areas which still have to be developed, and the areas which have already been developed, and other areas where developments which are essential to the country, should receive preference. I now want to inform the hon. member for South Coast that that is precisely what this Government means by planning. That is precisely what is being done to-day. If we were to look at the present state of affairs, we would see that the more than 90 points at which waterworks are at present being constructed for allocation to and use by communities, are all points by means of which a need which already exists will be supplied. The hon. member need not say that this must be done. That is the basis of our policy. That, and nothing else, is what is being done.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that we should use money to develop our own sources instead of spending money on the development of the sources of neighbouring states, so that we could keep ourselves independent as long as possible. I want to inform the hon. member that that is also our policy. Apparently the hon. member mentioned this point because we are all discussing and we are all speculating on the possibility of water being brought here from Lesotho, or the possibility of water being brought from the northern rivers of South-West to supply South-West Africa with water. I could even have mentioned this as a result of the speculation on the possibility of water being brought from the Zambesi in Rhodesia. I think the golden rule here is that one should as far as possible use one&#x2019;s own water and that you must also try to obtain water from new sources you have at your own disposal before making use of sources over which you do not always have full disposal. If I may discuss these three aforementioned areas, I just want to say that it is true that there is water available in Lesotho and that we are in fact conducting negotiations on the possibility of bringing water from Lesotho to South Africa. It is true that this could be beneficial to South Africa if we could make use of that additional source. It is also true that the water from that source could probably be delivered in South Africa at a cheaper rate than if that same water were to flow down in the same rivers and be pumped back to Johannesburg. But our entire development plan for the future is based on the Vaal River being developed to its maximum and that the additional water should come from the Tugela, as is the case at present. To date no agreement has as yet been entered into with Lesotho regarding the use of water from Lesotho. Negotiations have in fact been conducted with Lesotho, although they have not reached an advanced stage. During these negotiations the two governments took cognizance of their respective positions. In addition, a great deal of technical investigations still have to be carried out. In other words, we have not by any means reached the stage where South Africa has concluded an agreement with Lesotho. It may well be that the most sensible course for us and for them would be to help each other in this way. However, the principle is that we want to be as independent as possible, as far as this important source is concerned as well. I therefore assure the hon. member that we will not commit ourselves unnecessarily if it is not in the interests of the economy of South Africa and will not be in the interests of such a neighbouring state either.</p>

<p>If we consider the second source I mentioned, i.e. the northern rivers of South-West Africa, I must say that we have played a great part in this. In terms of international law we have a share in the following rivers: the Kunene, a great river in which only we and Portugal have a share, the Okavango, a river with which three countries are concerned, and the Kwando, a river which is as large as the Orange River. We also have a share in the Zambesi. Our borders run along the Zambesi up there in the Caprivi Strip. But now one must be practical. It is no use having these sources far from us, for it could mean that we would probably have to bring water down from the north at such a cost that we would scarcely be able to exploit it. We shall have to establish, according to the laws of economy, whether it can be done cheaply or not. But what is in fact important is that South-West Africa is on the verge of a development which makes it possible and necessary for us to bring in that water there which already belongs to us, for use as quickly as possible. This will be done. As far as our share in the Zambesi is concerned, and the possibility of bringing water in from Rhodesia, I must point out that this is quite unpractical. It is unpractical to consider pumping water over a distance of hundreds of miles to one&#x2019;s consumption area which lies 3,000 to 4,000 ft. higher. It becomes as expensive or perhaps even more expensive to supply water by means of pipeline than it costs the Department of Transport to pump oil from the coast. It is too unpractical even to consider. The hon. member and all of us hope that, as the need arises, there will at some time or other be a breakthrough so that we will be able to harness the ocean. This is however a development which we cannot anticipate. That is something about which we should not even speculate unnecessarily. Science is working on this. We are working on this ourselves. Many countries are working on this. You and I hope that within the foreseeable future we will reach the point where it can in fact be done economically. This, however, is something for the future. I almost want to say that we are closer to this solution than to the possibility of water being brought from the north to South Africa. Not only is such a solution perhaps closer, but it will also be cheaper. I say therefore that this is in fact the policy. In fact, the application of our <span class="col_1135-1136" refersTo="page_0580"/>policy over the past number of years has in fact been aimed at ensuring that our water supply, too, should be as independent as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member made another point. He said that we should be sensible and that we should store our water at high-lying points and from there take it to places where it is needed for use. This is correct and we are doing it wherever we can. However, the hon. member will understand when I say that one cannot always, as in the case of the Tugela, have a dam basin on a high point in which water can be stored. The water must be stored at a point where it is possible for one to do so. The best example is the Boland itself. We cannot for example dam up the Berg River in the Berg River itself. We shall heave to take the water by tunnel nine miles through the mountains and store it on the other side of the Berg River. In other words, we will in fact have to take topography into consideration, and judging in accordance with that, do the best we can. We must be careful when we establish large storage points that we do not then proceed to distribute water throughout the entire country. As far as irrigation is concerned, there is such a thing as giving preference to the rights of the riparian owners. When it comes to the requirements of cities and industries the possibility does exist that the water can be pumped out and taken overland, in the same way as we are taking it out of the Tugela River to the Vaal River. But it must always be borne in mind that it is extremely dangerous in South Africa to concede in principle that water can be taken from any possible point to any other point where the need exists. This cannot be done. We have too little water to do this. We will come up against irreversible problems in regard to conflicting interests.</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned a fourth point as well. He stated that we should allocate water properly to places and areas where the need exists. This ties in with what I have just said. This is so. We shall allocate water where the need exists. The best example of this is the requirements of the Witwatersrand. This is a requirement which exists in a place because of its inability and because of the fact that that is precisely where there is a concentration of the masses. We must, in other words, take water to that place. As I have just said, the right of use of the place where the water comes from, which is predominant, cannot be disregarded. We cannot accept the principle that water can be taken in any direction to other places where water is needed. It must always be established whether the need and the rights of the place where the water comes from are not greater than those to which it is being taken.</p>

<p>The hon. member also put forward an argument in regard to pollution. The hon. member stated that we were being faced with a serious crisis in regard to pollution. When I asked him whether he was reproaching us because we were not doing enough, the hon. member said that that was not so. Recently everybody seems to be talking about pollution. I even read in a newspaper the other day of papers which had been read in which the idiotic statement was made that as far as pollution is concerned we were much worse off even than the United States of America or Europe. This is of course completely untrue. The fact of the matter is that as far as pollution control is concerned, South Africa is the leading country in the world. There is not one single country outside South Africa which has as much control over the pollution of its natural resources as we in fact do.</p>

<p>Along the great rivers in America where industries have arisen like mushrooms, you dare not swim in the water. It is simply not possible. It is highly dangerous and no animal or plant life can live in that water. There is no control in those countries to maintain the quality of the water. Our Water Act is extremely strict in regard to this point. No factory may abstract a single drop of water from a public stream if such factory does not have a permit from the Minister. In future the quantity of water and the rate at which it may be abstracted will be stipulated in that permit. No person may draw water from a public stream and return it or utilize it unless he has a permit which states how he should use it and what standards must be complied with. I can give the hon. member the assurance that at the present time in the Republic of South Africa there is not one large factory which takes a single drop of water from a river that does not do so according to a permit which stipulates precisely how clean that water should be and where that water should go.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to Mondi in a moment. In this connection I should like, for the third time, to make a statement in the House. We therefore have control over this matter. The section which deals with this is already a large section in the Department. We work in the closest collaboration with the C.S.I.R. We work in the closest collaboration with the Bureau of Standards. The Bureau of Standards helps the Department. Regular samples are taken of the effluent and this is tested. If those samples do not meet the standards, the permit is cancelled at once. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that this is repeated by way of a special instruction. There are few things in regard to which we are as strict as we are in regard to the control of the quality of effluent returning to our streams.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the case of Mondi. It would be just as well if I told the House what the position was. This is an important case. Mondi lies plus-minus 125 miles upstream in Natal. It is situated near the Umzimkulu River. The Umzimkulu River is the second largest river in Natal. Water flows down that river at a rate of 530,000 morgen feet. Not only does it carry such a great quantity of water down, but it also has a reasonably assured supply reaching the sea. Not only does it have an assured supply reaching the sea, but the Umzimkulu River is at present the cleanest river in the Republic of South Africa. There is not a single river the water of which is as clean as that of the Umzimkulu. Is that correct?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Now a large firm has decided to purchase land near Creighton&#x2014;the specific name of the place is Mondi&#x2014;and to erect a pulp factory there. The effluent from a pulp factory is among the most difficult to clean that we know of. There are two kinds of effluent. The one kind of effluent, which forms the bulk, can be handled; in other words, it can be purified to a standard where it can be re-used, but the other kind of effluent, which is called black liquor, is the effluent which results from the pulping process. The various chemicals contained herein cannot to the best of our knowledge be extracted easily. I now want to give the hon. member the assurance that we are very apprehensive of the situation. My Department has sent scientists out and they have travelled all over the world. They have seen what other countries are doing and studied every process by means of which water can be purified in this way, but to the best of our knowledge it is still not technically possible to clean that water to such an extent that I would be satisfied that it could flow back into the Umzimkulu River. I have previously given the hon. member the assurance, and I am going to say this again, that regardless of whether an investment of R5 million, or RIO million, or R20 million has been made at Mondi, my Department will not issue a permit for that development, even if that investment has to rot away, if an assurance cannot be given that that water is pure enough to flow back into that river. As I have already told the hon. member, my reason is that I cannot accept the responsibility of issuing a permit for a factory which will pollute the second largest river in Natal, and the cleanest river in South Africa, so that it becomes unfit for use by people, animals and plants&#x2014;and that just for the sake of a single factory. I want to give the hon. member this assurance. I have discussed this matter in public in Natal on two occasions, and I am repeating it now. I do not intend repeating what I have now said to them, since it is their own business to get to hear what I have said here. However, if the hon. member wants to bring what I have now said to their attention, I would be glad. I want to add that we cannot say at once that we will not issue a permit, for if the C.S.I.R. is able to report to us that we can rest assured of the fact that the effluent has been absolutely purified according to our standards, then a permit will be issued. However, I do not yet know, and nor do they, of a process by means of which it will be possible to purify this water. There may in fact be a method, but then they must come forward with it. I also want to say that we are not prepared to lower the standards just for the sake of one factory. We would much rather raise the standards. Now, at this stage, I am satisfied with their solution, which is not to release the effluent into the river, but to spray it over a large area which they have purchased in order to get rid of it in this way. I am not satisfied with this solution because it could happen that we could pollute an entire area and the underground water of the area, and all the seepage, in such a way that it would not be in any way possible to solve the problem. For that reason I am not satisfied either that it is a solution to spray the water over a large area. I want to give the hon. member this assurance. I also want to say to the hon. member, whatever he or his party may think, that we realize that the pollution of our water is the greatest threat to our sources. Some of this pollution takes place owing to circumstances beyond our control. Nature in itself can also pollute water. I am thinking for example of water which flows down after heavy rains. Such water can also be regarded as polluted water.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the short time at my disposal I want to touch cursorily upon a few matters. The hon. member for Paarl pointed out this afternoon that the establishment of this small party was, <i>inter alia</i>, responsible for the fact that the Exchange could not recover from its slump. I want to tell the hon. member that I deny it, but if we should have that tremendous power, I feel very sorry for him and his party on 22nd April. If we are capable of forcing and keeping down the Exchange, a very unpleasant surprise is in store for him.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister of finance took up a standpoint here, and I want to agree wholeheartedly with the interpretation thereof. This was when he said that in terms of the policy of the United Party, non-Whites would in due course enter through these swing-doors and share these benches with us. I repeat that I support that interpretation, but I want to add that both he and his party should consistently adhere to it. If my deductions are correct, the course of the policy his party has now adopted is the very one which will lead to those final results.</p>

And if the Coloureds are permitted to play rugby against the Whites, on what grounds can a rugby match between the Whites and our own Bantu then be forbidden? And once we have reached this stage, on what grounds can the various race groups be forbidden to share the same residential areas? The next step is a very logical one and just around the corner. After all, people who play sport together, and live together, are also entitled to vote together. We would then have full-blooded integration, and the consequences of that ought to be obvious to everybody by this time. We have over the years built up pleasant sports relations with New Zealand and we should not like to see those relations coming to an end. In any case, we still hope that it will be possible to build on those relations. But if it amounts to a cold choice between sport and a colour policy, on which the Whites are pinning their only hope for survival, then, we believe, it will not be necessary to choose.</block>

<p>Would hon. members now endorse this policy as it is stated here? My standpoint is still as it was reported in the <i>Dagbreek</i> of 28th September last year, and I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">People who are prepared to accept Maoris in an All Black team, do not belong in the National Party. The traditional Nationalists are those who say that the admission of Maoris would be a deviation from policy.</block>

<p>That is my policy. This policy which hon. members on that side supported, was formulated in an editorial of <i>Die Suidwester</i> of 8th September, 1965. [Laughter.] Those hon. members are laughing now, but <i>Die Suidwester</i> is the organ of the National Party in South West Africa. I wonder whether the South West Africans are laughing, too?</p>

<p>I want to touch upon something else, i.e. two charges I want to make against that side of the House. The first is that not enough is being done for the small and medium class entrepreneur, and here in my hands I have the latest I.D.C. annual report, that of 30th June, 1969. It appears from this report that during the year July, 1968 to June, 1969, assistance was granted to 21 small industries to the amount of R626.878. Over all the years since the introduction of this service on 9th November, 1962, assistance has been granted to 132 small entrepreneurs, assistance to the total value of R2.962 million. Nothing is being done for commerce. In <i>Volkshandel</i> of December, 1969, the director, Mr. Stockenstr&#x00F6;m, advocated an institute for the retail trade, and he said the obvious solution lay in a Government-established institute which could tackle this problem on a national level. I do not want to go into the matter of agriculture. It is sufficient to say that, as is apparent from the announcement the hon. the Prime Minister made Friday before last, the Government is also of the opinion that not enough is being done for the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>The second charge I want to make against the Government, is that the growth rate is too high at this stage and that our growth factors are being overburdened by it, and that especially our skilled white labour is being over-burdened, which will have to lead to the kind of integration in respect of which the hon. the Minister of Transport admitted the other day that 1,162 positions traditionally held by Whites, were now being held by non-Whites. The position has developed where the economy, which ought to be the slave of man, has become his master. We on this side of the House are fully aware of the value of a powerful economy, but the economy may never cause the nation to forfeit its character, and in saying this I am not alone. Here I have a report, and you may assess this man&#x2019;s integrity if you feel like doing it. It was written by Dr. A. S. Jacobs and is entitled &#x201C;Rate of Growth Too High&#x201D;. He said the growth rate was too high, and I shall only read one sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is, however, not the kind of growth which makes one very happy. We would like to see overall State expenditure as well as private consumer expenditure rise at a slower rate in 1970.</block>

<p>Why does he say this? He says this because, if we do not slow down our growth rate, and if we do not bring it into line with our natural <span class="col_1141-1142" refersTo="page_0584"/>resources and our supply of skilled white labour, we must admit that our immigration policy is now being dictated by the economy and no longer by what is stated in the programme of principles of that side of the House; the alternative is that we should go on promoting the non-Whites to positions traditionally held by the Whites. That is why the hon. the Leader of the House was not prepared to reply to my question the other day when I wanted to know to what extent he was prepared to allow the intrusion of the non-Whites into positions traditionally held by white workers; and I still say that he owes the people of South Africa a reply. It is his bounden duty to tell the people that he is preaching apartheid but implementing labour integration in practice. Sir, my time has run out, and I want to content myself with this idea, i.e. that during the years 1929 to 1933 there was a great deal of material poverty and distress, but the Afrikaner people retained its spiritual strength, and we must be on our guard lest, with the material prosperity of the seventies, we enter this era with a large measure of spiritual bankruptcy.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE AND OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I feel myself obliged to discuss a few little matters which were raised and which fall under my various departments. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat made a few remarks in his speech and at this stage I do not want to say very much about them, but I just want to remind him that what we have to-day in respect of apartheid, which he maintains is being preached but not implemented, we have as a result of the course of action followed by the National Party during the past years. The measure in which he can enjoy peace and quiet, and his wealth, in South Africa in all the various spheres to-day, he owes to the National Party Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, give me the opportunity to discuss other matters, and then I will in all probability return to what happened in this House as a result of the action of the hon. member for Innesdal. Friday of last week a question was put to me by the hon. member for Durban (Point), which read as follows. I should like to read it out in English&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether any alleged security leakage from the Bureau of State Security or Military Intelligence had been reported to him or his department, and if so. by whom; (2) whether the report has been investigated and, if so, with what result?</block>

<p>In the Afrikaans version it asked quite clearly whether a report or a complaint had been submitted to me or to my department by the Bureau or the Department of Defence, and if that was the case, whether an investigation arising out of the report had been institured. Sir, I state unequivocally that no report was submitted to me or to my Department, and now I am asking you what my reply to that question should be? My reply must be no. Surely that is clear. And then he asked, arising out of that report, whether I instituted an investigation. Now, if the reply to the first part of the question was no, surely it is obvious that the second part of the question was irrelevant, and for that reason I said the question fell away. But despite that, the weekend newspapers, the <i>Sunday Times</i> and the Saturday evening <i>Argus</i>, and the leading article of the <i>Cape Times</i> this morning and to-night the <i>Argus</i> again, stated that no report had been submitted to me and that I had stated that no investigation whatsoever, arising out of the document which was disclosed in this House by the hon. member for Innesdal, was being instituted. Now, if the hon. member for Durban (Point) is not capable of asking a question as he would like to ask it, then he and his English newspapers must not blame me if I replied only to his question. I hope this matter is clear now once and for all. An investigation was instituted, of course, with my knowledge and my instructions, arising out of the document which was disclosed by the hon. member for Innesdal here. The investigation is still in progress, but if the hon. member does not know that investigations are from time to time instituted by the Police on their own initiative, then it is time he learns. [Interjections.] I wish I could hear what the hon. member for Transkei was saying, for he ought to know better.</p>

<p>I would say so, but in this House we have taken cognizance of that document which was made available to the hon. member for Innesdal, and because we have taken cognizance of it here, and because the whole country has taken cognizance of it, but particularly because the Police took cognizance of it, the Police immediately got to work and started an investigation. [Interjections.] Of course the Police institutes investigations on their own initiative, and in this case on my instructions. [Interjections.] Sir, the hon. members must please give me a chance, because my time is very limited. We regard this matter as being a very serious one.

<p>I should like to give you a brief survey of the position on the borders, and when I do so, I should like to call to witness the hon. member for Durban (North) and the hon. member for Odendaalsrus, because they accompanied me to the borders last year. They saw what the conditions there were like. They know what things look like there and under what circumstances our young men there are working. I say that I am hesitant to disclose any information in regard to the borders here because our enemies beyond the borders are waiting eagerly to seize upon it and to use it against the security of our own people on the borders.</p>

<p>I am doing this because I have done it in the past. If the hon. members do not want any information about this, then it does not matter, but previously they were eager to hear about this. Certain information has recently been disclosed by the Rhodesian Government in regard to happenings in Rhodesia. One of our camps in Rhodesia was attacked. On this occasion no fewer than six of our young men were wounded. Two of them were pierced through by not less than two bullets each, bullets of communist origin. These are the dangerous conditions under which they find themselves there. Not only were six men wounded on that occasion, but damage was to a large extent also done to property. But I want to tell you this. Sir, to set your mind at rest, that of those six men, some of which went to hospital, there was not one who was subsequently prepared to return to South Africa. We gave them the opportunity, and they said, no, they want to carry on with their work on the borders until their time was up. But that is the danger in which these people are living from day to day. On another occasion towards the end of December&#x2014;I am briefly giving this information to the House, because I think the House ought to know about it&#x2014;our young men in Caprivi clashed with a group of terrorists and those terrorists were virtually wiped out. In fact. I think only one or two of them were taken prisoner: the others were all wiped out, and fortunately not one of our young men even sustained any injuries on that occasion. At the same time a large quantity of automatic weapons, ammunition, explosives and hand-grenades were found in the possession of these terrorists. They were wiped out by our young men. In the incident in Rhodesia, where a group of terrorists attacked our camp, the attackers were also pursued, and as far as I know, they were wiped out and the last two, the leader of the group and the guide, were taken prisoner.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My conclusion is the following: We regard this matter in a serious light. Once and for all I want to remove all doubt by saying that we are investigating the entire matter, not only to establish where the document came from but also to what extent it is permissible that information of that nature should be made available to the world at large. I think the position is clear now. [Interjections.] I do not act on reports which I receive from anyone else; I am acting because it was brought to my attention and to the attention of the S.A. Police and it is our duty to act in this regard.</p>

<p>The second matter I should like to touch upon is the matter raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the incident last year when three prisoners suffocated in a van which was removing them from the place where they were being detained to the court. I should like to issue a statement in regard to this matter, as I undertook to do:</p>

<p>Immediately after the incident and before such action could be urged or suggested from any other source I announced on 3rd April of last year that apart from any criminal or other investigations, and whatever the result or finding of such investigations might be, I would appoint an inter-departmental committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of the chief magistrate of Johannesburg to investigate all the circumstances related to, and giving rise to the incident, and to make recommendations in order to prevent any repetition. During the debate on the motion of the hon. member for Durban (North) the names of the committee were announced, i.e. Mr. Gush, the chief magistrate of Johannesburg, as chairman, Maj.-Gen. Crous of the Police, Maj.-Gen. Brink of Prisons, and Mr. Venter, the regional prosecutor, as secretary. Mr. Speaker, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to thank the members of this committee very sincerely for the work they did. The report they brought out comprised four bulky volumes which have since been handed to me and which I began studying at the beginning of November.</p>

<p>I have here the report which was brought out by the committee. The members of the committee were all senior Officers of their various departments. Unfortunately they could not be released full-time for the purposes of the activities of the committee from their normal duties and responsibilities and were forced to carry out the investigation and their normal official duties simultaneously. This did in fact bring about a degree of delay, but in no way detracted from the thoroughness of their investigation. It is obvious that after I have received the report I must first study it. I received it, as I said, at the beginning of November, and then I decided to make the report available to Parliament, where the matter was raised last year shortly after the incident. Sir, you will recall that this matter was raised here last year by the hon. member for Durban (North), and that is why I felt that I should make this information available to the House. I want to state clearly and unequivocally that on 2nd February, the day on which the no-confidence debate was introduced here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, I discussed this matter that same morning with the hon. member for Durban (North) and told him that I was going to report to the House during this session; that if I did not do so during the no-confidence motion, I would do so during the course of the Part Appropriation debate.</p>

<p>An important factor which undoubtedly had a hampering effect on the activities of the committee is the fact that notwithstanding wide publicity by means of repeated notification over the radio and in the Press as well as at Bantu Affairs&#x2019; Offices and magistrate&#x2019;s courts which addressed an invitation to the general public to give evidence before the committee, not a single member of the public came forward to give evidence. This negative attitude on the part of even the most outspoken critics and know-alls is clear proof that obviously they were not really so concerned about the incident as they professed to be. I am afraid I am compelled to say this, Mr. Speaker. When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was speaking in the no-confidence debate, he berated me for being an arrogant Minister. Sir, I am the most modest and humble Minister in the Cabinet. I think I am the last person the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should berate on that account. But what he did in fact berate me about was the fact that I have said last year that they wanted to make political capital out of this matter. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition then said that I had said that they had wanted to make political capital out of this because I had objected to the fact that he raised this matter in this House. I just want to correct him. This was not the reason, and he may as well look it up in Hansard. He knows just as well as I do what the reason was; he wanted to steal a march on Helen Suzman last year, and he did so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition may as well look it up in Hansard. Sir, the finding of the committee was as follows:</p>

<p><span class="col_1147-1148" refersTo="page_0587"/>The committee confirmed (1) that the primary cause which gave rise to the incident on 2nd April was the daily conveyance of a large number of prisoners over long distances and through heavy traffic between prisons, police stations and courts in the Johannesburg complex, a duty which has been placed squarely on the shoulders of the police. This causes immense problems for the police in addition to their many other duties in regard to the application of the law and the administration of justice, and bearing in mind the long distances, heavy traffic and the possibility of defects in vehicles it happens almost every day that prison vans are forced to stop by circumstances beyond the control of the police drivers, as a result of which prisoners, depending upon weather conditions, are exposed to inconvenience; (2) the problems in regard to conveyance has their origin in the fact that there is insufficient prison accommodation in Johannesburg (Central) and that prisoners coming from Johannesburg have to be detained at Modder B on the East Rand, approximately 20 miles from the courts; (3) that a few members of the South African Police, as a result of the routine nature of this task had unfortunately not exercised continual proper control and supervision in regard to this matter. The steps which have already been taken, as mentioned in the committee&#x2019;s report, are as follows&#x2014;and the committee confirmed that these measures would bring relief but would not offer a permanent solution&#x2014;firstly the system of transport has been revised and improved <i>inter alia</i> by (a) following a more convenient and somewhat less busy roundabout route from Johannesburg to the prison; (b) equipping all prison vans with two-way radios; (c) intensifying supervision and control over the transportation of prisoners and placing this under the personal command and supervision of an Officer with the rank of major; (d) withdrawing seven-ton trucks from this particular service replacing them with adequate additional three-ton trucks and making provision for more reserve vehicles; (e) supplementing staff in order to make more motor vehicle drivers and guards available for prison vans, and (f) further improving ventilation in the vehicles.</p>

<p>Secondly, steps were taken to eliminate, as far as possible, the delay in prisoners being received and sent out from the Modder B prison; thirdly, arrangements have been made between the police and the courts to try to maintain a more constant flow of prisoners during the day and eliminate congestion and delay in the afternoon as far as possible. Sir, hon. members who know how courts work will realize that a more constant passage of prisoners through the courts will also improve the position.</p>

<p>Fourthly, improvements in the cell accommodation at the Bantu Affairs Commissioner in Fordsburg have been made.</p>

<p>Sir, the following recommendations are the recommendations of the committee as a longterm solution to this problem:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) In order to shorten considerably the d: stances which prisoners have inevitably to be conveyed between the courts and the prisons, which is seen as the only permanent solution to the problem, the Committee recommends the construction of a new prison complex situated both near to the courts and the city centre of Johannesburg and the branch Offices in the Bantu areas. As an immediate interim measure the Committee recommends that where accommodation is available at police stations, particularly in the Bantu residential areas south of Johannesburg, this accommodation should be used as far as possible for awaiting-trial prisoners. Where this is possible it will greatly reduce the distances of conveyance between the courts and the places of detention. Pursuant to this recommendation of the Committee the Department of Police is of the opinion that when the new centrally situated prison complex is constructed, provision should also be made for the establishment of branch courts as close as possible to the prison, possibly as part of the same building complex; in other words, that the courts be brought to the prison instead of the prison being moved closer to the courts.</li>

</ol>

<p>Now, as far as the question of steps against the persons who failed to execute their duty properly:</p>

<p>The apparent lack of adequate control and supervision on the part of certain police Officers concerned has been thoroughly investigated departmentally, and rising out of that the following steps have already been taken: (1) Seven police Officers and six other members have been warned; one Officer has been dismissed from his post and transferred elsewhere; (2) a disciplinary board was appointed to deal with two Officers; one was admonished, dismissed from his post and transferred; the other was released; and (3) one constable was tried departmentally, found guilty and fined.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I said that I was not prepared to make this report public because it contains information which in my opinion cannot, in the public interests, be disclosed. However, I want to make this offer to the hon. the leader of the Opposition: If he and the chairman of his justice group, the hon. member for Durban (North), is interested in it, I will make this report available to them for study. This of course applies as well to the chairman of the justice group on that side of the House. This is the report I promised to make in this House arising out of this incident which took place last year.</p>

<p>Now I should, briefly, like to raise a matter in regard to the Electoral Laws. This matter was raised by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke about &#x201C;loading&#x201D; and &#x201C;deloading&#x201D;. He raised very serious objection in regard to this matter. On the 6th of this month the hon. the Prime Minister asked the hon. the Leader of <span class="col_1149-1150" refersTo="page_0588"/>the Opposition what his attitude in this regard was. It has always been part of our electoral system that the sparsely populated area of our country where long distances are to be found, we should apply deloading there. Now I want, for the information of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to say that a few years ago, in 1965, there was a select committee on the Constitution. In the Constitution provision is made for loading and deloading. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout was a member of that select committee. He is a man who said &#x2026;</p>

Then a proposal was made by Mr. Steyn to the effect that the deloading should only be 30 per cent, i.e. 70 per cent of the quota. There was no vote on that. Now I want to remind the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the Prime Minister asked him where they stood in respect of this matter. I want to inform him that my constituency would also like to know where it stands in respect of this matter. I have a constituency which is larger than 10,000 square miles.

<p>May I ask the Minister a question? Does the Minister adopt the attitude that a man from the rural areas, merely because he is from the rural areas, is entitled to a vote which is worth more than that of a man in the city? [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This is not the matter which gave rise to these resolutions. I am now asking the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to tell us where he stands in respect of this matter, because we should like to know. There are other matters as well which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised, but unfortunately my time is spent. I cannot therefore reply to that now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should deal first of all with a matter which the hon. the Minister raised, namely the question of terrorists on our borders. I am glad that the hon. the Prime Minister is here, because I did not have the opportunity of replying to some of the things he said during the no-confidence debate, owing to the time factor. I hope that he will hear what I have to say.</p>

<p>I did not really appreciate what the hon. the Minister was getting at when he went on and on about our boys on the border and terrorism. He was kind enough to ask me, in my capacity as chairman of the Justice Group on this side of the House, to accompany him and the chairman of the Justice Group on the other side on a tour of the borders to see what our boys in the Police Force are doing. Let me say now what the hon. the Minister will remember me saying to a group of our people, when he asked me to address them. I said: &#x201C;Van albei kante van die Raad is ons almal trots op julle vir die werk wat julle hier doen&#x201D;. I think that I was speaking for everyone when I said that.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with what the hon. the Minister said. He was apparently leading up to the hon. member for Innesday letting out something. He said that he should not be prepared to make anything public because it would then be available to our enemies. I want to ask him: Who made public what was in that document? Was it the hon. member for Innesdal, or was it the hon. the Prime Minister? No one knew what this was all about. There was something about &#x201C;meeluistering&#x201D;. I did not know what &#x201C;meeluistering&#x201D; was all about. It was only when the hon. the Prime Minister expounded on this document and told one what it was all about that one had any idea at all of what was in this document. Surely the hon. the Minister of Police should not be so worried about the hon. member for Innesdal mentioning part of a document which appears to be a secret document. What he should be worried about is how that document came to be in the hands of the hon. member for Innesdal, how it disappeared from the place it should have been. That is what he should be worried about.</p>

<p>Let me deal now with what the hon. the Minister of Police said about the enquiry into the deaths in the police van. He mentioned the recommendations which were made. He mentioned the facts that had been discovered. If I may say so, Sir, my reaction was &#x201C;elementary, my dear Watson&#x201D;. Why on earth had the department not known about this long before? They took all this time, and suddenly a commission had to tell them, in three volumes. When the hon. the Minister makes the offer that he will make that report available to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and to me, so that we can look at it, I should like to say that we are here in our public capacity. We are not here in our private capacity. I want to ask the hon. the Minister why he will not make this public. What is the point of our seeing this document in our private capacities, and then being bound not to say anything about it, because it has been shown to us in confidence? We raised this matter in the House and we asked for an explanation from the Government. We were told nothing until he appointed a commission of enquiry, which reported in November. Now he tells this House that he will not make the document available <span class="col_1151-1152" refersTo="page_0589"/>to the House. Sir, we represent the people. This Government must get that into their heads. We all sit here in our capacities as representatives of the people. We do not do things that the people are not allowed to take part in.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, and to this Parliament. Sir, can the hon. the Minister tell this House why he cannot lay the report on the Table and thus make it available? I shall tell him why he cannot do so. He cannot do so, because quite obviously it must disclose some tremendous incompetence on the part of the hon. the Minister and his colleagues. The Minister must not tell us in this House that it is in the interests of the State that this document cannot be revealed. That is what he said in answer to my question last Friday. Actually it is not in the interests of the National Party that this document cannot be laid on the Table, because it will disclose tremendous incompetence on the part of the administration of this Government just before the election.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but as I have said, I am not here in my private capacity. I am here in my public capacity. What makes this even more interesting is that when that hon. Minister talks about the interests of the State, I think we are entitled to wonder whether he does not in fact mean the interests of the National Party. Do you remember what happened when this matter was raised last year, Mr. Speaker? We raised this matter in one of the short, snappy, half-hour debates when you, Mr. Speaker, ruled that this was a matter of public importance and of urgency. We used the occasion, Sir, under your guidance; you said that it was such an occasion. What was that hon. Minister&#x2019;s attitude? His attitude was that it was a scandal that this matter was raised here and that in fact we only raised the matter so that we could &#x201C;beswadder&#x201D; the name of South Africa overseas. In other words, what he was saying was that it was not in the interests of the State that we should raise this matter. Now he says that it is not in the interest of the State that this Parliament should have disclosed to it what the findings of that commission are. I feel the same about this comment on the interests of the State as I did about his comments when we raised the matter last year.</p>

<p>I do not quite know how to describe it, but the hon. the Minister then tried to deal with the difficulty in which he found himself when the hon. member for Durban (Point) asked him a question the other day. The question was a very simple one and read as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether any alleged security leakage from the Bureau of State Security or Military Intelligence has been reported to him or his department; if so, by whom;</li>

<li>(2) whether the report has been investigated; if so, with what result?</li>

</ol>

<p>Does that hon. Minister really want to tell this House that he did not know what the hon. member for Durban (Point) was getting at? Is the fact of the matter not that he wanted to avoid the question? If I may use an expression which the hon. the Leader of the House uses very often in respect of hon. members, he was too clever by half, this time. The answer was &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Does the hon. the Minister not appreciate that on 9th February &#x2026;</p>

This is too important a matter to have a small play on words. The hon. the Minister either knows about it or he does not. The Police are investigating the matter or they are not. This Parliament should not be treated in this way. This is the attitude they have to Parliament. Their attitude is that they can play with Parliament. What is the position?

He must not threaten me because I have nothing to be threatened about and will not be threatened by this hon. Minister or anyone else.

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Not only has a lot of nonsense been spoken, according to the Prime Minister, but he said that section 29 has not altered the law at all. That was always the law and this section merely clarified it. He defended Sampie Froneman, who was the Deputy Minister in charge of the Bill at the time. He said that he was absolutely right. He congratulated him on his behaviour at the congress. Then, when my hon. leader raised the matter in the No-Confidence debate, the Prime Minister said &#x201C;Ask the member for Durban North&#x201D;. My hon. leader said that I did not agree with him. Then he said &#x201C;Go and ask another advocate whether that is the position or not&#x201D;. Now let me call my first witness. I only need to call one, really. This is the Johannesburg Bar, the biggest Bar Council in the country, which said in its statement about section 29&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Froneman was incorrect if he told Parliament that the provision was only a modification of the existing practice and that every single part of the measure is already existing in a law or in an existing statute. The provision takes away from the courts their established right to protect a citizen from an unwarranted claim of privilege by the executive and to ensure that citizens&#x2019; rights are maintained.</block>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Now the hon. member for Prinshof says that is nonsense, but, Sir, it is terribly interesting that the day that this Parliament adjourned last year his Bar Council, the Pretoria Bar Council, came oui with exactly the same statement. So they are also talking nonsense. It so happened that the Natal Bar Society did it as well. It so happened that the Cape Bar decided to do the same. It so happened also that the General Council of the Bar, which only speaks when it speaks unanimously for all the Bar Councils, approved of every single statement that was made. So the hon. the Prime Minister, when he says that the hon. Leader of the Opposition must find another advocate, is going to have some difficulty. Is it a lot of nonsense that they have spoken? Was it a lot of nonsense that was spoken by Judge Kowie Marais and by other judges? Was it a lot of nonsense that was spoken by all the deans of the faculties of Law? Are they all wrong and the hon. the Prime Minister, the Administrator of the Orange Free State and the hon. member for Prinshof correct? No, Sir! This is one of the difficulties. It is the arrogance that he displayed which is so disturbing. The hon. the Prime Minister is a lawyer. He has practised at the Bar. Surely he must appreciate that one side is always wrong. Why cannot he be big enough to admit that this is so? But what worries me, is that the hon. the Prime Minister is already determined. It does not matter what the commission said; he says that section 29 makes no difference whatsoever to the existing law. The hon. the Prime Minister went on to quote various examples. He said that there was a difficult decision in Natal in 1965, presumably in Naicker&#x2019;s case. He said that in 1963 he signed a certificate and the court accepted it.</p>

<p>Of course I know all about it. But it is irrelevant. What I am trying to drum into the hon. the Prime Minister and what my hon.

<p>It is most difficult to get the hon. the Prime Minister to understand that that decision said that the court had a residual discretion. It also said something else which contradicted the hon. the Prime Minister where he said that in South Africa it went even further than in Britain and that officials were entitled to give certificates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is exactly what happened in the Free State case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but never mind about the Free State case. The matter ended with the case of <i>Van der Linde and <span class="col_1157-1158" refersTo="page_0592"/>Calitz</i> (1967, volume 2, p. 239). Would the hon. the Prime Minister like to read it? I will pass it over to him. Division, namely that those officials cannot give such a certificate. It has to come from the executive head in the provinces, for example from the Executive Committee, and here from a Cabinet Minister.</p>

<p>There are so many other contradictions, apart from the contradiction of the hon. the Prime Minister himself, from the hon. the former Deputy Minister, who said that this had been the law in England for 100 years. The hon. the Prime Minister himself admitted the other day in a Press statement or in a speech reported in the Press that, in fact, up to 18 months ago only had it not been the law. But the House of Lords 18 months ago said if that was the law stated by the hon. the Deputy Minister, then it was no longer the law.</p>

<p>I have only a few minutes left, and I still want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister two things. I want to remind him of his own definition of democracy when he addressed the General Council of the Bar in Grahamstown a few years ago when he was Minister of Justice. He said that democracy was &#x201C;general and regular elections and a free and independent judiciary&#x201D;.

<p>What use has the commission of inquiry? What does it matter what the commission of inquiry finds? This hon. Prime Minister has already prejudged the whole matter. He has already determined that in fact it is the law, that it should be the law and that a lot of nonsense has been spoken about it. That is the attitude of the hon. the Prime Minister towards the commission and section 29. I ask again, will the commission report, in fact, before the 22nd April? What did he appoint it for? To look into section 29? Sir, look at the attitude.</p>

<p>I want to give just one more example of the manner in which he regards the security of the State, the manner in which this Government is prepared to use the machinery of the State for its own purposes. What happened when there was this outcry by most responsible people, judges and Bar Councils, as I have mentioned? What happened when he constituted the commission? The commission was to &#x201C;inquire into and submit recommendations and a report on the following &#x2026;&#x201D;. Then he set it out. Then suddenly the hon. member for Ermelo said something, and he thought, &#x201C;My goodness me&#x201D; &#x2014;he must have been advised by someone who also wants to be too clever by half. He decided *o pillory him before the commission, because it was sitting and it could easily be done. But what is interesting is that in the terms of reference of the commission of inquiry, because this is more important to the country in his opinion than the other matter, &#x201C;the commission has been requested to inquire <i>immediately</i> into and report <i>forthwith&#x201D;</i>. Why? Which is more important? Let us get our perspective right. Is it more important that the hon. member for Ermelo has said that it would cost R40 million when it in fact will cost only R4 million? Or is it more important that the country be satisfied about section 29, about the power of the courts to intervene on behalf of the individual where the State might molest his interests? That is the most important thing, namely, access to free and independent courts. That is the byword in our policy and that is what the people will get after the 22nd April.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that this Government cannot be trusted with the liberties of the individual. Look at the performance they put up last year when the Boss Bill was discussed. During the discussion or clause 29 not one hon. member opposite could get up to justify or to condone it. Nor the hon. member for Houghton, of course, but that is by the way. That is the stage we have now reached. When your parliamentary representatives are clearly wrong this is what happens. Either the hon. the Prime Minister does not understand what clause 29 means or he knows what it means but he is determined to have the power and we want to know why. I think the answer to that &#x201C;why&#x201D; is either that he does not know or that he wants the power for a certain purpose. Why should the courts be precluded from hearing evidence?

One can, however, be prevented from pressing one&#x2019;s claim, because one can be prevented from giving evidence about the events that took place because in the opinion of a minister it would not be in the interests of the State.

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now seen here an exhibition which in the sixteen years I have been a member of this House, I have never seen before. I want the hon. member for Durban (North) to listen very carefully. During the No-Confidence debate I quoted certain passages from Hansard, as a result of which I accused him of having said that South Africa was a police state or developing into one. I now challenge the hon. member to deny that he said South Africa was a police state. Does he deny it? No, he does not have the courage. I am now accusing the hon. member of having told the world that South Africa was a police state. Does the hon. member deny this? [Interjections.] I shall deal with the hon. member for Durban (Point) at a later stage. I am asking the hon. member for Durban (North) once again whether he denies that he said South Africa was a police state. He will not reply now, because his Hansard is lying here in front of me. The hon. member ought to be ashamed of himself for having been so indignant the other day because I said he had said South Africa was a police state, whereas he knows he has been propagating this throughout the country and whereas he knows he said it in this House. I have here another quotation of what the hon. member said on another occasion. However, it was with profound indignation that the hon. member denied here that he had ever said South Africa was a police state. On 22nd January, 1963, he &#x2026;</p>

<p>Wait a minute; the hon. member is talking now and I want to repeat this question to him: Did you say that South Africa was a police state, yes or no? I shall furnish the hon. member with the date. He need not be afraid of it. I am testing the hon. member&#x2019;s courage and his sincerity. This is what is going to be tested in the weeks ahead. <span class="col_1161-1162" refersTo="page_0594"/>In the course of the No-Confidence debate I accused the hon. member of having said that South Africa was a police state. At the time the hon. member exploded in indignation. Does the hon. member deny that he said South Africa was a police state? Now the hon. member does not know anything about it, but when I mentioned the date, he was quick enough to ask what the date was. The date is 22nd January, 1963. What I now want to read out to him, is recorded in Hansard (Vol. 5, column 73). These are his words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Minister will learn the lesson now, the lesson is that this turning of South Africa into a police state &#x2026; will not solve the problem.</block>

<p>Is the hon. member not ashamed of himself? Is the hon. member not ashamed of denying that he said this while he knows he did? Surely he knows he goes around saying this all over the country. The whole speech the hon. member has now made, amounts to South Africa&#x2019;s being a police state. The hon. member&#x2019;s two friends are looking at me in a funny way, but I shall deal with them in a moment. Because the hon. member for Innesdal has made a mistake, the hon. member for Durban (North) proclaims that South Africa is a police state.</p>

<p>He said we were changing South Africa into a police state. So much tor that hon. member and so much for the question of the police state. I thought I was going to speak to-morrow, but the hon. member made me so angry that I had to speak now.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the hon. member for Port Natal. In the course of the No-Confidence debate the hon. member for Port Natal, and I am sorry the hon. member is not here to-night, delivered himself of untruths, the like of which this House has never heard before. For instance, he said, &#x201C;I have a letter from him&#x201D;&#x2014;the reference is to me&#x2014;&#x201C;in which he said that 600 Indian traders in Durban are still looking for trading premises after being evicted from the ones they were in&#x201D;. I want to say that it is a downright untruth that I have ever written such a thing to the hon. member. The hon. member ough to be ashamed of himself for telling the world that we evicted 600 Indian traders from their trading premises before they had obtained other trading premises. What his accusation amounts to, is that we deprived 600 Indian traders of their livelihood and that we took the bread out of their mouths. There is nothing which can besmirch South Africa&#x2019;s good name more than that accusation which was made by the hon. member for Port Natal. Any government which takes the bread out of their mouths and evicts them from their business premises while they cannot offer those people alternative accommodation, is worthy of being condemned. What did I in point of fact write to that hon. member? In regard to the Indian traders in Durban and the position in Chatsworth I wrote to him as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Originally there were 607 displaced Indian traders in Greater Durban. An unknown number have, however, re-settled on their own accord.</block>

<p>But where did I tell him that they had been evicted from their trading premises? I have repeatedly said that they are not evicted before they have alternative accommodation, and the hon. member for Port Natal ought to know this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>But where is he?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he is not here at the moment. But he told the world that 600 Indian traders had been evicted from their shops and that they were unable to get other accommodation. Is it not a shocking thing to say while he has from time to time received the assurance that not one single Indian trader would be evicted from his trading premises until such time as alternative accommodation was offered to him in his own group area? I challenge any hon. member from the Natal area, the hon. member for Umbilo, the hon. member for Musgrave, the hon. member for Pinetown or any other hon. member from Natal who is spreading these low, base stories against South Africa, to prove that we are evicting these Indians from their trading premises without affording them alternative accommodation. Can they bring me one single Indian trader who has been treated in that manner? If they can bring me one, I shall resign as Minister of Community Development. But they do not mind telling these stories to the world. The only Indians who have been evicted from their shops, are those Indians who were offered alternative accommodation, who were given twelve months&#x2019; grace to change accommodation but then refused to do so. If they are in fact evicted, it is done by court order alone. But that side of the House is spreading the story here that Indian traders are recklessly being forced to leave their business premises and that they do not have an opportunity of carrying on business. I just want to say to that hon. member that if he had a grain of decency in him, he would not only apologize to me, not only to the Department, but also to South Africa for that abominable untruth he spread about South Africa.</p>

<p>But he also told a second untruth. In the accusation he levelled at Mr. Con Botha, the then secretary of the National Party, he said, <i>inter alia</i>, the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then two years later the rest of the ground &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is land which the Community Development Board allegedly bought from Indians&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1163-1164" refersTo="page_0595"/>&#x2026; was put out to tender. There can be no question about that as I have the relevant dates on which this was done. Mr. Speaker, do you know who bought the rest of the ground. It was bought by the secretary of the Nationalist Party in Natal. Mr. Con Botha bought the second piece of ground in the name of his wife.</block>

<p>What is the impression the hon. member wanted to create by saying this? He wanted to suggest that Mr. Con Botha had bought that land under suspicious circumstances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>In a dishonest manner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in a dishonest manner. He also suggested that Mr. Botha&#x2019;s tender had not been the highest one, or that there had not been a tender and that Mr. Botha had obtained the land in an underhand manner. According to the hon. member Mr. Botha wanted to conceal his underhand dealings and bought the land in the name of his wife. What are the facts of the matter? The facts of the matter are that the land was advertised for tender purposes in the <i>Daily News</i> and in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 30th September, 1966, and in the <i>Nataller</i> of 7th October, 1966. Six tenders were received and Mr. Con Botha&#x2019;s was the highest of the six. The land was subsequently allotted to Mr. Botha. It was not registered in his wife&#x2019;s name either. It was registered in the the name of Cornelius Johannes van Rooyen Botha. Having submitted the highest tender and gained possession of the land that way, Mr. Botha sold the land to a company in which he and his wife are equal shareholders. What is wrong with that? But the impression is now being created here that the Department of Community Development sold the land to Mr. Botha under false pretences and did so because he was the secretary of the National Party.</p>

<p>But the hon. member also told a third untruth. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The third piece of ground was sold to a person who had in fact surveyed the ground for the Department.</block>

<p>But the fact of the matter is that this Mr. W. J. Schelin was the surveyor and he did not buy one single square inch of land. In fact, he did not even tender for one single square inch of that land. Never before have there been so many untruths about so many people in such a short speech as was the case in this speech made by the hon. member for Port Natal. I say he ought to be ashamed of himself. He obtains this information from letters he receives from me. Out of courtesy I wrote these letters in reply to his letters. I just want to tell him that if he does not apologize to Mr. Botha and Mr. Schelin, I shall pay no attention to his criticism in future. Nor shall I reply to his letters again. I simply will not do it. And if the <i>Natal Mercury</i> does not publish denials of this disgraceful report in the same way as they published the report, I shall know how to deal with them.</p>

<p>But now I want to deal with another group, the new high priests of South Africa, namely the Hertzog Calvinists. I am very sorry that the hon. member for Innesdal is not present. I want to take him to task first. After all, he is the high priest of Innesdal, Jaap Moari. Under his leadership they are proclaiming here in South Africa that I allegedly wrote to the Girl Guides that &#x201C;the Government is happy with mixed parades&#x201D;. I want to tell him that it is a downright lie that I wrote anything of that nature to the Girl Guides. But these Hertzog Calvinists, these new sanctimonious people we find in this country, deal with the truth in a manner I have in many a year not seen truth dealt with. Just look at the hon. member for Innesdal himself. If he says such a thing in this House, just imagine what he is going to say in the rural areas. Here in this House he manhandles the truth recklessly; he halves the truth and violates it. Just see what he does. He quoted from a letter which was written by my private secretary to the head of the Girl Guides, and in which only the following is said&#x2014;this is the relevant part&#x2014;&#x201C;&#x2026; and have to inform you that the Minister agrees with your exposition &#x2026;&#x201D; And from this &#x201C;exposition&#x201D;, with which I allegedly agreed, he read out the following sentence only: &#x201C;the Government is happy about mixed parades &#x2026;&#x201D; That was all he read out. His behaviour in this House is shameless. But he did not read the rest of the paragraph, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; provided they take place at venues where separate facilities are available; the various race groups assemble in separate groups on the parade ground and the march past takes place by groups, i.e. the all-white group first, all Coloureds, all Indians, all Bantu after that, so that they do not march past in a mixed order.</block>

<p>No, this was not read. [Interjections.] Now I come to the hon. member for Ermelo. It is not I who used the words &#x201C;mixed parades&#x201D;. It is this lady, the leader of the movement, who used these words, but her conditions were quite correct. That is why I told my private secretary that he could inform her that everything was in order.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that hon. member now. Now this hon. member says that I am happy with mixed parades. I am not happy with them. Just as the people in the last World War were &#x201C;bomb happy&#x201D;, so the hon. member for Innesdal is &#x201C;election happy&#x201D;, for he knows he is going to forfeit his deposit. &#x201C;Meat pie&#x201D; is going to make &#x201C;mincemeat&#x201D; of him at that election. What are the facts of the matter? The facts of the matter are that the Girl Guide movement has Whites and non-Whites <span class="col_1165-1166" refersTo="page_0596"/>in its ranks and always holds separate parades. This is not because the law lays this down. This has become tradition in South Africa. They hold their parades separately. But now the position is that they invited Lady Baden-Powell, an elderly lady of between 80 and 84 years. I do not know her exact age. At that time the leader of the Girl Guides in South Africa, through the Leader of the Opposition, approached the Prime Minister and wanted to know what could be done since the poor old lady could not address the Whites and the non-Whites separately. The hon. the Prime Minister subsequently entrusted to me and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development the task of going into this matter. In point of fact, there is nothing in the Act prohibiting this, but we told them that where venues and ground could be obtained, they could arrange the Girl Guides in different groups, a white and a non-white group. The only condition that was laid down, was that these groups had to sit and stand separately and that Lady Baden-Powell could then address them. If a march past had to take place, the Whites had to march past first, subsequent to which it would be the turn of the non-Whites. Is this really something very strange in South Africa?</p>

<p>I am coming to the tea now. And I am now coming to the tea you had with the Bantu. [Laughter.] And if you do not look out. I shall also tell whom you danced with. [Laughter.] That hon. member is the last one who should raise the question of tea. After all, we do have other mixed gatherings. At New-lands, Ellis Park and in circuses we have mixed audiences. In various spheres this has been the policy of the Government of which that hon. member also used to be a member. For instance, there was our Republic Festival, where a number of Bantu were present in the church in Pretoria at the inauguration of the State President. It was raining. At that stage the hon. member was perfectly happy about the presence of Bantu inside the church. But if he had to speak about it to-day, he would say that while poor white boys and girls were being drenched outside, a lot of Kaffirs were sitting in the church, and this takes place under the regime of this Government! But this was the policy of Dr. Verwoerd. All that happened here was that, with the retention of all the precepts of apartheid, we merely tried to perform an act of decency towards an elderly lady of 84. That this is strange to the hon. member for Ermelo, does not astonish me at all. Nor do I find it at all astonishing that this is strange to his whole party.</p>

<p>Now I come to that hon. member who complained about the fact that Officers of both races were allowed to have tea with Lady Baden-Powell. I had no control over that matter, nor was this against the law, as long as invitations were not sent to outsiders. This is done during the sessions of the Anglican synods. At those synods Whites have tea along with black clergymen. This is also done during sessions of Dutch Reformed synods, where Whites have tea along with non-white missionaries. This has always been the position. What is so objectionable about it? When the hon. member was still Minister of Health he addressed a health conference at Turfloop. Subsequent to that he took refreshments along with non-white professors and lecturers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the hon. member for Ermelo whether he is not ashamed of himself. He knows just as well as I do that under certain circumstances the position has always been that certain non-Whites may stay in white hotels. But now they come along with their little newspaper pretending that this is a totally new thing and that it is being permitted by the present Prime Minister. I just want to tell Dr. Willie Lubbe, who is such a great Calvinist, that his little newspaper is the most untruthful newspaper I have ever read in South Africa. After 25 years of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, this is saying a great deal. To say that under this Government it is being permitted that non-Whites may stay in white hotels, is an utter and absolute untruth. Under the Group Areas Act of 1950 there was no prohibition on non-Whites to enter white restaurants, cinemas and hotels. That was left to convention and tradition. The first time action was taken by the Government, was more or less at the time of the Sharpville riots, when a number of non-Whites sat down in the restaurants of the O.K. Bazaars, Stuttafords and others. In addition there was the trouble at the Luxurama in Wynberg. Subsequent to that a proclamation was issued in terms of which these people were forbidden to enter restaurants and places of amusement without a permit from the Department of Community Development.</p>

Carpio stayed in the Union Hotel. The Egyptian maize buyers stayed in cur hotels.

<p>Then the hon. member for Ermelo complains about a luxury hotel which is going to be erected in the densely built-up area in front of the Union Buildings, where Whites and non-Whites can stay together. Where did the hon. member hear that? Who but the liar Willie Lubbe told the hon. member this? Who said that a luxury hotel was going to be erected in the middle of Pretoria, right in front of the Union Buildings, a hotel where Whites and non-Whites can stay together? Are you not ashamed of yourself for propagating such things here?</p>

<p>Under oath? Heaven help us! I beg your pardon. Sir, I wanted to say, &#x201C;Good gracious!&#x201D; This is an absolute untruth. What really happened there? The two De Jongh brothers applied for permission to build a luxury hotel there. There is a possibility that if important Black visitors from abroad should come here before other facilities are available, they will stay in that hotel of the De Jonghs. They will stay there, just as the others stayed in the Union Hotel not far from there and did so with the permission of the hon. member for Ermelo. Now he comes forward with the story that the Black people are going to be enticed into our White residential areas, and he wants to know what is going to happen to our poor White boys and girls. Nobody has done more to disrupt our whole apartheid policy than did the hon. member for Ermelo when he was Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. What did he do at the time? Now the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and I have been saddled with this problem. What did he do at that time? By signing his name he gave permission for a luxury restaurant for Bantu, Coloureds and Indians to be fitted up in the micro-wave tower which is situated in Hillbrow, the most densely populated White part in the Republic and a part which has already become a problem area.</p>

I intend to bring this House back to some of the issues that were raised by the hon. member for Durban (North). These issues are far too important to be passed over, they are far too important to allow the Nationalist Government not to deal with them. One of the most important points raised by the hon. member for Durban (North) is the fact that through the years we have been opposing legislation introduced in this House by the Nationalist Government on the pretext that these laws are required in order to control the country and in order particularly to deal with subversive elements and elements attempting to sabotage the country. I want to point out to this House that on many occasions when we on this side of the House have felt that the laws which the Government were attempting to pass in order to acquire powers to deal with subversive elements, with saboteurs, etc., were necessary, we have supported this Government when we have felt that these powers were justified, having regard to the existing conditions at that particular time.</p>

<p>The hon. Chief Whip who has interjected knows that on many occasions when the Government has placed before this House this type of legislation, we have readily supported them. We have done so, because we took the view that the powers asked for were justified in the circumstances which prevailed at that time. When we opposed the Government we opposed them on the grounds that the powers which they sought were quite unnecessary, far-reaching and beyond what was required to meet the existing situation. We pointed out to this House that the danger in taking such far-reaching powers is that it makes the Government, as it were, punch drunk. It is very easy to abuse those powers and to use them, not against elements which try to subvert the State, but against the Government&#x2019;s own political enemies. Have we on this side of the House not been proved to be justified in our opposition to the laws which we opposed? Of course we have been proved to be justified.</p>

Mr. Speaker, will the hon. the Chief Whip deny that the hon. the Prime Minister used the Security Police against the writers of smear letters which were directed not against the State as such, but against the Prime Minister and his party? Were the Security Police not used against the political opponents of the Nationalist Party? This has nothing to do with communists at all. Will he deny that? What is more, Sir, these letters had nothing to do with the subversion of the State. The smear letter writers had nothing to do with the subversion of the State. They were merely criticizing the hon. the Prime Minister and his party, and who did he use against them? He used the Security Police. What do <span class="col_1171-1172" refersTo="page_0599"/>we find now to-day, Sir? It appears to us of the official Opposition that the same may be happening to the Herstigte Nasionale Party, We are not interested in the fight between the Nationalist Party and the Herstigtes. Both parties are Nationalists. Both parties, in our opinion, are extremists. Both parties, in our opinion, are verkramp and we wish to have nothing to do with either. What we are concerned about as the official Opposition in this country, is that it appears to us that the Government is using the far-reaching powers, which it took, to attack the Herstigtes, not because they are subverting the State, or saboteurs, or anything of that sort, but simply because they are political opponents of this Government. We wish to have clear proof, and the country is entitled to clear proof, that the Government is not using its powers for these purposes. What have we had so far?</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Prinshof knows the facts. It is up to the Government to reply to these points and, since the hon. member for Prinshof is so loquacious, perhaps he will get up and explain to us the reasons for the actions taken against the hon. member for Innesdal. If this sort of thing is done against the smear letter writers, and if this is done against the Herstigtes, what assurance have we as the official Opposition that these far-reaching powers are not going to be used against us, the legitimate political opponents of this Government? Let us examine some of the answers we have been given. We have questioned the Minister of Police and the Prime Minister on these matters. My Leader, during the no-confidence debate, asked the hon. the Prime Minister how he explains that a document, which he claims is top secret, got into the hands of the hon. member for Innesdal. We are still waiting for the answer to this question. The hon. the Minister of Police addressed the House this evening for half an hour, and he did not even attempt to explain to this House how a top secret document, bearing the signature of the hon. the Prime Minister, got into the hands of the hon. member for Innesdal.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am coming to that. This document, which presumably runs into eight foolscap pages, must deal with a number of very important matters if it is a top secret document. If that sort of document can get into the hands of persons who are not entitled to it, what assurance does the country have, and what assurance does this House have that the security of the State is in safe hands when it is in the hands of the Nationalist Party? The other curious aspect of this matter is that the hon. the Minister of Police tells us that nobody reported to him, as Minister of Police, the fact that a top secret document had got into the wrong hands. I am sorry that the hon. the Prime Minister is not in his seat this evening, because I would have liked to put the question directly and unequivocally to him: Did he, or did he not report to the Minister of Police the loss of this document or the fact that this document or a copy thereof had fallen into the hands of someone who should not have had it? If he did not report it, why did he not? These are questions that this House and the country are entitled to have answered. We hope that we shall hear answers to these important questions from other members of the Cabinet as well as other members on that side who rise to take part in this debate.</p>

<p>Sir, while I am on this subject, I wish to accuse the hon. the Prime Minister of irresponsibility in the handling of this matter in this House. The hon. member for Innesdal referred to one paragraph in this document which suggested that &#x201C;meeluistering&#x201D; was taking place in this country. He interpreted this paragraph as support for his contention that telephone tapping was taking place. The hon. the Prime Minister stood up, and what did he say? He said that he had been forced, by the fact that the hon. member for Innesdal had raised the subject, to disclose to the House facts which would endanger the safety of our young people guarding the borders between this country and other territories adjoining us. This was an irresponsible attitude to adopt, in the light of what the hon. the Prime Minister told this House. What did he tell this House? All that he told this House was that that paragraph in the document had nothing to do with telephone tapping. All that it referred to was the fact that monitoring of subversive elements, and that sort of thing, was taking place in this <span class="col_1173-1174" refersTo="page_0600"/>country. Sir, he was not divulging anything that the enemies of South Africa do not know. Everybody knows that all Western nations resort to the use of monitoring devices to ensure that they are well informed as to what the communists and other persons who wish to subvert the State are doing. The hon. the Prime Minister did not tell us in this House where monitoring is taking place, where those devices are situated or who is actually doing the monitoring. He did not disclose any of that sort of information, which could have given any secret information away. All he told us was that monitoring devices are being used, and this is a fact which is well-known to everybody including those who wish to subvert the State. To say that he was disclosing to the House information which could jeopardize the safety of our young men guarding our borders, was the height of irresponsibility. This attitude was repeated in the House this evening by the hon. the Minister of Police who again said that the hon. member for Innesdal had disclosed information which would place our enemies in a better position to endanger the lives of our young people who are protecting our borders.</p>

<p>Why are you so worried about it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Why I am worried about it, and I repeat what I said a moment ago, is that the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Police appear to me to be using this incident as a smokescreen in order to make use of their far-reaching powers not to control subversion, terrorists and so on, but to use it against their political enemies. As we ourselves are their political enemies and will continue to be their political enemies, we are very concerned that their powers are being abused in this way, if indeed they are. I do not know whether these powers are being abused in the case of the hon. member for Innesdal because we do not have all the facts before us. Nevertheless, those facts which we do have and the fact that we have not had satisfactory answers to the questions we have raised lead us to a very strong suspicion that this is in fact what may be happening. It is up to this Government to assure this House and the country that in fact they are not abusing their powers by using them simply against their political opponents.</p>

<p>I want to refer to another matter on which the Minister of Police reported this evening, i. e. the report on the investigation into these van deaths. Once again it appears to us that the hon. the Minister of Police and the Nationalist Government are glibly exhibiting their well-known attitude, i.e. that when they wish to not answer a question, it is usually against the interests of the State to answer if. It appears to us that once again they are resorting to this. I fail to see, and I should like some hon. member on that side of the House to explain to this House, how the report on the van deaths can possibly contain any matter which would not be in the interests of the State, as opposed to those of the Government and the Department of Police, to disclose. I can believe that this report contains unfavourable statements in regard to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department because the way in which this incident was handled certainly did not redound to the credit of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. But how could it possibly not be in the interests of the State to disclose this information? The only issue which this commission had to consider was the cause of the deaths of these people in the van and whether or not anyone was responsible, and what steps should be taken to ensure that a similar incident would not recur. How can the hon. the Minister of Police suggest to this House that an investigation of this nature into these three basic issues could possibly contain anything which would effect the interests of the State were it disclosed? No, Sir, I am afraid we are finding far too often with this Government these days that where they wish to hide their own incompetence and the fact that they are abusing their powers, they resort to the tactics that to disclose these matters would be against the interests of the State, whereas, in fact, it is no such thing. Of course, it would be contrary to the interests of the Government or the Nationalist Party. They would not like the electorate to know the truth. But that is a very different matter from saying that it is contrary to the interests of the State. The State of South Africa is not the same thing as the Nationalist Party. It is time that this Government realize this.</p>

<p>The other matter which I wish to deal with is also a matter which the hon. member for Durban (North) raised, and on which we do not intend to let this Government off the hook. Since they have refused to deal with it, I wish to deal with it once again to ensure that this time we shall get a reply. That is the whole issue over BOSS and section 29. The hon. the Prime Minister persists in telling this House that section 29 did not in any way alter the law as it then stood. He persists in telling the House and the country that the law, as it is in section 29, is the same as it has always been, and this despite the fact that we pointed out to him during the debate that that was not the case. I would forgive him for not accepting our word. He seldom does until such time as it is obvious to him that we are right. But I did expect of him to accept the statement made by our responsible and well thought of judges such as Mr. Justice Kowie Marais and Mr. Justice Ludorff, to name just two. But the most disappointing aspect of this matter is not so much that the hon. the Prime Minister is so obstinate, despite the fact that judges, lawyers, lecturers and professors in law have all expressed alarm over the far-reaching extent of this BOSS section, section 29, which was passed last year. The aspect of it that concerns us, is the fact that the hon. the Prime Minister has clearly prejudged this issue in two respects. Firstly, he did not make section 29 part of the terms of reference and said it was <span class="col_1175-1176" refersTo="page_0601"/>not necessary to enquire into it, and it was only when the judge who was chairman of the commission of enquiry decided to enquire into it that the hon. the Prime Minister accepted the position. Secondly, he appears to be prejudging the issue, because he told the country in statements made by him after he appointed the commission of enquiry that section 29 did not change the law and that it did not have the effect which judges, lawyers, professors in law and we on this side of the House claims that he did.</p>

I want to come back to the statement made by the hon. member for Potchefstroom. He reiterates that the hon. the Prime Minister was quite right and that he will prove it. We challenge the hon. the Prime Minister and any other hon. member on that side of the House, including the hon. member for Potchefstroom, to substantiate the statements the hon. member for Potchefstroom has just made. I want to go further and ask the hon. member for Potchefstroom what the purpose is of including this issue as part of the matters to be considered by the commission of inquiry if the Government has already made up its mind. It is quite obvious to us what is going to happen. They have already made up their minds, so whatever report is submitted by the commissioner who is sitting on this matter, we shall be told by the hon. the Minister for Police or by the hon. the Prime Minister that the report cannot be Tabled because it is not in the interests of the State to do so.

It is quite obvious to this House and it will be quite obvious to the country outside that we are going to have the same whitewashing operation that we have been used to in the past. When this matter is Tabled we shall get the same story, namely that it is not in the interests of the State to Table the report. We shall then have some weak statement from the hon. the Minister of Police telling us what is contained in this report but not being prepared to Table it so that we can debate it.</p>

<p>I wish to close by emphasizing that we have in the past, in opposing these far-reaching measures taken by this Government, expressed our deep concern that such far-reaching powers lead to arrogance and abuse and to a state of affairs where they will be used not for the purposes for which they were allegedly taken, namely to deal with communists and saboteurs and so on, but used against the legitimate political opponents of this Government.

<p>No, I merely want to ask him a question. The hon. member for Prinshof has challenged me to answer this question. Will he now answer our question as 1o how this document got into the hands of the hon. member for Innesdal?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I resumed my seat on purpose because I wanted the hon. member for Musgrave to reply to my question. I knew as well as the hon. members sitting around me that he had no reply and that he would not give one. The only reply the hon. member could, in fact, honestly give me is that they are joining forces with the Herstigte Nasionale Party against the National Party. That is the only reason why he made that speech. What are the facts of this matter? The facts of the matter are that an important document, signed by the Prime Minister, is suddenly read here in this House by the hon. member for Innesdal. It is evidently a document of eight pages; it is apparently a top security document. I regard it as this Government&#x2019;s duty to have this matter investigated. If the hon. the Minister of Police or the hon. the Prime Minister had not had this matter investigated our country would have been entitled to ask, where is our Government heading? In one way or another, how we do not know, this document ended up in the hands of the hon. member for Innesdal. Now hon. members on that side of the House ask us how this affects the security of South Africa, as if they could not imagine for themselves how this was possible. If they are then so stupid that they cannot see this I want to ask them: Supposing security documents come into any person&#x2019;s hands, what is going to happen on the borders of South Africa with the terrorists making an onslaught upon our young men? There is a leakage somewhere in our Police Force or in our Military Forces and these documents are apparently being obtained in some way or other. We do not know how many copies the hon. member for Innesdal made. We do not know how far the hon. member for Innesdal himself would go in revealing the contents of these documents. Let me accept for a moment that the hon. member for Innesdal is acting responsibly. In my humble opinion he did not do so. If I do, in fact, accept for a moment that he did act in this way, the question still remains whether those documents which he obtained could not also leak out elsewhere? Could they not leave the country? Could they not get our young men there into trouble? Was it not his duty, when the person gave it to him, or however he obtained it&#x2014;according to him he received it quite innocently through the post&#x2014;to have read the document immediately and, having seen that it bore a security stamp and was a top security document from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office, to have submitted it to the Police? Was it not his duty to do so? Was it not his duty to say to himself immediately that he should not read any further from the document since it was obviously not meant for his scrutiny? Should he not, as a responsible Member of Parliament, even if he is an Opposition member, immediately have returned the document to its source? No, we have reason to feel unsafe. We have reason to feel unsure and we have reason to investigate this matter. I notice that the hon. member for Durban (North) is now walking out. He also made an attack here. I hold it against them as advocates that, while the matter is being investigated, they do not only insinuate, but directly accuse the Government of now using the Police to intimidate the members of the Herstigte Nasionale Party. I regard this as an outrageous utterance. I know that these hon. members cannot reply to that.</p>

<p>I now come to the so-called section 29. I refuse to be taken in tow by the hon. member for Musgrave when he refers each time to the BOSS section. It is not the BOSS section. Section 29 of the General Law Amendment Act is a section embodying the legal position as it existed in common law. It is merely a more detailed definition. The hon. member for Durban (North) knows this. He knows very well what the difference is between common law and section 29. He knows that section 29 was in reality only a consolidation of the Government&#x2019;s standpoint. He knows very well that what the Appeal Court really said was that a privilege did, in fact, exist in respect of matters concerning State security. In other words, even under common law a person could say in court that it was in the country&#x2019;s interest that certain evidence should not be given. On the basis of that certificate our courts, and the English courts in England, have always said that the evidence need not be given. All that this court decision states is that the signature of the person concerned should be that of the political head of the department. The powers cannot be delegated. That position has been rectified by section 29. Section 29 now reads <span class="col_1179-1180" refersTo="page_0603"/>that on his signature the Minister can delegate that right to someone in his department. That person must be a responsible person who may then issue a certificate when he thinks that the country&#x2019;s security is being affected. There is an argument among jurists about the degree to which the Appeal Court case is affected by section 29. I notice that the two hon. members are now holding a discussion. I have to listen to them, but now they are not listening to me. I expect those hon. members to afford me the courtesy of listening to me as well.</p>

<p>There is now a difference of opinion. The hon. member speaks of the Johannesburg and Pretoria Bars. These are two Bars I know nothing about. He should rather speak of the Natal Bar. As far as the Pretoria Bar is concerned, I found out that the decision was taken without a proper and comprehensive legal opinion being submitted to the Bar.</p>

<p>Is it necessary for them to obtain a legal opinion?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>He asks if it is necessary. My standpoint is that when one wants to criticize such a section one must take into account that a Bar is composed of a lot of advocates and that everyone is busy. Those advocates are not all in a position to study the full implications of that Act. In my humble opinion it was the task of each Bar to say that they must first obtain a comprehensive legal opinion about what the precise extent of this section is. On the basis of that they must hold discussions and formulate their decision. I am now going to accept that the Bars acted in all good faith.</p>

<p>What about the judges then?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to accept that the judges expressed an opinion in all good faith. I am also going to accept that the reason why we are submitting a case to five judges in Bloemfontein is because there could possibly be five different opinions. In other words, there are as many different opinions as there are jurists. Legislation is now being submitted here which will altogether clarify the position. The hon. the Prime Minister goes still further and says that he sees that there is turbulence in the country, that there is a lot of discussion about it in legal circles and that is why the commission of enquiry has now been given the task of finding out to what extent section 29 differs from our common law position. Now there are complaints against that. Now the hon. members come along and ask us why the hon. the Prime Minister appointed a commission of enquiry for that. They gave us the reason, because they made such a fuss about virtually nothing. The matter has now been submitted to a proper technical enquiry because they made such a lop-sided fuss here. What is wrong with that? Surely there is no fault to be found with that at all. Now the hon. member for Durban (North) is blaming the hon. the Prime Minister for expressing such an opinion. The hon. member for Durban (North) is also a lawyer, is he not, and he surely also expresses his opinions. Even the hon. member for Musgrave expresses his opinion. Every man expresses his opinion, and now the hon. the Prime Minister comes along and also expresses his. The commission of enquiry can ignore this if it wants to, but we are all entitled to express opinions. Why may the hon. the Prime Minister not do so now? Oh no, this hon. Opposition actually makes one laugh. I now want to refer to another point and that is the point raised by the hon. member for Durban (North) as well as by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I want to reproach them most severely for this. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said this earlier on, and this evening the hon. member for Durban (North) once again said that he blamed the hon. the Prime Minister for appointing a commission to report on the allegation made by the hon. member for Ermelo. The allegation was that the Bureau for State Security would cost an amount of R50 million instead of R4 million. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is himself a lawyer, and now I want to put a question to him. These allegations were made at various meetings, at two, as far as I can remember. The hon. member for Ermelo may correct me. His allegations were reiterated by the hon. member for Innesdal at Bronkhorstspruit. Only the hon. member for Innesdal went further with the insult by saying that his source was such a sensitive one that they were afraid that the lives of the persons concerned would be jeopardized if the sources were revealed. Let us now look very honestly at this claim that R50 million would supposedly be spent on the Bureau for State Security. What does this allegation mean for South Africa? It means one of several things. It either means that the entire Public Service joined the Prime Minister in dishonesty, or it means that that hon. member&#x2019;s utterance was a complete fabrication.</p>
