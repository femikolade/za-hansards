<heading>MOTION OF CENSURE</heading>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, deeply conscious of its duty to the people, censures the Government for its failure to heed the increasing signs of dissatisfaction with its policies and administration, and condemns it for its apparent and obvious inability to govern South Africa in the interest of its ordinary citizens.</block>

<p>I do so, Sir, conscious that this is the first Session of a new Parliament, a new Parliament elected at a general election in which for the first time, I think since 1943, the Nationalist Party failed to make any progress. The result seems to have come as a surprise to the opinion pollsters. It also apparently came as a surprise to most of the political forecasters. Sir, it came as a surprise to the hon. the Prime Minister himself. In fact, Sir, the hon. gentleman not only forecast further gains for his Party within a few days of the election, but he had the temerity to foreshadow my retirement from public life &#x2026; [interjections] &#x2026; in frustration and disappointment. In retrospect it is difficult to understand why the hon. gentleman and his advisers found themselves so out of touch with the mood of the electorate, because to any student of politics who had taken the trouble to study by-election trends from 1966 onwards it must have been evident that there was a steady and growing swing away from the Government. This disenchantment was intensified at the time of the general election.</p>

<p>As you know, Mr. Speaker, there are various ways of evaluating election results. You can do it on the basis of the seats won in Parliament. You can do it on the basis of the percentage of votes cast <span class="col_21-22" refersTo="page_0025"/>for each party out of the total possible votes. That method has regard to abstentions as well. You can also do it on the basis of the percentage of votes cast for each party out of the total number of votes cast. Whichever way you do it, when you evaluate the results of the last election you find a substantial movement in the ranks of the electorate away from the present Government and the governing party. I believe that perhaps the most accurate way of evaluating election results is to look at the percentage of votes cast for each party out of the total number of votes cast. On this basis it is interesting to examine the 122 seats in which there were straight fights between the parties both in 1966 and 1970 and on the same delimitation. When this is done it is found that the United Party bettered its position in no less than 90 of those seats. The Government bettered its position in only 20 of those seats. The other battles were between different parties and they do not come into the comparison.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>What is even more interesting is that the United Party tended to improve its position more spectacularly in the urban and peri-urban areas where there are settled to-day many newcomers from the rural areas who are clearly dissatisfied and disenchanted with the manner in which this Government is managing their interests. The result is that we now have nine more seats in this House than we had at the end of the last session. But this is certainly not the sole measure of the improvement in our position in the election. That must be measured by the improved majorities in the seats which we won and the slashed majorities in the seats which we did not win. When the results are viewed in this light one cannot avoid the conclusion that the Government is even more out of touch with the people than even we imagined at the time of the last election.</p>

<p>I believe that the reasons for this change in the loyalties of the electorate are not far to seek. I think the first and one of the most important is the fact that this Government has grown more and more out of touch with the people of South Africa. It does not seem to realize that they are South Africans first whether they are English or Afrikaans-speaking. It does not seem to realize that they seek national unity on a basis of true South Africanism and want more than the sort of national unity on terms which is the best the Prime Minister and his party can offer. I believe that there is also a second reason for the change in the loyalties of the electorate. This is to be found in the growing maturity of the South African people. With that growing maturity many old political issues which divided us in the past have lost their appeal. The people of South Africa to-day are judging political parties on their ability to provide good government for South Africa. This is a sphere in which this Government has failed singularly because of the incompetence of its administration and its lack of interest in the well-being of the ordinary man in the street.</p>

<p>Of course, Sir, the electorate is also very conscious of the complete breakdown of this Government&#x2019;s non-European policies and, I believe is becoming increasingly intolerant of the sacrifices it is being called upon to make in the interests of a policy which it sees crumbling before its eyes. It appreciates too that in the interests of the ideology underlying the policy it is being faced with growing problems which are problems of the Government&#x2019;s making. What do we find? We find the manpower shortage is reaching crisis proportions; we find the country&#x2019;s rate of growth is being artificially restricted; we find the economy is not being well managed. We find the agricultural community, wrestling with one of the most ghastly droughts in our history, is receiving attention only in patchwork fashion and there is a disastrous lack of overall planning. And then, Sir, and perhaps above all there is the all too frequent evidence of incompetence and blundering on the part of individual Ministers.</p>

<p>I cannot hope to deal with all these issues. If this debate were to last twice as long as the five days for which it is scheduled it would not be possible to exhaust the list of Government misdeeds. I can only deal with one or two and draw attention also to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s fatuous attempts since the election, to rectify the position. In doing so, I want to warn again that pursuit of his policies must inevitably lead to further disasters because they are inconsistent with the exploitation of the true potential of the country&#x2019;s economy and the maximum advancement of the well-being of the ordinary citizen.</p>

<p>I believe that perhaps the most important reason for the falling off in Government support is the fact that after all these years in power the Nationalist Party has been steadily losing touch with the people. Thus the Prime Minister found himself in a dilemma. He found himself in a dilemma because he did not know, and his people were unable to tell him what support the verkrampte elements which had broken away from him, were likely to get from the electorate. As a consequence, what happened? As the election battle developed he either allowed or encouraged certain of his Ministers to pander to what they thought would be verkrampte support by making statements and indicating policies which certainly did not appear to be in the best interests of South Africa. One example of that was the sinister threat directed at Mr. Oppenheimer by the then Minister of Planning, <span class="col_23-24" refersTo="page_0026"/>Dr. De Wet, who now, like Dr. Albert Hertzog at the close of his ministerial career, has been deprived of his major portfolio and is left with Health and Mines. Could anything have been more calculated to play havoc with an outward-looking verligte image both inside and outside South Africa and to play up to verkrampte elements at home than the statements made by that hon. gentleman? It was a childish and absurd manoeuvre which, I believe, cost the Government votes at the polls.</p>

<p>Why are you crying?</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. gentleman asks why I am crying. I will tell him why I am upset. I am upset because South Africa has yet to pay for the irrefutable damage that such statements bring in their wake. It is useless to suggest that outsiders and businessmen at home will dismiss such outbursts very readily from their minds. It is now on record that when the Nationalist Party imagines itself to be in a tight corner politically there is little limit to the irresponsible things they will attempt in an effort to retain or obtain public support.</p>

<p>In similar vein we had the pre-election frolic of the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, Dr. Koornhof. Five jobs described by him as &#x201C;cracks in the wall of apartheid &#x201D; were to be closed to the Bantu. The Government had apparently hoped to sit back and watch the verkrampte votes pour in as a result, indifferent to the far-reaching effects this measure could have both in terms of the fate of employers, already hard pressed to find labour, and the feelings of the Bantu concerned. Indeed, the hon. the Deputy Minister landed himself in such a mess that we still do not know how he is going to extricate himself from it.</p>

<p>Which your people exploited in the election.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what the hon. the Minister is missing is that they create the gravest uncertainty in business, that they are an incitement to racial friction and even to hatred which can affect our very security as a nation. Throughout the election we were never free from the attempts of canvassers and agents on the other side to minimize the expenditure inseparable from the proper development of the Bantu homelands. But I have no doubt that the public to-day are beginning to realize that big money is involved in these developments, big money which is going to have to be found by the white man in South Africa. The public are beginning to realize something else and that is that independence can mean hitherto unsuspected dangers in respect of these homelands. They are aware that there is a communist danger in Lesotho and they do not like what they see developing in the field of diplomatic relations in respect of Botswana in connection with certain states in Africa hostile to us and in connection with possible diplomatic relations with Communist Russia itself. The fact is that the public is becoming more and more suspicious of Government policy in this sphere and feels that it is becoming embarrassingly clear that the Government is not governing with the aid and guidance of practical principles of policy, but according to the whim of party political ends.</p>

<p>These reasons for the Government&#x2019;s decline in popularity all fall within the category of reasons which are due to the Government&#x2019;s getting more and more out of touch with the people of the country. But there are other reasons as well. I believe that one of them was that the electorate was struck as never before by the extent of South Africa&#x2019;s isolation in respect of the outside world. Whatever bitterness we might feel at the irrational acts of spuriously motivated demos, I am afraid we cannot avoid a little soul-searching. We cannot avoid asking ourselves whether it was really necessary that South Africa should come to such a pass. How much are we to blame and how much hostility is justified? All South Africans with loyal sentiments obviously rush to the defence of their own country. But with what confidence can we leap into the battle when we think of the Japanese jockey incident, of Arthur Ashe and other stupid actions by the Ministers of the present Government?</p>

<p>I have mentioned the pre-election posturing of the present Minister of Health and the present Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. They are merely examples of the sort of curbs and restrictions being imposed on non-Whites and Whites in a blustering attempt to justify the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid. The snag is that the policy is now affecting people in many walks of life and all shades of political opinion. Individual inconvenience and hardship and universal disruption of natural economic growth are coming to be regarded as the only real fruits of apartheid. Positive constructive development, taking into account population growth, is being seen to be further away than ever. I would say that the frustrated phone user was also among those who put their cross with gusto against the present Government. This is no deficit budgeting administration. It has enjoyed the cosy warmth of revenue surpluses for years and years, but to judge by services received the public has good reason to wonder what the Government does with its money and now we are being faced with the possibility of <span class="col_25-26" refersTo="page_0027"/>transport bottlenecks which may in due course affect the development of the economy of the country itself. Unfortunately, too, there are too many people who had been adversely affected by the grave changes in business optimism which have taken place in recent months under the direction of this Government. In fact, Sir, the operative word in the South African economy to-day seems to be uncertainty.</p>

<p>I could go on because there are many more reasons why the Government has lost ground. However, what to me is important is that the trend against the Government is continuing. Even the coincidence of the announcement by the Minister of Transport, a day before the Langlaagte by-election, of a R60 million pay rise for the Railwaymen at a meeting held in a suburb of Langlaagte, did not stop the rot. Former Nationalist supporters stayed away from the polling booth; many voted for the United Party, and the result confirmed the swing away from this Government which is failing the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>And it seems to me that the Prime Minister is not unaware of what is happening. A day or two after the election he was reported as saying: &#x201C;Ek en elke lid van die Regering sal moet sorg dra dat administratiewe foute wat in die verlede begaan is, nie herhaal word nie. Sekere opknappingswerk sal gedoen moet word &#x201D;. Let us now see what &#x201C;opknappingswerk &#x201D; has been done by the hon. gentleman and what the possible effects thereof can be.</p>

<p>Of course, he immediately began with the job of tidying up his Cabinet. But when one looks at the changes opposite one can only come to the conclusion that he relied more on the flick of a duster and rearranging the same old furniture than on the merits of a fresh and new decor. The changes are curious; the motives, except to give some failures another chance in new portfolios, seem to be obscure. Despite the size of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s party he certainly does not seem to be suffering from an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Cabinet material. The effect is that the Cabinet is as colourless as ever and can do nothing to imbue the electorate with greater confidence in its abilities to provide efficient government for South Africa.</p>

<p>One piece of &#x201C;opknapping &#x201D; one would have expected after the gaffs of the Japanese jockey and Arthur Ashe, is that the Government would have avoided stupidities in the sphere of race relations. But now, look what has happened in respect of our own South African Chinese community. Since the election we seem to have had the one blunder after the other. Certain representatives of those people have been humiliated; the attendance of little children at a cr&#x00E8;che at Port Elizabeth had to be considered by the Cabinet itself apparently; and in some areas Chinese citizens are allowed to play with Whites in one sport but not in another. As we know, these people normally tend to associate with white people and are allowed to do so until some busybody or snooper complains, and the whole weight of the Government&#x2019;s confused bureaucracy descends upon them. These actions, Sir, are not evidence of &#x201C;opknapping &#x201D;. All they prove is that the confusion and the uncertainty in Government circles are growing and that the Government has no answer even to the lesser problems of race relations in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has, of course, been on a trip overseas since the election. As far as I am concerned, I want to say without hesitation that I am delighted that the hon. gentleman made that trip. Isolation is synonymous with stagnation and can, as the pointers already indicate, lead to disaster. Any contact is better than no contact at all, and this at least was a new beginning for the Nationalists and contains the germs of improved prospects for South Africa. But more than that I cannot say. To eulogize the trip as some of the Nationalist papers have done, is I think really going a bit far. An initially well concealed and progressively more mysterious trip through four countries at a spanking pace, left little opportunity for more than the exchange of courtesies between the hon. the Prime Minister and some heads of State while contacts with the people of these countries seemed to have been slight.</p>

<p>I believe that if the hon. the Prime Minister is to present himself as the protagonist of an outward looking policy, far more remains to be done than this. For one thing, there is a large backlog of a great deal of harm which has to be compensated for. The effect on America of the Arthur Ashe ban and the effect on the world of banning the Japanese jockey are only two examples. While, as I have said, I greatly appreciate the fact that the hon. the Prime Minister did go on that trip, I do not believe that he has returned fully briefed with the answer to many major international problems, like South Africa&#x2019;s future relationship with the European Economic Community, our relations with the rest of Africa or our future defence arrangements, to mention but a few.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that neither I nor my party will be particularly impressed with any spine chilling reports on depression abroad and failing economies, because I believe that whatever indications there may be of a fall off in growth in South Africa are up to now due to indigenous factors which we will allow to be sidetracked at our peril.</p>

<p>But I am sure that there is one thing the hon. gentleman did find out overseas, and that is that foreigners are surprisingly well informed about South Africa, so that any support that he seeks in future for his policy of apartheid must be based on its moral justification and deeds rather than on bluff as in the past. He cannot be optimistic about &#x201C;greater tolerance &#x201D; towards South Africa and its policy in any other terms. Nor, and I want to say this at once, would any South African submit to tailoring our way of life to suit the whim of international opinion, with or without demos. But the time has passed for seeking <span class="col_27-28" refersTo="page_0028"/>refuge in the cry, &#x201C;No one understands us &#x201D;. Informed opinion overseas understands us pretty well, and there is even sympathy for our problems, but there are some things in our political life that will not pass the test of simple morality and humanity. The hon. the Prime Minister would do well to take some advice from an unusual quarter. Professor H. B. Thom, past chairman of the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurverenigings, said in his last address to members: &#x201C;&#x2026;Die w&#x00EA;reld staan nie stil nie &#x2026; Die w&#x00EA;reld behoort aan hom wat hom van die toekoms meester wil maak &#x2026; en dit sal nie help om in sak en as te sit en treur oor die feit dat jong Afrikaners vandag nie meer hulle kulturele besieling uit gebeure soos die Tweede Vryheidsoorlog en konsentrasiekampe put nie &#x201D;. This means that the Prime Minister will have to actively join the growing number of people who see a great adventure and a greater future for our country in generously opening our hearts as well as our eyes to the advantages of closer contact with people of other countries and in adopting more modern attitudes at home as well. But the problem is whether the hon. the Prime Minister can do it, and is it his intention to try?</p>

<p>We have serious doubts as to that on this side of the House. The advent of the Herstigte Nasionale Party showed South Africa what has been going on in the ranks of the Nationalist Party for many years. It revealed to us a policy of racialists and bigots, and it revealed a policy that clamped down on immigration after the war. It revealed a policy that condemned racial minorities and capitalists as enemies of South Africa. It showed us a policy that seriously considered making English a second language and English-speaking citizens second-class citizens. We saw a policy that inculcated such great hostility towards the Black man that a denial of even the simple courtesies of life to them was regarded as normal behaviour.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>These are the attitudes which have been influencing the Government of this country and which have been steering the thinking of many of our people into narrow channels over the years. I am sure the hon. the Prime Minister is sincere in his attempt to rid his party of an extreme element, those on the far right, but he was not able to defeat them with clean, sharp blows in the election, because there was too much in the policy propounded by Dr. Albert Hertzog and the H.N.P. which the honest Nationalist knows underlies the philosophy of his own party. This philosophy will not only remain a strong psychological influence; it will also remain a problem in the practical politics of the Government. You cannot just throw overboard the consequences of 20 years of deliberate indoctrination and propaganda. Many supporters of the members opposite have been carefully conditioned over the years and they now demand that their leader should deliver the goods in accordance with the prospectus as it was originally drawn up.</p>

<p>The tragedy is that the hon. the Prime Minister, facing this dilemma, has serious problems that require urgent solution. I think the two most important of those are the slowing down in the economic rate of growth of South Africa and, secondly, the failure of separate development, and the insuperable difficulties he will face if he tries to continue implementing that policy.</p>

<p>Let us deal with these in turn. I believe that the volume of evidence in regard to the slowing down of the economy is so great, particularly in the field of direct investment, that while no emphasis is needed from me to establish this as a fact, I will forecast that it will be the subject of careful analytical debate from this side of the House over the next few weeks. Suffice it then to accept an economic slow-down as a fact, a slow-down which, strangely enough, is not attributed by the hon. the Minister of Finance to the success of his credit control measures, because when he spoke at a banquet of the Finance Houses Association in June, 1970, he pointed out that the total gross domestic product had increased by over 7 per cent in 1969 while fixed capital outlays by private manufacturing industry had declined by 10 per cent, but this according to him could not be attributed to credit control because total bank credit to the private sector had increased in 1969 and the first quarter of 1970. So it is not for lack of funds that capital investment slowed down in the view of the Minister of Finance. Next on my list is Dr. Kuschke, and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is probably no single factor which can be taken as the most substantial reason, but in sum it appears to amount to uncertainty which causes entrepreneurs and investors alike to hesitate. We clearly have to break this psychological log jam.</block>

<p>Uncertainty, Sir, about what? I do not believe there is any doubt in anybody&#x2019;s mind that if South Africa had the workers and sufficient workers had enough money to spend and to pay taxes for essential services, South Africa with her rich natural resources, which include a large and growing population, could outstrip the rate of growth of any country in the world. So what is causing the uncertainty to which Dr. Kuschke and so many other people refer? <span class="col_29-30" refersTo="page_0029"/>Is it not being able to understand or believe the Minister of Finance when he speaks after his strange behaviour in this House and in the Other Place in June, 1969? Is it not knowing what employee in what category of work is going to be axed next? Is it, Sir, not knowing if any industrialist will ever get all the labour he needs and in the place he needs them to produce competitively and efficiently? The body of evidence from economists and businessmen is that the scarcity of labour and the uncertainty in regard to the possible availability of labour are the prime uncertainties. There is not a single sector of the economy, whether worker or employer, or any shade of political opinion, that does not admit either readily or reluctantly, that a shortage of labour is hampering development. The solutions offered differ according to the shade of political opinion, but only those that include an appraisal of the role that the use of non-White labour must inevitably play seem to have any contact with reality.</p>

<p>What has the Government done? The Government so far have settled for a compromise with reality in a series of exemptions from its own laws. Industrialists, on whom much of the success of the Government&#x2019;s separate development policy depends but whose co-operation in regard to its own laws was never sought, have developed a sort of shake-down <i>modus vivendi</i> on the basis of evasions of Government policy and legislation. Now, exemptions and evasions can never take the place of a constructive policy for growth, a policy that in present circumstances must run counter to practically every law governing the use of non-White labour in this country.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite are well acquainted with the policy of my party. They know that we fully acknowledge the right of the White man to protection against unfair competition and a lowering in any way of his standard of living. They had it given them during the election. In fact, some of them were so anxious that they came to buy copies of the answer from us. They know it very well and we will deal with it again. But with a new approach the growth of this country could be so vast that the cost of protecting White standards and White values could be relatively small compared with the possible returns. But the question we have to ask is this: Is the vision necessary to create this greater South Africa possible within the confines of narrow Government ideology? It is not 100 years ago but only a few months since we heard that statement from the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. A dramatic change of heart is neither to be expected, nor will it be trusted if it took place. The Prime Minister and the Government, I submit, are not the administration to bring about the essential adjustment to changing circumstances and he, I believe, is too chary of criticism from within his own ranks to try. Sir, he will have to make up his mind one way or another and sooner or later. The relaxation of control by the Minister of Labour over a few jobs for Coloureds is a welcome move in the right direction but the real dialogue, Sir, is between Bantu and White in this country. The great mass of the workers, the great mass of the job-seekers, are Bantu. The fate of South Africa depends on decisions in this forum and not on whether or not a Coloured girl takes cash at the till of a suburban bazaar.</p>

<p>Given the policy of apartheid and, flowing from it, the restrictions on the use of non-white labour both in numbers and in types of work, I suppose a 5&#x00BD; per cent real growth rate is probably the maximum at which the economy can grow in the future. The restrictions of the Physical Planning Act, however, are now threatening to reduce that rate of growth over the next five years to something possibly under 5&#x00BD; per cent. I would like hon. members to pause for a moment and to examine with me what has been happening over the past few years. If one had to listen to Government politicians only, Sir, one would believe that only Japan developed faster than South Africa. The truth, however, is that the Common Market as a whole has in the past decade developed just as fast as South Africa and the United States only slightly less fast. Japan has developed twice as fast. Of the great Western industrial powers only the United Kingdom has developed at a substantially lower rate. But there is this crucial difference between the United Kingdom and the Common Market countries and South Africa: Their populations are increasing at a much slower rate than even the White population in South Africa. The United Kingdom population is only increasing at one-third of the rate at which South Africa&#x2019;s White population is increasing and the Common Market countries at between one-third and one-half of the South African rate of 2.15 per cent per annum. Thus, Sir, if the growth rate of the Common Market keeps up with that of South Africa their standards of living will rise faster than ours in the next decade and the decades that lie ahead. This has already happened in the past decade, and if it were to continue for the next decade, we are going to draw fewer and fewer immigrants from Europe, because to draw immigrants on a substantial scale we must develop faster and have a higher growth rate in respect of standards of living than countries like Holland and Germany.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am more than delighted; I seem to have awakened the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s interest. I will tell him what we are going to do; let him just listen to the problem which neither he nor his Cabinet <span class="col_31-32" refersTo="page_0030"/>seem to understand yet. I believe it has become imperative for South Africa&#x2019;s economy to grow much faster than the rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent envisaged for the 1970s, if we are to face the challenges to our sovereignty which look like developing in the years that lie ahead of us. For in the end, Sir, all sovereignty depends on economic power and military power, which to-day is based on economic power. The greater a country&#x2019;s economic and military power, the greater its sovereignty in the world. If we only maintain a rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent we will remain a relatively small power internationally. Do you realize, Sir, that Japan&#x2019;s rapid rise since 1945 as a world power courted by all the nations of the world, is directly due to its rapid economic development&#x2014;nearly twice as fast as that of all the other industrial powers? Their rate of growth has made them the third greatest industrial country in the world, next to Russia and the United States of America. If they go on developing at the present rate over the next decade or two they will catch up with those vast colossi. Sir, what differential rates of growth can do, can easily be illustrated if you look at a few of the forecasts made by the economists. If we had the rate of growth of Japan, we would in 1980 reach the wealth which we will now not reach until 1990, and if we had the same rate of growth as Japan for the next decade or two, then by the year 1990 the gross domestic product would be a massive R86,000 million which would place us amongst the ten top industrial countries in the world. I think our national security demands that South Africa should opt for maximum economic development or something close to it. Our national existence cannot be guaranteed by discriminating or discriminatory laws but only by economic and military strength. Refusing the entry of a Japanese jockey or a Coloured cricketer will not protect us from outside influence but economic and military strength will protect us and will protect our sovereignty. Sir, apartheid, by deliberately slowing down our economic development, is becoming a serious threat to the safety of South Africa. But for the Government&#x2019;s race policy and lack of educational policy, the South African economy could out-perform every other industrial country in the world, with the possible exception of Japan. Compared with Japan, the most successful society to have developed over the past few decades, we have immeasurably greater natural resources; we have a vast reservoir of millions of potential industrial workers amongst our under-employed non-Whites. Japan&#x2019;s only advantages over us are an immeasurably superior educational system and a competent Government following wise economic policies. Sir, to achieve a far higher rate of growth than that envisaged by the Government, revolutionary changes will have to be made in education and in the training of labour. As a country we only spend at the moment half as much of our national income on research and education as most of the highly industrialized societies in the world. I believe, Sir, that the educational policies of this Government have been a crime against South Africa. In addition to normal education, we must greatly intensify the training of labour in industry. With proper labour training, the bulk of our non-White labour can be turned into productive workers in industry in a short period of time. I know, of course, Sir, that there are going to be the Jeremiahs who will proclaim that a rate of growth approximating that of Japan could not be sustained because our domestic savings and capital formation can only support a growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent. I know they will say that a growth rate of this order will lead to serious balance of payments problems; and lastly there are those who fear that many jobs presently performed by Whites will have to be taken over by non-Whites. I want to say at once that it is my belief that if we speed up our economic development, it will of necessity lead to a vast inflow of capital, comparable to that of Australia in the last decade, where their vast ore mines have been rapidly exploited. No country that develops fast ever lacks capital from outside.</p>

<p>As far as balance of payments are concerned, it is surely significant that the countries which really develop rapidly, countries like Japan and West Germany, have the best balance of payments position, because a rapidly developing country expands its exports rapidly. It is when they do not grow fast that they run into balance of payments problems. If our economic development is accelerated I believe that we will draw far more immigrants. A dynamic economy, with rapidly increasing standards of living, is the best country to which to emigrate. Immigrants want economic opportunities, and the faster an economy grows the greater the flow of immigrants. I believe that we could aim for double the number of immigrants we are drawing at the present time.</p>

<p>Of course, if we speed up our economic growth a number of the lower paid jobs now reserved for Whites will have to be done by non-Whites. It is happening now, Sir. It is happening on the Railways. The Minister of Transport knows all about it. But the great bulk of Whites replaced will move to higher-paid jobs for which they should be prepared by proper industrial labour training schemes. In a wealthy economy a White who is replaced by a non-White and for personal reasons like age or health cannot be employed in a better paid job category, could be protected by adequate measures, and would be if a United Party government was in power. A greatly accelerated growth rate will not only make South Africa a more powerful and more independent country, but it will also make it a happier, fairer and more stable society. I do not believe that the well-off Whites can ever feel safe and secure as long as they realize that there are tens of thousands of Whites, the old and the incapacitated, living poor and miserable <span class="col_33-34" refersTo="page_0031"/>lives, and hundreds of thousands of non-whites in the same conditions. Accelerated economic development could wipe out grinding poverty in a decade or two, as it has been doing in Japan over the last decade. As we get wealthier there will be far more job opportunities at good salaries and good wages. These opportunities will be created for all. As we grow richer we can greatly increase our old age and our other pensions for those who cannot do a normal job of work any more.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I believe that South Africa should awake to the danger of the Government&#x2019;s racial policies. Their motto of &#x201C;poor but White &#x201D; is fallacious, for their policies are isolating White South Africans from all other countries in the world, including all the great European and Anglo-Saxon powers, and at the same time draining us of the economic and military power necessary to protect ourselves against eventual outside interference. That is the first challenge with which the hon. the Prime Minister is faced, but there is a second one.</p>

<p>The other major challenge he faces is the failure of his policy of separate development, and the problems that must arise if the Government persists in attempts to implement it. We must remember that it is in the name of apartheid, or separate development, that many negative and oppressive things are done. It is in the name of that policy that the Physical Planning Act, the amended Bantu Laws Act, and similar restrictive legislation appear on the Statute Book. But when we come to the positive side, in realizing constructively the fact of separate homelands for the black people, we ask what has been done. I am fully cognizant of the need for the co-operation and self-exertion of all underdeveloped peoples in any scheme for their own development, but a statement was made by Chief Buthelezi at a ceremony conferring territorial status on the Zulu territorial authority which seemed to me to have a ring of truth about it. The Government would do well to bear this statement in mind. He said: &#x201C;When man is reaching for the moon the Zulus cannot be expected to move towards self-determination at ox wagon pace. &#x201D; Sir, let us look at the needs of the Bantu people. Let us ask ourselves honestly whether they are being satisfied to such an extent that we can see them developing into separate nations in separate states, as the theory of Government policy would demand. It is interesting to note that almost wherever a territorial tribal authority is established, its first demand is for more land. The demand came stridently from Chief Kaiser Matanzima of the Transkei, and now we have heard it again from the Zulu authority. Three-quarters of the population of South Africa or more&#x2014; black people&#x2014;are going to be expected to inhabit one-seventh of the land of South Africa. For a people which is dependent for its living on subsistence agriculture this is clearly a very difficult situation. I think the Prime Minister should tell us: Are his Government and the people of South Africa prepared to give more land? If they are not, what are they going to do to make these Bantu areas viable territories, capable of supporting the people whose bases they must be in South Africa. To make these areas viable they do not need only land; they need industrial growth points inside their territories. What has the Government to show for the 16 years that are past since the Tomlinson Report was published? The main answer we have had from them so far has been that the Government has built 70 Bantu townships in the homelands, comprising 153,000 stands. But these townships are not in themselves viable. They are merely further expressions of the poverty and the inadequacies of the homelands. They are often nothing more nor less than inverted pyramids with a thin and inadequate base for secondary and tertiary employment, too thin and inadequate to give the residents there a reasonable source of income.</p>

<p>Then we have the border industries. As we have so often said, these are merely examples of accelerated economic integration between Blacks and Whites, integration that is encouraged in the new white areas with a measure of social separation because the labour lives in existing Bantu areas. If we want the prosperity in South Africa that will make the policy of separate development possible, or that will make any solution to our race problems feasible, we need the prosperity that will come only from greatly increased educational opportunities for all our people.</p>

<p>But what is the position with Bantu education in South Africa, Sir? Bantu education in South Africa is an &#x201C;operation boot strap &#x201D;, with the Government&#x2019;s contribution towards it theoretically pegged at R13 million since 1948 &#x2014;and this in spite of the fall in the value of money and the increase in population. The Government insists on self-help by Africans in the educational field. I wonder whether the Government likes the manner in which the Bantu are responding. The new Association for the Educational and Cultural Advancement of the Africa people in South Africa are thinking of appealing to the United States for support. Will the Government approve of this? Is this what they want? All experts are agreed that for any reasonable race policy to succeed, and indeed to avoid unrest and disorder, <span class="col_35-36" refersTo="page_0032"/>there should be rising standards of living for all. There should be jobs for all and people should be able to take these jobs. But what is the position in the reserves? It is one of intolerable poverty and it is getting worse. In May of this year the <i>Johannesburg Star</i> reported that white farmers and recruiters of labour visiting labour depots in Sekhukhuneland are besieged by thousands of hungry young men and women begging for jobs. Only a few get the jobs. Thousands are turned away. They return again and again to the depots hoping against hope that somebody will take them but in vain. The chiefs say that unemployment is crippling Sekhukhuneland.</p>

<p>No, this is an old story which is never proved. I have never known anybody to correct wrong reports in the Press quicker than this Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. I want to know what reason there is for saying that this is not true. I believe that there are thousands of men in those reserves who are not allowed to go to work in the cities because of Government policy. They are stranded in impoverished reserves. A policy which has side effects of that kind cannot be succeeding. It cannot offer any hope either to Whites or to Blacks that we are approaching a solution to their problems and ours. I believe that we South Africans have got to sit up and take notice as we do not have indefinite time. This is something I wish to emphasize. I wish more of us could read the comment of Mr. J. D. F. Jones, foreign editor of the <i>British Financial Times,</i> who recently wrote about what he saw in South Africa. He found that South Africa had entered a critical period during which separate development has little time to prove its point and during which the Government cannot continue to evade the dilemmas which face it. The Bantustan policy, he said, could not continue in its present diffidence without clearly emerging as a failure or a fraud. He challenged the hon. the Prime Minister to demand the necessary sacrifices from his white electors to make a success of this policy as, he said, this was a thousand times more important than any travels round European capitals. The Prime Minister should tell us. Will he call upon the people of South Africa to make the sacrifices necessary to remove these well-founded charges of diffidence and failure? Time and again in the past in this House we have had figures concerning what it is likely to cost to make these reserves viable. The hon. the Prime Minister should know that no impartial observer can find evidence that the Government is willing to face the realities of its own policy. I believe that the Government and the Prime Minister prefer to present themselves to gullible sections of the public as capable of indulging in unreasonable race prejudice but at the same time as capable of ensuring our economic and strategic security. Daily the facts of life prove these things to be incompatible. I am afraid that the Government is being faced with an inescapable truth. If the hon. the Prime Minister is sincere when he talks about &#x201C;opknappingswerk &#x201D; I believe he has much to do in respect of this policy.</p>

<p>I want to make a few suggestions to him which, I believe, most intelligent people believe should be followed diligently if his two major problems are to be dealt with. First and foremost I believe the Government should take steps to revitalize the economy. According to all the authorities this can only be done by removing the uncertainties, many of them created by the Government, about the availability of adequate supplies of labour and the availability of funds for investment. It will also require positive planning for growth. This will touch on fields such as future policy on the decentralization of industry; the adequate training of all labour, White and non-White; the provision of an adequate infra-structure, including especially water supplies; and, finally, adequate steps to promote our external trade. Here let me say that because of past stupidities on the part of the Government, it will be as important to restore our good image by avoiding embarrassing incidents of the kind we had from his Cabinet before which are often not the result of accidental slips but which flow naturally from deeply ingrained attitudes among the people who sit in this Government. While the Government remains enmeshed in such ideologies, I fear it will not be long before the outward looking handshakes with Dr. Banda are cancelled out by some embarrassing incidents in other quarters, such as what is happening at the moment with our Chinese community.</p>

<p>Related to the problem I have just stated is the need for an outward-going approach to our race relations at home in order to develop the quality of our peoples and to increase harmony amongst them. It is shortsighted to imagine harmony where there is none. Those of us who have contact with the non-white people know how frustrated they are under the yoke of restrictive laws which exist for themselves and are not balanced by freedom elsewhere or the opportunity to develop in other ways. We all know that South Africa is rich, that we have vast resources. Our potential for economic growth is tremendous and so is our opportunity to give improved quality to the life of peoples who are as yet largely undeveloped. If we really want to look outward, we dare not forget that vast though our material resources may be, our greatest asset is our people. And it is not only numbers that count. More and more we recognize that it is the quality of people that counts, their potential to use initiative, to work hard and to persevere in attaining aims that matter. These are the things that count more. <span class="col_37-38" refersTo="page_0033"/>We recognize this because we see the achievements of a small nation such as Israel. We recognize this because we see the achievements of the people of Taiwan compared with those of the people of the Chinese mainland who are dominated by the vast colossus of Communist China.</p>

<p>South Africa is governed to-day by what political scientists call an elite. This has been the result of an historical process with which we are all familiar. Whether that &#x00E9;lite will stay in power depends very much on what use it makes of its privileged position. This in turn will depend on the ideologies which motivate the elite and on whether those ideologies are based on justice, on morality and on reality. Those who govern must deserve the consent of the governed. It is interesting to find that in the United States of America to-day one constantly hears the complaint that the citizens, and particularly the younger generation, are losing all respect for authority of every kind, the law courts and the government, and that their loyalty to the state is also diminishing rapidly. This also goes for many countries in Europe. The problem in these countries is how to re-establish respect for authority and loyalty to the institutions of the state.</p>

<p>Yet here we have a Government whose policy it is deliberately to destroy respect for authority and loyalty towards the state amongst at least two important racial groups, the Coloureds and the Indians. They are informed that they are not part of white South Africa. But unlike the Africans who are at least promised ultimate fatherlands or motherlands, they are given no entity towards which they should direct their loyalty. Surely any political system in the modern world that instead of making attempts to inculcate respect for authority and loyalty towards the state, sets out to destroy loyalty in the hearts of its subjects, is doomed. I believe that the loyalty of our non-Whites can only be assured in the long run if they are involved in our political processes in whatever practical manner possible. They must feel that they belong to South Africa and that they can fully share in its fruits, economic and otherwise, of a dynamic and fair society.</p>

<p>I believe that South Africa must become a far more compassionate society. We must be concerned much more about the misery and the poverty of the incapacitated and the old people, not only of the Whites but of all races. Our welfare measures have not kept pace with the increase in our wealth. One can say that almost every welfare measure we have still dates from the actions of the United Party government. As we get richer so we should constantly extend welfare. The faster we develop the quicker we could do it. If we grow to our full capacity we can probably wipe out degrading poverty within one generation.</p>

<p>I believe that the United Party has an infinitely better chance of making more of South Africa than this Government has succeeded in doing. I believe this because our whole philosophy of government is different. We, unlike this Government, believe in maintaining the quality of leadership and improving the quality of those who have not yet had the opportunity to develop as they should. We do not believe in isolation and exclusiveness. We reach out to include all those elements that can make for a better life. Rigidity and isolation are the antithesis of growth and greater happiness for a greater number of people. I believe that we are also informed realists. We strive to understand and give due weight to those innate human factors that both impede social change and make adjustment to change possible. We do not believe that one can legislate to change human nature but we do have a great deal of faith in humanity and the processes, slow as they might be, that will lead to greater harmony among people and their greater happiness.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It means that our policy reflects our philosophy. As realists, we accept that the race groups are at divergent stages of development and that we must confess to a measure of ingrained prejudice which is not a monopoly of South Africa or the Nationalist Government. On the other side of the coin, it means that we accept that integration in the economic sphere at least, is a fact and that further economic integration must take place if we are to survive and grow as an economic power. We believe that further economic integration can take place since the potential for race friction is less apparent than real in many situations as the hon. the Minister of Transport is showing on the South African Railways at the present time. It also means that we as realists observe the importance of group differentiation and the wisdom of supporting racial separation in regard to residential areas, etc., and avoiding at all costs any suggestion of the psychological effects of forced integration.</p>

<p>It means something else as well. It means that we as realists also accept the desirability of the non-Whites in time sharing the responsibility on a federal basis with the white elite. As we see it, the natural process will be towards building up an elite among the non-Whites. However, with their masses of underdeveloped people homogenity of quality will be impossible for them for generations. But we do foresee a growing contact and a sharing of decision making amongst the &#x00E9;lite of all groups on a federal basis with the necessary guarantees for the maintenance of white leadership. We believe it is important too that this non-white &#x00E9;lite should be the true representatives of their people. We must therefore make sure&#x2014;and I believe our democratic federal process does provide adequately for this&#x2014;that Bantu leaders with whom we work will in fact be the recognized and accepted representatives of their people. Any government <span class="col_39-40" refersTo="page_0034"/>that negotiates or consults with stooges is building on sand.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is in directions such as these that we believe that the hon. the Prime Minister should direct his outward look.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has found it necessary to introduce a motion of censure. He has given his motivations for such a motion here to-day. I leave it to the House, not only this but also that side, the old members and the new, to judge whether the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has come to light with anything new. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made use as seldom before &#x2014;and that is saying a great deal&#x2014;of vague statements and generalities. There was not a spark of originality in what he said. The matters he mentioned have been mulled over repeatedly in this House over the years. Another matter he mentioned was the recent election, in which all manner of topics were exhaustively dealt with. With this the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tried to set the Thames on fire to-day. Unfortunately the hon. the Leader of the Opposition allowed himself to be dictated to in places&#x2014;and I shall deal with this in the course of my speech&#x2014;by certain journalists regarding what he should in fact say here to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us begin with what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said. At the very outset I want to concede that I personally did feel disappointed at the seats my Party lost. Both he and I know that. It is true that the National Party won fewer seats than it did in 1966. But what is also true is the fact that those seats were not lost because the policy of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had found acceptance among the voters. On the contrary. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition came to light with figures and calculations. I can furnish him with a reply by also making calculations in that regard. In this way I can very easily prove my statement. What do the figures tell us? The figures tell us that in 1966 the National Party polled 58.3 per cent of the votes cast. Over against that the United Party polled 37.5 per cent of the votes cast in that election. The result of the 1970 election, as far as the United Party is concerned, was precisely the same as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s speech: it was also 37.5 per cent. Precisely the same. It is true that the percentage of votes in favour of the National Party decreased from 58.3 to 54.8.</p>

<p>No, it does mean something. I have taken cognizance of that and I also want to furnish the explanation for it. I want to furnish the hon. member for Yeoville in particular with the explanation. He will understand it, because his majority in his own constituency also decreased. As I said, the percentage of votes in favour of the National Party decreased from 58.3 per cent to 54.8 per cent. However, the explanation for that is very clear. While the United Party&#x2019;s total number of votes remained static, and that of the National Party decreased, the Hertzog Party polled 3.6 per cent of the total number of votes. That explains the decrease in the total vote in favour of the National Party. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition waxed so eloquent here about his policy, but what progress has he in fact made? Did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition make any progress at all if one bears in mind that his percentage of the votes remained the same?</p>

<p>What percentage of votes?</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The percentage of the votes cast. After all, one does not win with votes other than those which have been cast. That is the most important thing. But what is of importance to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not only that the percentage of votes in favour of his party remained the same, but also the progress made by the hon. member for Houghton. The progress made by the hon. member for Houghton and the votes which she drew, votes which one would normally have expected the United Party to draw, are of great importance to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. And one need only refer to what happened in Houghton itself. I must admit that I too made a mistake as far as the United Party was concerned, and not only as far as my own results were concerned. This was the second election in which I expected them to get rid of the hon. member for Houghton. However, I am no longer going to rely on the United Party as far as that is concerned. It would be useless. It is not only a question of the progress made by the hon. member for Houghton. Just ask the hon. member for Sea Point what he thinks. [Interjections.] There is something he could tell this House in that connection.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into that matter any further now. I just want to say that any impression which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition may have created, i.e. that there was a swing away from the National Party to the United Party, has, on the basis of the figures, no substance whatsoever. The National Party&#x2014;and I am saying this merely for the sake of the record&#x2014;fought this election under the most unfavourable circumstances. In the first instance, it fought the election knowing full well that it had been in power for all of 23 years. It is obvious that when a party has been in power for so long, grievances and frustrations will arise which will affect it. This is not a phenomenon which is restricted only to South Africa. It occurs throughout the world. I am aware of this and we all know <span class="col_41-42" refersTo="page_0035"/>that this is the case. One also realizes that the election was fought whilst climatic conditions were prevailing which were without precedent in the history of South Africa. These were conditions which had to have psychological and other effects as well. I am allowing for that. In addition, all of us know, and this was in fact proved in the election, that we were faced with a rebellion in our own ranks. This also took its toll in the election. These were the objective facts with which we were faced.</p>

<p>But in this election we also had to deal with methods&#x2014;and these I want to lay at the door of the hon. the Leader and his people&#x2014;which too were without precedent in our country. These were methods which cannot be defended. These methods employed by the Opposition were such that their own newspapers had to call them to order. I can mention numerous examples of this to you. A few will suffice. It was necessary for, <i>inter alia, The Friend,</i> a newspaper which supported the United Party throughout the election, to issue a very stern warning to the United Party in a leading article on 10th March and to mention a certain Senator, Redi Louw, by name because of the irresponsible things he had had to say during the election. It was necessary for them to mention a certain Mr. G. van Schalkwyk, the United Party candidate in Kimberley (North), by name as a result of the type of propaganda he was making. That was not all. Apart from what appeared in the <i>Cape Times</i> and other newspapers, it was necessary for the <i>Daily News</i> to call a certain Mr. Myburgh to order in a leading article on 12th March. This was the kind of propaganda hon. members of the Opposition were guilty of. These were not ordinary agents or canvassers which one could perhaps excuse. These were leading members of the United Party who were guilty of this kind of thing. Apart from the insinuations in respect of the integrity of individuals, it was character assassination that was in many respects committed.</p>

<p>In this debate the hon. the Leader of the Opposition found it necessary to call in Dr. Hertzog as well. I would like to say a word about that as well in passing. Because it was deemed to be in the interests of South Africa and of future relations in this country, members on this side of the House did not hesitate for one moment to state, unequivocally, their standpoint in opposition to those policies mentioned by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. This was done from one platform to another. But what did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition do? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition took the persons who proclaimed those policies under his protection throughout. He did not have the courage of his convictions to adopt a standpoint. He was afraid that he would by so doing forfeit the support of those people. This is a fact, and there are numerous hon. members sitting on my side of the House who can testify to how the United Party and those people worked hand in hand in the election &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

These are only three out of many other examples. There was open cooperation between the United Party and these people. Everybody outside knows this. Numerous examples of this can be mentioned. For me and for us on this side of the House it was no pleasant task to repudiate former colleagues and to take a stand against them as we did. We had the courage to do so, because it was in the interests of South Africa and future race relations.</p>

<p>One need not hide behind that now. We are dealing with serious arguments now. If time allows I shall point out other examples as well. Therefore it does not befit the hon. member to make unmotivated statements here. Let me, before I forget, deal with the one statement he made in respect of my European tour. I found it terribly amusing to hear from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that, although I held talks with leaders, &#x201C;I did not make contact with the people &#x201D;. That is what the hon. member said and that is how it is recorded in Hansard. I wrote it down here. But, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member read it in that little Nussey fellow&#x2019;s report in the <i>Star.</i> That is where the hon. member read it; it is stated word for word like that in the report of this young man from the <i>Star,</i> who did his best to detract from the significance of this tour. In any case, what utter nonsense is this the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke here? Just imagine, you are in Portugal, in Spain, in France, and in none of these countries can you speak or understand the language of the people; must you jump around on the motor cars in public like Bobby Kennedy so that the people can see you? What nonsense and what rubbish! Or should I have told these people that I would hold a barbecue for them in some square or other and that they should come along? Surely that is utter nonsense. Surely one goes to those countries to have talks with the leaders of the people.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I shall come to that. I am obliged to report to Parliament in that regard. One goes there to have talks with the leaders of these nations. One goes there to give newspaper interviews and I did that in every country. One goes there and appears on their television if they so desire, and I did that in every country. One goes there to address press conferences and in these ways one makes contact with the people and the nation. How else must you make contact with them? Surely it is the most foolish thing <span class="col_43-44" refersTo="page_0036"/>possible to put forward arguments of this kind.</p>

<p>But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is once again presenting the old argument which we have been hearing in this House for years, i.e. the argument of the isolation to which we are subjected. Let us reply to this now for the umpteenth time. Let us consider this argument in the light of contact with other states in the world. When we on this side of the House took over the government, that side of the House had only found it necessary to have contact, in the interests of South Africa, with 19 states in the world. They had diplomatic representation in one form or another&#x2014;and there are many forms of diplomatic contact and representation&#x2014;with 19 states.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>How many states were there at that time?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There were many more than that mere 19. To mention only one example to the hon. member, there were all the South American states. The hon. member would do better to concern himself with his court case than with these matters. In spite of the so-called unpopularity of this Government, in spite of the hostility towards South Africa which exists in the world, which we are fully aware of, this Government has over the years succeeded in establishing diplomatic representation in one form or another with no fewer than 65 world states. I may as well inform hon. members that it will not remain at that number. Diplomatic representation with other states will be established as surely as night follows day (<i>padda in die water spring</i>)<i>,</i> as the hon. member for East London (City) put it at the prorogation of the previous session, when he said that they would win the election, but then they unfortunately put the lid on it. That further diplomatic representation will come. Is this a sign of isolation? In the field of science there is a greater exchange of knowledge and more association and contact between our scientists and scientists throughout the world than ever before. In the economic field there is more contact and more trade relations between our businessmen and other businessmen in the world than ever before. It is true that there is a setback in the field of sport to-day and tomorrow, again a victory on another front. This is true, but must one now, as a result, make the general statement here that South Africa is isolated and that this Government is to blame for it?</p>

<p>I come now to an argument presented without rhyme or reason by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He does not even attempt to substantiate his charges. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition simply goes on record as having said that in respect of education and training we have not done our duty and that there has been complete neglect. He said that we had not created the necessary facilities and had not made the necessary money available. Surely that is utter nonsense, something which one would expect from a back-bencher and not from the Leader of the Opposition. One expects from the leader of an opposition that he would at least take the figures and that he would base his arguments on them. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows that in 1947 a subsidy of R1.8 million for all our universities was made available by the United Party Government. In the short period of 23 years that amount increased under this Government to R46.3 million in 1970. Hon. members can work out for themselves with what a large percentage that amount increased. The population of South Africa did not increase in the same proportion. Nor did our national product increase in the same proportion. The amount increased because this Government gave the matter priority and realized that for the South Africa we have to build, we need properly trained people. That is why we made the necessary funds available to this extent. To indicate how strongly the Government felt about this matter, I should like to mention a few figures. This subsidy of R1.8 million in 1947 increased gradually because facilities first had to be created and it takes time to make up a backlog. In 1964 this subsidy amounted to R14 million, in 1968 R21 million, and two years later R47 million. In spite of this the hon. the Leader of the Opposition complained without rhyme or reason, that the Government had done nothing in this connection. If one wants to take the elementary trouble of placing South Africa in its true perspective in relation to the outside world, one has only to examine the number of students attending South African universities. After all, it is from these people that we get the industrial leaders and scientists of the future. That is what one must ensure if one wants to build up a country as we want to build up South Africa. Let the hon. the Leader of the Opposition have no illusions: we are going to build it up as surely as I am standing here. In 1948, when the Government of hon. members opposite was in power, there were 18,500 university students in South Africa. I want to repeat that our population has not been doubled or trebled since that time. In 1970 our universities drew approximately 70,000 students, who had to be accommodated. With what groundless nonsense is the hon. the Leader of the Opposition coming to light now in a motion of censure by asserting that we have not done our duty in this regard? But apart from that he can simply look at the borrowing powers granted to the universities over the years and in his time, which at this stage under this Government are already standing at R25 million. It is therefore obvious that, whether one views it from the point of view of borrowing powers, from the point of view of subsidies or from the point of view of students, South Africa is giving its youth the right education in order to take their place as leaders in the various spheres.</p>

<p>What applies to the universities applies to vocational training as well. The figures are <span class="col_45-46" refersTo="page_0037"/>there for anyone who wants an objective picture. Not only does this apply in respect of the Whites, it also applies in respect of the non-Whites, for the simple reason that our standpoint is and remains that we can use every trained and educated non-White in South Africa. We can use them with very beneficial results. But if one were to listen to these hon. members, particularly when they are discussing manpower, one would be convinced that they could fetch the rawest Bantu in the reserves and let him do the most advanced work in our industries. That is the kind of argument they want to turn this into.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader used another dangerous argument, which I cannot allow to go unanswered. He used the argument of the communists and the liberalists against us in this debate. When I say &#x201C;us &#x201D; I mean South Africa. [Interjections.] Yes, it is true. He used that argument against South Africa, i.e. the fact that the Whites have more land here in South Africa than the Bantu possess. Surely that is a dangerous argument to use. Not only does it fail to take into account the course of history and where each nation settled here in South Africa, but I would also like to put this question to the hon. the Leader: If he raises the question of the Whites having more land than the Bantu in a debate on a motion of censure, is it his intention to take more land away from the Whites and give it to the Bantu? If it is not his intention to do so, why does he use this argument in the House? We know what the standpoint of this side of the House is. Our standpoint over the years has been that the land which belongs to the Whites is the land which belongs to them lawfully and historically, and that the land which belongs to the Blacks belongs to them historically because they took possession of it for themselves and our forefathers maintained and protected them in their tenure of that land over the centuries. We shall continue to do so in future as well, as often as it may be necessary. We have said that we are going further. We shall honour the white man&#x2019;s word that he gave to the Bantu in 1936, i.e. that he would cede 7&#x00BC; million morgen of his land to the Bantu. We know that this is being done over the years. But the hon. member for Houghton will agree with me that it was in fact on the question of this land that the Progressive Party broke away in Bloemfontein.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is how it was reflected at the time in the newspapers. I have called in the one witness who was present there, i.e. the hon. member for Houghton. She said that that was the case. I have no reason for not accepting her word as an hon. member. Against that background the hon. member had the temerity, if I may put it like that, to use that as an argument in this motion of censure. With what purpose he alone will know. Sir, the hon. member&#x2019;s difficulty&#x2014;and he has a major difficulty in this regard&#x2014;is this: He did, it is true, gain additional seats in the last election. He did not gain them owing to the appeal of his policy. He gained them as a result, on the one hand, of the factors I mentioned here, and on the other as a result of the fact&#x2014;and I want to give them full credit for this to-day in this debate&#x2014;that the English-language press fought an election as no newspaper group ever did before. I want to grant them that. But it made the hon. member a captive of those newspapers, because it is axiomatic in politics that the man who makes you can break you as well, and whether hon. members want to laugh it away or not, the fact remains that they know in their hearts that that is the position, and that they will to an increasing extent be subjected to having the line of action which they will have to follow in future, dictated to them. And they will have to pay the price for that.</p>

<p>But to conclude this aspect of the matter, and just in order to complete the record, what grounds does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition have for a motion of censure if the figures at our disposal tell us that here you have a government which after so many years held an election under those unfavourable circumstances and still came back with a majority of 71 seats out of a House of 166? And in the second instance, what reason is there for making the kind of speech the hon. the Leader made if the figures tell you that the Government which was elected in South Africa, knowing South African political circumstances as we do, was elected with a majority of 262,000 votes? And to make it simpler to understand, more than a quarter of a million out of fewer than 1,500,000 votes cast? Then it becomes somewhat nonsensical to move a motion of censure in the terms in which the hon. member did so. Now I want to say this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and he knows it to be true, that never before was the policy of a government subjected to such a close scrutiny as it was at this election. This happened as a result of the fact that the Government did not have to fight on one front only, but had to fight on various fronts. <span class="col_47-48" refersTo="page_0038"/>It happened as a result of the fact that there was no consideration for anything or anybody in newspaper reports or propaganda. In other words, never before&#x2014;and the circumstances ensured this&#x2014;was such scrupulous attention given to every trivial thing that happened as in this election. Never before was a minor incident so blown up into an international crisis as during this election. And in spite of that, Sir, this Government gained that majority and, I want to repeat this categorically here to-day. this Government received an absolute mandate to proceed with its policy, and it will do so.

<p>In regard to the other points, I do not think it will serve any purpose, except in so far as I shall cover them, to deal now with the old election issues which are something of the past, or to say anything further about the old debating points which we have mulled over <i>ad nauseam</i> over the years in this House. I do not think it will serve any useful purpose to discuss them with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I just want to say a few words in regard to one matter to which he referred, and that is the question of relations. I had a great deal to say about this in the election. All of us discussed this matter, and it is good and right that we should discuss it, because it is of increasing importance to us here in South Africa, to whatever political party we may belong.</p>

<p>If one looks at the world outside, if one reads our newspapers or listens to the radio, one realizes only too well that virtually three-quarters of the problems of the world in one country after another are caused by disturbed relations, whether between religious groups, whether between employees and employers, whether between language groups or between colour groups. This is the case throughout the world, and for South Africa, which has all these problems&#x2014;some countries have only one of those problems; but we have virtually all one can think of&#x2014;it is of greater importance than for most other countries, and it is all the more important for South Africa because she finds herself in this threatened situation in which she stands to-day.</p>

<p>Yes, if there was one true word spoken during this election, it was spoken by our candidate in Wynberg when she said that the average U.P. supporter thinks Progressive, votes U.P. and thanks the Lord for the National Party Government. [Laughter.] For us this is of supreme importance, and I do not think it is a joking matter. No matter what party we belong to, it is very important to us. I said in the election, and I want to repeat now, that even if I had known in the past election that not a single English-speaking person would vote for my party and my policy, I would still have advocated the same policy in respect of Afrikaans-English relations. But I think it must be placed on record, and it is something to be grateful for, that this election, in which matters were subjected to such a close scrutiny, proved indisputably&#x2014;and there I must agree with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;that our people have made progress and that we have in fact become much more mature, because in contrast to what happened in former years&#x2014;and now I am not talking about the 1966 election; I am referring to the years prior to that&#x2014; there was more voting across the language boundary in this election; and as far as the National Party is concerned, it is very clear to me from an analysis of the election results that at least 140,000 English-speaking persons must have voted for the National Party. [Interjection.] If the hon. member for Yeoville is interested in this calculation, I can tell him how I arrived at it. I think there are only two facts which one has to establish in order to arrive at that calculation. The first fact which one must establish is what the present language ratio is for those who are entitled to vote. I am speaking in general now. It has been scientifically proved and established that the language ratio is in fact 58 per cent Afrikaans-speaking as against 42 per cent non-Afrikaans speaking people. This is a fact which anyone can establish. The second fact one must establish is how many Afrikaans-speaking people voted for the United Party. I would find it interesting if the hon. member for Yeoville would tell me what he has in mind as regards this percentage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It is approximately one-third of the Afrikaans-speaking people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I think the hon. member is exaggerating. It is certainly not 33 per cent. I asked real authorities in this field to work it out, and they work it out to be 17 per cent. Now the hon. member must realize that if it is 17 per cent one arrives at this interesting calculation. Where one&#x2019;s language ratio is 58 per cent to 42 per cent, the votes cast indicated that the National Party plus the Hertzog group received 58 per cent of the votes, or a little more than 58 per cent, and the United Party and the Progressive Party received a little less than 42 per cent. In other words, because one proceeds from the assumption that the number of English-speaking people who voted for the Hertzog Party is minimal &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; If one assumes that, it follows automatically that because the ratio is 58 per cent to 42 per cent, the National Party must have obtained the same percentage of English votes as the United Party obtained Afrikaans-speaking votes; otherwise the ratio would be incorrect and the calculation could not work out. And if it is 17 per cent, 17 per cent of 820,000 gives you approximately 140.000. but if it is one-third, it is far more than that. (Laughter.] I am <span class="col_49-50" refersTo="page_0039"/>simply mentioning this because I want to say how glad I am that we have become so mature. I am grateful, when I think of the future, that there is the prospect that this sound relationship between Afrikaans and English speaking people will be and will remain stable.</p>

<p>But having said that, I have to avail myself again to-day of my position in this House to make a very urgent appeal, as I did during the election, to all our people, my own people and the people who do not belong to my party, Afrikaans-speaking people as well as English-speaking people: Let us behave towards one another in such a manner and let us regard one another&#x2019;s cultural heritage with so much respect that we do not give one another offence. Sir, if we have regard to the problems which are lying in wait for us and on which I want to dwell for a moment, it is of cardinal importance&#x2014;though we may differ with one another in politics&#x2014;that we do not provoke one another as far as these matters are concerned, and it is of absolute, cardinal importance that there should be mutual respect for each other&#x2019;s languages. I do not with to apportion blame now. Far be it from me to apportion blame at this stage; this is a serious question in regard to which each of us can ask ourselves whether any blame attaches to us, and disregard for the language of any person, in commerce or in any other sphere, gives offence; there is not the slightest doubt about that.</p>

<p>I did not fling any reproaches at that hon. member. I do not know why he has to answer me like that, for this simple reason: I have often spoken to him and I have shown him the respect of addressing him in his language, but so far he has never addressed me in my language. But there is no need for us to reproach each other in respect of these matters. It is incumbent on all of us&#x2014;on the politician, on the businessman, on everybody&#x2014;to respect the other man&#x2019;s language, and I appeal to everybody to do so, irrespective of the party to which he belongs or the particular views he holds on the matter.</p>

<p>Sir, it also pleases me that it is possible for us to face the future, not only with the expectation that things will go well for us along this course, but also with the expectation that there will be good relations between the Whites and the Coloureds in future. Hon. members will notice that it was foreshadowed in the Opening Address that talks would take place in the future between the Government on the one hand and, on the other hand, the Executive of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council on the channel of communication which ought to exist between Parliament and that institution. The Coloureds are appreciative of the institution they have received; they appreciate the powers and the privileges they have been granted. They are progressively finding their feet, and I believe that in the course of time they will develop that institution. These talks will not be easy&#x2014;I readily admit that&#x2014;but they will have to take place, and what flows from them will to a very large extent determine our relations in the future. I do not have the slightest doubt that, with mutual dedication to the task imposed on us, we shall be able to create the necessary machinery in that regard to everybody&#x2019;s satisfaction.</p>

<p>On the Indian front the impression I have gained is that things are going well and, furthermore, that the machinery and facilities which have been created for that group of people are giving satisfaction.</p>

<p>As regards the Bantu, the hon. member for Transkei said in his speech in the no-confidence debate last session that it was imperative for the United Party to come into power, for if the United Party did not come into power &#x201C;then the point of no return will be reached &#x201D;. The hon. member is quite correct; the United Party did not come into power and the National Party is proceeding with its policy of Bantu homelands. The National Party is proceeding with its systematic preparation for the self-determination which will eventually fall to the share of those Bantu territories. I want to make this very clear to this House to-day, as I have in recent times often come across this problem. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is right to some extent, and others who are of the same opinion are right to some extent: It is not easy to sell South Africa&#x2019;s case to the outside world. I want to go further: One cannot sell the case of the National Party or the United Party or the Progressive Party to the outside world without making concessions. What the outside world wants from us, those hon. members are not prepared to concede, we are definitely not prepared to concede, and even the hon. member for Houghton is not prepared to concede, in spite of the camouflage she puts up in that regard. It is and remains a fact that it is not easy to sell South Africa&#x2019;s case. But, Sir, I have come to the firm conviction that the moment one makes the admission which the United Party has made from time to time and which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition once again made to-day by implication&#x2014;i.e. &#x201C;that we are a multi-racial country &#x201D;&#x2014;one does not have a leg to stand on and one has no possible chance of selling one&#x2019;s policy to them, because the moment one concedes&#x2014; and I have tried it out time and again, here and elsewhere&#x2014;that one is a multi-racial country and that one wants to remain a multiracial country for ever and, to tell the truth, that one will fight, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, to make South Africa a multi-racial country, that one will not allow people to break away or to follow their own course, that one will keep them together by force, if necessary, one receives this damning <span class="col_51-52" refersTo="page_0040"/>reply: &#x201C;If you want to do all those things; if you are even prepared to use force to achieve your object, and you admit that you are a multi-racial country, why do you not grant equal rights to every race in that country and, more specifically, why do you not grant equal political rights to all of them, irrespective of social differences and what may or may not be there? &#x201D;</p>

<p>Yes, there is an element of both, but when people in the outside world attack South Africa, they do so on the Bantu question, and one has to defend oneself against them on the Bantu question&#x2014; the hon. member knows this as well as I do&#x2014; and I can defend myself against them in respect of the Bantu by saying that, as far as the Bantu are concerned, we are not a multiracial country, but a multi-national country, each nation with its own language, its own traditions, its own land, no matter how small or how large it may be in extent, and that this is my ultimate policy, and in the years that lie ahead that policy will be developed further&#x2014;let there be no doubt about this&#x2014;until self-determination has been accomplished, and that to an increasing extent those people are being given opportunities for and the right to self-determination. I want to state this very emphatically here, Sir. We owe this to ourselves and to the outside world. Unlike the United Party, which says that it will keep these people with us by force, if necessary, the National Party states its case very clearly by saying that it does not stand in the way of any nation that wishes to become independent, and if and when, for the purposes of granting such independence, it should become necessary for consultation to take place&#x2014;for this is the course it has to take&#x2014;between the Government and the Administration of those Bantu homelands, such consultation can take place, and the machinery for that purpose has been created with care and with competence by the present Minister and his predecessor. Not only have we created the machinery as far as the organs of government are concerned, but only last year this Parliament placed its stamp on the citizenship of each of those Bantu homelands. We shall continue building on that basis. But I want to make this very clear here as it has so pointedly been my experience: We can make many mistakes, but there is one mistake we should never make, i.e. we should not see in our Bantu the parallel of the American Negro, because there is no parallel between the two at all. The Negroes are black Americans who have no language, traditions, or homeland or anything peculiar to themselves, whereas our Bantu have their own language, traditions, customs, land and aspirations.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have just referred to that, and I replied to that question last year as well as the year before. The hon. member may issue a statement on that to-morrow if he wants to do so.</p>

<p>Sir, I say that it is necessary for us to look at the relations here in South Africa, and I make bold to say that if one has regard to all the provocation that has been given, if one has regard to all the wilful people who wish to disturb these relations, if one has regard to the newspaper editors and reporters who go out of their way in order to blow up every little incident simply to cause ill-feeling among the various groups, one sees that we have made tremendous progress along this course, thanks to this party. Far from this party and this Government deserving censure, it should be commended for having, under all those circumstances, caused these relations to proceed as smoothly as has been the case in recent times.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, we come to our relations with other countries. In this regard it is necessary for me, especially with reference to what was said by President Kaunda, to state very emphatically that South Africa does not have any evil intentions as regards any other nation in Africa or in the world. It is not our intention to wage war against anybody. Furthermore, especially in recent times this is being mentioned specifically, because the question of arms to South Africa has cropped up. Let me now state very clearly&#x2014;and I am glad that I can say this not only on behalf of my side of the House, but on behalf of both sides of the House&#x2014;that we do not need arms from any country in the world for the purpose of attacking anybody. We do not need arms for the purpose of attacking anybody, in the first instance because we do not want to attack anybody and there is no need for us to do so, and, in the second instance, because we ourselves are manufacturing more than enough arms for the purpose of attacking anybody if we should ever have something like that in mind. But South Africa is not intent on seeking war, neither in Southern Africa nor anywhere else; South Africa is intent on seeking peace under all circumstances. Of course, it goes without saying that if we were attacked, we would defend ourselves with might and main. This is common knowledge to friend and foe alike. But violence and trouble will not come from our side. The biggest nonsense a leader in Africa has delivered <span class="col_53-54" refersTo="page_0041"/>himself of in recent times is what, according to the Press, Kaunda said to the head of Mauritius, who paid him a visit, when he (Kaunda) reportedly said that if arms were supplied to South Africa, they would be used for the purpose of attacking Mauritius and Zambia. I want to state here categorically that to make such a statement is not only nonsensical, but also malicious.</p>

<p>As I have said, South Africa does not need arms from anybody for the purpose of committing aggression. We seek, in the first instance, peace and the safeguarding of the Cape route. And we do not seek this for ourselves alone. Here, I think, the Leader of the Opposition and I are speaking the same language when I say that if we reduce this matter to its basics, the Cape route is probably more important to Europe than it is to us. To the Americas this route is, of course, not as important since it lies away from them. But to Europe this route is probably more important than it is to us. If this route were lost, we would suffer, and suffer a great deal at that, but it would still be possible for us to survive. Europe, however, is dependent on it for its raw materials and for certain food supplies, and consequently it would find it much more difficult to cope than we would. I am very grateful to be able to say, with reference to what I have seen and with reference to discussions I have had, that a better understanding of the need to retain the Cape route has come about. Such an understanding has been gained by the heads of many states. The long continued propaganda we have been making in regard to this matter has finally fallen on fertile soil. One is intensely grateful for that. In fact, we should be grateful for that&#x2014;and here hon. members must accept my word&#x2014;if we look at the military picture and see what large-scale Russian infiltration has already taken place into the waters around Southern Africa&#x2014;at places where they normally have no business to be and where one would not expect them to be. Just look at the nests they have made for themselves both at sea and on land. If one observes the feverishness with which they are establishing themselves here in the Southern Hemisphere, it must be obvious to all of us that they are here for a purpose, which, in addition to the other objectives they may have, is to sabotage this route around the Cape if and when it suits them. One appreciates how vulnerable the position is if one considers that as a result of the closure of Suez no fewer than 75 ships are sailing in our coastal waters every day, and that every day 620 vessels are present in this area within a distance of 3&#x00BD; days from our coastal waters. Along with these factors we should have regard to the expansion of the Russian submarine fleet and the establishment of bases in connection therewith, something on which I need not elaborate at this juncture. All of this makes us realize what havoc they can wreak on shipping if they were to deem it necessary at a given moment. That is why one is glad that, regard being had to this position, a greater appreciation of the importance of the Cape sea route has come about.</p>

<p>Hon. members will expect me, or ask me, to state what the position is in regard to the supply of arms by the Conservative Government of Britain. At this stage it is, unfortunately, not yet possible for me to make any official announcement in this regard. Hon. members may be aware of the fact that an official announcement on this matter will be made in the British House of Commons to-day. How far it will go, I do not know. However, I assume that as honourable people the gentlement of the British Government will keep their word, which was given both privately and officially, as well as the election promises they made. This is what I assume, and along with hon. members I am therefore awaiting an announcement on this matter.</p>

<p>It is in our interests, and this is also how I felt about the matter, that we should make closer contact with other states. For that reason I paid a visit <i>inter alia</i> to Malawi. This and our relations with Portugal clearly show that South Africa&#x2019;s standpoint is correct, i.e. that it is possible for one to have good relations with other states without pursuing the same domestic policy as they do. There is a world of difference between our policy and that of Portugal and between our policy and that of Malawi. Each of us has our own standpoint and views and, in spite of that, it is nevertheless possible for us to have friendly relations with one another and to receive one another as it ought to be done.</p>

<p>As far as Rhodesia is concerned, there has been no change in our attitude. We have stated that attitude over the years, and it is still the same. I paid a visit to that country, because it was consistent with the relations which have existed between these two countries over the years. We are concerned with sound relations with all states in Southern Africa, for this is where we have to live and work. I believe that as far as this is concerned, we have not only made a good deal of progress, but shall also make more progress as the years go by. We have problems with certain African states, but there will be an opportunity later on for furnishing this House with more detailed information in this regard.</p>

<p>Therefore the hon. the Leader of the Opposition need not be concerned about what the relations policy of this Government is in regard to its various population groups, nor about what our relations policy is in regard to the outside world; above all, he need not be concerned about our future economic position. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that the guarantee for a country&#x2019;s survival lay in its military and economic strength. These are but two of the things that are necessary. There are many others that can be mentioned. For instance, a third factor which is absolutely essential as well, is the moral strength and the faith of one&#x2019;s people. We as a Government are mindful of all these things. As far as the military factor is concerned, <span class="col_55-56" refersTo="page_0042"/>the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware that small as we are, we are, with the means at our disposal, engaged in making South Africa a medium-class power. We can never hope to be more than that. However, this I know: We shall be a good medium-class power.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to our economic growth. Surely he is aware that before the war we had an average growth rate of 4 per cent a year, and also that later on, in the fifties, we pushed this up to 5 per cent. He is also aware that for the decade that ended in 1970, we maintained an average growth rate of 6 per cent&#x2014;an average rate of 6 per cent over ten years, notwithstanding all the problems with which we were faced, notwithstanding the after-effects of Sharpeville and of other problems. I make bold to say that if we drew a comparison, we would find that in the whole of Europe only Spain and Greece had a growth rate higher than 6 per cent. In fact, according to figures furnished by UNO, only 14 countries in the entire world had a growth rate higher than that from 1960 to 1967, and this was accomplished in spite of the fact that our real growth only started in 1962. I could say more about the economy if time permitted, but I shall leave this to my colleagues, who will deal with it more fully.</p>

<p>In passing, and because it is important, I want to point out to the Leader of the Opposition, who expressed concern at this matter, that as far as border industries are concerned, we already have approved posts for 83,000 Bantu in those industries. If we have regard to the economic fact that in respect of tertiary industries we have two Bantu for every one who is accommodated in industry, and if we were to allot to each of those Bantu five dependants (which is not an unreasonable number, and which is the acceptable standard with which everybody is faced), it means that, thanks to the Government&#x2019;s border industry policy, its policy of decentralization and its use of the agency basis within the Bantu territories concerned, it has made it possible to retain there 1&#x00BD; million Bantu in all. The policy of those hon. members is that not only the Bantu labourer should come here, but that also his family should be housed and kept here. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition need not be concerned about those matters.</p>

<p>Sir, I referred in passing to the way in which we have over the years been doing our duty towards South Africa both in the sphere of education and on the research front. We have made available to our scientists facilities which, small as we are, are unique. Over the years we have from time to time reaped the benefits of this step. I am very grateful that I am in a position to-day to make an important and far-reaching statement in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>*Because it is of such importance, I take this opportunity of making the following statement in English so that there can be no misunderstanding about it:</p>

<p>In view of South Africa&#x2019;s large deposits of uranium, one of the most important objectives the research and development programme of the Atomic Energy Board, which was launched in 1959 with the approval of the Government was to process South African uranium to a form more advanced than uranium concentrate. Important progress was made in this regard and was in fact reported on from time to time by the Chairman of the Board.</p>

<p>It is well known that a number of countries are carrying out research and development work in the field of uranium enrichment, i.e. to process uranium to its most sophisticated form. In many countries this work is being done without their having the motivation of their own uranium production, which South Africa has in no small measure. (I lay stress on this point because it is very important in South Africa&#x2019;s case.) It is therefore obvious that the Atomic Energy Board would concern itself with this subject particularly for two reasons:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i)As a result of the increased demand for uranium in the enriched form, it is obvious that South Africa, as one of the largest uranium producing countries in the world, will consider it in its own interest to market uranium in the enriched form.</li>

<li>(ii)South Africa finds itself on the eve of a large nuclear power programme of its own&#x2014;of the order of 20,000 megawatts (electrical) by the end of this century, If such a programme can be based on enriched uranium, it will result in a very marked capital saving. However, such a course can only be followed if the supply of enriched uranium can be guaranteed, which, in the difficult world in which we live, implies own production.</li>

</ol>

<p>Scientists of the Atomic Energy Board succeeded in developing a new process for uranium enrichment, as well as the extensive associated technology, and they are presently engaged on the building of a pilot plant for the enrichment of uranium based on this process. South African scientists have thus again added to the prestige of their country in no uncertain terms. In the past they have made lasting contributions to science, but perhaps the achievement that I am announcing to-day is unequalled in the history of our country.</p>

<p>To appreciate to some extent the scope of the achievement of the scientists of the Atomic Energy Board. I need only mention that because of the enormous costs of uranium enrichment, only the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France in the Western world have such plants. The plant in France, which was the latest to be erected in the West, and which is appreciably smaller <span class="col_57-58" refersTo="page_0043"/>than the U.S.A. plants, cost approximately R700 million (development costs included). The high cost stems on the one hand from the development and application of the sophisticated technology associated with uranium enrichment and which is kept strictly secret by those who possess it, and on the other hand from the fact that uranium can only be enriched at a reasonable cost in very large plants.</p>

<p>The South African process, which is unique in its concept, is presently developed to the stage where it is estimated that under South African conditions, a large scale plant can be competitive with existing plants in the West. What is more important is that the process still holds appreciable possibilities for further development, and research and development to achieve this are continuing.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately not possible to mention the names of all the scientists and technical personnel who contributed to this important development. However, I would like to mention two who were associated with the project from the beginning and are still guiding the development. They are Dr. A. J. A. Roux and Dr. W. L. Grant. Dr. Roux, at present Chairman of the Board, initiated the development when he called a meeting of heads of divisions in the early sixties and requested them, in the light of the importance of uranium enrichment for South Africa as a large uranium producer, to consider alternative processes for uranium enrichment. One of the heads at that time, Dr. W. L. Grant, presently Director-General of the Board, proposed the principle of the new process.</p>

<p>Under the general guidance of Dr. Roux, the work was continued and in his present capacity as Chairman, he still devotes a great deal of his time to the promotion of this project, of which a multitude of aspects call for his personal attention. From the start Dr. Grant was project leader, a task which he, together with his team of scientists and technical personnel, carried through with vigour to eventual success. These two scientists&#x2014;a complementary team&#x2014;who have been closely associated for 22 years in the service of science in South Africa, have through their combined effort and guidance made possible this important development&#x2014;a development which nevertheless would never have succeeded had it not been for the real contribution (in some cases very important), zeal and loyalty of the personnel who were associated with the project.</p>

<p>In making this important announcement I would again like to emphasize, as has so often been done by the Government, that South Africa&#x2019;s research and development programme in the field of nuclear energy is directed entirely towards peaceful purposes. I must stress this again because as we all know, this will be misinterpreted. I must therefore say again that it is directed entirely towards peaceful purposes. I would like to go even further. South Africa does not intend to withhold the considerable advantages inherent in this development from the world community. We are therefore prepared to collaborate in the exploitation of this process with any non-communist countries desiring to do so, but subject to the conclusion of an agreement safeguarding our interests. I must, however, emphasize that our sole objective in the further development and application of the process would be to promote the peaceful application of nuclear energy. Only then can it be to our benefit and the benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>I also wish to state emphatically that South Africa is prepared to subject its nuclear activities to a safeguards system including inspection, subject to the conditions that:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i)South Africa will in no way be limited in the promotion of the peaceful application of nuclear energy;</li>

<li>(ii)South Africa will not run the risk of details of the new process leaking out as a result of the safeguards inspection system; and</li>

<li>(iii)The safeguards system, while efficient, is to be implemented on such a reasonable basis as to avoid interference with the normal efficient operation of the particular industries.</li>

</ol>

<p>South Africa, as the House knows, has not yet acceded to the non-profileration treaty, and has on various occasions clearly stated that it would consider participation as soon as the safeguards system to which South Africa would be subjected, is known. The International Atomic Energy Agency is at present devising its safeguards system and as soon as its nature and scope are known, South Africa will seriously consider accession to the treaty in the light of the foregoing exposition.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would like to mention that during the present Session of Parliament an Act will be introduced by the Minister of Mines to establish a corporation for the enrichment of uranium and to provide for matters incidental thereto.</p>

<p>*As we have to pay regard to the fact that the idea is steadily gaining ground that the world&#x2019;s known coal and petroleum resources will have been exhausted in approximately 50 years&#x2019; time&#x2014;in some countries it may take more time, in others less&#x2014;a developing country or, for that matter, any other country will therefore be more and more dependent on nuclear energy for its power and fuel. Bearing this in mind, I believe that through this new process which has been developed by our scientists, a process which is not only new, but also has the potential of being improved and becoming cheaper, it will be possible to meet the future needs of South Africa. I believe that South Africa has made a colossal contribution on this peaceful front, and that South Africa is prepared to share that contribution, as I have explained in this statement. I want <span class="col_59-60" refersTo="page_0044"/>to extend my gratitude and appreciation and congratulations to Dr. Roux and Dr. Grant and to everybody who was associated with them in this project. This is a great and magnificent service which has been rendered to South Africa. It has furnished proof that in so many spheres South Africa has at its disposal the services of great scientists of world class.</p>

<p>One looks to the future. I do not know why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is afraid of the future. I myself am not afraid of the future. I believe in it so much the more because I am convinced in my own mind that the only way in which South Africa can be governed, is in terms of the policy and principles of the National Party. What is of greater importance, is not what I believe or what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition or his people believe. What is of greater importance, is that the voters of South Africa believe in it too.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we had a very interesting performance from the hon. the Prime Minister to-day. It was a speech with a climax and a speech with several anti-climaxes. I am very pleased to be able to say immediately that everybody in South Africa is overjoyed at the Prime Minister&#x2019;s announcement that our scientists, Dr. Roux and Dr. Grant, together with their colleagues, have succeeded in developing a new and probably more effective process for the refinement of uranium.</p>

<p>This is a source of pride to every South African. It is a source of joy, because it opens new possibilities for South Africa, also in its relations with the rest of the world. We immediately want to express our joy and to extend our sincere congratulations to the scientists concerned on their splendid achievement. While the Prime Minister was speaking and was pointing out that it is in our interest to have uranium available in more refined form, I was astonished that he did not refer to the announcement of the Saldanha Bay project; I was struck by the thought whether it would not also be in our interest to have our other ores available in a more refined form. I was struck by the thought whether it is really in the interest of South Africa to export uranium and iron ore in the way we do while its refining in South Africa itself can provide greater opportunities and greater riches to South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I heard nothing which cast any light on this matter. There are two points on which I and, I believe, hon. members on this side of this House, are in complete agreement with the hon. the Prime Minister, and I want place this on record immediately.</p>

<p>Firstly, I refer to where the hon. the Prime Minister declared with so much emphasis that South Africa harbours no aggressive intentions against any other country in the world. I think the world should know that the official Opposition in South Africa shares that standpoint entirely. We believe that our Government has no aggressive intentions against any other country and we also believe that it is foreign to the character and the nature of our people to have such intentions. We agree with the Prime Minister that people who make such statements and base their standpoint against South Africa on the presumption that we may possibly have aggressive intentions, are under a complete illusion which can lead to erroneous conclusions and wrong actions which can only have unfortunate consequences for Africa.</p>

<p>I think I must go further and state that we of the official Opposition want to place on record that while we as a people harbour no aggressive intentions, it must be understood very clearly that should acts of aggression be committed against South Africa for some or other reason, the aggressor will be confronted by a people united as never before. I think this must be placed on record. I am saying this on the authority of every member on this side of this House, and especially on the authority of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I think it is perhaps important that the people who make these wild statements should explain why the only aggression committed in Southern Africa to-day comes from terrorists who are trained outside South Africa in order to harm us. They must explain to us why there is no similar action from our side against states in other parts of Africa who are hostile to us.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The problem with that hon. Minister is that he never listens. He is so busy preparing himself to belittle other people that he has no time to listen to what they actually have in mind.</p>

<p>We are all interested in these matters which the Prime Minister mentioned and we can take them further later. But we are also greatly interested in the largest section of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech. We expected a great speech to-day; we expected an important speech to-day; we expected a speech to-day which would portray the Government to us as a government with a profound vision, as a government which has great plans for South Africa. Judging by the <i>Beeld, Dagbreek</i> and all the newspapers which tell the Government what it should do&#x2014;unfortunately the Government does not listen, because they sometimes give good advice&#x2014;the Prime Minister would have released one bomb after another to-day in order to shatter the United Party once and for all. But we are still waiting. The only sensational and well-received statement made by the Prime Minister was that we can now <span class="col_61-62" refersTo="page_0045"/>refine uranium by means of a new process. This naturally falls to the credit of our scientists. Perhaps it would have been better for South Africa if those scientists sat in the Cabinet instead of the hon. the Prime Minister and the members of his Cabinet. Then we would perhaps have achieved something for South Africa. But where did the National Party&#x2019;s politically controlled Press, the newspapers with the Ministers as their directors, get the idea to predict that the Prime Minister would make a great, powerful speech presenting a new dispensation and a new vision for South Africa? Where is it? The hon. the Prime Minister reproached my Leader with harping on the old themes. Where was the new tone in the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech? Where was something refreshing, something bringing new hope, something bringing new expectations, something which can bring relief for the South African people in that speech? It was petty logic-chopping from beginning to end, with the exceptions which I have already mentioned and for which I granted the hon. the Prime Minister the credit which he deserves. He referred to the old themes. But what must the Opposition do? I concede his argument: old themes were discussed. But how much new light did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition not cast on these old matters? Here was vision. The best which the hon. the Prime Minister can hold in prospect for South Africa is that we shall become a medium class power. But by sound arguments which no economist and no sociologist can refute, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition pointed out that, provided we can change the policy of the Government and apply a truly enlightened outward policy in South Africa, we can become one of the ten most important states in the world before the end of the century. However, the hon. the Prime Minister did not react to that. He did not try to analyse, refute or approve of those arguments. He presented his own limited vision, his petty view, namely that if we are fortunate and if the Lord is merciful towards us while we remain under a Nationalist Party Government, which in itself will not be indicative of mercy, we can become medium-class people. What a contrast! How disappointed the <i>Beeld, Dagbreek,</i> the <i>Transvaler,</i> the <i>Burger</i> and the <i>Oosterlig</i> must be! These servants, these experts of the National Party who gave the Prime Minister such good advice, how disappointed must they not be? But he was incapable of implementing their advice.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister devoted much more time to the result of the election than the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did. I listened carefully. I wanted to establish what the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s argument was. Eventually, after I had made an interjection, he told me that the votes case were the main point. According to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own figures, the United Party drew the same percentage of votes, all the votes that count, as in 1966. These are his own figures. I can dispute them and I can argue about their application. But the National Party received between 4 and 5 per cent fewer votes than in 1966. Who is on the decline now? Surely this is the point: Who is on the decline? Not once did the hon. the Prime Minister explain to us how it happened that nine new members now occupy benches on this side of the House which were occupied by Nationalists before the dissolution of the previous Parliament. He did not explain to us how they fell out of the sky or how they happen to be here if there has been no progress on our side and no decline on that side of the House. Where is the hon. member for Zululand? Where is the hon. member for Umhlatuzana? Where is the hon. member for Benoni? Why is he in Langlaagte now? The hon. the Prime Minister should have explained these matters to us, but he did not even try to do so.</p>

<p>Oh, there are so many; I cannot mention all of them.</p>

<p>Let us look back for a while. The statement which my hon. Leader made, namely that seldom in the history of South African politics has there been a governing political party which was so totally out of touch with the real feelings of the people, is a very valid one. I did not prepare myself for this subject so thoroughly, because I did not expect that the hon. the Prime Minister would discuss it to such an extent, but a Sunday or two before the election an article appeared in one of the South African Sunday newspapers which contained the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s prediction of the result of the election. I think it was in the <i>Beeld.</i> He predicted that they would win five more seats and that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would emerge from the election so humiliated that his self-respect would force him to quit the political field in South Africa. At a public meeting in Johannesburg the hon. the Minister of Transport gave the Prime Minister either Von Brandis or Bezuidenhout&#x2014;I am not sure&#x2014;as a present. The hon. the Prime Minister did not want to be outdone and then gave Von Brandis or Bezuidenhout&#x2014;I am not sure how it actually happened&#x2014;to the hon. the Minister of Transport as a present. Can hon. members believe that a government can be so out of touch? We tripled our majority in Bezuidenhout from 1,400 to 4,200. Nevertheless they gave these two seats as a present to each other before the election and not after the election. I just want to show how out of touch the Government is, and not only how out of touch it is, but also how presumptuous and arrogant it was. I think it was the <i>Beeld</i> which used Sanlam&#x2019;s computer in order to predict the result of the election. The prediction was that there would be a larger majority for the National Party than ever before in the history of South Africa. One United Party seat after <span class="col_63-64" refersTo="page_0046"/>another would tumble: Von Brandis, Bezuidenhout, Gardens &#x2026;</p>

No, they fed the poor computer with information received from the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s organization and its leaders. Do hon. members know what the information was?</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No, they were merely out of touch. They fed the computer with the information that the Afrikaans-speaking group was increasing by 2 per cent and therefore the number of voters supporting the National Party must be increased by 2 per cent as well. Then they simply fed the computer with an increase of 2 per cent per year. But they forget that our followers are also increasing. They also forget that people change their political views. And they forget that at every by-election since 1966, the Nationalist Party showed signs of declining. They disregard the facts. It is wishful thinking, it is foolishness. And then the Prime Minister still comes with a political party which does not know what is happening among its own people, and on the strength of that he actually goes so far as to suggest that the result of the election will necessarily lead to the resignation of the hon. Leader of the Opposition from the political life of South Africa. But he does not apologize. He does not admit that he made a mistake. He continues with his bluffing. He is bluffing himself and nobody else. This naturally gave me the greatest satisfaction in the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech. He is bluffing himself that things are well with the Nationalist Party. I hope he will continue believing that. According to his speech there was never a by-election in Langlaagte; according to his speech there is to be no by-election in Klip River. According to his speech there will never be another election in South Africa. They are now in power for ever. As long as the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s leaders remain under that illusion and fail to realize the true political state of affairs in South Africa and as long as they give one another seats which they cannot win, I am perfectly happy and the United Party is perfectly happy and a very happy day in South Africa will arrive soon.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are so many little points. There is the accusation, which is unworthy of the Prime Minister, that the United Party was favourably inclined towards the Hertzog group or the Herenigde Nasionale Party in the past election.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it was.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is a mispresentation. It is untrue. It is totally and absolutely devoid of truth. In the history of South Africa here have never before been two political ideas which are so widely divergent as that of the Hertzog Group, the legitimate child of the Nationalist Party, and ours. There is, according to my study of politics, not one aspect of the policy of the Herstigte Nasionale Party which was not at some or other stage either the governing party&#x2019;s policy or propagated by prominent leaders of the Nationalist Party. They are responsible for the mental attitude which was revealed in the H. N. P. And now they have the unprecedented, unforgivable and indefensible audacity to pretend that we of the United Party would want to be associated with the worst aspects of the Nationalist Party. They say this while ever since we can remember we have fought against the less bad aspects, but nevertheless bad aspects, of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Let me point out the sort of argument that was used. The Prime Minister said very ostentatiously that in 1948 we had diplomatic relations with only 19 states and that there are 65 to-day. The Prime Minister forgets that the United Nations was established in 1945 with approximately 40 or 50 independent states of the world. Even if we had had diplomatic relations with all those states, there would still not have been 65. But since then 60 or 70 new, independent states have appeared on the world scene. It was therefore a matter of course that diplomatic representation had to grow. It does not matter which government is in power. As you develop and as your trade expands and you become a greater country, you must establish more diplomatic relations. This just shows how warped the Prime Minister&#x2019;s knowledge of history is. He wants us to believe that it is a tremendous achievement that the National Party has established diplomatic relations with South America. But what is the result of that? Can the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell me how many of those South American states support our point of view or are sympathetically disposed towards us at the UN? In the days of Jan Smuts and a United Party Government, however, without diplomatic representation and only with the contacts which we had, they stood solidly behind South Africa virtually <i>en bloc.</i></p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the difference. It is not the acquisition of representation, but the influence of a government, the image which a government creates of its country and the answer which it receives even from states in which it has no representation, that counts. This the Prime Minister cannot realize. He wants me to take this sort of argument seriously and to regard it as a reply to the imaginative and stirring view of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the important speech which he made to-day.</p>

<p><span class="col_65-66" refersTo="page_0047"/>The hon. the Prime Minister took delight in the fact&#x2014;and I do not want to deprive him of it&#x2014;that the subsidies for our universities have increased tremendously. He said this in reply to my Leader&#x2019;s charge that educational facilities in South Africa are not meeting our needs. He calls it a tremendous percentage increase of many hundreds in the subsidies which are paid to universities. He said that the number of students had increased. I am pleased that this is the position. But the increase cannot be very adequate, because every year there are still hundreds of students who want to become doctors or engineers, but cannot gain admission to South African universities because the facilities are inadequate. At the moment there are negotiations afoot among committees of heads of our universities in order to ask more from the Government because what they are receiving is insufficient to meet the needs of South Africa. This is the test. The test is not to mention overall figures. The test is whether our educational system is meeting the requirements of South Africa.</p>

<p>We had a commission of enquiry into the training of engineers and technicians. Did they report that the Government was meeting their needs? One of the most acute shortages in South Africa is that of technicians&#x2014;the men and women who stand between the artisan and the qualified engineer. What has been done to meet that? In 1948 we had four technical colleges; now we have five. The need, however, has doubled. What is being done to meet that need?</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No. We all know there is a shortage of these people. What is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s reply to the unquestionable fact which the Leader of the Opposition has raised repeatedly in this House, namely that our white population of 3&#x00BD; or 4 million simply does not have the number of people to carry out all the skilled, administrative and executive tasks for our developing community? What is his reply? Is it border industries, where the main incentive for manufacturers to move there is the much lower wages than those paid in the existing urban industrial areas? Is it border industries, in respect of which the trade unions are already becoming uneasy, where there is injustice and where the germ of labour unrest in South Africa lies? Is this his reply? Why did the hon. the Prime Minister not reply to the things which matter and which were raised by my hon. Leader?</p>

<p>There is the manpower shortage. My Leader devoted some time to that. There is a manpower shortage on all levels of enterprise. But the Prime Minister did not say a word about this. There is no word of encouragement and no semblance of an answer. This debate is an important one. It is one of the most important debates we have had for a long time, because for the first time there is a decline in the Nationalist Party. My Leader showed why. The hon. the Prime Minister was called upon to show us that that decline can be halted by a government which has vision and which has an answer to our problems. I now ask any impartial listener to the speeches in this debate today to say where the Prime Minister gave any indication that the Nationalist Party has a vision for South Africa, a vision which will solve South Africa&#x2019;s problems and which can serve as justification for the people to continue to have confidence in this Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to me one of the finest things in my hon. Leader&#x2019;s speech was his plea that we should become a &#x201C;compassionate society &#x201D; and that we should show compassion towards the less privileged among us.</p>

<p>Will he please accept it? The Prime Minister is making another &#x2026; I will not say it is a half-truth, it is an absolute untruth. Why does the Prime Minister make the cutting remark for which he has absolutely no grounds? Why is he so irresponsible and so petty? Surely it does not enhance the debate. [Interjection.] No. An election taught us that it is not &#x201C;Jolly John &#x201D;, but &#x201C;Jittery John &#x201D;.</p>

<p>One of the finest things in my Leader&#x2019;s speech was his plea for a compassionate society in South Africa. He asked us to care more for the aged, the less privileged, the ill and the suffering members of our entire society, White and non-White. During the election we pleaded time and again, and I believe it helped us a great deal, for State-assisted medical aid schemes. We pleaded for a national contributory pension scheme. It was well received, but to this important plea by my Leader there was not one single word of reaction from the Prime Minister, although he immediately stood up and, according to the predictions of the <i>Beeld</i> and <i>Dagbreek,</i> would make the Leader of the Opposition and the United Party look small and the Prime Minister mighty. After all, these are matters in which the people are interested. Is something going to come? Can we expect more compassion from this Government, can we expect more sympathy for the less privileged and a deeper understanding of the needs of those who suffer in our society? [Interjections.] Our record is that every social security measure placed on the Statute Book is the work of a United Party Government. I challenge the hon. the Prime Minister to name me one new Act or one new idea which was placed on the Statute Book by this Government during their 23 years in power <span class="col_67-68" refersTo="page_0048"/>for the protection of the less privileged and those who are struck by unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<p>Did you start the old age pension?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That was started by the old Nationalist Party of General Hertzog. Very well. The hon. the Prime Minister has mentioned one, but it was done by the old Nationalist Party, which was a good Nationalist Party. Now I ask the hon. the Prime Minister to mention one such Act which was placed on the Statute Book by this Government during the past 23 years. I ask the hon. the Prime Minister to mention one, besides two shillings here and five shillings there. The hon. the Prime Minister can be very talkative while one is speaking, but if one asks him a simple, pertinent question, he remains perfectly quiet. The hon. the Prime Minister must not ask me again what the United Party has done in this field, because the reply is obvious. We did the initial work; we did the planning; we were committed to a national contributory pension scheme as soon as our national income reached R2.000 million. It is now almost R9,000 million already, and where is that scheme? We are committed to a contributory medical aid scheme; we introduced free hospital services in the Transvaal and the Cape Province, which have been abolished by this Government. It seems that in the Transvaal to-day it costs more to collect bad debts under a maladministration than what a free hospital scheme will cost.</p>

<p>Apart from the announcements and the one other minor matter which I have mentioned, my charge against the hon. the Prime Minister is that his reply to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was the most superficial attempt I have ever heard in this House. My hon. Leader spoke about the tendency in South Africa to develop more slowly and the uncertainty which exists among the businessmen of South Africa and which results in a slowing down. He spoke about the manpower shortage, and he mentioned the dangers attached to a shortage of finance. Before me I have the latest survey of the Bureau for Economic Research of Stellenbosch, which has just been released. Every one of those points is repeated with emphasis. If I had the time I would have quoted then, but I want to mention just one. One point which they mention here&#x2014;incidentally, it is something which we have propagated for many years&#x2014;is that if we want to solve our problems in this country, we will have to make great progress in the economic field. We will have to become strong not only strategically but also so strong economically that a proper existence can be afforded to every citizen of South Africa so that everyone can have an interest in the maintenance of what is best in the existing order in South Africa. Here the Bureau for Economic Research mentions the negative aspects of the apartheid policy of which we hear so little, as being among the most important factors contributing towards the uncertainty among our businessmen, which is definitely retarding our development to-day. They mention the Physical Planning Act. This is the University of Stellenbosch! They mention other measures which are being injudiciously applied by the Government, but the hon. the Prime Minister disregards this. Apart from a section of his speech which lasted a quarter of an hour, he gave us two hours of petty politicising. My Leader presented a theme. It may be an old theme, but it represents a healthy line of thought which gives one courage for the future. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#janson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, year after year during the past few years I have had the privilege&#x2014;whether it is a privilege I do not know&#x2014;of listening to speakers on the Opposition side, and to the Leader of the Opposition, moving the customary motion of no confidence in the Government. This year&#x2019;s motion was no different from that of the previous years; it was the same words and the same song, only sung to a slightly different tune. I should just like to read to hon. members what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said in 1969 when he moved his motion of no confidence in the House. At that time, after the introduction of the proposal that the House had no confidence in the Government, he admitted &#x201C;it will be seen that the motion is in general terms &#x201D;. He continued by elaborating on this in the general terms he himself mentioned. At the beginning of this year, during the first Sitting, it was the same story again. As it was last year, and at the beginning of this year, so it will now be again. Initially the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has the privilege of moving a motion, and for a few moments one thinks of the Government as being in the dock. However, when the Leader of the Opposition and his supporters have had a little more to say, one finds that it is that side of the House which has already been standing in the dock for 22 years and longer. This is now once more the case.</p>

<p>An accusation was made to the effect that the hon. the Prime Minister did not reply to the specific questions touched upon by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Anyone in this House who takes his work a little seriously will know that for five years at a stretch each of these questions raised here this afternoon was answered by members of this side of the House and by Ministers in dealing with their posts.</p>

<p>However, there is one exception, and that is in respect of the analysis which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition furnished at the commencement of his speech about the recent election. I want to say that I am delighted at the result of the recent election. I am not delighted at the loss of nine good members who sat on this side of the House&#x2014;I regret that&#x2014; but I am glad that clarity could be reached <span class="col_69-70" refersTo="page_0049"/>within Government ranks about what our standpoint was, and that at the next election South Africa will know that this Government and this Prime Minister were prepared to accept the full consequences of its standpoint in respect of race relations in South Africa. In this election the Government paid the <i>pro tempore</i> price for that by being honest and by even adopting a standpoint in opposition to good friends of the past. South Africa, and particularly the younger generation, will take note of the fact that this challenge was accepted by the Government in 1970 when it honestly and sincerely stood before English and Afrikaans-speaking South Africa and the world in order to put its standpoint, notwithstanding the possibility of a loss of seats.</p>

<p>If there was a single factor which adversely influenced the election results for the National Party, it was the fact that a United Party and its newspapers exploited something about which the National Party was being honest. As the English saying goes, &#x201C;they were fishing in troubled waters &#x201D;. In this way they attempted to make capital out of it, and if they gained satisfaction from this and think that they will come into power with the aid of a temporary vote of grievance, they are welcome to the fools&#x2019; paradise in which they are living. I believe that as our problems become more compelling and urgent, the large majority of those who now voted against the National Party&#x2014; excluding perhaps those who took the lead&#x2014; will know that they must return once more to the fold where they belong. They will be welcome in defeating the common enemy, the United Party, which has always been South Africa&#x2019;s enemy, with greater remorselessness in the next election.</p>

<p>To-day, as he and other speakers have done in the past, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition once more elaborated on the question of &#x201C;morality, justice and reality &#x201D;, which are allegedly not being taken into consideration by the Government. I do not want to elaborate on that at length. Once before I have had the opportunity of pointing out that accusations are frequently forthcoming from that side of the House about the dearth of morality in our actions and in the determination of our policies. In speaking of morality, hon. members opposite should first give thought to its meaning. We on this side are now supposedly unjust to the non-Whites. We are supposedly acting immorally, and as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition claimed to-day &#x201C;some things will not pass the test of simple morality &#x201D;. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and hon. members opposite to explain to me where is the &#x201C;morality &#x201D; inherent in allocating the Government to 13 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s population and telling the remaining 87 per cent of the population that they must be satisfied with eight representatives in the House of Assembly. Where is the morality inherent in that, and what right has any hon. member opposite to point an accusing finger about morality at this side of the House when this Government tells the non-Whites: We are giving you equal rights, the full possibility for development and administration in your own area and in your own fatherland? But hon. members opposite say: No, for the sake of economic growth and because, by the year 2000, South Africa must be a mighty power, on a competitive footing with the rest of the world, as the hon. member for Yeoville said. They will not give these people those benefits, but they add that they should come along here to make us economically strong. Is this not flagrant exploitation? If there has ever been talk of immorality, is this not immorality? For the price of eight representatives in the House of Assembly they are asking these people to donate their powers so that we may grow bigger and fatter. That is what the United Party is holding up to us as a lesson in morality.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to deal for a moment with this question of race relations. I am glad that during the recent election clarity was reached about the standpoint of the National Party in this respect. As a junior member of this Parliament I want to call upon English-speaking people in South Africa&#x2014; perhaps an example can be set by numerous English-speaking hon. members opposite&#x2014;to take note of the standpoint of the National Party, to which by far the majority of Afrikaans-speaking people belong, the standpoint as stated in the newspapers which support this party&#x2019;s view. I think that it should of necessity be said that one unfortunate state of affairs is that the standpoint of the National Party cannot be conveyed to English-speaking people in their own language, and that English-speaking people neglect to acquaint themselves with the true policy and standpoint of the National Party on this matter about which they are repeatedly mislead and frightened by English language newspapers, and about which they are frightened by people from whom one would expect greater responsibility, i.e. hon. members on that side of the House. They frighten the people in respect of the National Party on the grounds of their language. The National Party and the hon. the Prime Minister proved their good faith towards English-speaking people in South Africa with a loss of seats but with an absolute intrinsic gain, i.e. conviction in respect of their own people. To the world they evidenced a gain in respect of their honest intentions. The call which must be made to the younger South Africa, if the older South Africa will then not give heed to it&#x2014; and which English-speaking South Africa must also take note of&#x2014;is that they should know what is being written in the Afrikaans-language newspapers of our country. I believe that there is also a challenge in that for our youth. I am glad that there are discussions taking place at our universities and elsewhere&#x2014;even though I do not agree with all the standpoints&#x2014;to see how opinions can be exchanged and in order to explain points of view to one another. I want to express the hope that youth will take note <span class="col_71-72" refersTo="page_0050"/>of what the Government has done in the recent election to give realization to the ideal of one South African nation, even though we speak two languages.</p>

<p>In the second place I briefly want to deal with what was touched upon by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon in respect of the Coloured question, when he spoke of &#x201C;immorality &#x201D; in our standpoint. It strikes one, and I say this respectfully to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, how ignorant the Leader of the hon. Opposition is about this Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of the Bantu and the other population groups in our fatherland. In Hansard on 3rd February, 1969, Vol. 25, Col. 17, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition explains the Government&#x2019;s standpoint in respect of the Bantu in South Africa as follows: &#x201C;The first objective is the separation of Black from White. The second is the establishment of separate states, which hon. members opposite regard as separate nations. &#x201D; The following year when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had to explain what he understood of the apartheid legislation and of the policy of the National Party, he said that no one would deny that the actual chief objective of the whole National Party policy was to reduce the number of Bantu in the white areas. I consider it necessary that the United Party should also take note of its past and of its leaders. The hon. member for Yeoville spoke again, this afternoon, about what has been done by the United Party in the past, and about how their leaders were respected by the world. The opinion of the present leader of the United Party is that the main purpose is simply the reduction of the number of Bantu. In 1913, when the late General Hertzog adopted his standpoint about the future of the Bantu in South Africa, it was not only his standpoint. He said at the time (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">Let us not take the whole Union for ourselves, but let us cede a portion to the Natives. Let them develop themselves there according to their individual natures and under the supervision of the Union Government. Blacks and Whites must be separated and each must exist separately.</block>

<p>Mr. H. W. Sampson then stood up and said:</p>

<block name="quote">The Native could only hope to aim at governing himself and making his own laws in the future by separating from the Whites.</block>

<p>Mr. Patrick Duncan was of the opinion that: &#x201C;Everyone would agree with the principle enunciated by the Minister that it was to the best interests of Europeans and Natives that points of social contact should be reduced to the least possible area. &#x201D; That is what was said then, and that is what is still being pursued by the National Party. In 1912, at Heidelberg, General Botha said the following on this subject (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">The Kaffir question was the most difficult of all, but he believed that it could be solved by segregating Kaffirs in certain parts and giving them a measure of independence there&#x2014;elsewhere not.</block>

<p>During a debate in 1913 he also said the following (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">The Whites must adopt a very careful attitude in connection with the Natives &#x2026; They carry the responsibility of developing the people. Segregation is the only good for the Native &#x2026; If the Native is segregated, one must give them the right to govern themselves. Let them govern themselves under the supervision of the Whites.</block>

<p>This is precisely what we are now doing. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove should rather confine himself to postal matters; with respect, he knows little enough even about them. &#x201C;Under the supervision of Whites &#x201D; is what is now happening in the Transkei. Must we get away from that? Would the hon. member for Orange Grove now know better than the then Leader of the United Party? Let me quote to the hon. member what one of his party&#x2019;s other leaders, General Smusts, said:</p>

<block name="quote">Wherever Europeans and Natives live in the same country it will mean separate parallel institutions for the two. The old practice mixed up Blacks with Whites in the same institution, as nothing else was possible after the Native institutions and traditions had been carelessly or deliberately destroyed.</block>

<p>We are trying to restore the customs and habits of the Bantu in their own homelands, and even where they reside temporarily. The Government is then blamed for that. The most tragic of all is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, during the last session, in an election speech. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> that there were several people within the ranks of the National Party who said that too little was being done for the development of the homelands. On the other hand, he said, there are people who say that the Government is doing too much for the Bantu. What he said was true. It was an unfortunate truth. But what is an even more unfortunate truth is that the United Party went and said those things in the country districts, and in my constituency as well. They did not hesitate to use the word when they said: Look what the Government is doing for the Kaffir! And when they arrived in the cities, they told a different story. They said this in my constituency and reverted to the old word, to capture a few votes and to be able to say that they have the confidence of the South African people. We have experienced this repeatedly in the past. The people who speak of &#x201C;morality, reality and justice &#x201D; use such methods where the winning of a few votes is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="col_73-74" refersTo="page_0051"/>I want to make the admission that I too would like to see the development of the homelands taking place more rapidly. Also that I would like to see the separation between Whites and non-Whites taking place more rapidly. But let me tell the other side that I am grateful that that separation and the gaining of independence is not taking place as it has done in the rest of Africa. I see a new hon. member laughing about that. He must go and listen to what the rest of Africa says about where the United Party&#x2019;s policy is heading, because during his lifetime he still has time at least to pull himself together. If it is a question of more rapid development as against stable development, if there is a choice between rapid independence and proper independence, the National Party prefers to choose the slow road, even though there are newspapers and people in our own ranks who say that we must quicken our pace. There are practical difficulties along the way every time. What we are engaged in to-day, our children will be engaged in. This is the challenge for the youth of South Africa not to say, as the United Party has said, that we should have all kinds of integration because this would solve our difficulties, but to choose the road which would at least guarantee us something in return for what we shall give.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition said last year that his policy of theirs offered an immediate solution for <i>a</i> number of our problems. Perhaps it does offer an immediate solution for a number of problems. At those places where there are no white workers, non-Whites can be crammed in to excess. If the Opposition wants to be honest, let them ask the voters of South Africa whether they want the immediate solution for their problems at the cost of their continued existence, and they will know the answer. In the past the National Party repeatedly warned that this policy was going to demand sacrifices. Sacrifices will be demanded, during the present Sitting and in the coming years even more so than in the past. But the choice that the National Party has already made and which we want to hold up to the South African public, is that we must choose between a white future or a future in which we shall have economic prosperity, but with the white man and his civilization having to perish.</p>

<p>I am glad that I may be the first to have the opportunity, in conclusion, of being able to say to our hon. the Prime Minister that we have a very great appreciation for what he has done together with the hon. Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance, for the extension of our outward policy, notwithstanding what some newspapers have said. The people of South Africa are grateful to them for that, because among all who love South Africa and its interests, among all who have a sincere appreciation for the work of our Ministers, there was concern for their safety when they went overseas. We are glad that they have returned safely and that they have been so successful.</p>

<p>In this connection I just want to quote what the late Dr. Verwoerd said when he opened the tunnel through the Soutpansberg in the Northern Transvaal. He said that the great task of this generation would be to tunnel through the mountains existing between ourselves and the outside world. On that occasion he made a stirring call, a call which our present Prime Minister is putting into effect. I think it necessary that we as a South African nation should once more take note of that. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A physical impediment has been placed on the road to the north and to the south. And, my friends, this idea of a road and of obstructions is symbolic of what is to be seen at present in our world and in our relationships in Africa. The hearts of the South African people are open in respect of the north, and also in respect of the movement towards us from the north, but there is an obstruction, caused by hate, jealousy, hostility, ignorance and illiteracy; obstructions of the spirit which, however, are not inherent in our spirits. In us the tunnels are open.</block>

<p>He then concluded&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For me the symbolism of this great road to the north and to the south is that there is only more work lying ahead for us. We have overcome the physical obstacles, the road ahead lies white, as the Bantu say; and now the road into the future lies white for us to build, it lies white into the hearts of people. This is the symbolism: the one struggle has been won, the easiest struggle; one penetrates a boulder with greater ease than one does the hardness of the human heart, but as the one, so can the other be penetrated, because we believe in our future and we believe in our good relations with everyone, everywhere in the world and in Africa, regardless of whatever they now think and say of us.</block>

<p>I think that with that spirit in our hearts, which our Prime Minister and his other Ministers have revealed these past weeks, we can also go forward to meet the next five years of government.</p>

<p>This motion of no confidence is symbolic of the weakness of an Opposition and has become typical and characteristic of it. It is a party which simply makes promises before and after elections and has no policy. At a subsequent election this Opposition will be even more crushingly defeated than in this election. [Laughter.] The Opposition&#x2019;s joy is gratifying. I have never in my life seen people get such a hiding and feel so glad about it. It is as if they are steeling themselves against an even greater thrashing in the next election.</p>

<p>This hon. gentleman obviously suffers from what psychologists call projection. When you are guilty of something <span class="col_75-76" refersTo="page_0052"/>yourself, you accuse the other side of it. We thought that he set off quite well, until he suddenly decided to take over a speech which was made during a previous session by the ex-member for Benoni. Now, we all know what has happened to the ex-member for Benoni and he must be careful. He might become the ex-member for Witbank if he goes on like that, because like the ex-member for Benoni he also has not done his homework. He quotes what General Hertzog said on the race issue, but why does he not tell this House that General Hertzog never advocated the establishment of independent Bantu states&#x2014; Why does he not tell us that General Hertzog was adamant in his belief that all the non-Whites should have representation in this Chamber? But it is quite clear that this hon. gentleman put his whole philosophy into a nutshell when he framed it this way. He said: &#x201C;Ons hoop al die Nasionaliste sal terugkom na die kraal toe. &#x201D; That is the only place where they can keep them, inside the kraal. The moment people have an opportunity to look outside the kraal, they will not vote for that party any more.</p>

<p>The hon. member also took us to task on the question of morality. I want to ask what morality is there in this situation which is propagated by that side of the House, that three-quarters of the people of South Africa should occupy only 13 per cent of its land area. Is that a moral division? And he asks what we offer the non-white people. Sir, what does this Government offer them? Nothing but empty promises.</p>

<p>But I want to return to certain basic issues raised by my hon. Leader and to which the hon. the Prime Minister has not responded.</p>

<p>No. The hon. member has just had 30 minutes and said nothing of consequence. They are just trying to divert me, Sir, but they will not succeed. What the hon. the Prime Minister has overlooked is that this election to which constant reference has been made, was one of the most important in South Africa&#x2019;s history. What he does not want to accept is that this election demarcates a clear political watershed as far as South Africa is concerned, that it signals the return swing of the pendulum, a swing which they will not be able to arrest. In fact that pendulum is gaining momentum as the bandwagon syndrome begins to show its affects. It is a swing of the pendulum which will ultimately usher in a completely new political era.</p>

<p>There are very many reasons why the Government does not want to take notice of this. To begin with, change is inherent in the democratic model itself. Unless there are cyclical changes of government, all these iniquitous symptoms of arrogance and authoritarianism that we see signs of every day, begin to manifest themselves. In order to have democracy, there must be change of government. If you do not have change of government you are left with a totalitarian r&#x00E9;gime. But the tide is also turning against this Government because all political movements are subject to certain irrevocable political laws. The longer a party remains in power, the more it begins to neglect the interests of the voters. The longer a party remains in power, the more the purpose for which it was put there becomes dissipated, and that is what has happened to this Government. It has become a Government without a mission. Every single one of its tenets to-day has been overtaken by events. Practically every single one of its beliefs have now to be abandoned in the face of reality. Its road is strewn with broken promises, notwithstanding&#x2026; [Interjection.] You can get a chance later on. We want to see that Minister of Tourism in the no-confidence debate, because he has never taken part in one. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all this, this party tries to perpetrate the myth that it has a workable plan for South Africa. The only difference is that there are fewer and fewer of the voters who believe them. Dr. Dennis Worrall did a study recently in which he found that less than 30 per cent of the voters included in his sample believed that the Government was going to grant independence to the black states it was creating. What a shocking indictment of the Government, which has been in power for more than 20 years, when only a third of the people believe that it is either willing or capable of carrying out its stated policy! This is the credibility gap. This is what happened to the Wilson administration in England, and we know the way they went, and this Government will go exactly the same way. This Government is like a stock exchange whose shares have slumped alarmingly. Politically speaking, there is a bear market as far as this Government is concerned, and anybody who has any interest in it should sell his shares immediately in order to have more money so that when there is a take-over they will be able to invest in growth and in stability. More and more people vote against this Government because they can see it leading us into a political and economic cul-de-sac. There is a greater and greater awareness among the voters of South Africa that this Government is not equipped to lead us into the 1970s, into a new technological era. This Government is more and more the past echo, and it is incapable of providing dynamic pointers <span class="col_77-78" refersTo="page_0053"/>and leadership as far as the future is concerned.</p>

<p>Now, it is true that this Government still commands very formidable electoral support, but this we can easily analyse too. For years this Government has capitalized for its own purposes on Afrikaner sentiment, but this is beginning to change because the very nature of Afrikaner sentiment is changing too. All nationalisms run a predetermined course. Afrikaner nationalism started way back as a small stream in the mountains of Afrikaner grievance. It gained momentum as it plunged downwards and it became a mighty torrent. But now that it has reached the lower levels it has become sluggish and it has begun to meander slowly through the lush valleys of achievement and of wealth. But all rivers, Sir, whatever their size, must ultimately meet their own destiny when they are absorbed by something infinitely greater, the sea. And this Nationalist Party is in the same position now, because Afrikaner nationalism has got to the stage of the river delta, where it is entering the ocean of South Africanism, and it will do so through many mouths, some earlier, some later, but all inevitably. But this party which has ridden on the crest of this wave of Afrikaner nationalism all these years, now that this wave has begun to dissipate itself, finds itself floundering in the eddies and the shallows of internal bickering and of squalid squabbles.</p>

<p>But there is a difference, too, in this sense, that the new Afrikaner will not allow a group of ambitious politicians to exploit his sentiment for the purpose of entrenching themselves in power, and this second reason is even more important than the first.</p>

<p>There will be change in government in this country, too, because the Nationalist Party and the Government find themselves in a leadership crisis. Some of the old loyalties are beginning to wear thin and new groupings are continually being crystallised. Albert Hertzog might not be a member of this Chamber any more, but his spirit will continue to haunt the Government for years. The tip of the iceberg might have been broken off, but the iceberg itself is still there, and it is more dangerous than ever before because it is now invisible and cannot be clearly defined. The stability of purpose of a Malan, the political integrity of a Strydom and the deftness of mind of a Verwoerd have disappeared, and this Government now finds itself almost like a storm-battered schooner drifting aimlessly and being pushed hither and thither by alternating gusts of indecision and confusion. Never before in the history of this country have we had a government as confused as this one. Not a day, not a week, passes where Cabinet Ministers do not contradict one another. Two or three years ago the Government came to this House and with very great fanfare told us that it was in the national interest and that it would lead to greater efficiency if the Department of Cultural Affairs were to be separated from the Department of Education. Two weeks ago they came to us and in the same wording they said that it would be in the national interest and would lead to greater efficiency if these two departments were amalgamated. What are they doing? Are they playing a kind of blind man&#x2019;s buff? That is all I can think of it. Tucsa recently wrote a letter to three Government departments to inquire about rail concessions and rail subsidies for non-Whites. They have now exchanged some 30 letters with different Government departments and the whole situation is becoming a kind of Langenhoven farce. There is not a single department that knows what the other one is doing. They are all contradicting one another; if it were not so pathetic one could laugh about it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there will be a change in Government also because the Government has lost its vision. There is none of it left. We heard the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech to-day; there was no substance to it. The paucity of policy had to be camouflaged by the brilliance of our scientists. But to illustrate the Prime Minister&#x2019;s approach to this problem, may I refer to his recent visits overseas, to which he to-day also made reference, because he told us that when he was there he had to address the foreign Press. I understand in Switzerland he invited the foreign Press to come to him because, so he told them, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know what you are writing about; I will tell you what it is all about. &#x201D; One can imagine the scene: Here is the main representative from South Africa ready to make a vital presentation. Here was obviously room for something that had depth and penetration; here was an opportunity for great profoundness of thought, because here was the top man in our country now putting our point of view to the outside world, and that is what he went there for. <i>Die Transvaler,</i> that faithful mentor and mouthpiece of the Government from the Transvaal, gave us an account of it. Its heading is &#x201C;Premier gee skitterende uiteensetting van beleid. &#x201D; Sir, one of the very first questions that they put to him was this: &#x201C;Wat is die verskil tussen &#x2019;n Witman en &#x2019;n Swartman? &#x201D; The Prime Minister replied: &#x201C;Dit is tog eenvoudig. Die een is swart en die ander is wit. &#x201D; I want to be as charitable as I possibly can be when I say that I am sure this is one of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s new jokes, one that he will add to his repertoire of 23 that he told at all the political meetings during this election. But I cannot pass it off as easily as that because the rest of the interview goes on in exactly the same vein. He also talks about the Negroes in America. The question was: &#x201C;Waarom neem Amerika die Neger in sy gemeenskap op? &#x201D; The Prime Minister replied: &#x201C;Die Neger van Amerika en die Swartman van Suid-Afrika kan nie vergelyk word nie. Die Neger het geen taal en kultuur wat hy sy eie kan noem nie. &#x201D; That is precisely the point that I tried to put to the hon. the Prime Minister to-day. If discrimination is justified under conditions where people have a separate language and a separate culture, how then could this be applied to the Coloured people of South Africa? <span class="col_79-80" refersTo="page_0054"/>Are they not in the same boat as us? They have no separate culture and no separate language, and yet they are harried from pillar to post, all for the sake of this unattainable myth that the Government has put before itself. I want to say this, much as I hate to say it: If this is the sort of presentation that the hon. the Prime Minister gives when he goes overseas, then I think it is far better that he should send the editor of <i>Die Burger</i> who has had quite a lot of experience in handling a bad brief.</p>

<p>We are told that there is a manpower crisis in South Africa; we are told that there is an absolute lack of managerial talent; we are told that there are not sufficient high-level skills available in this country. I am quite sure that this is correct and the place where it manifests itself more than anywhere else is in the Government itself. One only has to look at the top echelons of the Government to realize that portion of it is old and tired and a portion of it is young and ignorant and no one has the slightest difficulty in splitting them into either of these two camps. That is why every time the Prime Minister has to do a Cabinet reshuffle we find that it becomes such a half-baked and such a half-hearted affair. He is like a little boy playing the game of snakes and ladders. As you know, when you get a ladder, you go up and when you get a snake, you come down. The trouble with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s board is that it has more snakes than ladders; he never gets off the bottom line.</p>

<p>One could take practically every member of the Cabinet and subject him to some of these tests and one would find that the ineptness, the incompetence, has seldom been equalled in South Africa&#x2019;s history. [Interjections.] Sir, if I were the Minister of Sport I would be the last one to say anything on this matter. I want to pick just one of the hon. Ministers, one who does not seem to be with us at the moment. I am referring here to the Minister of Planning or better the ex-Minister of Planning. We want to have and the country is entitled to have as this House is entitled to have certain information about this ex-Minister of Planning. We want to know why he was given Irish promotion? Why was he relieved of the important portfolio of Planning? Was it because he was incompetent? We suspect that that might be the case. But why leave him in charge of two other Departments if he was incompetent in one? Surely he is also the same in the others. What we want to know is why he was not fully &#x201C;Haaked &#x201D;? Why was he only half-&#x201C;Haaked &#x201D;? Was it due to the fact that he threatened a very prominent industrialist in South Africa&#x2014;surely the worst example of abuse of ministerial power that we have ever had in this country? I would say exactly the same thing if he threatened Mr. Haak or Mr. Jan Marais. If that is the case, why was he not publicly repudiated? Why has he not made a public apology? In any other Government in any other part of the Western world, if a Minister abused his powers to this extent he would have been kicked out; he would have been fully &#x201C;Haaked &#x201D;, but here we still have him in a position of influence. What guarantee do we have that this ex-Minister of Planning will not now as Minister of Mines carry out the threats that he may no longer be able to carry out as Minister of Planning?</p>

<p>If this was not the reason for giving him Irish promotion, was it because his credibility had become an issue? Here we have the unusual situation where a Cabinet Minister at a public meeting indicated that an airport in Malawi was going to be used for South African military purposes. Surely, it was the most undiplomatic statement that an ex-diplomat has ever made. But he was immediately repudiated by everybody under the sun and then he promptly denied having said this. But <i>Die Beeld</i> claims that they have the tape recording. May we now ask the hon. the Prime Minister this: He was so quick in getting enquiries off the ground in other cases; in the Kolver investigation I think it was initiated within 48 hours after the accusation had been made. Is it not a source of concern to him that the credibility of one of his Ministers should now be under a cloud? Why does he not appoint a commission of inquiry in this case? <i>Die Beeld</i> can produce their tapes. They can show what they have. The point is this: It is not just the credibility of a particular individual that we are concerned with, but the veracity of the whole Government.</p>

<p>There is also the other case to which the <i>Sunday Times</i> has given prominence, where the same ex-Minister of Planning claims that he was never a member of the board of a particular company. Yet photostat copies are being produced &#x2026;</p>

<p>Photostat copies were produced which show that he resigned from the board of directors of this company. How can a man deny that he was a member of a board when there is evidence that he had resigned from that board? Mr. Speaker, this particular issue and this Minister have lost the Government very many votes. It will continue to do so because the new South Africans will <span class="col_81-82" refersTo="page_0055"/>not tolerate this situation where the credibility of people in high positions can be questioned in the way in which this Minister&#x2019;s credibility is under question at the moment.</p>

<p>Our greatest complaint against him is not this so much, but the way in which he has implemented and administered the Physical Planning Act. Here is a situation that has done South Africa great harm. I am not talking about the Act itself, Sir, because I know I may not discuss it. I am talking about its implementation. Here we have a highly sensitive economic instrument. We issued dire warnings when it was discussed originally. To leave an instrument of this kind, sensitive as it is, in the hands of a Government as hamhanded as this one, is like putting a bull in charge of a china shop.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, as a result of the administration of this Act, industry is being forced into areas where industry does not enjoy maximum locational advantages, that the cost structure is being pushed up and that we are becoming less and less competitive. It is probably one of the reasons, too, why we have this massive deficit in our Foreign Trade Account. We cannot obtain from this Government precise figures as to its full implications. When questions are put in this House the whole thing is played down very considerably. In November last year when the Secretary for Planning addressed the F.C.I. he told them that only 4,000 jobs which had been requested for Africans had been rejected. This would suggest that its influence is only marginal, but when the Minister of Bantu Administration spoke to the Roodepoort Sakekamer at precisely the same time, in November last year, he had a somewhat different story. He mentioned a figure of 15,000 jobs. Now you will notice that there is already a difference of 300 per cent. It shows you the confusion in the Government. They derived their statistics from exactly the same sources, yet the Minister makes it 15,000. But he went further, Sir. He said that a request for the reclassification of 6,500 morgen of potential industrial land, a request for that land to be zoned as industrial land, had been turned down because of the implementation of this Act. And then, by some strange form of reasoning&#x2014;he is really becoming the chief conjurer of figures in the Government&#x2014;he says: This means that 220.000 jobs for non-Whites which would have been created, had this land been rezoned, were not in fact created. Sir, you know how expansive he can become when he gets around to these figures. He says that if you take into account the dependants of these people, it means that white civilization has been saved because one million non-white people would no longer come in here.</p>

<p>Sir, it is just as well that his alter ego. the over eager sidekick of his, the Deputy Minister, was not around, because he is never one to be left out of these things. He would probably have differentiated immediately between the <i>de facto</i> and the <i>de jure</i> situation. He would have sought to prove that there is not a single African left in any of our factories; that they are all back in the reserves. If we drew attention to this, he would have said that it was merely an economic issue and that, provided the socio-political matters were in order, it was of no consequence. But, Sir, if you find that a number of Africans, to the extent of nearly a quarter million, were kept out of our industrial structure as a result of the implementation of this Act during one year, then it assumes very significant proportions, because in 1968 the total number of Africans in industry was given as 650,000. That means that our potential industrial growth was inhibited by one-third in one year. That is in fact what he was telling us. Is this not what we are also told by the Stellenbosch survey? Do they not indicate that the majority of industrialists wish to expand? 97 per cent of them however say that they cannot do so because of the Government&#x2019;s labour policy. 76 per cent of them mention specifically people of higher skills and 62 per cent of them refer to the implementation of this Physical Planning Act.</p>

<p>There is another way in which one can show what this Act is doing to South Africa. In 1969 private fixed investment in manufacturing industry decreased by 11 per cent. In the previous year, 1968, it decreased by 16.8 per cent. This means that over a period of two years it came down by nearly 27 per cent. However, if we allow for the fact that it should have increased, as was the case over the previous three or four years, by some 15 per cent a year, it means that private fixed investment in the manufacturing industry dropped by nearly 50 per cent over two years. This is economic sabotage of South Africa. This is completely unnecessary. That is why the hon. the Minister of Finance, we are now told, has instituted an inquiry into the working of this Act. Again, to show how confused the Government is, one Minister must now set afoot inquiries to see how other Ministers carry out their duties.</p>

<p>Let me just say that we in the United Party will approach this matter completely differently. We realize that economic growth is essential for our survival. Our salvation lies in economic strength. We will not inhibit economic growth. We say to the industrialists of South Africa: We will give you the tools so that you can do the job. If they can expand and grow, there will be more jobs for all our white workers. Our national income will then increase. and there will be a bigger slice of the cake for everybody. Can you imagine what would have happened if, at the turn of this century, somebody as stupid as this Government had introduced an act of this kind, and had implemented it in this way? Had this been done at the turn of the century, South Africa would have had half the factories it has now. Our national income would have been a fraction of what it is to-day. We would have been a poor and impoverished little state. <span class="col_83-84" refersTo="page_0056"/>We would have been vulnerable to the attentions of all foreign adventurers.</p>

<p>The choice before South Africa in this regard is clear. We can go on as we are to-day, inhibited by a small-minded Government, which is continually introducing controls which are hedging us in all the time, or we can think big. This party will think big. We will step up our growth rate very considerably because we know that it is herein that our salvation lies. This is the choice before the electorate of South Africa. If they go with this Government they will remain small. If they opt for the United Party we will become a great South Africa, a prosperous South Africa, a secure South Africa, a united South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that if the hon. the shadow Minister of Hillbrow were to get on to a soap box in Trafalgar Square, his word-inflation might perhaps impress a few people in his audience. But in this hon. House most of his talent is lost, because sometimes it becomes a little uncalled-for. The hon. member does not only suffer from a swollen head, but also from an over-riding ambition, i.e. to aspire to the crown of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. In that process he positively indulges in word-inflation and in reprehensible expressions aimed at this side. I do not want to go any further into what the hon. member had to say. I think that members of this House can judge for themselves. The refrain that the hon. member repeated time and again, sounded like a day dream to me: &#x201C;There will be a change of Government. &#x201D; The hon. member consoles himself with the thought that it is a law of democracy that at some time or other, even though it might take a hundred years, a change of government must take place. That a party, which is sitting in the Opposition benches and which has been bold enough to move a motion of censure in the Government after a general election, can say here that a change of government must take place because it is a law of democracy, merely goes to prove how absolutely bankrupt they are as regards policy and a positive approach for solving of the problems of this country.</p>

<p>If, over the past three months, one had read the newspapers and looked at the statements that were issued by the hon. member for Hillbrow in particular, but also at those that were issued by the General Secretary of the United Party, one would have seen how presumptuous their attitude is. The statement that the Prime Minister may not address the people over the radio without the Leader of the Opposition also being given an opportunity to do so, is presumptuous. If one has read the newspapers and if one has listened to their speakers here to-day, one has to take a really good look to see what has happened to the people who have been talking in such a swaggering and boastful manner. Then one sees that it is merely the U.P. members here in their little corner. They are still merely sitting there in their little corner. One finds this hard to believe, and then one looks at this side again; then one thinks of the history of these people. Before laughing at them and judging them too harshly, one realizes that these people have a long history. For 22 years they have been wandering in the desert without ever having reached a single oasis. Mr. Speaker, you will be able to correct me if I am wrong, but I think that in Biblical times, when the people of Israel were wandering about in the desert, they did at least reach a little oasis every year or two. But these poor people had to wander about for 22 years before eventually reaching an oasis on 22nd April. Can one not perhaps forgive them their delusions of grandeur and judge them a little less harshly if one considers that they wandered about in hunger and thirst for such a long time, and that like the ancient people of Israel they had to start out on their wanderings because they did not have the courage, the pluck and the drive to tackle the problems of this country in a positive manner? After 22 years they still do not have the courage and the pluck to-day to get up here and to state to the country and to this Government an alternative policy which would solve the problems of this country effectively. No, they are only being negative, destructive. Can we then judge them too harshly for thinking they were in the land of Canaan when they reached their little oasis on 22nd April. For these two months they have been sitting at this oasis and thinking they had arrived in the Promised Land. To-day they have to start out again on their desert road. From now on things will no longer be so easy. If they do not learn that they should tackle the problems of this country in a positive way and that they should not try to take over the reins of government by way of scandal-mongering and disparaging statements, they will wander about for another 40 years or more. Then we also have the hopes and the expectations of the hon. member for Hillbrow and of the hon. member for Wynberg, who also wrote in the newspaper recently that it was a law of democracy that at some time or other a change of government had to take place. If they are living on that hope, they will still be wandering about for more than 40 years without reaching the Promised Land.</p>

<p>I shall come to that hon. member in a moment. During the past election the United Party succeeded in winning a few seats from this party for the first time in 27 years or 30 years. Now I must say that they are actually traditional U.P. seats which belonged to them previously, but in 1966 they were so wretched that we took those seats from them. If they could not shake off that wretchedness, democracy in this country would have been in real danger. It was in fact <span class="col_85-86" refersTo="page_0057"/>the National Party&#x2019;s dilemma that our democracy was in danger because the Opposition had crumbled, and for that reason it has, after all, been to the advantage of the image of this country and of the democratic institution that they have temporarily been able to gain a few seats. They regained those seats from us while we were not engaged in fighting against them. We were not fighting against them. It actually happened behind our backs. We were fighting an extremely harmful political movement which could have done this country and its human relations a great deal of harm. The Leader of this party had the courage and the conviction to say that this movement, although it was comprised of ex-colleagues and friends, had to be destroyed. We had the courage and the conviction to do this. Meanwhile, during that process, the United Party succeeded in gaining a few seats behind our backs. We succeeded in our primary task. I want to associate myself with what the hon. the Prime Minister said, for when we were fighting these people who had taken an extremely dangerous political course, this party, which professes to be the party pre-eminently looking after the interests of the English-speaking people in this country &#x2026;</p>

<p>It is. Then they became exceedingly friendly with the Hertzog people and co-operated with them. Not once, neither before nor after the election, has the Leader of the United Party or any of his lieutenants stood up in this House and repudiated the Hertzog Party. They have not done so once. I challenge them to prove to me that they have done so. They have not done so to date. To my mind this is reprehensible political opportunism unworthy of an official opposition.</p>

<p>While we were engaged in a primary task, i.e. to try to destroy a dangerous political movement, these gentlemen were engaged in scandal-mongering and doing destructive things. Actually, they had a task as well. They, as a responsible Opposition, actually had an important task as well. Just as we had an important task to the right, they had an important task to the left. The hon. member for South Coast knows that the dangerous political trend of the Progressive Party is just as harmful to this country. Actually, it was their task to expose and destroy these people, but they failed hopelessly in that primary task of theirs, so much so that it was possible for the hon. member for Houghton to treble her majority, that they nearly lost in Sea Point and Parktown. and that it was possible for the Progressive Party to gain a considerable number of voters. Whereas we succeeded 100 per cent in our primary task, they failed 100 per cent in theirs. They evaded this issue, not only because of their political opportunism, but also because of the fact that they have an impossible composition. Whereas we on this side of the House are sitting here as people who are as one at heart, in mind and in being, they on that side of the House are sitting there as a divided party; they are sitting there with their original verkramptes and their ultra-liberals. They cannot prejudice either of the two elements in their party too much, for then they would split in two. This is true; we know what we are talking about. When they speak at Upington, Vryburg or Kimberley they say that the Government is negrophilistic. Then they say that the Government is giving too much money to the Bantu and doing too much for the Bantu. This is true. The hon. the Opposition cannot dispute this, because this is what they said there. But if they speak at Houghton or at Parktown, they come up with a different story. Then they plead for equal opportunities for White and Black in this country. That is why I say that their composition is such that they could not carry out their primary task. It makes them as a party quite unsuitable for taking over the government of the country. They need not even consider being prepared to take over the government, as the hon. Secretary of their party said. Oh, well, one will just have to accept it with a little humour. This, then, is the enormous dilemma of the United Party to-day, i.e. its composition of verkramptes and liberals. With this composition the United Party now has to try to win the next election. Because this is its composition, the United Party did not fight the past election by pitting policy against policy.</p>

<p>No, at one meeting after the other one looked for a positive statement on policy by one of the leaders of the United Party, but one did not find it. Over there we have the United Party&#x2019;s future Cape leader, the shadow Minister of Agriculture and Coloured Affairs. If one could have expected a statement on policy by one of the United Party people, one would probably have expected him to state the policy. But he was one of the worst creators of unrest, one of those who insinuated misconduct on the part of the Government, and one of the scandal-mongers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a pity that our politics should have reached such a low-water mark. It is a pity that in this country, which offers so many dynamic challenges to its rulers, the Opposition has not succeeded in sharpening wits against wits by pitting argument against argument so that the real problems of this country may be thrashed out and be laid before the electorate of this country. I think it is primarily the task of the Opposition to do so.</p>

<p>I am coming to the policy. When we come to the major problems of this country, our relations problems. our population problems, we get from the Opposition vague, general statements which <span class="col_87-88" refersTo="page_0058"/>they themselves do not really understand and which nobody really understands. So often in the past the United Party has come up with a slogan thinking, &#x201C;Now we have something. &#x201D; Then they got carried away by that slogan, hoping that by using it they would be able to bring about the downfall of the Government and sow distrust amongst the people. In the same way they have now come up with a slogan again. What did the United Party and its newspapers say in 1948 when this party came into power? They said that a racial war would break out in this country; that the banks would close down; that the people would emigrate from South Africa in their thousands; that there would be stagnation in the economic sphere; that a cultural war would ensure between the Afrikaans-speaking section and the English-speaking section. That was not so long ago. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said to-day that we should forget the past and think about the future. It suits the United Party to forget the past. It suits the United Party that this book be closed never to be opened again, but we should take from the past what is good and build on it for the future. It is a good thing to see in what respects the United Party sometimes went completely astray in the past. In 1948 they suggested to the people of South Africa that there would be a total collapse in the economic and political spheres. What happened? In the 22 years since 1948 South Africa has experienced one of the most wonderful periods of economic revival in the world.</p>

<p>This Government, which came into power in 1948, has indeed made South Africa a great country. It has made South Africa a great country of which the United Party has no understanding to-day. If South Africa should be struck by the disaster of their coming into power, they would be quite unequal to the task of taking over the lead, because they are still living in 1947. They have not kept up with us. This has become a great country and they and their children have shared in the advantages of this process. Some of them have become rich and have been enriched economically and industrially as a result of the prosperity which the National Party Government has brought to this country. They have been sharing in that prosperity. To-day they say that this party will bring disaster to this country. In 1960, after Sharpeville, the refrain of prophets of doom was heard again. What was the result? Since 1960 South Africa has become the most fantastic and most sensational success story of the whole free world. Since 1960 the number of immigrants from Europe increased more than fivefold, with a record total of 48,000 in 1966. Imports and exports increased by 45 per cent. Foreign capital investments increased by more than R400 million. The creation of new capital reached the impressive figure of 24 per cent of the national product, and the national product itself increased by 64 per cent. This is what happened after those people had said that this was the end of South Africa and that we would collapse economically. In spite of what they had said, South Africa became the most fantastic success story of the world. To-day they say that South Africa is heading for disaster as a result of the fact that apartheid has failed and cannot be proceeded with. Will the people believe them now? The people did not believe them 22 years ago; nor did they do so ten years ago. They will not believe them now either. But because this party believes that it has a calling in this country, it will not be put off by such scare stories. The National Party feels called upon to unravel the intricate population problems of this country, where they have become entangled as a result of being under colonial r&#x00E9;gime for 300 years. This is no easy task. If hon. members on that side of the House were to say today that apartheid has failed, I would tell them they are behind the times. We are not at apartheid any more. We have already passed apartheid on the road of development.</p>
