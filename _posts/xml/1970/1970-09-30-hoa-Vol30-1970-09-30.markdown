<p>When the House adjourned last night I was referring to certain questions which the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs put to the hon. member for Orange Grove as a result of which the <i>Financial Mail</i> put a series of questions to the United Party, questions that penetrate to the core of the United Party&#x2019;s labour policy. For the purposes of the record I want to quote this series of questions in full, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Would the U.P. to use one of Van Rensburg&#x2019;s examples, in fact employ non-Whites to serve Whites as counterhands and telephonists and as technicians provided they were trained; if not, why not&#x003F; How would it counter white employee resistance to such a move&#x003F; More generally, would it spend a bigger proportion of State revenue on nonwhite education and technical training in the urban areas than the present Government does&#x003F; If so, how much bigger&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Would it allow and encourage private industry in established industrial areas to employ African electricians, motor mechanics, fitters and turners&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Would it amend the Bantu Building Workers Act to allow Africans to be employed as bricklayers and painters and to do other <span class="col_5341-5342" refersTo="page_1228"/>skilled work in the building industry in the so-called white urban areas&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Would it abolish section 77 (work reservation) of the Industrial Conciliation Act&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Would it extend the general application of this Act to African workers&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Would it scrap section 3 of the Physical Planning Act&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Would a U.P. Government amend the Apprenticeship Act to make it easier for Africans to qualify for artisan status&#x003F;</block>

<p>May I ask you a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, no&#x2014; because I am afraid that the hon. member&#x2019;s question would be of the same calibre as his approach to our labour problem. The <i>Financial Mail,</i> of course, is not favourably disposed to this side of the House, and yet it is this journal which, at the end of this Parliamentary Session, has still not been able to get any reply to these questions from the United Party. Referring to the debate in which the hon. member for Orange Grove was involved, the <i>Financial Mail</i> continues by stating&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was another occasion where the U.P. displayed a dismaying lack of courage.</block>

<p>This comes from the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 14th August of this year. [Interjections.] Yesterday the hon. member for Orange Grove had a question on the Order Paper in connection with sauna baths. I have a suspicion that the question concerned the high temperature to which a person is exposed in a sauna bath. We also know that when one develops a high temperature one can sometimes avoid awkward questions. It therefore does not surprise me that the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2019;s interest lies in that direction.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point tried to raise a smoke screen in order to mislead us. But we shall now allow ourselves to be mislead. I should like to deal briefly with a few points he mentioned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>In the light of the high opinion the hon. member has of our judicature, I want to refer him to what the Prime Minister said on 14th September of this year in the House of Assembly (Hansard, column 4130)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now I want to say something, and I do not say it because it is I who say so, but because it is a senior advocate, a Judge at present, who said so. He appeared in this case for the defendants. Having investigated the case, that advocate as well as the junior, who is a senior at present, arrived at the conclusion that there was no case against Dr. De Wet at all, and that he had never been a director of that company.</block>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Since the hon. member for Sea Point has suoh a high opinion of our legal men, I want to conclude this matter with this quote. [Interjections.] The hon. member also referred to the Senate and to South-West. He put me in mind of an English expression, an expression which, out of respect for this House, I want to furnish in its translated Afrikaans form: &#x201C;Die onwyse snel d&#x00E1;&#x00E1;rheen waar selfs engele huile nie sal begeef nie.&#x201D; (Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.) And so saying I want to dismiss these two matters. [Interjections.] As far as the United Party is concerned, during the Second Reading and the Committee Stage of this Bill they had the opportunity of calling the National Government and its Ministers to account. They had opportunities throughout to ask questions, and their questions were dealt with courteously and answered properly. But now in the Third Reading we have an opportunity of looking at the United Party, and as the Official Opposition in this country I think the United Party should welcome this opportunity. It is the responsibility of the Opposition to come under the magnifying glass from time to time, because they aspire to take over the Government. It is only fair to the voters that they should eagerly seize every opportunity to undergo that test. There are a number of conditions I want to put to the <span class="col_5343-5344" refersTo="page_1229"/>Opposition before they can act as an aspiring alternative Government. I say only aspire to rule, because up to now their achievements have in no way been suoh that they can be considered as the alternative Government.</p>

<p>The entire debate in the first phase of the Second Reading dealt with the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s judgment concerning inflation. This side of the House through the mouth of the Minister of Finance, said that inflation developed as a result of the consumer demand for goods. The proposition from that side of the House was just the opposite. The whole question now is whether the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s judgment was correct. I want to tell you, Sir, that his judgment was correct, because two-thirds of our total consumer spending is related to goods; 51 per cent of the average family&#x2019;s income, after taxation, is spent on consumer goods, while 19 per cent is devoted to sport and recreation, etc. But those hon. members thought fit to reproach and to recriminate the hon. the Minister for a wrong judgment in this instance. In a moment I shall come to what they tried to do in this connection. The question is whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s judgment was correct. In the middle of August he delivered his speech in this House, and he announced certain measures whereby money would be taken out of the consumer&#x2019;s pocket. The question is whether he has succeeded in cooling the economy down, in taking money out of the hands of the consumer or at least developing in him a nonspending attitude&#x003F; The hon. members said no; let him look at the cost pressure; let him look at the inflation being caused by the labour shortage. I want to re-emphasize this. I have here the consumer index that has just come to hand, dated 25th September, 1970. I think those hon. members, specifically the hon. member for Parktown, will agree that this is the first indication of whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s judgment was correct or not. We make the following comparison. For Cape Town the consumer price index for August, 1970, was 101.6, and for July it was 101.1, an increase, therefore, of .5 on the previous month, but in July there was an increase of 2.3. Port Elizabeth is the exception. There the increase is 1.4, as against .8 the previous month, but all the other large centres of this country evidenced a considerable decrease in the upswing of the consumer price index. This supports the fact that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s judgment was correct, and it supports the fact that the judgment of that side of the House is to be doubted. Sir, I want to take a further look at that and state that their solution to this question of inflation was a Trojan horse. They saw in this an opportunity for the opportunistic infiltration of their philosophy into our economy, the philosophy of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;. That is what they saw their way clear to doing, and what they tried to bring about. Long before the time they tried to bring about a psychosis. That was a standpoint they adopted before the Minister of Finance delivered his Budget speech in this House; they were then already regimented into doing it. No one other than the hon. member for Hillbrow regimented them into doing it, and if he is not the one, he must tell me if he has anything to do with the United Party&#x2019;s information service.</p>

<p>He has nothing to do with it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have here some United Party information documents. The one is dated 25th January, 1968, and it deals with labour. But the most interesting one is this one dated 4th December, 1969, which states: &#x201C;Warning to workers and employers&#x201D;. It is a bulky document. The interesting point here is that this document contains references that were used in most of the speeches of hon. members opposite to prove that the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s judgment was incorrect. In other words, they came along to this House with a preconceived purpose of using the Trojan horse, cost inflation, as a means of bringing the Government and the country under the impression that a labour crisis had, in fact, developed. Sir, what a pathetic display they gave. They could not keep up this display for an unspecified time. Here is a scientific item in the <i>Sunday Times&#x2019;</i> Financial supplement &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Do you believe the <i>Sunday Times</i>&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ooetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. OOETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Rising wages do not cause inflation.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Sir, how the hon. members on that side are protesting against the <i>Sunday Times</i>! It is a complicated item: I think a few members on that side of the House will perhaps understand it. But the conclusion to which the writer comes is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is involved is a fallacy of composition. Any one person may be able to leave a crowded theatre in two minutes without difficulty &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is ridiculing that side&#x2019;s standpoint. They could not for long keep up the debate about the so-called crisis that was at hand. In the <i>Cape Argus</i> of Saturday, 26th September, the following caption appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Highest average dividend yield for eight years.</block>

<p>It refers to companies that should have been hit by the so-called labour shortage. I have here the short-term index that does, admittedly, indicate a slight level tendency, but it is extremely slight by comparison with the sustained growth tendency over the past years.</p>

<p>What can hon. members on that side range against the facts of the matter&#x003F; What defence <span class="col_5345-5346" refersTo="page_1230"/>can they bring to bear if the hon. the leader of the Opposition, when the Budget is about to be submitted, argues that only the party that can bring about a change in the labour pattern of this country has a long-term future&#x003F; That was round about the time the Budget was delivered. That is why I say that it was their preconceived purpose to create a psychosis. The Opposition failed lamentably in their purpose. But that is not all. There are a number of other conditions the Hon. Opposition must comply with before they qualify as an alternative Government. In the first place there must consequently be no doubt about the U.P.&#x2019;s policy. The voters must not for a single moment have any doubts about the consequences of the Opposition&#x2019;s policy. The voters must have no doubts about the aims of that policy. Throughout this entire Session not a single member on that side of the House has devoted half an hour to speaking about the United Party&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>In the second place, the Opposition must give a clear exposition of its philosophy. The hon. the Prime Minister directed a challenge at the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in connection with the philosophy of the U.P.&#x2019;s policy. What did we get&#x003F; Up to the present day we have got nothing. One would have expected that with the Klip River by-election &#x2014;and now the hon. member for Durban (Point) can join in the conversation&#x2014;they would have had an opportunity to state their policy. Unfortunately the hon. member for Wynberg is not here now. At one meeting after another they argued from the wrong corners. They base their arguments on incorrect premises. They base their arguments on standpoints that are allegedly those of the National Party but in fact are not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That is untrue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>I was there. I now want to say why it is true. And I put it to hon. members on this side of the House who attended those meetings. At Colenso the hon. member for Wynberg made certain statements in connection with the Liquor Act and the South African Police. When we pointed out her mistakes to her, she did not accept it. But at Bergville she apologized to us. She then said that she is an honest politician by way of exception. She apologized to us. However, as shadow Minister of National Education she must still come along and explain to this House what sections of certain Acts and what Acts she will repeal. Here I refer to that famous letter of hers that appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i> in February of last year. Hon. members on that side of the House are aware of this problem. Hon. members must not hesitate to answer questions.</p>

<p>In the third place the hon. Opposition must not differ among themselves on cardinal issues. During this Session we once again saw the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout differing among themselves. We thus found the hon. member for South Coast differing essentially from other members on that side of the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Prove it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>It has been proved over and over again.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand&#x2014;and I request his attention&#x2014;made a speech here. I want to put it to that hon. member that his statement also differed essentially from the United Party&#x2019;s long-term object. In Hansard, Col. 287, he states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An exclusively white State if attainable under reasonable conditions, would, I believe, be almost universally accepted.</block>

<p>I now want to ask the hon. member what he had in mind when he said that&#x003F; Did he have in mind a State in which the Whites retain political authority, or a State in which their numbers prevail&#x003F; The hon. member may give us a reply at a later stage. Was it numbers the hon. member had in mind, or was it political authority&#x003F; If the hon. member had numbers in mind, does this mean that he will throw political authority overboard as soon as there are one or two or a thousand or five thousand or a million more non-Whites or Blacks than Whites&#x003F; Is that what the hon. member meant&#x003F; If that was what he was saying he fits in completely with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I refer him to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s Hansard of 18th May, 1959 (Col. 6038), where he stated the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and it should be remembered also that as the standard of civilization of a community is raised, leadership will depend to an increasing degree upon numbers.</block>

<p>These hon. members were very concerned about the statistics, not about what it would mean to us. because we say that it is political authority that counts, but on that side of the House the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says definitely that leadership depends on numbers. Numbers are therefore at the basis of their philosophy.</p>

<p>But I have just told the hon. member. However, that is not all, but now that side of the House argues as if numbers are fundamental to the policy of this side of the House. The hon. member for Maitland is unfortunately not present, but when he spoke during the debate on the Bantu Administration and Development Vote, he spoke of the old Bantustan policy that allegedly had numbers as its point of departure. That was his argument. He supported the hon. member for Zululand in that. That is so, is it not&#x003F; The hon. member for Zululand does not want to reply now, but he supported him. My final point is that the hon. Opposition does not understand the policy of this side of the House. When they present it to the voters, they present it as a distortion.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has been listening to discussions about that for more than 300 hours now I shall make a final statement. I presume the hon. member for Zululand contradicted himself in a moment of weakness when he said that an exclusive white State, would, in fact, be the ideal. We should like to have his reply to that.</p>

<p>An Opposition must oppose, we realize that. It must oppose in such a way that it can bluff the voters, if it does not agree with them. There are, however, certain priorities that must be determined. One of those priorities is the question of where South Africa&#x2019;s interests lie. We take it that we shall be occupying the last trench side by side with the United Party, in a physical sense of the word, but what about the economic trench&#x003F; There could also be such a last trench. A week or so ago the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> very clearly pointed the way in a leading article to both the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Progressive Party. This is what was said: The policy of separate development of this side of the House contains so much of value to South Africa on a short-term as well as on a long-term basis, that it can only be in the interests of our community if that side of the House throws in its lot with us.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have had considerable difficulty in following the thread of the hon. member for Bloemfontein (West&#x2019;s) speech, because he seemed to jump from one subject to another without their being necessarily connected with each other. I would like to ask him straightaway does he identify himself with the questions put by the <i>Financial Mail&#x003F;</i> It is extraordinary that this gentleman should get up and read out these questions if he does not identify himself with them.

<p>Yes, I want to know why he put such questions if he knows how stupid they are. He asks whether we are prepared to repeal section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act.

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has been told on many occasions what we will substitute for section 77. We will substitute far greater protection for the white worker than he has at present. [Interjections.] The hon. member wants to know whether we will repeal section 3 of the Physical Planning Act. He knows that we have undertaken on many occasions to repeal that section of the Act. He starts off by asking:</p>

<block name="quote">Will the United Party, to use one of Van Rensburg&#x2019;s examples, in fact employ non-Whites to serve Whites as counterhands, telephonists and as technicians, provided they were trained; if not, why not&#x003F;</block>

<p>Let me tell the hon. gentleman that the answer sent to the <i>Financial Mail</i> was the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, with the agreement of the Post Office associations concerned. One can be certain that an agreement with the staff associations will ensure that South African conventions concerning social separation betweeen the races and the provision of separate amenities for them all will be observed. Mr. Van Rensburg&#x2019;s question was a silly one, and it surprises us that it afforded the <i>Financial Mail</i> so much delight.</block>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I might say the member for Bloemfontein (West) as well. The Minister&#x2019;s problem was whether we would allow non-Whites to serve Whites in the Post Office. We have difficulty in understanding the Minister. In every departmental store and tearoom and at every petrol station throughout South Africa non-Whites serve Whites. How can it be such a dreadful challenge to the United Party to ask whether we approve of something whioh is commonplace throughout South Africa&#x003F; I leave the hon. member there and I suggest that he invests another 30 cents on Friday and reads the <i>Financial Mail,</i> and he will find all the answers there.</p>

<p>During the discussion of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote the hon. the Prime Minister put a pertinent question to me concerning something said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout <span class="col_5349-5350" refersTo="page_1232"/>about delimitation and the loading and unloading of seats. As I understand the situation, the hon. member has pleaded for greater equality between the values of votes in South Africa. He has made a study of this matter. He has studied various constitutions throughout the world as well as their systems. He has expressed a view of his own, to which he is perfectly entitled. The hon. the Prime Minister allows even a Minister to speak about a Colouredstan.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman has no quarrel. Well, Sir, I would say that he has certain very interesting suggestions which will be studied in due course. I feel then that perhaps the time may come when we shall proceed, as we have traditionally done in respect of any changes to the electoral law, namely to refer them to a Select Committee, where we try to hammer them out and work on the basis that we try to obtain unanimity on the subject. I believe that that is the right way to tackle problems of this kind.</p>

<p>We have had an interesting session, which started with the Government trying to explain away its setbacks in the General Election. We have the Prime Minister on record as having said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Ek en elke lid van hierdie Regering sal moet sorg dra dat administratiewe foute wat in die verlede begaan is, nie herhaal word nie. Sekere opknappingswerk sal gedoen moet word.</block>

<p>We were particularly interested in this &#x201C;opknappingswerk&#x201D;, because during the election we had raised certain very important issues. We had hoped that progress would be made in dealing with those issues. They were the failure of the Government&#x2019;s non-European policy, the failure of the Government to cope adequately with the manpower problem in South Africa, the neglect of the Government of the economic interests of the ordinary man in the street, the failure of the Government to play its proper part in combating the problems of the agricultural community, the failure of the Government to promote real national unity in South Africa, and the alarming authoritarian tendencies revealed by this Government. As I have said, we were interested in this &#x201C;opknappingswerk&#x201D;. We were interested indeed, not only in the country&#x2019;s interests, but also because in the coming provincial elections the people of South Africa will have to decide whether there was improvement, whether that improvement was adequate or whether the Government needed further chastisement as a final prelude to expulsion from office. Do not let us delude ourselves. The provincial elections, although they are fought to some extent on provincial issues, are decided almost entirely on national issues.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am most happy, Sir. They are aspects of the national drama much more than provincial conflicts, as the hon. the Prime Minister knows. Of course, we were prepared to be patient, because we have good reason to believe that this Government have grown so out of touch with the people that it now lacks the understanding and the insight necessary to initiate the reforms which are needed to restore good government to the country. I want to go further this afternoon. I want to say that even if this Government wanted to initiate reforms, it would find it difficult to do so. The fact is that under this Government the machine has become cumbersome and unmanageable. I believe that the machine has grown too big. The Government is spending too high a proportion of the country&#x2019;s money. Proportionately it is employing too many of the country&#x2019;s people. It is doing too much business in competition with its own citizens. It is laying down the law too much by way of legislation. There is too much administrative red tape and too many proclamations. It interferes too much with people&#x2019;s daily life. Almost every department of its administration is proliferating and spreading like a noxious weed into the business of the people. Government monopolistic control and administration is notoriously not subject to the same competitive correctives that sharpen the efficiency of private enterprise. In the very nature of things a bloated government must result in inefficiency and mounting costs.</p>

<p>Let us look at the telephone service as just one example. There was a time when the cost of transferring an exchange line outside was about R3. Now I believe it is R20. Let us look at the installation charges of an exchange line. There was a time when only a nominal deposit was required. Now the fee is also about R20. In fact, the costs involved are becoming so high that one must conclude that the Government wants to deter people from becoming its customers and from acquiring a service which normally would increase the income of the Post Office.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the situation is the vast network of laws which the Government has enacted to support every detail of its race policy. This is a network which must inevitably lead to delays, to higher costs, which admits abuse and which encourages corruption. Tn short, administrative vested interests have been built up over the years which are not only clogging the efficient working of this Government&#x2019;s machine, but which also seems to be effectively preventing reform. I believe that this is inevitable when you have a government which is essentially incompetent and which has been kept in power too long <span class="col_5351-5352" refersTo="page_1233"/>by the exploitation of artificial issues. I believe that there is a great deal of truth in what Professor Ben Roux said recently. Writing in <i>New Nation,</i> he said:</p>

<block name="quote">It is an open question in my mind whether the Nationalist Party can afford to destroy on a large scale the vested interests which reform requires. I think a new party would be in a much better position because it would not be tied to old buddies and vested interests.</block>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the country has just had an opportunity, and it is going to have another opportunity in October. I want to say that since the election we have waited in vain for any sign that the Prime Minister can implement his promise to bring about &#x201C;opknapping&#x201D; in the administration of the country. There are the same old shortages. There are the same old bottlenecks. There are the same old excuses. There are the same old platitudes. There is the same old rake&#x2019;s progress and precious little gets done.</p>

<p>The Government itself is of course the main sinner. We tested it out during the session on the vitally important manpower issue. This is an issue from which problems are arising, which are not only well-known but are becoming more serious daily. We left no doubt in anybody&#x2019;s mind what we wanted. We wanted better training, better use of white and non-white manpower, which is available to us. We wanted to see a higher growth rate. We wanted to see better living standards for everyone. We wanted greater economic strength and greater security for South Africa. What did we find on the Government&#x2019;s side&#x003F; We found no properly formulated plan to deal with the situation. We found a lot of talk about controlled employment of non-Whites, but no indication of the principles upon which the control would be applied. We found a government, which is afraid of non-white unemployment, wedded to policies which make such unemployment inevitable and which must lead to the paradox of a growing scarcity of white labour, accompanied by a surplus of black labour. The hon. the Prime Minister will be aware of the figures given by Professor Reynders at the recent Sabra conference on his expectation as to black unemployment in the few years lying ahead. We found Ministers contradicting each other on important issues. The outstanding example of which was when the Minister of Finance invited industrialists to enter into a dialogue with him as to the use of non-white labour in white areas. Ministers differed as to the meaning of the word &#x201C;non-white&#x201D;, whether it did or did not include Bantu labour. The Ministers of Labour and Bantu Administration were adamant that the term did not include Bantu. The Minister of Finance maintained an embarrassed silence. The hon. the Prime Minister in his dialogue with me seemed to support the view that he was not excluding Bantu. Indeed, the Prime Minister must have realized that, if Bantu were not included, the important suggestion of the Minister of Finance became meaningless.</p>

<p>Another example of confusion in Cabinet ranks concerns the statement by the Minister of Labour that it was still his policy that the number of black workers in white areas should be reduced. It was inherent in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement to me that they would increase, even if it was only to the extent that much of the natural increase of the Bantu in the white areas would remain and eventually be employed there. What was even worse than this confusion, was the admission by the hon. the Prime Minister that the employment of Whites was increasing at a rate more rapid than that at which the white population was increasing. He said that the facts told us that between 1963 and 1967 the number of Whites in the labour market increased by 200,000 persons, which is 33,000 per year. That represents a growth of 2.7 per cent of the white labour force, which is much higher than the natural growth of the white population. Obviously, this state of affairs must lead to a situation where our white population will become so extended, that it will be quite incapable of filling the gap in our economic ranks. Then the crisis will indeed be upon us with overwhelming force.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>What I say is that it will be with us then with an overwhelming force. Yet the Prime Minister gives us no indication at all of how he is going to deal with that problem. He said that the Government would train as many people as they can to the highest level and try to increase productivity at every level.</p>

<p>He said firmly that trade unions would be consulted about any changes to be effected. He boasted, Sir, that one out of 50 of our Whites went to university. However, he did not say that the Whites in South Africa would virtually have to provide the sooial and economic leadership for our entire population of more than 20 million people. If one looks at the figure of our entire population, then it is only one out of 200 now that goes to university&#x2014;a proportion so inadequate that our White people are going to be subjected to a strain which they just cannot bear indefinitely. Furthermore, the hon. gentleman boasted that from 1963 to 1969 the number of Whites in employment increased by 200,000, but he did not mention that the demand greatly exceeded the supply. He further told us that during these same six years 700,000 non-Whites were absorbed by the labour market. Well, the ratio between Whites and non-Whites taken up in <span class="col_5353-5354" refersTo="page_1234"/>employment differs from the population ratio and simply cannot be maintained. The Prime Minister has no suggestions for the necessary adjustment in our labour pattern, adjustments which inevitably have to be made. In fact, he did not deal at all with the growing shortages of skilled and semi-skilled labour forecast by the experts. I say once more that although he says that he fears non-White unemployment, he seems to be unaware of the fact that experts see that unemployment just round the corner. The Prime Minister tried to persuade us that the Planning Act was more honoured in the breach than in its observance. But nevertheless he told us that it would remain on the Statute Book&#x2014;the biggest single handicap to expansion in South Africa at the present time. Our entrepreneurs are virtually unanimous in saying that because of the uncertainty the Act has created, investors are becoming nervous while the rate of investment in the manufacturing industry is actually declining. The hon. the Prime Minister tries to justify this aspect of Government policy on the basis that he is afraid of the clogging up of the big cities. This may be a rational fear but then it need not lead to irrational actions. Planning for the future does not mean that you must now strangle the natural growth points on which South Africa&#x2019;s prosperity must rest. One can plan positively for growth, as the United Party did with its own Planning Act&#x2014;the Natural Resources Development Act, 1947&#x2014;without committing injustices to our existing cities. If the Government wants to succeed with its plans for the decentralization of industries and for the development of the reserves, it would be wise to encourage and stimulate activities in these industrial area. These are the economic dynamos to generate the wealth which we need to solve our racial and social problems. I believe the failure of the Government in respect of its planning to deal with our manpower problem has already led to increased inflation as our production lags behind the buying power of our people.</p>

<p>In a futile attempt to avert this the Government has lately been allowing imports on a scale which is, I believe, almost beyond our means. We find that the gap in our balance of payments is becoming very large&#x2014;to the order of R618 million at the present time. Our gold production amounts to R800 million to cover that. But our gold production may fall and with that that gap can only be filled by greater production for export and for internal consumption, a greater production which is being inhibited by the Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of the supply of labour and the uncertainties it has given rise to. I do not believe that the inducements to export contained in the present Budget are going to do much to improve the situation. Unless the Government takes adequate action to meet the problem the result is going to be inflation so spectacular that it could be described as official theft of the purchasing power of the people&#x2019;s money to bring this into closer relation with the volume of goods legitimately available in South Africa I believe the Government&#x2019;s advisers are obviously aware of these dangers but the Government is not seeking to remedy them by increasing production adequately. Instead, it is seeking to limit the amount of money in the hands of the people both by increasing taxation and by the imposition of compulsory loans and other fiscal measures. The success of these measures is, to say the least, doubtful and so the problems will remain with us. In the absence of more reasonable Government action to increase production we can only expect more severe budgetary measures next year. Here I want to reiterate and reinforce the warning uttered by the hon. member for Parktown yesterday&#x2014;that if things go on as they are we have to expect a tough Budget next year as a result of the lack of planning on the part of this Government.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not running away. I am warning the people that one of the direct results of this Budget is going to be a harsh Budget next year. I believe it should have been a harsh Budget this year&#x2014; indeed, it would have been a harsh Budget this year were there no provincial elections in the offing. The Government&#x2019;s failure to cope with this problem has led to repercussions in a variety of spheres. One is in respect of housing, a question which has already been dealt with most eloquently by the hon. member for Green Point. This matter is particularly hard on young married couples who are beginning to accept adult responsibility in our society. At present prices the majority of them just cannot afford their own home. And, what is more, the position is getting worse by the day because theirs is the direct responsibility for the nation&#x2019;s children for whom flat dwellings are not suitable. Architects in Cape Town tell me that building costs in this area have gone up by as much as 20 per cent in the last year alone. And they are still going up. This then is just another example of the lack of <span class="col_5355-5356" refersTo="page_1235"/>planning on the part of the Government for which the young South African family is suffering.</p>

<p>Taking a more long term view, there is an even more serious consequence of the Government&#x2019;s inability to get to grips with our problems. I refer to the artificial limitation being placed on our economic growth rate by the Government&#x2019;s ideology, by its attempt to bend our economy almost to breaking point in order to serve the Bantustan concept. I wonder how many more times I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that our growth rate is nothing extraordinary, nothing unusual. Does the hon. the Prime Minister realize yet that the Common Market as a whole during the past decade has developed just as fast as South Africa and the United States only slightly less fast&#x003F; With their populations increasing more slowly than ours, their rate of growth and standards of living are improving faster than ours. That means that we are not going to draw immigrants, and that our position is not going to be comparable with that of the great Western powers. That means that we may find ourselves in difficulties in respect of the happiness of our own people.</p>

<p>But it is not only economic growth that is important in South Africa. In South Africa we are all conscious of the necessity for physical security and personal safety. I think this awareness arises from the fact that we have an unsolved race problem in South Africa and that our attempts to solve it have earned for us the hostility of large numbers of the countries of the world. This requires us to be strong enough to deter irresponsible steps to deny us, by the use of force or sanctions and things of that kind, our right to seek our own solution. Now I know that our people have the character and the moral courage to stand up to unjust pressures, but in the modern world courage alone is not enough; we need the equipment to make courage effective. We must have the material resources to equip our people without too great a sacrifice of our living standards.</p>

<p>To create those material resources we need the hands and the brains of every single subject of the State of South Africa. This, I believe, is where the Government fails us, and I believe the Government is failing us because of its slavish observance of the ideological precepts of a policy which I think the latest census figures have conclusively proved to be in ruins. I say the figures have conclusively proved it to be in ruins because despite the warnings from experts like Prof. Sadie, South Africa&#x2019;s best-known demographer. and Prof. S. P. Cilliers, Head of the Department of Sociology at Stellenbosch University, against an over-hasty interpretation of the preliminary census figures released by the Minister, I believe there are nevertheless three or four facts which must be accepted.</p>

<p>The first, and perhaps the most important, of these is that over the last 10-year period the number of Bantu in the white areas has increased by at least 1.2 million. That is at the rate of approximately 120,000 a year. I deliberately say at least 1.2 million, because of the probable under-enumeration of Bantu in the white areas and the fact that during this period many Bantu employed in white areas were moved into new townships around our urban centres which have been declared or are part of the Bantu homelands. But the relevant Bantu are still employed in the white areas as before, in many cases in their old jobs. This means quite simply that we are not less dependent on black labour but probably more dependent on that labour than ever before, which in itself is a complete negation of one of the main objectives of the apartheid policy.</p>

<p>The second important point to which I want to direct attention is that while the number of Bantu in the white areas has increased by 1.2 million, the number of whites has increased by only 700,000, despite the Government&#x2019;s immigration scheme, leaving us with the position that we are now 3.8 million Whites in the White areas, as against 8 million Bantu and 2.5 million Coloureds and Asiatics. This is so far from the parity in the white areas that Dr. Verwoerd postulated as the minimum for the achievement of the policy of separate development, an achievement to be reached by the year 2000, that the whole policy becomes even more of a pipedream. Even the suggestion that the percentage of Whites in the white areas has grown in the last 10 years from 25.8 to 26.2 per cent means that by the year 2000, provided all the present factors remain, the percentage of Whites in the white areas will only be of the order of about 27.4 per cent. The whole concept of the policy, if you accept the yardstick set by the former Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, vanishes into thin air and seems even more impossible of fulfilment than ever before.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The third point I think we should notice is that if present trends continue, then by the year 2000 there will be approximately 38 million Bantu at a minimum and 7 million Whites in South Africa and another 8 million or 9 million Coloureds and Asians.</p>

<from><span class="col_5357-5358" refersTo="page_1236"/>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>They are not too high, as I think the hon. the Prime Minister will find if he looks at the new census figures. The point I want to make is that Prof. Rhoodie points out that we have yet to see the maximum growth tempo of the Bantu people because the Bantu&#x2019;s infant mortality can be expected to decrease dramatically in the next three decades. Sir, this represents a population explosion that is going to test to the full our ability to feed our people and our ability to give them better living standards even without unnecessary clogs on our economy caused by slavish attention to apartheid ideology.</p>

<p>Lastly, Sir, this census raises another problem, and that problem is how the 6.9 million Bantu in the reserves exist at the present time. Tomlinson worked on figures available in 1951. On these figures he left no doubt in anybody&#x2019;s mind that the Bantu in the reserves were living in dire poverty. According to Prof. J. J. Stadier of the University of Pretoria, writing in Sabra&#x2019;s Journal for Racial Affairs for October, 1967, the <i>per capita</i> income of a Bantu in the homelands for the year 1959-&#x2019;60 was only R25 a year, earned in the homelands, and if you added an estimated R150 million earned by migratory labourers that <i>per capita</i> income was increased to R53 per annum. He argued convincingly that the real product of the homelands <i>per capita</i> had not increased by 1967 but had in all probability fallen lower. Sir, this was the figure for the <i>de facto</i> population. The Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education has since given a far higher figure for the <i>de jure</i> population.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>But, Sir, it is uncertain how much was spent in the homelands. Sir, there is something else that has to be remembered and that is that when the Sabra experts made their calculations they had no inkling that the homeland population would increase by a staggering 90 per cent in the 20 years from 1950-&#x2019;51, as the results of the present census would lead us to believe. All their guesses made in 1959 and the subsequent projections were probably far out in the light of the present figures. Sir, this means two things. The first is that living standards in the reserves must be even lower than was imagined. The second is that there must be massive unemployment in the reserves, when regard is had to the very small number of jobs created, even if we accept as correct the most optimistic of the estimates made by the Government in respect of new jobs inside the reserves or on the borders.</p>

<p>Sir, I recall what I said earlier in the debate on the censure motion when I spoke of unemployment in the reserves. I was challenged and was told that this could only be the position amongst people who did not want to work on the farms. Sir, that figure has never been dealt with by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. I say again in the light of the figures of this census: What hope is there of these areas ever becoming viable economic units&#x2014;surely a <i>since qua non</i> for harmonious co-existence, even if not a <i>sine qua non</i> for independence in the view of the Government&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to say again that I do not believe that we have sufficient information at this stage to interpret the real meaning of the census figures. There seems to be something wrong somewhere. Either the last census was hopelessly out or this one is. Some of the growth rates postulated are altogether too high to accept readily. But one fact does emerge in all its starkness and that, as Prof. Cilliers comments, is that on the present population figure of the reserves, unless economic development of those reserves is accelerated out of all knowledge, population pressures could result in an explosion. I believe that is correct. But has the Government any conception even now of how enormous is the task that is involved in that plan or how astronomical the costs are likely to be&#x003F; What has been spent up to now is just chicken feed, compared with what will have to be spent. And the Government has no hope whatever of being able to make these vast sums available unless there is massive development in the existing white areas at faster economic growth rates than we are enjoying at the present time to generate the necessary wealth for that development. Once more the Government is faced with a dilemma: It cannot develop fast if it applies its policy and it cannot achieve its objectives unless it develops fast.</p>

<p>Government speakers in this and other debates have queried whether we are generating enough capital to be able to undertake faster growth rates. I have said before, however, that experience has shown that countries growing fast seldom, if ever, lack capital as the investors of the world are looking for such fields of investment. Nor do such countries tend to have balance of payments problems. They are able to build up their exports rapidly. I can see the inflationary dangers do exist from a faster growth rate. But they are not unavoidable provided always that productivity is pushed up. Mr. Speaker, the opportunities for increasing productivity in South Africa must be greater than in any other developed country of the world because of our vast resources<span class="col_5359-5360" refersTo="page_1237"/>of untapped and untrained labour in this country.</p>

<p>Even the critics of a higher growth rate, like Dr. Rieckert yesterday in <i>The Argus,</i> admit that at present the labour shortage is our first ceiling and should be raised. Despite this knowledge the Government has managed things so badly that there is still a serious shortage of labour. Estimates vary, but the shortage is probably for Whites, Asiatics and Coloured persons alone of the order of 55,000. A recent survey by Assocom estimates the present level of vacancies in commerce and allied industries alone to be as high as 35,000, of which 62 per cent are for Europeans, which is understandable. But 26 per cent of the vacancies are for Bantu workers, which is unbelievable. It would seem to me that this reflects very badly on Government labour policies.</p>

<p>I have outlined in this House before, the steps we on this side of the House would like to see taken to cope with this labour shortage. I have emphasized that those steps would be within the framework of our policy of the maintenance of white leadership over the whole of South Africa and that it would provide for the protection of the white worker.</p>

I would just like to complete what I was saying about labour. Then I will be happy to deal with that question. I wanted to say that I have emphasized those steps before, namely that the changes would be within the framework of our policy of the maintenance of white leadership over the whole of South Africa, that it would provide protection for the white worker and that those steps would be taken in co-operation with the trade unions on a basis of collective bargaining. I do not propose to outline those steps again. However, in order to meet the question of the hon. the Prime Minister, I want to say that he knows that our policy is for communal councils to replace the provincial councils. Provincial councils would be for Whites only. There would be a Coloured council for South Africa and communal councils for the Bantu in the various areas including those who have broken their tribal affiliations and are permanently settled in the white areas.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister and his predecessors tried to steal the policy from the United Party, but when they had a select committee to deal with that matter they did not deal with the necessary link between Parliament and the communal councils. Now they are running into difficulties because they did not have the foresight to listen to us when those councils were brought into being.</p>

<p>On the question of economic development, I attempted to initiate a dialogue by challenging the Government to accept that we are not strong enough to-day, nor do I believe that we are ever likely to be, to develop the Bantu areas to sovereign independent states, each economically strong enough to support its Black population as citizens of an independent state. I pointed out that if we inhibited growth, in an attempt to achieve this end, our rate of growth might well be inadequate for certain very important objectives which will affect not only our economic future but also our security. I suggested that the Economic Advisory Council should be called in not as an arbiter of future policy, but to place before the public the facts in respect of what future growth rates could be if Government policy were altered to abandon this objective as opposed to what growth rates would be with the present scheme. My approaches have been rejected as they have been on this issue in the past. The Government goes on blindly and I do not think that the Government itself knows what the cost will be. I do not believe that the Government wants to know what the cost will be, because it is afraid to tell it to the public of South Africa.</p>

<p>By contrast, we believe that South Africa is capable of greater things which could give greater security to everyone. It seems to me that one of the big differences between this Government and ourselves is in regard to the position that the white man should occupy in South Africa. We believe that the white man&#x2019;s ability, and the maximum contribution he can make, is indispensable to South African society. It is indispensable all over South Africa. The Government seems to think it is only necessary in certain areas and only to a limited degree, but we believe that if we use that ability to the full, we can soon wipe out degrading poverty for all races. We believe that our people can become rich enough to be able to create a more compassionate society, a society which will not only be richer in material terms, but also in terms of human happiness. To achieve this we shall have to use the skills and abilities of every individual in our population. The Government seems to <span class="col_5361-5362" refersTo="page_1238"/>think that it can keep people happy by using the white man&#x2019;s skills in only limited areas and restricting his usefulness by insisting that he continue to do certain jobs even if non-Whites who can do those jobs, are available. It believes it can keep people happy even if only very limited use is made of non-white skills and our growth rate is kept not only below an easily reached potential, but is of such a measure that because of increasing population our living standards will lag behind those of the great countries of the Common Market and other countries of the Western world.</p>

<p>To achieve our objectives, education is a matter of key concern. I believe a recent international survey has shown that there is a very significant correlation between the index of higher education and the gross national product of countries. I believe much of our education is wrongly directed. We spend more than three times as much on the education of the retarded child in South Africa as we do on the gifted child, but it is the latter group which is primarily responsible for the advancement of our society. I know that expenditure on education has increased very considerably over the past 20 years, but I do not share the Government&#x2019;s view that what has been done is adequate. It is certainly not adequate for the sort of progress we should like to see and it does not measure up to what the more advanced countries of the Western world are spending. We believe, on the evidence available to us, that we should probably be spending twice as much on education as we are doing at the present time.</p>

<p>But not only are we lagging behind here; as I pointed out a minute ago, the Government is allowing job reservation to be used to keep Whites pegged down to doing jobs which non-Whites could easily do. Thereby they not only block the advance of those Whites to higher graded jobs, but they are slowing down the entire growth rate of the country. There are many examples. The collection of night soil in Durban, I believe, is one. There are countries of the world, like Sweden, where there are permanent bodies consisting of representatives of the trade unions, the employers and government departments that are constantly engaged in a review of labour patterns with the object of reclassifying jobs in an effort to raise productivity. I believe such a body in South Africa could examine our needs, analyse the situation and make recommendations for the State and industrial councils to consider. I have no doubt that the activities of such a body could lead to an increase in the productivity of our entire labour force and could raise the standards and the status of our workers, but especially of our white workers. Unfortunately the seeds of such proposals seem to have fallen on arid, barren ground.</p>

<p>Sweden has shown us something else, too. It has shown us that in the modern world one achieves economic growth by moving people from less productive work to more productive work. The countries which have grown the fastest in the last 20 years are those where there is this mobility of labour. Sweden has an autonomous agency working with the Government, systematically promoting the mobility of labour. It anticipates the job opportunities of to-morrow and also the redundancies of to-morrow. It systematically prepares men to move from one kind of employment into another and has done so with singular success. I believe the lack of growth in the United Kingdom at the present time, or its very slow growth, is due particularly to the fact that it resists change in this direction. But there is no government in the world which, by virtue of the job reservation policies of this Government, restricts the mobility of labour and the growth we could get from that mobility as this Government does in South Africa. The Government does not seem to appreciate that in the long run the white man&#x2019;s contribution will be judged not for his discriminatory laws, but by his achievements in giving leadership and inspiration towards a wealthier and happier society in South Africa.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that the United Party accepting as it does that progress, civilization and order will depend upon the white man, believes that it is essential to create a dynamic society progressing to higher standards for all, to spread the new riches created in that society justly and fairly and to be able, as a result of those new riches, to eliminate poverty and misery wherever they exist. We must never forget that the world is a dynamic place today and that the rates of growth of which we are proud are being equalled and surpassed in many other parts of the world, including certain Eastern countries at the present time outside of Japan. This is just not good enough. We are a richly endowed country as far as natural resources are concerned. Our Whites certainly have the ability, and many of them the educational standards, to develop our country much faster if the best use is made of that ability.</p>

<p>Discriminatory laws will never secure our future. In the long run it is only the security that arises from economic strength that will ensure the future of civilized life in South Africa. That security will only be permanent if the white man can create a dynamic and just society and can achieve the wealth necessary to move South Africa in the direction of what I have described before as a more compassionate society. I think it is generally accepted that our welfare measures have not kept pace with the increase in our wealth at the present time. The compassionate society which we envisage will be one that is much more concerned with the welfare of all our citizens, and in which the wealth we engender is used to create higher living standards for everyone. This would enable us to spend far more on education for our citizens, and certainly for our white citizens, so that they will use the <span class="col_5363-5364" refersTo="page_1239"/>maximum of their ability, regardless of the financial position of their parents. They will have to provide the leadership in South Africa. It will enable us to afford better technical training, directed towards greater productivity. Most important of all, it will create greater opportunities for all our people.</p>

<p>Such a society would afford better protection against sickness by means of free hospitalization and a State-assisted medical aid scheme to protect our people from the economic disaster of sickness, but maintaining at the same time the patient&#x2019;s right to choose his own doctor. Such a society would also provide better protection against infirmity with more realistic disability pensions, and particularly more attention and better pensions for those disabled in war and for those limited in their activities because of blindness. We would provide better protection against old age with a national contributory pension scheme, free of the means test. We would certainly do more about the establishment and the provision of adequate running expenses for old age homes. We would also insist on better treatment for war veterans. We would certainly see to it that veterans of the 1914-T8 war receive veteran&#x2019;s pensions without the means test, as is the position in the case of veterans of some of our earlier wars. I wonder whether hon. members realize that a boy who joined up i.n 1914 at the age of 18, is now 74 years old. There cannot be many of those veterans left. They are dwindling and fading away, as old soldiers do.</p>

<p>I believe that we can also give more attention to our children and their care, and proper attention to better housing, particularly for young married couples. I know that we expect the community to play its part in welfare organizations, but there is no doubt whatever that if the State were wealthier, the State would be able to help to a greater extent, especially as many of these organizations are feeling the pinch at the present time because of the sales tax, higher salaries and other living costs. I believe, too, that a more compassionate society would have a greater regard for the dignity of the individual. There is nothing which invades the dignity of the individual more than grinding poverty. The combating of that poverty can best be undertaken by providing more opportunities for all sections of our population to develop and to raise their own standards by hard work, application and enterprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is how we see the South African society of to-morrow. It will be a rich society, a society so prosperous that it can afford to solve these problems which to-day seem intractable, and to construct the solutions we find on firm foundations of justice and equity for all men. It will be a strong society, a society so strong that we shall ward off the threats of the prejudiced and have time to work out solutions in the light that God has given us, in the light of our own conscience. It will be a compassionate society, a society so truly compassionate that it will not tolerate the misery of poverty, the ugliness of injustice or the suffering that can be avoided in the lives of the sick, the aged and those stricken by life&#x2019;s misfortune. That is the society we see. We know that it can be founded only on the industry and the loyalty of all our people. Such a society is the real challenge to South Africa. I believe that this Government is too timid, too fearful, to accept it and to meet it. The United Party accepts it and will meet it. I believe that the people in time will use the United Party as the instrument which will build the rich, the strong and the truly compassionate society for all our people in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, somebody once asked a student what he thought of the author of the Book of Ecclesiastes. The student replied that he did not really know, but thought that he was a clever man. Then the questioner said, &#x201C;No, he was the greatest pessimist who ever lived.&#x201D; When we listen to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on the future of the Whites in South Africa, I think that we can award a medal to him as being the greatest political pessimist in South Africa. In the time at his disposal the hon. the Leader of the Opposition once again spoke to-day about all sorts or things, but in actual fact he gave us nothing new. What he did give us which was new, was a few faulty figures in regard to the statistics which were made available to us recently. Amongst other things the Leader of the Opposition referred to the Coloured population and said that they would number between 8 million and 9 million by the end of this century.</p>

<p>Even with the Indians added. The statistical projections in regard to the Coloured population indicate that by the end of the century the figure will be approximately 4&#x00BD; million. Therefore, that figure of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition helps him along on his road of pessimism. However, it does not shed any light for us on this matter.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to a few of the points which were stressed by the hon. member in the course of his speech. He referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the political policy statement by the Government and the National Party which was ostensibly the basic cause of what is wrong in South Africa and which does not guarantee any future to the Whites in South Africa. The question which occurs to me now, is what party in South Africa has actually adopted a political ideology or basic premise which does offer any future to the Whites. Actually, there is only one party which is clinging to an outmoded political idea, i.e. the United Party. It is the United Party which, through the mouth of its Leader, has repeatedly come forward with the idea that we should have a united nation of 20 million people in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_5365-5366" refersTo="page_1240"/>[Interjections.] Over the past number of years he has expressed this idea time and again.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Let us now pay attention to what the hon. member said today. To-day he substituted the word &#x201C;society&#x201D; for the &#x201C;nation&#x201D;. He toned it down a little by using the word &#x201C;society&#x201D;. In other words, it is still the same concept of unity, the same concept of including Whites, Bantu, Coloureds and Asiatics under one overall roof. It is still the same and is merely another form of the one-nation theory of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. It is often the case that they want to bring the world under the impression that the National Government is a rigid Government with rigid and antiquated ideas to which it is clinging desperately. This one-nation idea, or this one-society idea, is a very old idea&#x2014;as a matter of fact, over the years it has been proved to be a lost idea and one which has been doomed to failure. We found in the British Empire the idea of an overall organization, the idea of doing away with the identity of nations. That idea of unity was broken by the power of nationalism. In the end the British Empire merely became a shell, and all that was left was the British Crown, which served as a symbol of that unity. I say that nationalism broke this idea. In the federation established by the British here in Central Africa, the same idea obtained, but there it also broke down. Why&#x003F;&#x2014;because it was based on the wrong premise, the premise that peoples are willing to give up their own identity for the sake of political unity and co-operation. Nationalism destroyed the continued existence of the federation in Central Africa. But in spite of these things the hon. the Leader of the Opposition persists in coming forward with this idea of unity, this vague and false idea of unity. That is why he is so pessimistic in regard to the future of our country; that is why he does not see any light; that is why his watchword is, &#x201C;There is no hope!&#x201D;&#x2014;words which he once again used to-day. This is what he says in regard to the Government&#x2019;s policy, if we should continue on the road to separate development. The objection which we have to this fundamental statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, is that in their approach to the matter they disregard the identity of the various peoples&#x2014;they disregard that important principle of the individual identity of separate peoples; they disregard the major differences of language and culture which exists amongst the peoples in South Africa. In spite of those differences the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is still referring to &#x201C;one society&#x201D; to-day!&#x2014;in spite of the great diversity of the languages, cultures and people who do not understand one another and do not have the same national aspirations. In spite of these things, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition persists in his idea of &#x201C;one society&#x201D;. And then he is terribly pessimistic in regard to the future&#x2014;&#x201C;No hope for the future!&#x201D; is what he says. As long as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition persists in disregarding the diversity of peoples in South Africa, as long as he disregards their individual identities and the will of each of these peoples to subsist separately and to work out its own salvation, the National Party will remain in power.</p>

<p>In keeping with his pessimistic approach, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition once again said here to-day that there was no hope of our small white population being able to carry in future the economic development of the large number of non-white peoples. If we adopted the attitude that this small white people would have to accept the sole responsibility for the progress and development of the various Coloured peoples, we would have a very hard time indeed. But the idea is not that we should drag these people along the road of progress. Our entire policy is based on our guiding and helping these people along the road of development which leads to individual nationhood and economic progress. This is, therefore, no reason for writing off the various Bantu homelands as being states which will never become economically viable, i.e. merely because they are still in a state of being undeveloped or because they themselves do not have the capacity. As we help them to stand on their own legs and to get into their stride, they themselves will to an increasing extent render a contribution to their own economic progress and to creating their own future. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition should take cognisance of the fact that there is no need for us whatsoever to accept that the Bantu peoples themselves will never render a contribution. On the contrary; they will, to an increasing extent, render a contribution in regard to their own progress and their own development. Eventually they will stand on their own legs. Why does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition apply in respect of our Bantu homelands a criterion different from the one which Britain applied in respect of the gaining of independence by Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana&#x003F; At that stage we never heard him saying that those countries were not economically viable, that they would not be able to stand on their own legs in the foreseeable future. No&#x2014;at that stage it was done on good authority and it was good for Southern Africa. But when we guide our own Bantu peoples along the road to self-government and a separate existence, many objections are raised. Yesterday the hon. member for Sea Point asked this question here: Who wants sovereign Bantu homelands&#x003F; This is not a question to put to us; it is not our concern. We are partly responsible for it, but it is actually the Bantu&#x2019;s own concern and his own right. What is the responsibility of this Parliament in regard to this important matter&#x003F;&#x2014;not to say that we <span class="col_5367-5368" refersTo="page_1241"/>want independent Bantu homelands, self-governing black states; this is not our responsibility. It is our task to make provision so as to enable the Bantu to gain independence when they ask for it and rightly lay claim to it. This is the responsibility of the Whites. We cannot dismiss this important matter cheaply or lightly. The merit of this Government and of the National Party in regard to the nonwhite peoples of South Africa, is to place them on a road leading to an identity of their own, and once they have reached that stage in their development they may ask for it&#x2014;and sooner or later they will ask for it, if we have regard to what happened in the history of peoples and nations. When they ask for it, we must be prepared to give it to them. In fact, the hon. the Prime Minister has already said that it will be done in this way. We want to suggest to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that his approach is an outmoded one, an approach which is doomed to failure in South Africa, with its various nations, languages and cultures. He must, therefore, reconsider it. We in South Africa do not recognize or accept the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s recipe for a united nation under white leadership. As against that we make provision for a diversity of leadership in accordance with the diversity of peoples living in South Africa.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, permit me to deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s objections against certain financial measures and the general financial policy of our Government. The hon. member said here, amongst other things, that they were striving after &#x201C;physical security&#x201D;; they were asking for economic stability and progress&#x2014;&#x201C;greater economic strength&#x201D; are the words he used. As a rule I do not take part in the financial debates, but I have been reading the debates for quite a number of years, and I remember that on a certain occasion, after 1948, a person such as the late Mr. Havenga, as the Minister of Finance, said that the United Party&#x2019;s financial policy was absolutely short-sighted. What was their criticism&#x003F; In the Budgets presented by the National Party there has usually been, from year to year, a surplus of revenue over expenditure, and on every occasion the charge of &#x201C;over-taxation and an unnecessary burden on the people&#x201D; was levelled. This is the approach of the United Party. [Interjection.] I shall reply to you in a moment; just keep quiet for a while. I say that this was said by Mr. Havenga as long ago as that, and essentially this is still the financial policy of the United Party to-day, a short-sighted, narrow outlook on the future of South Africa, which wants to consume everything they earn every year, which is willing to spend more than they can afford. On that basis the &#x201C;greater economic strength&#x201D;, to which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is referring, does not exist. A people that wants to create its own future cannot rely on its capital works programme, its expansion programme, having to be financed with borrowed money all the time. Over the years it has been the policy of the National Government to guide and help our people to contribute from its current revenue account a share to its capital works programme. This was not only the case in Mr. Havenga&#x2019;s time. A person such as the late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said here on more than one occasion that we were only too pleased if there was a surplus so that we could by those means make a contribution to the essential development of South Africa by drawing on our own revenue.</p>

<p>To-day the hon. the Leader of the Opposition came forward here with the other leg of their approach, i.e. free hospitalization and all sorts of concessions on a large scale. Of course, he says this with a view to the provincial election. But free hospitalization has been put to the test before, and it is not as wonderful a thing as the Leader of the Opposition considers it to be. On the contrary; there are many misgivings and the public itself has its misgivings in this regard. Under free hospitalization we had the experience that some of our best hospitals were filled to capacity with skolly boys who had been involved in street brawls. They ran to the hospitals with head wounds, whilst deserving people were unable to find beds in hospitals. For that reason I want to tell the Leader of the Opposition and his party that this is just another part of a short-sighted financial policy which does not hold any good for South Africa. The National Party has been saying this for years, and we say it in 1970: Make South Africa economically strong and independent. This is also what we strived after in those days when we were still part of the British Empire. At that time we saw that if, eventually, we wanted to stand on our own legs politically, we would have to be economically independent.</p>

<p>Does this apply to the Bantustans as well&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. in principle it applies to the Bantu homelands. But what will happen in the years to come, you want to have there right now, and if you do not have it there right now, you use it as an argument against our policy. It is not an argument at all. Sir, I say the National Party says: Make South Africa economically strong and independent. It is our policy to say that the population of South Africa should work and save. Our people should as far as possible finance its capital works itself. It is one of the great achievements of our Government that, when the Orange development project was announced at the time, the Government was able to say, in reply to the question as to where we were going to get the money from, that South Africa would pay for it itself. These are the fruits of a far-sighted policy of financial planning and development.</p>

<p>I want to refer to another point that was emphasized by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He said here <i>inter alia</i> that the Physical Planning Act &#x201C;is the biggest single handicap for our industrialists&#x201D;. I want to point <span class="col_5369-5370" refersTo="page_1242"/>out to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that in this matter, too, he is very short-sighted. In a country such as the United States of America we had an unplanned and uncontrolled industrial growth over a long period, an industrial growth of vast dimensions, and what is the problem that the U.S.A. is experiencing to-day in regard to this matter&#x003F;</p>

<p>The problem of the U.S.A. is that its tremendous industrial development has placed it in an embarrassing position; that public bodies and persons cannot keep up in creating the necessary infrastructure and in removing the refuse of the industrial world. This is how matters are over there: The private sector undertakes, develops and manufactures, and the public sector has to do everything in its power to remove the refuse, and it cannot keep up. Essentially this underlines to us a problem with which South Africa will have to contend in the future if it does not take this into account. Furthermore, we have an additional problem, i.e. that we cannot allow our Bantu population to leave their own homelands and come flocking into our industrial areas in an uncontrolled manner, for this would make the problem an even greater one. For that reason, Sir, the Physical Planning Act is an essential component of South Africa&#x2019;s future development, and if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says to-day that it is the &#x201C;biggest handicap&#x201D; for our industrialists, then he is not taking a correct view of the future and he does not see it clearly; then he is against proper planning with a view to the needs and the problems of the future.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>That is why I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that we should take a serious view of this matter if, in the future, we do not want to come up against certain bottlenecks which will be created through uncontrolled industrial development; then we must plan now, and then we must provide for space. In the United States this is such a serious matter that no less a person than President Nixon himself has launched a campaign in regard to clearing up the environment of his country. At present he is conducting a campaign in order to make his entire nation and his entire people conscious of the fact that if they want to safeguard their continued existence, large-scale industrial decentralization must take place, and greater lungs must be created for every industrial city. Sir, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is disregarding those facts to which other countries with more experience and a longer history in this regard are bearing testimony to-day and against which they are warning us. Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asks us to share his views. Sir, industrial decentralization is imperative if we do not wish to overload and overtax the existing infrastructures. Industrial decentralization is imperative if we want to restrict the pollution of our environs to a minimum. Industrial decentralization, especially border industries, is essential, particularly in South Africa with its heterogeneous population. Our cities have become a concentration of people who represent different national aspirations, largely differing ways of life, different languages and cultures, and then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is still talking about one community!</p>

<p>I want to conclude with another thought. Sometimes one is amazed at observing the political short-sightedness of the Leader of the Opposition and his party. I want to conclude to-day with this statement, i.e. that the United Party is a party with little or no political integrity. Sir, I want to illustrate to you why I say this. Earlier this year we witnessed here an attack made by the hon. member for Newton Park on members on the Government side, amongst others a Minister who had allegedly obtained a Land Bank loan. On a high level he received here a proper and decent reply. He was informed, but what did he do&#x003F; He and his supporters went into the country and made a political issue out of it. They made a political issue out of the Land Bank, which is an autonomous body. What is more, on behalf of the United Party some of these people pointed a finger at people on this side, both in the House of Assembly and the Senate. Yes, they stood on a platform and pointed at people on this side, whilst they themselves had Land Bank loans. To my mind it is beneath common political decency that responsible people of a party should go into the country with a matter which was explained, and which is known. On a certain occasion I made inquiries with a senior official of the Land Bank to find out what the Land Bank&#x2019;s policy is in regard to this matter. They explained it to me. In spite of the information which was available and what was said here, hon. members on that side of the House made a point of spreading cheap gossip all over South Africa. What did they actually do&#x003F; They implicated the members of this House in the matter. They cast doubts upon the members of the Senate and of the House of Assembly. For that reason I want to express the hope that in these matters we shall act with more fairness, more responsibility, and more decency in the future.</p>

<p>I want to mention another matter, i.e. that in the course of the recent general election the so-called Herstigte Party interferred with one of the cardinal points in the old Union Constitution and in the Constitution of the Republic. They made the statement that as far as they were concerned, Afrikaans would be the first official language in the future; in other words, that English would be scrapped or relegated to a second official language. I have never seen the hon. the Leader of the Opposition taking a stand in this regard. [Interjections.] Let me tell the hon. member for East <span class="col_5371-5372" refersTo="page_1243"/>London (City) why I am asking this question in my stupidity. In my constituency there was a peculiar fraternization and understanding between the candidates of the United Party and of the Herstigte National party. I gained the impression that my party and I were the common enemy, who had to be fought. What is more, I want to tell the Leader of the Opposition that in the constituency of Parow, where he is a voter, they did not have a United Party candidate; they only had a Herstigte Party candidate and a National Party candidate. Canvassers in Parow brought H.N.P. supporters to the polls in cars displaying portraits of the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I shall furnish the hon. member here in this House with proof to this effect. I knew the hon. member would feel bad now. In these circumstances I have asked myself whether we in South Africa have already achieved something in our political progress. I have asked myself whether there are certain cardinal points, on which we do at least agree as good South Africans, so that we may say as man to man that we accept and recognize certain points. The hon. the Prime Minister has very definitely taken a stand in regard to this maner. This is an old, acknowledged principle, which was also written into the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has remained silent to this day. He has not remained silent because this is so self-evident, for with them the recognition of two official languages with equal rights is not as self-evident as they want to suggest, but he has remained silent for the sake of a number of votes.

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is just as stupid for the hon. member to say that we have taken no part in the fight that they have with the Herstigtes, as it would be were I to say to the Nationalist Party that they do not interfere in our fight with the Progressive Party. I do not want to follow the hon. member as far as finance is concerned, because that is not my longsuit. [Interjection.] One should not speak about something unless one knows what one is speaking about. The hon. member referred to the Central African Federation, which has broken up, as an example of how a policy of federation cannot work. When one has to try and argue with people, it is difficult if one is not able to argue on the same basis. It is absolutely and completely irrelevant to compare &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the hon. member why. That federation did not succeed because it was, amongst other things, purely a geographical federation. This Government itself wants to administer the very concept which is the basis of our solution for South Africa&#x2019;s future. That is to say, they believe that the Coloureds and the Indians should have a communal council without any geographic boundaries. What is the Coloured Council but a council which represents all the interests of the Coloured people who do not live in a separate state&#x003F; That is precisely what they want to do with the Indian population. What is the difference between that and what we propose in principle, except that we say there shall be a federal parliament which will control the destiny of all those peoples and that they should be consulted by that parliament by means of representatives&#x003F; If they can have it for that purpose, then why can we not extend the same concept which they espouse to Bantu in rural areas and to Bantu in urban areas&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to leave the hon. member there, because it has become necessary to come back again to the question of what we may call the Marendaz-De Wet affair.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member may be sick of it, but I can also say that we are somewhat sick of not getting an answer about it. If I may say so, since the last time this matter was discussed, namely under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote, the matter has changed considerably. Now there is a completely new case which has to be dealt with and which has to be met.</p>

<p>The situation we now have is that it now appears that in the first place when the hon. the Minister of Health spoke on the subject in the House, on 23rd July this year, and again on 16th September this year, he told the House several untruths. Secondly, when he spoke to the hon. the Prime Minister, before the hon. the Prime Minister defended him in this House, he must have told him some untruths. Thirdly, it appears that he told the Police untruths about this matter on 16th August, 1960. If any of these matters is in fact so, if this is proved to be so, and I shall demonstrate that that is so, he ought not to remain in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>It is no good asking the hon. the Minister to resign. He would probably say that he had never been a Cabinet Minister.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>When I have finished, perhaps the hon. member will tell me whether I have done the wrong thing or not. I make no excuse for raising this matter here. It is no good saying: &#x201C;Are you proud of yourself&#x003F;&#x201D;; it is a matter of public importance to be dealt with here. Indeed, as witness to that, let me call the hon. the Minister himself<span class="col_5373-5374" refersTo="page_1244"/>He said on 23rd July of this year (Hansard, Col. 277)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What I am in fact going to do is quite simple and is without doubt the function of Parliament. That is to deal with what the hon. member raised by way of questions and insinuations, because he inevitably raised doubts with regard to my integrity and honesty.</block>

<p>This is a matter to be raised in this House. The hon. the Minister himself concedes it. He went on to issue a challenge in that debate. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I now want to issue a challenge to the hon. member. My word of honour, my name and my honesty is at stake now, for I have now given him the assurance in this House that throughout this period there was nothing irregular on my part. Now I want to challenge him. If he wants to raise this matter again in this House or outside he must bring me proof of his charge.</block>

<p>Well, Sir, I proposeto give the House proof of these events. This is not a question of character assassination, as was alleged by the hon. the Minister himself when this matter was debated. It has nothing to do with the personality of anyone. It has to do with the integrity of a Minister of the State. That is what this matter is about.</p>

<p>If those statements he made were untrue and if he knew they were untrue, they are lies. That is a matter that we must decide. But there is a precedent in other countries that, if lies are told, that should terminate the membership of that person in the Cabinet. I am sure that our standards are as high as those of any other country.</p>

<p>Concerning the first question, whether or not untruths were told in this House, I want to point out a few matters. When the hon. the Minister first spoke on 23rd July, he said nothing whatsoever about whether he was a director of Marendaz Diesel Company or whether he knew anything about the company. In fact, he gave quite the opposite impression. In Col. 277 he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Let me inform the hon. member and the House that I furnished advice and assistance to Mr. Marendaz as a voter, because he was at the time living in my constituency. Subsequently, I assisted him on behalf of the late Dr. Verwoerd, because that part of the constituency then fell under his constituency.</block>

<p>Now, what was the hon. the Minister trying to convey&#x003F; He said nothing about an association with a company. The impression is that he just did that. That is all the information he gave. It just happens that part of that information is in any event untrue.</p>

<p>On a second occasion, in Col. 4272, he spoke in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to associate myself with what the hon. the Prime Minister said here.</block>

<p>He was referring to what the hon. the Prime Minister said in attempting to defend him. What the Minister said, is most interesting. He continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall quote only two passages. The Prime Minister said the following: &#x201C;Now I want to say something, and I do not say it because it is I who say so, but because it is a senior advocate, a Judge at present, who said so. He appeared in this case for the defendants. Having investigated the case, that advocate, as well as the junior, who is a senior at present, arrived at the conclusion that there was no case against Dr. De Wet at all, and that he had never been a director of that company. These are the facts of the case.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That is the first passage with which he associates himself. He continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The second passage in respect of which I want to associate myself fully with what the hon. the Prime Minister said, is the following: &#x201C;The standpoint of the defence was that he had never been a director, in spite of the letter of 12th February, for the simple reason that Dr. De Wet, acting on advice, had written that letter at that stage in order to get out of the mess.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The exact word was &#x201C;gemors&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote">That is the truth of the matter&#x2014;not my mess, but the mess of Capt. Marendaz.</block>

<p>Sir, counsel can only give an opinion on the facts which are given to him, as everyone here knows. I should like to know whether some of these facts which have subsequently appeared, indisputable facts such as letters by the hon. the Minister, were with counsel when they gave their opinion.</p>

<p>In this connection I should like to mention an aspect of parliamentary procedure, both in respect of counsel&#x2019;s opinion, from which the hon. the Minister quoted, and in respect of the Attorney-General&#x2019;s file, from which the hon. the Prime Minister quoted. I should like to quote from the third edition of Kilpin&#x2019;s <i>Parliamentary Procedure</i> in <i>South Africa.</i> On page 91 he states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is also a rule that no Minister should read from a public document not before the House unless he is prepared to lay it on the Table or to state that it is not in the public interest to do so.</block>

<p>Is the hon. the Minister prepared to lay that opinion and the Attorney-General&#x2019;s file <span class="col_5375-5376" refersTo="page_1245"/>on the Table, or does he feel that it is not in the public interest to do so&#x003F;</p>

<p>It remains for us to see what the other evidence is. As far as the Minister&#x2019;s being a director or not being a director is concerned, one wonders what the opinion would have been had this information been available. In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of last week one finds a letter. It is the first time that this letter has appeared. It is the very letter that was written in this regard when the hon. the Minister was invited to become a director of this company. It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Further to our conversation regarding your joining the board of Marendaz Diesel Engines Limited, we have pleasure in confirming that we are now transferring to you &#x00A3;l,000&#x2019;s worth of shares free of all cost to yourself. These we anticipate when we have reached full production shall pay dividends &#x2026; We expect directors&#x2019; meetings to take place two or three times a year, unless something of a special nature, by way of a development, should arise. Any expenses incurred by you on the company&#x2019;s business will of course be for our account. We know that you will do what you can to promote the company &#x2026; In welcoming you to the board of directors, we feel that our association will be a long and happy one in this new industry to the Union of South Africa, with its vast and far-reaching potentialities.</block>

<p>That is the letter from the company. What is interesting is that that very letter bears on it some marks by the hon. the Minister. His name was spelt &#x201C;Carl&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Carel&#x201D;. Apparently that has been changed in his own writing. An &#x201C;e&#x201D; has been inserted. His address is incorrectly spelt. One &#x201C;r&#x201D; has been deleted. On the back of that very same letter, in the writing of the hon. the Minister, one finds the Minister&#x2019;s names and a box number, namely &#x201C;P.O. Box 232, Vanderbijlpark&#x201D;. That was left with the company, and that address, P.O. Box 232, Vanderbijlpark, is also in form &#x201C;J&#x201D;, filed with the Registrar. Where else could that have come from, but from the hon. the Minister&#x003F; It was on that very letter in which he was asked to be a director. Did counsel have that information, and would that have made any difference to their opinion&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is another letter about a photograph. One finds that letter also in the last issue of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> The letter is dated 29th January, 1960. I do not want to read it all out. In it the hon. the Minister deals with various matters. It is a letter addressed to the Marendaz company. It deals with various aspects of the company, and then one finds this significant passage. The hon. the Minister is asked about a photograph of himself on a brochure, and he says:</p>

<block name="quote">In regard to that photograph of myself, I think it will only spoil it &#x2026; Well, that is a matter of opinion. He continues:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; because I am not at all known in the engineering or technical world. Nevertheless, thanks for this kind thought. I would, however, suggest that a photograph of yourself will be appropriate.</block>

<p>Surely, you do not put photographs of shareholders on your brochures&#x003F; Otherwise, good heavens! anyone could have his photograph put in the brochure. Surely you only put the photograph of a director on it. But one wonders whether counsel had that letter.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, we come to perhaps the most important aspect of the whole of the defence of the hon. the Prime Minister of the hon. the Minister and his reply. The gravamen of his case is this. He somehow or other was not a director because he got legal advice that he was not. He only wrote that letter to get out of the mess. It appears in Hansard, column 4272. In other columns the hon. the Prime Minister attempts to show what a bad fellow this Marendaz was. And then in column 4131, the Prime Minister on being asked by Mr. S. J. M. Steyn &#x201C;If he had not been a director, why then was he in a mess&#x003F;&#x201D;, replied: &#x201C;Because he was up against a rogue.&#x201D; Later on when Mr. S. J. M. Steyn interjected: &#x201C;He resigned because he was not a director&#x201D; the Prime Minister replied: &#x201C;Because he wanted to extricate himself without any problems from the situation in which he had been involved by this fellow&#x201D;. One gets the impression that he had been put in this &#x201C;gemors&#x201D;, that he wanted to extricate himself from it, and that was why he wrote this letter. But what we did not know, and what I believe the hon. the Prime Minister could not have known when he made that speech in this House during the discussion of his Vote, was that on the very same day he wrote another letter to Marendaz. The first letter, namely the letter of resignation, which I should like to read for purposes of the record, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Will you be kind enough to accept my resignation as director of your company as from to-day. I am enclosing herewith share certificate No. 8. May I say that our association has been a very pleasant one and that it is solely due to circumstances beyond my control that I reluctantly have to resign as director of your company.</block>

<p>The same day he wrote this letter. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Captain: I was indeed very perturbed about the very serious matter brought to my notice yesterday morning and have already spoken to the Department about it. They will go into the matter immediately. I mentioned to you over the telephone that there were certain developments as far as I personally was concerned. It would be presumptious of me to say anything about my <span class="col_5377-5378" refersTo="page_1246"/>future in politics. But I may, however, in the strictest confidence tell you that I have resigned as director from all the companies where I held a directorship.</block>

<p>Not quite the same tale. It is not the tale of the man who wanted to get out of it because he was in a &#x201C;gemors&#x201D;. The letter proceeds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our association has indeed been a very pleasant one and yours and Mrs. Marendaz&#x2019;s I hold in very high regard. It is my sincere desire that you will continue to make use of my services as if no change has come about at all.</block>

<p>That is quite a different story. I am quite sure the hon. the Prime Minister did not know it. And then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must make a success of this venture. It is indeed the start of something very big as I see it, and apart from that it renders a big service to our country, South Africa.</block>

<p>Then I quote the last sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to repeat that it is my desire to be of exactly the same assistance to you as in the past.</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, there it is.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is what he was referred to as. He was referred to as a &#x201C;skelm&#x201D; by the hon. the Prime Minister. Now, if I may say so, that letter makes nonsense of everything the hon. the Minister said, and nonsense of everything the hon. the Prime Minister said, As any other advocate the hon. the Prime Minister, who took this brief to defend the hon. the Minister, had to stick to the story he got. That is what he had to defend. He could not make up something for the hon. the Minister, as no other advocate could. He certainly would not do it here. What he did was to tell him a cock and bull story which was devoid of all truth. The hon. the Prime Minister was put in this individious position that he then had to deliver this sort of nonsense not having the facts. One wonders again whether counsel would have given the opinion they did give if they had had this letter. The hon. the Prime Minister did not have that letter. He did not know about it. The hon. the Minister of Health did know about it. He wrote this very letter.</p>

<p>The next untruth, in my submission, is his explanation of the fact that he wrote that letter in that particular tenor. In column 4272 of Hansard of this Session he said that he wrote this letter of resignation in that particular tenor, in that friendly way because he knew the people he was dealing with. The letter I have just read surely puts a lie to that and indicates that that is palpably false. If that is his case which he stated to this House, then I say it is demonstrably untrue. But to make quite sure that it is untrue I want to refer to a letter which also appeared in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> written one year later. According to the <i>Sunday Times</i> on the 20th March, 1961, the Minister wrote the following letter to Capt. Marendaz&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am indeed sorry that I missed you on the evening you came to Parliament, but I hope that you will understand that sometimes it is impossible for us to get away. I shall certainly make a point of visiting you when I am back in Vanderbijlpark. I am very keen indeed to see how you have progressed with the factory and also to see some of the entries. Please give my kind regards to Mrs. Marendaz.</block>

<p>Now, if he wanted to get out of the &#x201C;gemors&#x201D; and he did not want to deal with people like that, how do you square it with these facts&#x003F; It makes nonsense of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s defence of the hon. the Minister! For that I am not blaming the hon. the Prime Minister because he can only do what he can with the goods given to him. It appears that the Minister of Health did not tell the Prime Minister the truth. At the very lowest he withheld important and material facts from the Prime Minister before he defended him and by doing so made a fool of the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he also made untrue statements to the Police. I have the Hansard report of the hon. Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech where he tried to defend the hon. the Minister and I find it extraordinary. First of all the Prime Minister referred to the fact that the Police went to the Minister of Health and asked him whether he knew anything about the Bamzam Company and that the Minister quite rightly said that he had never heard of it, that he never was a director of it and had never anything to do with it. Thereafter the Police went once more to the hon. the Minister and put to the Minister the same questions but now in respect of Marendaz Diesels. In regard to this the Prime Minister said, &#x201C;Once again the answer was the same&#x201D;. Well, words must have meaning. The Prime Minister is usually very careful in choosing his words. He is a senior member of this House; indeed, he is the Prime Minister. Furthermore, he had a lot of time to think about this matter and to prepare his case. So, if words have any meaning, the hon. the Minister of Health said to the Police that he had never heard of Marendaz Diesels, that he never was a director of it and never had anything to do with it. It is not a question here of a slip of the tongue. This very point was again put to the Prime Minister by the Leader of <span class="col_5379-5380" refersTo="page_1247"/>the Opposition on the last day of that debate. The hon. the Prime Minister then sat back and said: &#x201C;Read my Hansard&#x201D;. Well, I have read the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Hansard and that is what he said. Having prepared his case carefully, are we not entitled to assume that that is in fact what he meant&#x003F;</p>

<p>It is quite clear; it is not even necessary to argue the matter. On the Minister&#x2019;s own admission he applied for and received shares in the company. He said so himself. Therefore, it is unnecessary even to argue this. Sir, we do not need a committee, or a commission or any inquiry at all into this matter because here are the facts&#x2014;all documented.</p>

<p>The strangest feature of this whole case is that the Minister himself has never admitted, never in fact used the words &#x201C;I was not a director; I know nothing about it; I had no dealings with it &#x2026;&#x201D; That is what one would have expected. The Minister spoke after the Prime Minister tried to defend him and was at great pains not to say anything himself apart from saying that he associated himself with what the Prime Minister said&#x2014;a remarkable state of affairs!</p>

<p>But the most remarkable of all happened last night. When the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) was dealing with the matter, the Minister of Health interjected &#x201C;dit is skinderstories&#x201D;. Thereupon the hon. member said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is nie skinderstories nie. Die <i>Sunday Times</i> het lasterlike dinge van die Minister ges&#x00EA; en hy is nie bereid om op te tree nie. Hoekom nie&#x003F;</block>

<p>To that the Minister replied: &#x201C;omdat die <i>Sunday Times</i> by niemand tel nie.&#x201D; Sir, the <i>Sunday Times</i> has a circulation of 450,000 and a readership of 2 million. And then we have the very fact that these things have been written. Here we have the measure of the concern of the Minister for his good name, and this is apparently the measure of concern for the good name of a Minister of State.</p>

<p>Let me remind the hon. the Prime Minister of his own dictum in matters such as these. When, earlier in the year, he dealt with the case of Mr. Haak, he said that he had full confidence in Mr. Haak not only as an able Minister but also in his integrity. He said that he had every confidence that Mr. Haak was no party to anything unworthy or improper. The Prime Minister continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If he had been a party to anything of this nature I would not have hesitated for a moment to terminate his membership of the Cabinet.</block>

<p>This, then, is the dictum of the hon. the Prime Minister. Let him now apply that dictum to these facts. It cannot be questioned that if an hon. Minister makes a statement to this House which is not true, or to the Police which is not true, then that is an improper and unworthy act. The facts are there, and if the Minister stays on, the public might feel that they cannot have the same confidence in what Cabinete Ministers say in future. But worse still from the point of view of the hon. the Prime Minister, is the fact that people will be entitled to think that the hon. the Prime Minister is not concerned about the veracity and the integrity of his Ministers. I submit, in conclusion, that there has never been a clearer case than this. Here are all the documents and the Prime Minister has all the facts. In the circumstances I hope he will do the duty that is his towards the country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schoeman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The speech we have had to listen to for the last half-hour is adequate proof of the total bankruptcy as far as policy and a sense of positiveness on the part of the Opposition is concerned. We are approaching the end of what has been, to my mind, one of the most important sessions of Parliament. And yet, what is being dished up here&#x003F; Gossip! To my mind this is sufficient proof that there is no basis of integrity whatsoever between the Government and the Opposition, no basis for liaison or for co-operation. This also brings to us proof of exploitation by a political anachronism, such as this country has never known before. This is further proof that we are dealing here with a party which is committing suicide and do you know, Mr. Speaker, we have just had a whiff in our nostrils now, and a whiff in the nostrils is usually the precursor of decay. Under the guidance of the Progressive English-language Press, that party is to-day being made up into a neat packet and it will in your time and mine be laid at the feet of the hon. member for Houghton in this House with the ironic statement &#x201C;Allah, confirm to us the work of our hands&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, I said that we were dealing here with a political anachronism. We are dealing here with final proof of a total lack of a basis of integrity between the Government party and the United Party, and in addition we are dealing here with final proof of dissension in the soul of that party. There is a horizontal and a vertical red chalk mark running through their soul. On the one hand we get the Mitchell group as advocates of the concept of brute White supremacy. On the other hand we have the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who is now condeding that homeland development may as well become part of their policy. He has now stopped protesting against the &#x201C;fragmentation of this country&#x201D;. But do you know, Sir, he is too scared to admit it. He came forward here with the clever suggestion that if the Economic Advisory Council of the hon. the Prime Minister were to come to such a conclusion, his leader would be morally bound to abide by it. The corner is becoming too small and the anxiety is increasing. They must get out. They may not admit it, they cannot include it in their policy, they must remove it <span class="col_5381-5382" refersTo="page_1248"/>from the sphere of politics, and now they want to pass it on to the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, liaison between the Opposition and the governing party is necessary, but how are we going to achieve this&#x003F; How are we going to remedy this tragic position&#x003F; Only by informing the voters of South Africa and asking them to speak to their leaders in the House of Assembly so that they can muster their thoughts for a change. I do want to make this one concession to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He came forward this afternoon with an indication and proof that he has almost as much in his head as he has around his waist, because he is speaking of a subsequent policy, the policy of &#x201C;communal councils&#x201D;. We will probably get it in pamphlet form one of these days to distribute as voting fodder throughout the country&#x2014;communal councils, an amendment of the homelands policy and the acceptance of border industries&#x2014;it is coming. Sir, I come now to the integrity of the paragons of virtue on that side of the House, and I appreciate this opportunity at this stage of the session. I may as well begin right away. Mention was made here of integrity and of morality. What did we get in Randburg from the representatives of that side of the House&#x003F; According to him a member of the National Party had become a Hertzogite; after the election he would walk over; he was a verkrampte. Do you know. Sir, the voters of Randburg are still waiting for that to happen&#x003F; The voters of Randburg are now putting this question to the United Party; When is it going to happen&#x003F; You promised it, and undertook that it would happen. The United Party representative in that election campaign, what did he do in that petition of his&#x003F; He made fraudulent allegations. He committed political treason. [Interjections].</p>

<p>Not in regard to that part of the case; only in regard to the cost aspect. The contrary of the statement of that hon. representative&#x2014;not, not &#x201C;honourable&#x201D; &#x2014;of the United Party was proved to the hilt through the submission of sworn statements, and when he saw that he was going to run into trouble, he withdrew that allegation in the Supreme Court, after he had had all the benefit of newspaper publicity and after he had created an atmosphere of deceit. Sir, this is proof of the integrity and the manliness of representatives of that side of the House. But I shall go further. They cannot say that they did not know that their man would leave them in the lurch. The United Party caucus of the City Council of Johannesburg knew Mr. Horace van Rensburg very well for was he not, according to their United Party norms, suspended by them for six weeks and prohibited to speak in the City Council of Johannesburg because he had called my hon. Prime Minister a &#x201C;bloody fool&#x201D;&#x003F; Sir, is that integrity; is that the image which is to be created of politics in South Africa&#x003F; It is hypocrisy. Believe me, Sir, the voters of Randburg deserve better than that.</p>

<p>We are definitely going to see in October. So much for the integrity and the irreproachableness of that side of the House. Here we have further proof of their bankruptcy in originality. This is advice they received from professional advisers; &#x201C;Launch gossip-mongering campaigns; disparage the leaders and sow confusion by lack of an alternative policy. You have lost; you have no policy; you have nothing to offer, so make use of these means&#x201D;. Sir, this is a tragic day in the politics of South Africa. But an Opposition party has never gossiped itself into office. Many have gossiped themselves out of office and many have gossiped themselves into oblivion. We are dealing with a cultivated, ethical electorate in South Africa and they will pronounce judgment on tactics of this kind and the behaviour of that side.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to recommend to the hon. members that instead of making use of professional advice which they received from distant countries, they should rather hold symposiums with our Bantu leaders in this country, Bantu leaders who have expressed a final unequivocal judgment on their own level-headedness sobriety, their views, their feelings and their duty to their fatherland.</p>

This is further proof of integrity. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As chief councillor of the Ovambo nation I find it very strange that the Security Council should go the the World Court to hear whether the Republic of South Africa has the right to act here in South-West. It is our right as full-fledged nation to exercise the choice ourselves, and we do not need the U.N. or the World Court to help us.</block>

<p>Have we ever heard anything like that being said on that side of the House&#x003F; That side of the House must effect a little liaison with the people for whom they want to buy security. They are level-headed; they have already decided. They could serve as an edifying example to you. What does the Tswana chief, tribal chief Lucas Mangope say&#x003F; He says that his blood boils when he hears talk of people in the Africa countries wanting to come and liberate the black people of South Africa. In addition to that he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In May the National Party has been in power for 20 years. Whites do not know what the reaction of the Tswana to that is; for every Tswana it is a day of thanksgiving.</block>

<p>Chief Kaiser Matanzima once said to the world: If you think to commit an act of aggression against the Republic and you think you will find us passive bystanders, you are making a mistake. Chief Jonathan said that he was opposed to Communism and that he would tolerate no terrorism or afford it any protection if it was aimed at the Republic of South Africa. That side of the House is saying that the idea of separate development has failed. Living leaders of the Bantu nation bring confirmation that it has succeeded. It is no longer necessary for us to proclaim it from these benches only. It is being proclaimed from the four corners of the Republic of South Africa by the Blacks themselves. Where does the United Party fit in&#x003F; They want to sow confusion and place obstacles in the way. They want to Europeanize the Bantu, they want to mislead them through flattery. And the Blacks say to them: &#x201C;We do not want to be Whites&#x201D;. It is not only in the National section of the population where one finds this standpoint, but also among the United Party people. The recently established South African Students&#x2019; Organization, the organization of non-White students, was established to break away from Nusas because they felt that as a minority in Nusas they are being neglected. They wanted to represent themselves, and this Nusas is after all a kind of junior United Party. What do the Bantu say about them&#x003F; Never before was an Opposition Party in this country so far off course as regards the requirements of the time and level-headed thinking about it. Any national leader and any governing group must at least have this talent and skill, i.e. to interpret the requirements of their time correctly and then to go to the people and to say: Here are the requirements, this is the road and here are the means. How brilliantly has my party not succeeded in doing so during the past twenty years.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said the following in Hansard, column 4216, after a speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister in regard to the combating of Communism&#x2014;</p>

But what does his party say&#x003F; I have said that they are an anachronism, a contradiction; they are out of step with the times.

<block name="quote">Unspectacular, but with deadly penetration, creeping Communism gets along in Africa.</block>

<p>That is what his Press is saying, that is what his party is saying and that is what the Bantu leaders in this country are saying to him. No, but the great king, Vause Raw, says it is nonsense. He says communistic danger is merely an intimidatory story.</p>

<p>Now we come to the hon. member for Hillbrow and to the hon. member for Yeoville who waxed lyrical here about the decentralization of industries. They came forward here with the statement that this was not decentralization of industries at all, and that it was not border industries at all, but that we were taking the industries to the borders and then taking the Bantu along, and in this way trying to bluff them and the public.</p>

<block name="quote">Every urban industrialist who still doubts the advantages of decentralization should go along and take a look at the Veka factory in Natal.

<p>This is no figment of the imagination; this is not an ideology, this is a fact which speaks for itself. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under white supervision these men are at present producing 780 jackets for men&#x2019;s suits, 1,500 trousers for men, 900 blazers, 305 trousers for boys and 2,400 shirts for boys, apart from all the hundreds of spring gowns, and the full 1970 production of the factory has already been sold out.</block>

<p>We are making progress, despite the intimidatory stories and the unlevelheadedness of the party on that side. Mr. Speaker, we find that we are dealing here with a party which are trying to force themselves as a square peg into a round hole. The voters are going to extricate them.

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are dealing here with a party which is disappearing. We are dealing here with a party which has no message. We are dealing here with a party which, in a very tragic way, is committing suicide. We are dealing here with a party which is decaying. I want to say to the hon. member for Houghton, she need not be overjoyed if the Progressive press lays this neatly made up parcel of the former United Party at her feet with the cry &#x201C;Allah, confirm the work of our hands!&#x201D; because by that time it will already be dead.</p>

<p>What is the policy of the Land Bank&#x003F; The policy of the Land Bank was set out at Worcester by the chairman of the Bank as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Land Bank is not there to finance land barons. It is there to finance persons who do not possess land or to help persons who do not have an economic unit, to obtain an economic unit.</block>

<p>If there are people who get bonds of R450,000, if millionaires get bonds, must this side of the House remain silent&#x003F; Surely it is the duty of this side of the House, and it had nothing to do with the fact that it was the father of the son-in-law of the Prime Minister. It did not matter whether it was his grandfather; it was the principle involved. Let me now say that this side of the House will act as the watchdog over the interests of the voters of South Africa, regardless of who gets hurt in the process and regardless of how much inconvenience it causes that side of this House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Randburg went further and said that this party was divided in its soul, but what have we seen in this House in recent times&#x003F; Yesterday we had the spectacle when the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs put his standpoint. He never committed himself to a policy. What he did at least make clear was that there should be good relations with the Coloured people.

<p>What did the Minister of Coloured Affairs say&#x003F; Then they talk about division! We also had the example of the Minister of Finance, who said that he would grant the industrialists the opportunity of having a dialogue. If he then saw their point of view in regard to border industries, he would adopt a sympathetic approach to their case as far as labour was concerned. His words were scarcely cold when the hon. the Minister of Labour, under the guidance of the hon. member for Brakpan, said that no concessions would be granted. Is this division&#x003F; So much has been said about the challenges of the 1970s, but is this how we are to meet the 1970s&#x003F; There is not even clarity among Cabinet Ministers of the Nationalist Party. If they do not have unity in regard to their policy and if members of the Nationalist Party do not have unity, how must the people have unity&#x003F; How must we know what course we are to follow in the 1970s&#x003F;</p>

<p>We have heard a great deal about the challenges of the 1970s and about how the Prime Minister would face them. We heard how the Prime Minister would be doing some overhauling after the election. Sir, what overhauling has been done&#x003F; What has been done in order to solve the problems of the ordinary man in the street&#x003F; Nothing. All the Nationalist Party did was to send two organizers overseas in order to study election methods, because elections are apparently more important than the problems of the people of South Africa. Sir, the problems are not overseas. Those people should not have been sent overseas. The problems are here inside the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own Cabinet. Then the Nationalist Party appointed a certain Mr. Rezelman. who must now improve the image of the Nationalist Party. He must sell the policy of the Nationalist Party. Then we heard from the hon. the Minister of Information the other day that the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy was State policy. For that reason, he saw his way clear to using almost R2 million of the taxpayers&#x2019; money in South Africa in order to propagate the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s propaganda.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister explained that the policy of the Nationalist Party was Government policy or State policy. They are now doing what has never been done before, and that is to use money for the purpose of propagating that State policy within this country itself.</p>

<p>Only the other day the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s newspapers told us that we would never be able to have television in South Africa. They said that if we were to have television, the Nationalist Party newspapers would go under and if the Nationalist Party newspapers went under, the Nationalist Party itself would go under. In other words, that whole party is dependent on propaganda in order to keep the people in the dark. It is not concerned about the problems of the people of South Africa, but only with serving the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl mentioned the good account which the Nationalist Party Ministers had given in this House of their tasks. But what did we hear&#x003F; In every Department of every Minister we heard about shortages. There are shortages of telephones, railway trucks and houses. And then their excuse was that the country had been growing too rapidly. Yes, Sir the country has grown too rapidly. South Africa has grown rapidly as a result of the initiative of the industrialists of South Africa and the workers and people of South Africa. This is the position in spite of this Government and not as a result of this Government. Every Department in which this Government has a hand has not been able to grow with South Africa. Is this the way in which the Nationalist Party wants to meet the problems of the 1970s&#x003F;</p>

<p>But what have we seen in this House&#x003F; In contrast to this lack of policy and incompetence, the Leader of the United Party forcefully, dynamically and squarely faced up to the problems of the 1970s. He clearly and unambiguously outlined the course to be followed in the 1970s, i.e. to make South Africa economically strong and to develop it economically so that it will be one of the ten economically strongest countries in the world at the end of this century. He said that this could be done by increasing the growth rate of the economy to 10 per cent, and not by pegging it at 5&#x00BD; per cent, as this Government wants to do.</p>

But under a United Party r&#x00E9;gime and at a growth rate of 10 per cent, the amount will reach R86,000 million. Why should we not become one of the ten strongest countriese in the world&#x003F; What does the Nationalist Party have against that&#x003F; Why do they not want that growth&#x003F; After all, we have the necessary factors in South Africa in order to have that growth. We have all the natural resources. We have factors which not even Japan has, and to-day Japan is the third largest industrial country in the world. I think it must be heart-rending for everyone in this House and in South Africa to think that our natural raw matereials and resources, such as iron ore, must be exported to Japan in order to square the trade balance of an incompetent government, while we have a shortage of steel in this country and while we have the possibility to process that steel.</p>

<p>No, because I am not ridiculous. Surely the hon. the Minister should not make himself appear stupid. If we can process steel here, it does not mean that we can process wool, but the United Party will solve this as well; it will solve the labout problem as well. We shall obtain more trained labour by means of a more purposeful immigration policy. We shall not peg the immigration effort as the Minister of Immigration does, in that he said yesterday that he did not want more than 13,000 to 14,000 workers. [Interjection.] The second point is that the United Party will provide free university training to all needy white children who have the capacity for it.</p>

<p>But what is the objection to it&#x003F; Is it money, or the cost involved&#x003F; Because if it is the cost, I just want to remind him that when we asked the Minister of Bantu Administration what this Native policy would cost, he said, &#x201C;It does not matter&#x201D;. But it does matter when the children of South Africa have to be trained; then they cannot find the money. In addition, we shall train and retrain the older workers of South Africa. We shall introduce short courses in order to elevate them and to provide them with better positions, and as we give them better positions, as they move up the ladder, we shall fill those vacancies with non-white workers, and in this way we shall raise the standard of living of our entire population and achieve prosperity for our entire population. We shall achieve security for the entire population, because we know that the country with the greatest economic strength is the country with the greatest military strength. If your country is economically powerful, you can withstand boycotts. Who will dare to boycott Japan or America&#x003F; We can solve all our problems if we follow the leadership provided by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. All we need in order to put this plan into operation, is a change of Government. But what hope do we have under the Nationalist Government&#x003F; How are we to enter the 1970s under the Nationalist Party, a party which wants to retard the economic development and the growth rate of South Africa, and which wants to peg the growth rate at 5&#x00BD; per cent&#x003F; As the hon. the Minister of Finance said, &#x201C;Rather a poor country, but a white country&#x201D;. But little does the Minister realize that if the white man is to retain his position in South Africa, he must first be made economically strong. The hon. member for Paarl quoted figures and said that the faster we grow, the faster inflation would increase and therefore we should not grow, otherwise inflation would become too high. For years and years we have been hearing this inflation story, that there is too much money for too few goods. Sir, if there is too much money for too few goods, then there eare two courses open. The course of the United Party is to increase the goods by producing more. But what is the policy of the Nationalist Party&#x003F; It is to withdraw the money from the people of South Africa; in other words, to impoverish the people. Thus the people have, economically speaking, been crushed by the Government in &#x2018;the past five years, because what steps have they taken&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that I am talking nonsense. Let us argue the matter out. What was the first step which they took&#x003F; They restricted bank credit, then they increased taxation, and then they increased interest rates&#x2014;everything in order to combat inflation. Every method was tried in order to withdraw the money from the people, in order to impoverish the people, because the argument was that if the money was withdrawn, there would be less buying power and this would bring down the cost of living and reduce inflation. But what has happened after five years&#x003F; Has inflation been reduced&#x003F; It was 2 per cent from 1960 to 1965. From 1965 to 1969 it was 3.6 per cent. This year it was 4 per cent and next year it is going to be 5 per cent, and I think the hon. the Minister agreed with that. In other words, the rate of inflation has not been checked, but the people of South Africa have been impoverished by this Government. The entire farming population has been ruined by these measures and by the actions of that hon. Minister of Agriculture. These plans could never have succeeded, because how can one combat inflation by restricting bank credit&#x003F; Because if one restricts bank credit, one prevents the industrialist from expanding and he will produce less, so that fewer goods will appear on the market, the goods will become more expensive and this will increase the cost of living, and if the cost of living increases, the worker will demand higher wages and then the Government will grant higher wages and then one will have less productivity and greater inflation. This is what has happened in the past years. The same applies to taxes. How can one combat inflation by increasing inflation&#x003F; Because taxation is the largest single factor which increases the cost of living and if one increases the cost of living, the workers demand higher wages and then one gets inflation. The same position applies to interest rates. How can one combat inflation by increasing interest rates when every farmer has a bond on his farm and every home-owner a bond on his house&#x003F; If one increases the interest rates, one surely increases his cost of living and one makes it impossible for him to live. How can one reduce the cost of living by increasing interest rates, thus enriching the rich man, who receives those interest rates, and impoverishing the poor man who has to pay that interest&#x003F; And this has been the policy of this Government. This process has been repeated every time until we have the position to-day that the rate of inflation will be 5 per cent next year. On 18th June last year the Minister of Finance gave this country its final economic knock-out blow when he said that he was going to lift exchange control and that we should send the money out, that we should get rid of the money. What happened&#x003F; The next day, the Stock Market collapsed and that <span class="col_5393-5394" refersTo="page_1254"/>bit of fun and games cost the investors of South Africa, the small investors, R1,800 million. This is what it cost the small investors, and when he had completed this, what did the Minister of Finance say&#x003F; He said that he had issued warnings and that it was in any case the typists and the clerks who had lost their money and that they should never have invested in the Stock Exchange. The typists and the clerks should not have invested in the Stock Exchange; that privilege was reserved for the capitalists.</p>

<p>On 18th August, after the entire Stock Exchange had collapsed, what did the Minister of Finance do&#x003F; He restored exchange control; he reversed the whole policy. No wonder that the Stock Exchange correspondent of <i>Die Beeld</i> referred on 9th October, 1969, to the Stock Exchange being strangled. He referred to the success which the Government had had in strangling our economy and said that &#x201C;the economic policy is too negative; perhaps one should call it &#x2018;verkramp&#x2019; &#x201D;. Then a man like Dr. Hupkes said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa&#x2019;s economy has too long had a restrictive and inward policy. Are we not exchanging galloping inflation for the evils of galloping socialism&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, is this how we are to enter the 1970s, with an economy which has retarded the economic growth of South Africa, and which holds no hope for the ordinary man&#x003F; Must we enter the 1970s without houses, without money, without telephones, without television&#x003F; Must we enter the 1970s as an impoverished country&#x003F;</p>

<p>What is the view of the hon. the Prime Minister and that side of this House in regard to national unity, one of the most important matters in the 1970s&#x003F; In the past election the Prime Minister stated his policy in regard to national unity. In his speech at Heilbron, he said that he stood for co-operation with the English-speaking people, provided that he did not have to forfeit one iota of his Afrikaner identity. He said that he expected co-operation from the English-speaking people, but that they need not forfeit any of their English identity. Sir, surely this is co-operation; surely it is not national unity. One will then forever have two races in one country each of which will fight for the control of the steering wheel in South Africa.

<p>I believe it, and there is no doubt about that. Why should I not believe it. if the reports come from the United Party candidate himself, or from the, as I now must say, hon. Redi Louw. I shall quote to hon. members from the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 3rd September, 1970. Hon. members must remember that the member for Klip River was at that stage a seriously ill man, who was lying in hospital. At that stage that United Party candidate came along and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If Mr. Theo Gerdener was sincere to the ideal of national unity, then he should dissociate himself from the Broederbond immediately.</block>

<p>That is the way they go to work. They challenge a man who is lying in hospital. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This was the challenge issued at Spioenkop last night by Senator Redi Louw, who was on the platform in support of the United Party candidate in Klip River. Senator Louw said that it was not difficult to anticipate the reaction of the Nationalist Party candidate to the challenge. No Broeder will put the ideals of South Africa before the ideals of the Broederbond.</block>

<p>That is the level to which these hon. members have sunk. One must then still bear in mind that this was one of these &#x201C;hand-picked men&#x201D; of the Leader of the Opposition. The Broederbond is not at issue, but I am going to tell hon. members what the issue is. How it became known, I do not know, but I accept that the hon. the Deputy Minister admitted it himself, but because he is a member of the Broederbond those hon. members say that he has cheated the English-speaking people. If there has ever been a testimonial for the Broederbond, with the best intentions at his command, then it is the membership of Theo Gerdener in respect of an organization such as the Broederbond. Mr. Speaker, those members&#x2014;I regret that the hon. member for Wynberg is not present&#x2014;preached racial hatred from beginning to end. I regret the fact that <span class="col_5397-5398" refersTo="page_1256"/>the United Party candidate is not here to defend himself. At Bergville a friend stood up and asked the candidate whether the Moths was a political organization. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; says Mr. Henderson &#x201C;it is not a political organization. I myself am a member.&#x201D; He fixed his gaze on him and asked: &#x201C;Then why did you call me a disgrace to the Moths because I am a Nationalist&#x003F;&#x201D; Thereupon the hon. gentleman did not deny this. He said it was a private occasion. He replied: &#x201C;But then why at the Moth meeting did you call the Prime Minister a bloody bastard&#x003F;&#x201D; Thereafter the United Party candidate, of course, took the loudspeaker and shouted the whole lot down. That is the way they carried on. And in addition they gossiped from beginning to end. The hon. member for Wynberg was one of them. She finally said, &#x201C;Here is a real saucy one for you.&#x201D; What did she do then&#x003F; She told how the hon. the Leader of the Opposition argued himself into a corner about the Agliotti affair. She told the Klip River voters again how the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had said that that land was offered to the State. You have never in your life seen a more typically vulturous party! They just scavenge on gossip as far as they possibly can.</p>

<p>The only way the <i>Sunday Times</i> could iron out all these stories was by saying, &#x201C;Yes, with the verligte Mr. Gerdener they sent all the verkramptes to hold meetings there.&#x201D; All the verkramptes&#x003F; The Minister of Agriculture, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, the Minister of Community Development&#x003F; Is the Minister of Community Development a verkrampte&#x003F; He is so verlig that one has to put a shade around him! But we know this story of the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. These are not old stories. We expected them to come. Senators have also spoken about that. They do not want to be Afrikaners. I quote from the Senate Hansard of 7th October, 1966, what a senator said who went to work for the United Party at Klip River. He said (column 1116)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am a South African.</block>

<p>And he is bilingual as well! &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not even want to be an Afrikaner because the best Afrikaners are those fourlegged animals with the beautiful horns and the red hide. Those are the true Afrikaners. We ought to realize we are all good South Africans.</block>

<p>That is the way those hon. members carry on. If one now looks at this booklet of theirs, &#x201C;You want it, we have it,&#x201D; one reads: &#x201C;We accept the Republic as an accomplished fact.&#x201D; After ten years they write that they now accept it. What happened to the hon. Leader in Natal, who wanted to &#x201C;march&#x201D; out of Natal&#x003F; He was conspicuously absent in this debate. Are they people who want to work together for one culture and who are going to relinquish theirs&#x003F; The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town has already relinquished everything. He is nothing but a United Party member. [Interjections.] Sir, I shall go further. Right at the back of this little booklet of theirs those hon. members write: &#x201C;We accept one loyalty.&#x201D; They now only have one loyalty, and that is to South Africa.

<p>Mr. Speaker, through you I want to ask that hon. member for East London (North), who waxed so eloquent, what his party&#x2019;s attitude was when the question of one citizenship was put to the Vote in this House&#x003F; Did they want one citizenship, or did the hon. member and his party also still want to be citizens of a foreign country&#x003F; Was it not those hon. members who at a certain stage did not want to take the oath of allegiance to the Republic&#x003F; Was it not that hon. member who wrote a letter to a good English friend in Natal in which he said that he was a &#x201C;disgrace&#x201D; to the English-speaking people because he joined the National Party&#x003F; Those hon. members are now sitting there so sacrosanctly, but what was their attitude when a previous member of the House, Mr. Arthur Barlow, suggested that there should be only one National Anthem and one flag&#x003F; Now they accept it, but what did they do at the time&#x003F; They got rid of Arthur Barlow. What was the attitude of those hon. members in Natal when the House decided on one flag&#x003F; They voted against it, and for quite a few years afterwards the Union Jack flapped alongside our flag in Natal. Then those hon. members want to come and tell us that they support one loyalty. Sir, I am sorry that I have devoted so much time to these matters, but the hon. member upset me very much by carrying on in this vein.</p>

<p>There are a few other statements that have already been made on various occasions by hon. members on that side of the House. Last night, when this debate began, the main speaker on Finance on the Opposition side once more said something in this vein. Incidentally, I want to say that I am glad that hon. member was not here to-day to listen to the arguments on economics by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. I have previously seen him laugh at the hon. member for East London (City). To-day he would have hidden his head under the bench. Hon. members have repeated, on several occasions, what the hon. member for Hillbrow has also said, that by March of next year we shall be seeing such a cruel Budget. That is not a matter that can simply be allowed to pass unchecked like that. It is, of course, a story that is expressly being propagated with a view to the provincial <span class="col_5399-5400" refersTo="page_1257"/>election. What are the actual facts&#x003F; The facts and one of the biggest bottlenecks, in the economy at this stage, is that the total local consumer spending increased in the past year by no less than 17 per cent. If that is the position, then I want to say that that consumer spending increased in the past year by double the amount of any other year. The average for the past ten years was about 8 per cent. This had a few repercussions, i.e. that the prices of goods and services increased considerably. This resulted further in our imports increasing sharply. Most important of all is that it resulted in personal savings decreasing markedly, to such an extent that the percentage of personal savings, in relation to personal income, decreased to 6 per cent, while in the previous years it was 10 per cent. In other words, this simply means that our people are spending too much. They went on a &#x201C;spending spree&#x201D;. The position is simply that our people buy anything. I can see no reason why one has to buy Italian shoes for an ounce of fine gold or 35 dollars. That is what they cost to-day.</p>

<p>There are two ways of restricting this problem. The first is by means of import control. As soon as we begin with import control, we experience problems with G.A.T.T. The other possibility is that our people should spend less and save more. However, if the hon. the Minister of Finance appeals to the public to save more and spend less, these hon. members make a ludicrous story of it. They do not believe it. The reason why people spend so much is because they have too much money. If people then continue to spend so much, there are two ways of getting rid of the money. The one way is voluntary saving. In order to help bring about that voluntary saving, the hon. the Minister of Finance made announcements in his Budget speech about considerable relief, as far as taxation was concerned, for people who wanted to invest money in the building societies. They can invest considerably more than last year at a tax-free dividend or interest rate. Unless particularly strict import control is applied, which does not appear possible in my opinion, because of our international restrictions, the only other alternative, when people do not want to invest their money in provident funds, is to take the excess money out of the hands of the public by means of taxes, saving or in some other way. But the solution to the problem is expressly in the hands of the public, and instead of that side of the House assisting the hon. the Minister of Finance, they are making a joke of the entire matter. That is the problem, but I do not think that we can merely leave this story about such a terrible future Budget at that.</p>

<p>In the few minutes I have left I must just say a few words about the labour problem Here I have the <i>Business Times</i> of July 1970&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is a report emanating from Cologne in Germany: &#x201C;Europe&#x2019;s manpower crisis seems every bit as acute as South Africa&#x2019;s&#x201D;. Surely the people are exaggerating this matter as much as they possibly can in order to steal a march on someone, and I do not know who, because I do not think that any informed person will allow himself to be caught out like this. But stealing a march is not such a simple matter. Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to establish a &#x201C;crash programme&#x201D;. All that will happen to that &#x201C;crash programme&#x201D; is that he himself will crash, if he has not already crashed. Now he tells us here to-day that they are going to give the white worker better protection. How&#x003F; That remains the question. Tell us how&#x003F; He simply keeps to generalities. The reason he advances is that we have so much confidence in the leadership of the white man that he will remain on top. But a moment ago the hon. member for Bloemfontein (West) told us what he thinks of leadership, and I repeat what he said in column 6038 of 18th May, 1959&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And it should be remembered also that as the standard of civilization of a community is raised, leadership will depend to an increasing degree upon numbers. Restrictive laws alone can never be a final solution.</block>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition categorically declares that restrictive legislation, as they call it, will never be the solution, but he says they will give the white worker greater protection. Does he then want the white worker to accept his word&#x003F; Why would he accept it&#x003F; Oh, I could quote you a great deal of this stuff. And did he not say that the Coloured people should be restored to the same voters&#x2019; roll&#x003F; It was said repeatedly, and the hon. member for Yeoville confirmed it; in fact, one day they agreed with Mr. Abe Bloomberg, the former member for Peninsula, and just the following day they made a different suggestion. They were then sitting here in Committee, unaware that their congress had decided otherwise. Sir, how can the people accept such words of trust&#x003F; I want to tell the Opposition, and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself, that it is high time for them to begin designing a new policy. I think, in fact, that a new policy is already in preparation. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has been preparing a new policy for a long time. The Leader of the Opposition himself has begun to think that it would not be such a bad <span class="col_5401-5402" refersTo="page_1258"/>idea if the Economic Advisory Council could possibly suggest something to him as well. But, Madame Rose, the hon. member for Hillbrow, will have to look into the crystal ball to see what U.P. policy the future holds. Hon. members of the Opposition will have to watch out, because the hon. the Prime Minister has announced that if one of the non-white peoples wants to come and speak to him about independence he is prepared to talk to them. And if in the next five years any of those non-white peoples gain independence the Opposition&#x2019;s policy will be left dangling even more than it is at present; then they will have passed the &#x201C;point of no return&#x201D; not knowing which way to turn. They do not know in any case.</p>

<p>I want to make it very clear that the United Party asks of no one to give up any of his Afrikaans-speaking or English-speaking cultural personality; it asks this of no one who wants to be a member of the United Party; if this were the case, I would not be sitting on this side of the House. Whether people are Afrikaans-speaking or English-speaking, they are equal South Africans in our eyes. Throughout my political career I personally have fought for equality, for equivalence as South Africans, and for co-operation between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. But I want to say here that I am not prepared to give up one single facet of my Afrikaans cultural personality, and those who do not want to co-operate on this basis, need not do so. They must co-operate with me as I am, and this, I want to emphasize, is the standpoint of the United Party.</p>

<p>Sir, towards the end of the discussion on his Vote, the hon. the Prime Minister started taking notice of the proposal which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had made to him in connection with Bantu homelands. I called it a challenge. The hon. the Prime Minister said that it could also be regarded as an invitation. I do not think this changes the matter to any great extent. I rather took it amiss of the hon. the Prime Minister that he raised the matter when it was no longer possible for us to reply. It is not satisfactory that one has to reply by way of interjections across the floor of the House. Be that as it may, I would have thought poorly of the hon. the Prime Minister if he had not reacted at all to what was intended as a serious proposal by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I wish to explain our position, because it again appeared this afternoon, for example from the speech of the hon. member for Randburg, that there is some misunderstanding. I am sorry to say, in addition, that the propagandists of the Government are trying to hold up a certain image of the United Party, and when the facts do not happen to correspond with that image, they conveniently forget about the facts and continue holding up their image of the United Party. For example, the Prime Minister pretended that the United Party&#x2019;s acceptance of the guide-lines laid down in the report of the Tomlinson Commission was something new, but what are the facts&#x003F; What are the ascertainable facts&#x003F; Shortly after the publication of the report of the Tomlinson Commission, the party issued a statement in pamphlet form through its information office.</p>

<p>Sir, I am deliberately going as far back as this, in order to prove to the hon. the Prime Minister that this is nothing new. It was officially placed on record after the publication of the Tomlinson report and it has been repeated over and over again in this House. The United Party therefore officially accepted the guidelines, the broad principles, of the Tomlinson <span class="col_5403-5404" refersTo="page_1259"/>Commission&#x2019;s report, and did so shortly after the report was published. But, in addition, at the general election of 1961, nine years ago, the party reaffirmed this standpoint in its election manifesto under the heading &#x201C;Development of the Bantu areas&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote">We believe in large-scale and rapid economic, social and constitutional development of the Bantu areas.</block>

<p>This too has been quoted here repeatedly. In the same election manifesto and in subsequent speeches and interviews, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition left no doubt about the nature of both the economic and the political development which the party envisaged for the Bantu areas. The Tomlinson Commission laid down as an absolute requirement that, if its proposals were to meet with any success, the main economic development would have to take place within the Bantu areas and not only through the State, but also through white private entrepreneurs from South Africa and from overseas who would have to be found to promote that development within the Bantu areas in terms of the rules of our capital system. The United Party fully accepted that aspect of the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission and it is in fact the only party which accepted that cardinal point in the report of the Tomlinson Commission, and it is to-day still the greatest weakness of the Government party and its programme that it rejected and still rejects this cardinal requirement of the Tomlinson Commission.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister ought to know better. I served on the executive of Sabra.

I attended one interview after another with Dr. Verwoerd about that.</p>

<p>I have never accepted anything else than the recommendation of the Tomlinson Commission. What is more, before the Government accepts it, very little will come of the development of the Bantu areas. Dr. Anton Rupert has proved that private white entrepreneurship in Lesotho can assist with development without its having to affect the essential basic rights of the Bantu. I think the activities of Dr. Rupert, who is assisting in the development of that territory with South African initiative, have the approval of the hon. the Prime Minister. We grant Lesotho all the possible development it can achieve. But it is the height of shortsightedness that a white South African entrepreneur can invest on a capitalistic basis in Lesotho or in Swaziland and help them to develop, but is not allowed to do so in our own Bantu areas. I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister pertinently to explain this inconsistency to us. This is therefore the Opposition&#x2019;s standpoint as far as economic development is concerned.</p>

<p>The party has been just as outspoken about the political development. It has been stated repeatedly here and outside by the Leader and other speakers of the party that the areas should be developed to the maximum autonomy which each area can achieve. Surely it cannot be put more clearly than that. In 1966, for example, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said in the <i>Sunday Express</i> of 11th December&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The basis of the United Party&#x2019;s federal plan is maximum autonomy for constituent elements &#x2026;</block>

<p>With as the ultimate object an appropriate federal association which will be based on consultation and agreement with one another according to the development and circumstances of each territory. It must be clear to everyone who is interested in the facts of the matter that the whole point of departure of the United Party in respect of the relationship between white and black in South Africa is one of decentralization of political power as far as it is practicable. Any other representation of this matter is not in accordance with the facts. I am prepared to concede that decentralization of political power between white and black is also basic to the policy of the Government. There is therefore a certain consensus of opinion on the question of basic principle. There is in fact a very broad consensus in South Africa, but there is also a very clear difference between the two sides. The differences are higher up. The Government is ideologically orientated. That is why it speaks of absolute and total physical and geographical separation. All Blacks will have <span class="col_5405-5406" refersTo="page_1260"/>to withdraw to areas which will be set up as sovereign independent states; but not even a part of the population which will be in those areas will be able to lead a decent existence. Our approach is idealistic enough, but it is far more practically orientated, because we realize that the history, the geography and the economy of South Africa and the distribution of its natural resources have joined in bringing about a certain inter-dependence among the various population groups. This cannot be wished away. This also makes the absolute policy of the Government unpractical. For this reason we are propagating a federal association, a federal unity. Contrary to what is so often said in this House on the grounds of superficial study, I now want to say that in most countries of the world where there are great population contrasts and deeprooted ethnic and cultural differences, federalism in some form or another has proved to be by far the most successful constitutional instrument for existing inter-dependence to be &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks, which countries&#x003F; I want to tell him that he only has to read the evidence which South Africa gave in the case in The Hague and that he will see there that our advocates mentioned 50 countries which have contrasts or differences of the same nature as South Africa has. More than half of the people in the world live under federal systems. Anyone who just takes a look at what is going on in the world will find that federalism in one form or another is by far the most successful constitutional instrument to reconcile any existing inter-dependence of nations with the requirement that the one will not dominate the other. Not so long ago the Czechs and the Slovaks in Czechoslovakia, who are two ethnic groups, formed a decentralized federation and in so doing achieved co-operation and peace. This happened after years of conflict. In this way one can cite one case after another.</p>

<p>We do not doubt in the least that there will be far greater agreement between white and black and far greater general support among them for the principle of decentralization of political power of white and black in South Africa if it is done on the lines we envisage. This is far more likely to succeed than the absolute objectives of the Government can. In fact, with its objectives of absolute fragmentation the Government has brought the concept of decentralization of power into such disfavour among thousands of Whites and Blacks that many who would be prepared to support reasonable objectives reject the whole idea of decentralization. This is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had in mind when he came forward with the proposal which I called a challenge. The challenge was that the Prime Minister should place his whole plan on the Table and that he should call upon his Economic Advisory Council, which is his own, trusted body, to make an estimate, <i>inter alia.</i> &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Is this not to determine political policy&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, it does not say so anywhere. But if this were to have been the case, it would have been the same as with the Tomlinson Commission; but now this is not the position in any case. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked for an estimate to be made of the full consequences of the Bantustan policy, including freedom and everything which the policy involves. He said that all this had to be placed on the Table so that it could be evaluated. Basically, however, it does not affect the principle of decentralization. It has nothing to do with the principle. It deals with the extent to which it is practicable. If the hon. the Prime Minister accepted this, if he believed in the practicability of his policy, a greater measure of consensus could at least have been achieved in regard to the handling of the whole matter.</p>

<p>However, I again emphasize that the proposal did not affect the basic principle of decentralization of political power at all. The hon. the Minister of Finance rejected the proposal very gently and he gave as his reason the fact that the Economic Advisory Council was not elected by the people. That was the only reason which he gave. That is of course no argument. The Tomlinson Commission was not appointed by the people either and, indeed, its terms of reference went a great deal further than the request of the Leader of the Opposition regarding what terms of reference should be given to the Economic Advisory Council. In fact, by way of a counter-proposal, and I think it was as a direct result of the proposal of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister of Finance did go so far as to invite industrialists to come and have candid discussions with him about the development of the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, whatever the reaction of the Government and the Prime Minister may be, there is one matter which we as Whites will have to face. We in this Parliament, as a governing body consisting entirely of Whites, can make all the plans we like, but ultimately very little will come of them if we do not obtain the co-operation of the Bantu peoples concerned. The Government stresses the independence of the Bantu areas as its main objective. A week or two ago the Prime Minister said that they could come to negotiate and have discussions with him. But have any Bantu leaders reacted to that already&#x003F; No, the fact of the matter is that there is no proof yet that any Bantu people in South Africa wants to secede on the terms of the Government. We will still have to see whether the Government will accept the conditions which they will lay down. We know, for example, <span class="col_5407-5408" refersTo="page_1261"/>what the conditions of Chief Matanzima will be. [Interjection.] We speak lightly of independence. But where is the proof&#x2014;if it exists, let them give it to us&#x2014;that any Bantu people is prepared to separate itself from the riches of South Africa, from what it regards as its economic and political potential&#x003F; Where is there any proof that anyone wants to secede on the terms of the Government&#x003F; We still have to see it.</p>

<p>However, I want to add that the hon. the Prime Minister placed the matter in the right perspective in his speech. He placed the accent on self-determination. You must remember, Sir, that self-determination not only means acceptance of the terms of the Government. It also means the right to reject them. That is included in it. Therefore I want to say to-day to the hon. the Prime Minister and the Government that, if they neglect to develop the Bantu areas radically, dynamically and as a matter of priority, the whole idea of political decentralization of power in South Africa will collapse in so far as any of the parties advocate it to-day.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister is now entering his fifth year as Prime Minister. He has influential support behind him. He has an influential Press and a large majority. But I want to tell him that what we find lacking in the Government is a realization of the urgency of the situation. No matter whether it concerns Coloureds, Indians, or Bantu in Bantu areas, there is a lack of urgency on the part of the Government. Our problems are building up in the world. One can take one matter after the other. [Interjections.] No, Sir, just take the case of the Indian population. They had two representatives in Parliament 21 years ago, good or bad. Their representation was taken away, but to this day the Prime Minister has not made any move in order to provide them with an elected body of any kind in which they can participate in the process of government. One can view the question of the Coloured people in the same light. The whole attitude of hon, members on the opposite side is that this is a matter which we must leave to the future. One need only go to the Coloured University of the Western Cape to-day and talk with the students there to see what attitude is building up against the Whites. One need only go to an international rugby match, and if one bottle flies through the air, it is very soon followed by a thousand.</p>

The time has arrived that there should be a more venturesome spirit on the part of the Government in order to tell us exactly where they are heading with all the various population groups of the country.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is not present in the House yet, and that is why I shall not reply to his speech immediately. When he comes in, and as my speech develops, I shall perhaps refer from time to time to what he has had to say in this House. We have now reached the end of a very long Budget Debate. It was a debate which was supposed to have been a very important one, because this is an important election year, with two elections. In this debate I noticed something, and I cannot allow it to pass without referring to it. In this Budget Debate the Opposition reached a low-water mark unparalleled in the history of this House. This debate involved gossipmongering and character assassination and occasionally hon. members on the Opposite side repudiated one another. That low level was in fact more in the way of a joke than anything else, I shall return to that later.</p>

<p>I do have some sympathy for the Opposition. I think I understand their problems. The task of an Opposition is to prove that the country does not have a good government, and that the country is not being governed correctly. They must on the other hand level criticism so that this good government can even be improved. I think that this was an impossible task for them, because in South Africa we have a good Government. The hon. member for Pinelands is laughing there on the other side, but I notice that it is a very embarrassed little laugh. However, it is his duty because he is a Whip and he is paid to do so. [Interjections]. Sir, I say that I have sympathy for them, because we have good government in South Africa.</p>

<p>This evening I want to mention a few requirements for good government. In the short while at my disposal I shall try to prove that in South Africa we not only have good government, but excellent government. The first proof I want to mention is that this party, from whom the government has been constituted, has over the years supplied the components for a good government. The policy followed over the years by the National Party is now being carried out to its logical consequences by this Government. That is why the task of the Opposition has become so impossible and that is why I have just a little sympathy for them. The first component for good government is political freedom. I am calling the first component freedom. I am referring here to political freedom. Who <span class="col_5409-5410" refersTo="page_1262"/>acquired for South Africa all the components of freedom&#x003F; I want to ask my hon. friends on the opposite side just one component of political freedom which they acquired for South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#maree">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is trying to reply, but he knows that he has nothing to say. It was the predecessor of this National Party or the father of the National Party, i.e. the late General Hertzog, who with the Statute of Westminster acquired for us sovereign independence in this country. I was very young at the time, but I cannot remember from my early youth that that side made a wonderfully great contribution. What I can remember from my early youth is that it was for that side of the House an extremely unpopular thing which he brought back to South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to mention a second matter. Is it not this side who said that if you want a free people, they must have the right to speak in their own language&#x003F; Was it not this side that brought this country equal language rights&#x003F; Now I want to ask those hon. members to think back a little. If they can still succeed, after I have asked the following questions, in keeping their heads above their benches, they must tell me what part they played in that language struggle. No, Sir, it was negative. It was less than nothing. It was negative. While it was imperative for us to achieve those things, those hon. members tried time and again to disparage us and oppose us.</p>

<p>But let us consider another aspect, i.e. our flag. Who acquired these symbols of our nationhood for us&#x003F; Was it that party&#x003F; [Interjections]. Yes, my old friend, you will recall how long you clung to a second flag in Natal. Oh please, that poor old friend can have nothing to say. I shall come to him later on. I shall ask him a question later on. After all, one of my failings is that I like to put questions to the United Party. Those hon. members were so embittered that they wanted Natal to secede when we got a flag of our own. That member is one of their most embittered successors.</p>

<p>Yes. there an hon. member has mentioned the friendly appelation. Who is it that got us a national anthem, and what was the attitude of those hon. friends to the national anthem&#x003F; And recently when we argued about single citizenship of this country&#x003F; To-day they are terribly concerned about citizenship. But what was the attitude of those hon. members to a single South African citizenship&#x003F; Let us look it up in Hansard. I note that the hon. member for Pinelands is laughing. No, I think the hon. member is feeling ashamed of himself. Even if he is being paid to laugh, it is nevertheless difficult. I have sympathy for the member. I know that it is difficult to laugh about this matter when people are reproaching you. It tastes is as bitter as vinegar mixed with gall. This is the past of that party which is criticizing this Government in the House, a government with a proud past.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I want to mention one last point. Who saw to it that South Africa became a Republic, and what was the attitude of that side towards this Republic&#x003F; What did those hon. members do during the last election&#x003F; They asked the voters to hand over to their tender care this fine fledgling of ten years, whom they wanted to murder before his birth. It was a reckless thing to do. It was so reckless that the hon. member for Simonstown said in the Swellendam constituency that they helped fight for the Republic. We know how they helped to fight for it. They helped fight to kill it at birth. Now, however, they have the temerity to go to the country and to ask that the Republic, in its tender years, be entrusted to them so that they can have another chance to kill it.</p>

<p>Because this nation is aware of what political freedom means to people and what its value is, it is our policy in this country to lead the various peoples living together in South Africa to political freedom. I shall return later to this point. However, I do not want to dwell any longer on the first component, i.e. freedom. My old friends on the opposite side are very embarrassed. I quite like their being boisterous when I am speaking. However, when I am discussing this subject, it is not possible for them to be boisterous, even if they wanted to. Some, if not all of those members, have too much self-respect to do so.</p>

<p>The next matter I want to discuss is prosperity. Now, I do not want to make a speech on economics here. I merely want to talk to them for a while as a farmer, and then I want to show how ridiculous that hon. young member for King William&#x2019;s Town was when he said that this Government had plunged this nation into poverty.</p>

<p>Oh please, we are so used to the nonsense of the hon. member for Sea Point that we take no further notice of it. [Interjections], But I want to ask, how did we succeed in establishing this high standard of living which we have in South Africa&#x003F; Was it through poverty and hardship&#x003F; Another testimony to our prosperity is our sound monetary unit. I think there are few monetary units in the world which are as sound and more sought after than our rand. [Interiection]. The next question I want to ask is this: If a country has a balance of payments such as South Africa has, does it not have prosperity&#x003F; No, those people have an <span class="col_5411-5412" refersTo="page_1263"/>impossible task. If a country has the industrial expansion South Africa has, does it not have prosperity&#x003F; Yes, it has, but now I want to relate a little anecdote in regard to my constituency. They say there that we boast of our economic progress and our industrial expansion, but if they had not given us Iscor, then we would not have had that prosperity. They think the Namaqualanders are so ignorant, but that is why the Namaqualanders sent them packing with nothing to show for their pains, for they thought that they could insult our intelligence. Yes, they say that if we had not had the United Party which established Iscor for us, we would never have had that economic growth. But I want to come to the third component of good government, and that is the maintenance of peace in a multiracial and multi-lingual fatherland which consists of various peoples. If there is one thing which could lead to friction and dissatisfaction, it is the structure of South Africa. Show me another country with the potential for friction and problems that South Africa has. Yet this Government has led the country in such a way that to-night we have peace and harmony among all the peoples of South Africa, because it understood the problem of all the people, and did not, like those hon. members, try to argue away the facts with fallacious statements and insubstantial stories. No, we admitted we were more than one people, and we want to teach those peoples to be themselves and we want to help them to be themselves in this multi-national father-land. This is our concept, and when we have one day finished establishing the peoples in South Africa, I want to make the statement here and give the guarantee that the United Party will say that it was, after all, they who first came forward with the concept of multinationality; it was after all, they who led the peoples to independence. They have done so with everything this Government has established. Sir. on that basis of multi-nationality we are bringing about harmony and peace in South Africa which is unparalleled in the history of South Africa. But we have also brought peace among the white language groups in South Africa. I am now entering a sphere where I would be very pleased if the hon. member for Bezuidenhout would return. But I understand, the hon. members for Bezuidenhout and King William&#x2019;s Town are falling out in regard to what the policy of the United Party is, and I wonder who the referee is. Yes, the hon. member for Yeoville is playing the role of referee, but I wonder whether he can solve the problems. But now I want to state candidly, I have learned to believe that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings one hears the truth.</p>

<p>Then tell us the truth.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#maree">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Has the hon. member for Yeoville managed to restore peace&#x003F; But I think the hon. member for Yeoville has a difficult task on his hands. We have heard here to-night a young hon. member, with the impetuosity of youth, admit that the basis on which that party wants to find peace, is that the Afrikaner must cease to be an Afrikaner. [Interjections]. He stated this unequivocally. He said that was the basis. He is a dyed-in-the-wool United Party supporter and since his childhood days his father has been teaching him that he must stop being an Afrikaner, and then he would see national unity in South Africa. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Zululand whether he is prepared to stop being English. I want to ask the hon. member for Durban and a few other hon. members there the same question. Are they prepared to stop being English&#x003F; No, I maintain that it was because they were trying to build national unity on a false basis that they were unable to succeed in doing so.</p>

<p>But I want to quote another juvenile to prove what I said here, that it is the policy of the United Party that the Afrikaner must sacrifice his Afrikanerdom. I want to quote what a certain Mr. Japie Basson said when he was still a young man and still had a love for the truth. In 1960 a correspondent of <i>The Argus</i> came to him and put questions to him, and wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I asked Mr. Basson: &#x201C;Why did you leave the United Party&#x003F;&#x201D; and he replied &#x2026;</block>

<p>Listen oarefully now. At the time he was a young man who still had a love for the truth, when the truth was still be heard from the mouths of sucklings, and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believed in national unity of English&#x2014; and Afrikaans-speaking people. I still do. That is what the National Union is working for. But you would not believe me what the attitude towards Afrikaans and Afrikaans institutions was in the United Party in those days when I left the United Party. For instance, I ran into bitter hostility in the United Party because I banked at Volkskas. Once I helped to organize a rally in Cape Town. Afrikaans-speaking delegates from all over the country attended. All the proceedings were in English, not a word of Afrikaans. When I protested, the chairman complained about me to General Smuts. At the Paarl by-election in 1939 the Peninsula office-bearers of the United Party came to help us. When he entered the office I greeted him in Afrikaans and he said: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t talk that language here in this office&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That was when the hon. member was still a youngster, and spoke the truth. But I just want to complete my arguments. [Interjections.] If there is time, I shall reply to questions. I want to allege that a certain Mr Japie Basson said that there is no place for an Afrikaner in the United Party. Sir, it is that youngster who has now grown up and who now says that his <span class="col_5413-5414" refersTo="page_1264"/>young back-bencher was a little undiplomatic. That young back-bencher, with all the impetuosity of youth, made only one mistake; he spoke the truth; that is all. And that is the same mistake Mr. Japie Basson, at present the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, made in his youthful impetuosity when he said when he was still young that there was no place for the Afrikaner in the United Party, and when he told the Press what I have just quoted. But to-night he is saying that that young member does not know what the policy of the United Party is. Oh my, Mr. Chairman, how bitter it is to be a United Party man! How grateful I am that I was never a United Party supporter. Opposed to this there is the honest, fine, open policy of the National Party which says that we want co-operation between the white races in South Africa; the closest, the strongest, the best co-operation, but on a specific basis. Sir, that basis is one of respect for each other&#x2019;s rights. That basis is that I shall respect you, I shall respect your language, your culture, your traditions, and your identity. But I demand the same for myself; I demand that I, too, be shown respect. I do not expect you to come and tell me that I must relinquish my Afrikanerdom, and that only then can we co-operate. Wonderful honesty. Sir! I should like the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to give me a reply to this.</p>

<p>Sir, my time is up. There is a tremendous amount I still want to say, but let me say a few words about the next component, i.e. security. Do we have security in this country of ours to-night&#x003F; Yes, of course! In this Africa, in this world of unrest, we find ourselves to-night in one of the most peaceful countries in the world, and how did we acquire that security&#x003F; We acquired it because we were not afraid to do certain things and to adopt certain standpoints. We have built up a defence force here; we have built up a police force here; we have a Bureau for State Security here, and we are not ashamed of it. Hon. members on the opposite side arraigned us overseas and said that we were becoming a police state. When the hon. the Prime Minister, in his capacity at the time as Minister of Justice, came forward with his General Laws Amendment Bill, you will recall, Sir, how we had night sittings. The youngsters in this House will not remember it, but the old members will. Did we not have night sittings on the 90-day clause&#x003F; Did we not have a night sitting on the 180-day clause&#x003F; Was the hon. the Prime Minister not berated as a terrible person, as a monster, as a Nazi, because he introduced these things into South Africa in order to stabilize the security of South Africa&#x003F; But we also have security because we have a policy in terms of which there is satisfaction and peace, because people who live at peace with one another, never feel insecure. No, this Government brought us security. We are grateful for that security. The Opposition has a difficult task. While all these components of good government are contained in this Government, while we are enjoying the advantages of good government in South Africa, the Opposition is finding it difficult to state a good case, and for that reason I want to excuse them for stooping to gossip mongering, character assassination and joking repudiations of one another, because they do not know what to say any more.</p>

<p>Under this aspect of security, I want to mention one more thing, and that is the security of survival. Sir, under this Government with its policy one feels that one has security of survival in the group, in the race, in the nation of which you are a member, because we have a policy which safeguards that survival. I should very much like to compare the standpoint of the two parties, but my time is almost up. In the few minutes at my disposal, I should however, just like to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and I hope that he will have the decency to reply to it, because I have in my constituency openly been made out to be a liar. I challenge my United Party friends to ascertain what the position is and then to come along and inform me in public whether I had told a lie. I told them what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had said in an interview with a certain magazine, <i>Beacon,</i> in January 1966, in reply to a question which a journalist had put to him. He put various questions to him, and asked <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is it possible; could a Coloured become Prime Minister under United Party policy&#x003F;</block>

<p>Whereupon the hon. gentleman said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is highly unlikely but it is not impossible.</block>

<p>When I made this statement in Namaqualand, a lot of United Party men came to their feet and said: &#x201C;It is untrue, and we refuse to remain at your meeting; you are insulting our leader&#x201D;. I issued that challenge and said that if the hon. members of the Opposition could get their leader to repudiate that this had taken place, I would strongly consider withdrawing my candidature in that election and making Mr. Cornelissen a present of that seat. Up till this day those heroes have not taken my challenge any further. I said that if they could ascertain from Sir De Villiers Graaff, the Leader of the Opposition, that he had in fact made those statements, then I expected them to have the decency&#x2014;and at the time I still thought that they had some decency&#x2014;to rise to their feet in a meeting and to say that they were sorry that they had made Mr. Maree out to be a liar, and would at a public meeting admit: &#x201C;My Leader did say this!&#x201D; To this day I have heard nothing from them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if you stop me I shall resume my seat. I want to go further until my time is up. One night, in the same constituency, <span class="col_5415-5416" refersTo="page_1265"/>we asked Senator Redi Louw, who alleged that they were the greatest advocates of apartneid, why they had originally opposed the Group Areas Act. He then said that surely we knew that they had not really opposed it. He said that it was such a poor Act, that they had merely tried to improve it a little. I discussed this with him further, and he landed himself in terrible difficulties. The next evening, when I attended the meeting of Mr. Cornelissen, he replied to my first question on group areas: &#x201C;Oh please, do not be ridiculous. Surely you know that the Group Areas Act is an Act which we passed&#x201D;. This is the United Party, and those are the people who want to govern our country. This is the party that has the temerity to conduct a Budget Debate with this Government. This is the hon. the Leader who has to lead those people, who sees his way clear to debating with our Prime Minister. Still, I have every sympathy with the hon. gentleman, because I know that it is a bitter task to get anywhere with such followers. It is an impossible task. That is why I am sorry for him, and I want to give him some good advice: Call the people to order. He must tell the people that he also endorses the policy of the National Party. They must stop obstructing this party in its policy in the implementation of its good government. They must also try to be a little more positive in the years which lie ahead and to support us in the policy which we advocate. They must demolish their negative approach.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, at one juncture in his speech, gave me such a fright that my heart almost stopped beating. He began to make overtimes. He said that in regard to certain points we were very close to one another. I hope that he is not seeking an opportunity for the next phase of his political hitch-hiking trip. It will be a bitter day for me if I had to pick him up. As hospitable Afrikaner, how will we be able to drive past him if he is standing in the road hitching a ride&#x003F; [Interjections.] I now want to make an appeal in advance to our pilot: &#x201C;Please, Mr. Prime Minister, if you drive past him, look the other way. I know that it is not easy for a generous man to drive past someone who is hitching a ride. But this is going to create problems for us in future. So please drive past.&#x201D;</p>

It is a pity that this will be an emotional election. It is obviously an attempt to change the debate again as we have experienced so often in this session in Parliament where Government members attempt to change the debate from things which really matter, to these emotional matters.

<p>The greatest Afrikaners were in the United Party and in the old South African Party and not in the Nationalist Party. They are the people who did more than anybody else to build up this country to what it is to-day. They were the people who were able to ensure that we live in peace in this country to-day. I would like to remind him, and the hon. Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education will probably appreciate this, that at the Treaty of Versailles it was General Botha who represented South Africa after our participation in the First World War.</p>

<p>That is right, one of the hon. members asked who is General Botha&#x003F; He was the Commandant of the Boer forces who put up a wonderful fight against the British forces and the Nationalists ask &#x201C;Wie was hy&#x003F;&#x201D; Yes, they have just forgotten one of the Boer leaders. Because of Louis Botha&#x2019;s participation in the 1914-1918 war and his presence at the Treaty of Versailles, South Africa was recognized <i>de facto,</i> if not <i>de jure,</i> as an independent state. It was through the efforts of General Smuts and the United Party that we were able to play a full part after the last war and so again received international recognition. I would like to remind him too that if it were not for the part that the United Party played in 1934 with General Hertzog and General Smuts, the Status Act may not have been passed. Because of the passing of the Status Act, we were able to declare a Republic without getting the permission of the British Governmenet. Otherwise we would have been in the same position as Rhodesia is to-day. [Interjections.] I know that they do not like swallowing this when they look at their record of the past and when they look at what they have done to attain international recognition.</p>

<p>I also like talking about national unity, about this new idea of the Nationalist Party. The hon. member wants to remind us of things which he said happened in the past. I do not believe him, because I think he is misinformed. <span class="col_5417-5418" refersTo="page_1266"/>The proof of this to me is Chat the member for Bezuidenhout now sits in the United Party and not in the Nationalist Party.</p>

They refused to give him that guarantee and General Hertzog and Mr. Havenga had to leave the Nationalist Party. We do not like bringing up all this old history. We would like to forget it, but in this election, they are going Co make an emotional appeal to the Afrikaans-speaking people and that is what we will have to face. If they do it we will also hit back when they try to appeal to the English-speaking people. I am an English-speaking member of the United Party and I support our attitude that neither section, neither the English-speaking nor the Afrikaans-speaking section, must surrender their identity. You do not have to do it in the United Party.</p>

<p>This is an important session, because the Government have been compelled, albeit reluctantly, to make important policy statements. They have realized that the criticisms of the intellectual and the economists are meaningful, that they cannot merely rely on party loyalty any more. Party loyalty is not as strong as it used to be when they relied solely on emotions. What the people are now worrying about, including Nationalist supporters, is the good of the State. The 1970 election, although it did not bring about a change of Government, has certainly brought about some changes in Government policy. The wind of change has certainly come. The supporters of the Government, not necessarily the Members of Parliament here, but the people who count, economists and intellectuals, are worrying about the future of our country. They are not so concerned any more with prejudice and party loyalty.</p>

<p>It is being realized more and more, too, that Dr. Verwoerd was not infallible and there is a readiness now to depart from much of his policy. Some of the departures have been wise, for instance the change of policy with regard to development of the reserves. Others, of course, have not been so wise, for instance the abolition of Coloured representation in this House of Assembly. It is a departure from Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy which has not been so wise.</p>

I should like to remind hon. members of what his attitude was, because they are apt to forget it and to deny it. They are apt to pretend that this has always been their policy. I want to read to them what Dr. Verwoerd said in this House. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the Native territories are concerned, I have always spoken only of the development of Native industries there&#x2014; Native-owned and Native-financed industries, managed by Natives in the Native territories.</block>

<p>That was Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s attitude in one statement he made. Then, in 1962, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is why our approach is that while we want to give white initiative an opportunity amongst the Bantu, the furthest we can go is up to the border of the Bantu area, because in that way we give the Bantu the benefit of being able to develop within his own town and to develop his own tertiary industries because the capital that he earns in the white area can then be used by him for further development.</block>

<p>Yes, on the agency basis, but is the Deputy Minister now saying that the suggestion of the Minister himself should be followed, namely that these people must be flown out to their homes for the week-ends, or must they be established in the Reserves&#x003F; Of course their families are going to be established there. The Deputy Minister knows that they are going to establish a new white town in Umtata. They intend establishing factories there, and white people will have to work in those factories. They will therefore have to have their homes there. He is suggesting just what Dr. Verwoerd wanted to avoid. Dr. Verwoerd wanted to avoid a white colony being established there. The Deputy Minister can get up and explain what he meant in his speech to the Rapportryers.</p>

Dr <span class="col_5421-5422" refersTo="page_1268"/>Verwoerd even went so far as to try to prevent others from taking part in such development. He even wanted to stop public bodies, like the Umtata Municipality, from taking part in that development. In 1956 the Umtata Municipality wanted to establish a hydro-electric plant at the Tsitsa Falls. They had to obtain permission from him to carry the electricity a short distance over Trust land to Umtata. They pointed out to him that the power so generated would be available to the Department for other development as well. The power would be available to the Natives living in the area as well. Dr. Verwoerd refused permission. He turned down the request because it would involve the acquisition by such a body of rights in and the utilization of resources in a Native area. And so he stopped it.</p>

<p>They belong to municipalities and not to private individuals. The municipality was going to make that electricity available to Government Departments and to the Bantu for development. But he even stopped that. The Government is now attempting to take capital in on an agency basis. The Deputy Minister as well as the Minister gave information about the number of firms who have applied for those contracts. This Government has now been in power for 22 years. If this has always been their policy, why do they lag behind so much&#x003F; How many people have been given employment under the agency basis&#x003F; I asked the hon. the Minister a question in the House the other day and was told that 1,600 had so far been given employment. That cannot accommodate the people who are living in the Transkei or any other Reserve. That was for all the Reserves and not only the Transkei. This agency business is not working. They may have applications from a few people. The question however is how many Bantu are going to be employed&#x003F; I should like to know from the hon. the Minister how many are being employed&#x003F; Unless you offer them the profit basis, industrialists will not go in. We say capital must go in on a controlled basis; we do not advocate the free access of white capital. We say that it must be on a controlled basis and we gave the example of what we did at Zwelitsha when we established the Goodhope Textile Industry.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>We gave them a long lease on the land. What did Dr. Verwoerd say he was going to do about that&#x003F; He was going to take that factory out of the Reserve. He never did but he said in the House that he was going to take it out of the Reserve. He said that it was wrong to have a white industry in the Reserve. It is naturally going to be difficult to attract white capital into the Reserves. Everybody agrees that we will have to have white capital in the Reserves otherwise there will be no development. With no development, the Government cannot carry out its policy. The hon. the Prime Minister has realized that there is going to be some reluctance of white capital going into the Reserves. The industrialists remember the warning given by Dr. Verwoerd when he was Minister of Native Affairs. He then warned that if white capital went into the Reserves or Protectorates and these Protectorates ultimately gained independence and industries were nationalized and they suffered damage in some form or other, they were not to come to him for protection. That is why the hon. the Prime Minister has now given the assurance that if industrialists who establish themselves on an agency basis suffer any loss as a result of the homeland becoming independent, this Government will indemnify them against any political action taken by that Government. These assurances have become very necessary because of two recent statements made by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and by the Prime Minister. These assurances have now become doubly important because industrialists are going to be less likely than ever to go in.</p>

<p>There was a lot of talk about the independence of the homelands, the Reserves. We all thought it was a long way ahead. Dr. Verwoerd said that he did not want &#x201C;verbrokkeling&#x201D; at that stage. The way he spoke the country was given the impression that it was going to take place over a long time. Then the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration said the other day that the Reserves did not necessarily have to be able to maintain or support their own people before they got independence. Then we had the Prime Minister saying that he was inviting them to ask for their independence. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration in defending his attitude that the homelands need not be economically strong enough to support its own population, quoted Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland. He said that the gross national income of each of those states was less than that of the Transkei. May I remind the hon. the Minister that these three Protectorates received financial assistance from Britain: but it was not enough. So what do they do&#x003F; They go to another country to get assistance; they have come to us, and Botswana may go elsewhere as well. Once we give independence to our Native states and they are not viable, they are going to look for assistance as well. Surely, what is happening in those three states <span class="col_5423-5424" refersTo="page_1269"/>ought be a lesson to the Government that unless a state is viable it may also have to look for assistance and it may get that assistance elsewhere and not from us. That is what concerns us to-day, and that is what is happening in Botswana. The Transkei seems to be the first reserve which will get independence. The Prime Minister of course says it is self-determination.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said:</p>

<block name="quote">We are in fact guiding them along the road to self-determination. We are in fact educating them into being mature enough for self-determination. We are in the process of training them.</block>

<p>Now, what does self-determination mean&#x003F; It means that they will have the right to choose, and supposing they do not choose independence, supposing they say they do not want independence, then they have the right tho choose what they want. The word &#x201C;self-determination&#x201D; is meaningless unless you give them the right to choose what they want, and if they choose to stay part of South Africa, part of the Republic and to be represented in this Parliament, have they not that right&#x003F; [Interjection.] The Prime Minister says &#x201C;no&#x201D;, but then it makes his claim that he is giving them self-determination hollow and meaningless. The only choice they have is that they either can become independent or remain reserves on the conditions set out by the hon. the Prime Minister. What choice is that&#x003F; That is not self-determination. But let us take the Transkei, the reserve which is most advanced. What is happening there&#x003F; Supposing they ask for independence, which incidentally they are not going to do because they do not want it and they have said so. I want to ask the Prime Minister, to do something. He met a deputation from Port St. Johns some years ago when he visited Umtata. Here you have a colony of Whites completely surrounded by a black state and the only way out is by a road which has been proclaimed a national road, but that road has not even been located on the one side from Port St. Johns to Natal. They asked for that road to be put into a proper state and nothing has been done. The Prime Minister has not even answered their deputation.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>His reply was that nothing had been done because there was a shortage of staff. They cannot locate the road and they are not tarring the road. [Interjection.] That is no explanation. Those people are entitled to have a proper way of access and exit to and from Port St. Johns. They are completely cut off there and the least the Government can do, seeing that it is the Government which put them in that position, is to build a decent road for them. If there are flooding rains, they are cut off completely and they cannot get in or out. That is not right and they asked the Prime Minister to do something because they failed with the other Minister, and my appeal to him is to do something and to tell us what. Now the Prime Minister will admit this, too, that if you are going to set these people on the road to independence, you have to see that law and order are maintained and you have got to have proper communications. Who maintains law and order&#x003F; It is the Police and the communications are kept open by the Post Office and by the Railways. Now the civil servants who work in that area, in the Transkei, get special allowances, territorial allowances and also housing loans, but the Police who are responsible for maintaining law and order and the Post Office and the Railways do not get those allowances, and it is most unfair. They are the people who work under more difficult circumstances than the civil servants do. And the reason why they cannot get the allowances is that they work for the Transkei Government, whereas the public servants are seconded to the Transkei Government. Sir, there is difficulty in getting teachers. People are reluctant to go to the Transkei unless the remuneration is high. In order to get teachers there, the Provincial Administration of the Cape pays the teachers an extra allowance and gives them a housing allowance. Why should only the Railwaymen, the Police and the Post Office employees be the people to suffer&#x003F; Sir, I have made an appeal to the different Ministers on this issue but they have done nothing about it. The Minister of Railways seems to control that issue. I am now appealing to the Prime Minister to intervene and to look after these people. It is in the interest of the country as a whole to see that law and order is maintained there and that communications are kept open. What the Government should do is to ensure that they have an efficient and satisfied staff to carry out those duties. I appeal to him again to see that this is done. As I have said, unless those Departments are kept going, there will be a complete collapse of the administration in the Transkei.</p>

<p>Sir, as far as the policy of separate development is concerned, this policy of granting independence to the reserves, the position is that at the moment the Government is lucky in that none of the political parties in the Transkei wants independence. The democrats certainly do not want it and Chief Kaizer Matanzima and his party say that they are not going to ask for it until they are viable. But, Sir, you are going to find that some of the other reserves will ask for it. I think it is time the Prime Minister told the country, in <span class="col_5425-5426" refersTo="page_1270"/>view of his indication to all the reserves to come and see him to ask for independence, where their boundaries are going to be.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Prime Minister where Mdantsane was in 1936; was it part of a reserve or was it part of a white area&#x003F; It was part of a white area, and the Government then made it a reserve, alongside East London, and now they say that the Bantu working in the border areas of East London are accommodated in a reserve. Sir, the Prime Minister knows that you can move the boundaries. I must say that the only realistic thing that I saw in the reports of the meeting that Sabra is holding at De Aar is the statement made by one of the professors at the meeting that it was time the Government told the country where the boundaries are going to be, because nobody knows where they are. My appeal to the Prime Minister is to set at rest the worry in the minds of people in the country, especially those living near the reserves, as to where the final boundaries are going to be. The Prime Minister knows that Chief Kaizer Matanzima who supports the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development, has asked for certain areas to be added to the Transkei. He keeps on asking for it and he is not always going to be put off. The Prime Minister should now tell the country definitely where the final boundaries will be; then there can be no more trouble caused to people because of the fact that different Bantu chiefs ask for more areas to be added to their land.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to elaborate much on the problems of the hon. member for Transkei. His problems remind me of the joke one hears about a man and a woman who were married, and who, on teturning from their honeymoon, found that their parents had built a house for them, that the house had been fully furnished, cot and all. That night they went to bed; early the next morning the man went over to the cot and, on seeing that there was still nothing in the cot, he said to his wife that he really could not understand it. Sir, this is how innocent the U.P. members are. When one refers to the homelands and homeland freedom, they, on rising from their beds the next morning, expect us to have the title deed for those homeland borders quite ready, so that they may go about and spread gossip. [Interjections.] Sir, what did that hon. member say in a debate here the other day&#x003F; When the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development sounded a slight warning to those people who are always in league with the Bantu and asking them to collaborate against the National Party, against the National Party&#x2019;s aspirations and its stated policy, the hon. member for Transkei was the only one of the three who were under suspicion who came forward and said that he did not accept the Minister&#x2019;s warning; that he would, whenever he pleased, consult and visit any Bantu whom he wished to consult and visit, and that he would not allow himself to be threatened by the Minister.

It is the empire of that side of the House. They are the people who are attacking us now. The hon. member for Sea Point has even said that they are also standing for certain things now for which the National Party stands. He does at least want to keep Sea Point white, and now a block of flats has to be erected close to Sea Point, flats in which the non-Whites working in Sea Point may be housed. This is the kind of double-faced story with which they are going to the voters. In Klip River we came across this from house to house. By refraining from putting up someone as a candidate in Klip River, Natal could now have proved to the rest of the Republic of South Africa that they have appreciation for any person who exerts himself for bringing English and Afrikaans-speaking people together. But they are more ungrateful than the black people I know, and so they nominated a sour-mouthed (<i>bitterbek</i>) jingo in that constituency.

<p>That hon. member has least reason to complain. He is one of the chaps who went around in the road camp and told the people that they were living in such simple houses because the National Government did not want to make money available for better housing. But he did not tell them that it was the Provincial Administration of Natal which had built those houses. Nor did he tell them that an amount of R<b>8</b> million of the National Road Fund was being ploughed back. No, this he did not tell them. He said that the poor housing conditions which prevailed in the road camp in Drakensberg, were the fault of the National Government. This is the kind of story they tell. And then they still think that they can get away with it. However, we followed them closely and we were able to expose those stories and explain what the right position was.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to what I wanted to say. If they only had the decency displayed by my farm labourers, who, whenever I give them a piece of bread or a plate of porridge, say, &#x201C;Thank you, Master&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Thank you, Sir&#x201D;, then they would not have put up a candidate there. But they have now destroyed the 9&#x00BD; years which the Administrator of Natal sacrificed for the purpose of bringing English and Afrikaans-speaking people together, by nominating a candidate to oppose him. Fine, this may be their right, but then they still had no right to exploit his Afrikanership, his cultural ties and his position. They did the rounds there and tried to influence our Afrikaner people by saying that Mr. Gerdenr had allegedly admitted that he was a member of the Broederbond. But none of them had the courage to say to what organizations in South Africa they belonged so that we might tell the voters where they were carrying on their intrigues at night. This is the cowardice with which we had to deal. But, what is more, they fought the election and lost it. In the course of the 9&#x00BD; years during which Mr. Gerdener was Administrator, he put Natal on the map. He played a major role in making it possible for an amount of more than R110 million to be poured into dams and reservoirs alone. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I know that that side of the House is sensitive about this matter, for in 1948 no provision had as yet been made for Government dams in Natal. The industrialization in Natal, the fact that Natal was put on the map, and the inquiry into the Tugela catchment area, all of these are things which they now claim to have come about through their efforts. Surely, this is not true. That survey was made on the <span class="col_5429-5430" refersTo="page_1272"/>instructions of the National Government. Capital expenditure on Natal is out of all proportion to similar expenditure in all the other provinces. All these things are to the advantage of Natal, and instead of their being grateful for them, they proceeded to fight us tooth and nail because we dared to nominate a National Party candidate in Klip River.</p>

<p>However, that is not all. This matter goes much further than that. In regard to the United Party, I want to state unambiguously to-night that they are a diabolical party which is reaching down the depths and trying to get hold of the marrow of the Afrikaner and the artery of his heart. I say this, because even if the Government were, with the best of intentions, to announce a scheme in Natal, they and the organs supporting them would see a dark motive behind it. A dam is to be built shortly at Albert Falls, which is situated in my constituency. Their organs are speaking well of this project, but they have also informed the people that boating will now disappear completely and that a deep dam will be built, whereas previously people could swim there in hip-deep water and sail their boats. The name of this place is Lake Peattie. They did not ask the people who are living around Lake Peattie, for those people, although they are English-speaking, are National Party supporters. We take our has off to them, because in spite of the United Party&#x2019;s intimidation they still have the courage of their convictions to stand by us. If one wants to be an English-speaking Nationalist in Natal, one should really know how to hold one&#x2019;s own, because one does not know to what sinister forces the United Party in Natal may resort in order to liquidate, intimidate and cast suspicion on these people. They always seek help behind the colour bar. The hon. member for Zululand and the hon. member for South Coast should not adopt such a sanctimonious attitude here, for they are the gossip-mongers. That hon. member for Zululand is the man who, for instance, when cattle were poisoned on a certain farmer&#x2019;s farm, sent his lieutenants to obtain the particulars because the Government was allegedly too slow in paying out that claim. That is the kind of thing on which they live.</p>

<p>That is not all. The moment the sluices of the Josini Dam, or rather the J. G. Strydom Dam, are shut off during times of drought, and the water level of the lakes behind the embankment of the dam starts dropping, the non-Whites are told that their fishing waters will disappear one of these days, because the water level is dropping so tremendously. Every day one sees in the newspapers that the northern parts of Lake St. Luoia are becoming so salty that the fish have disappeared. These things are not done with the intention that a solution has to be found, but with the intention that the non-Whites, who are dependent on the fish in that lake and who have to make a living out of it and whose food it is, should develop an allergy to the National Party and to the National Government. It is for that reason that I said a moment ago, at the beginning of my speech, that the hon. member for Transkei did at least have the courage of his convictions.</p>

I have a suspicion that the latest anti-Government statements and demands for more land, as well as other demands of a divergent nature, which are directed at the Government, actually originated with the hon. member for Zululand, for he is the man who engaged in gossip-mongering all over Zululand.

<p>But they bring those matters to the public notice. Now, one may wonder why they do not publicise the Wilks case. He was a member of their executive committee, charged with hospital services. Before we knew where we were, virtually all the laundries were in his possession and the hospitals were obliged to have their washing done at those laundries. But they do not come to this House with this kind of case. They are really a diabolical party, because they do not care what forces they enlist and what forces they unleash in order to plough the Afrikaner and the Nationalist under. Sir, unfortunately time does not allow me to say much more, but I can give you the assurance that, if I did in fact have the time, I would prove to you tonight, giving chapter and verse, how these people who are pretending to be so pious before us, are colluding with enemies behind our backs. I have reason to say that they would not stop at anything to achieve their objectives, because they have not reached the level of development where they can be incited without using violence.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, mindful of the good advice recently given in a newspaper by an expert on parliamentary procedure and etiquette, a person who had recently announced his retiremenet after 41 years of active political service, as to what the contents of a new member&#x2019;s maiden speech should be, I should like to give you the assurance that I shall adhere strictly to the procedure of the past and to the traditions of this House.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure for me to represent the constituency of Odendaalsrus in this House, and more particularly to be able to do so on this side of the House. It is a pleasant privilege and an honour to me, because this <span class="col_5431-5432" refersTo="page_1273"/>is an outstanding constituency. It is outstanding because it forms the heartland of the Free State maize area, because it produces a large part of the Free State&#x2019;s gold, because clear signs of industrial establishment and growth are already discernible, and particularly because of the exceptional people who live in that constituency. Thus we find that all three the corner-stones on which the South African economy rests, namely agriculture, mining and industry, are very strongly represented in the constituency of Odendaalsrus. In respect of each of these three aspects I have something special to say, but I hope to do so in due course in further sessions of this House.</p>

<p>What I intend saying now, I want to say with reference to the political currents in our country, especially with reference to one particular group which is at present operating outside this House, but more particularly with reference to rumours which I came across in my election campaign and which were designed to prejudice my candidature and which concerned the position I would allegedly take up in South African politics in the future. I therefore want to make it very clear to the voters of Odendaalsrus and to the members of this House that in South African politics I am standing where I have always stood. The voters of Odendaalsrus will always find me standing where I am standing now. By this I mean that I regard it more as a task and as a duty, that I regard it as a sacrifice to my country and my people to assist the Government in its great task of governing this country in such a way that it will be to the advantage of every population group living in this country.</p>

<p>I shall assist it in its great task of implementing its relationships policy, so that racial peace and harmony may be maintained. I shall assist it in its great task of guiding the Bantu homelands to full independence, so that stability may be brought in Southern Africa. I shall assist it in its great task of establishing bonds of friendship with our neieghbouring states and the rest of Africa, so that insight and understanding may be created. I shall assist it in its great task of deciding for itself how this country will be governed, without being dictated to by others but under the guidance of the Holy Trinity, and how the people of this country shall live here. I therefore say unequivocally that I wholeheartedly endorse the policy of the National Party and the way in which it is being implemented, and that I support the Prime Minister in his great task. I support him in the lead constantly being taken by him in order to implement this policy in this way. The hon. member for Sea Point laid down certain requirements for security and prosperity, and as illustrated by the hon. member for Namaqualand, it is precisely these aspects in which we are all interested, regardless of our political views, namely the protection and the security with which each of us as inhabitants of this country can go our daily ways. Unrest and uncertainty destroy progress and prosperity, and bring chaos, hardship and fear in their stead.</p>

<p>The progress and prosperity prevailing in this country is characteristic of a society which has peace and quiet as a result of good administration. Peace and quiet in a country, to the extent in which we find this in South Africa, has almost become something unique in the world to-day. More than that, it is an achievement. This unique South African situation of peace and quiet and the achievement of progress and prosperity is more than sufficient proof of the fact that the present Government has fulfilled its guarantee to the inhabitants of this country in regard to their protection and security. In more than one overseas country there are race riots, religious rebellions and terrorist activities which do not even spare the countries which are their hosts. There are student riots and youth rebellions in those countries. Compared with them, South Africa is indisputably a safer country in which to live. In a world which has become dangerous and crude, this Government has fulfilled its guarantee of protection, security, peace and quiet with great distinction, and in addition it has built up prosperity and progress on that basis.</p>

<p>Therefore it is so inconceivable that a body such as the World Council of Churches, which we would like to accept as a body with a Divine task and calling, has now revealed itself to us as a godless institution which does not even hesitate to associate itself with Communism, with the object of destroying existing order, peace and quiet in an established community. Thus far, hostile countries in Africa and terrorist organizations have taken thorough cognizance of the. guarantee by this Government that it will project and safeguard the future of this country. If the World Council of Churches has not yet heard of this guarantee, I trust that they will soon have that experience. If the Government takes action against member churches of the World Council of Churches in South Africa or against their office-bearers, it will by no means be a violation of the concept of sovereignty in their own sphere. Even less will it be illegitimate interference, as some people like to say, because the World Council of Churches overstepped the bounds of its jurisdiction when it entered a section of the political field, that field which is concerned with our protection and our security.</p>

<p>According to all standards&#x2014;religious standards, social standards and political standards &#x2014;the Government has therefore been justified in its action so far against certain officebearers of member churches of the World Council of Churches in South Africa. In conclusion, I want to express a word of thanks and appreciation to a worthy predecessor in my constituency. Ben Havemann, now the hon. the Administrator of Natal. As a member of the National Party he served the constituency of Odendaalsrus in a worthy manner in this <span class="col_5433-5434" refersTo="page_1274"/>House. I am convinced that he ewill justify the confidence placed in him in his having been appointed to the high office which he now occupies.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to congratulate the hon. member for Odendaalsrus on the fluency with which he delivered his maiden speech. I should also like to congratulate him on the charm which he exhibited while delivering that speech and the fact that he was able to deliver his maiden speech entirely without any notes. I am sure that these two things will enable him greatly to make progress, which I am sure lies before him in this House. I must say, however, that knowing that the old tradition is that one&#x2019;s maiden speech is always non-controversial, the hon. member at times reminded me of an act one sees in the circus of an acrobat walking along a tightrope with a safety net underneath him for the purpose of catching him should he fall off that tightrope in his difficult balancing act in keeping on the narrow and straight line I hope the hon. gentleman will not mind if I say that at times I feel that he was overbalancing a little from the narrow line of a non-controversial speech. Indeed, at times I wondered whether he had not fallen into the safety net. But, Sir, he did bounce back towards, the end of his speech onto the tightrope of the non-controversial speech. I am sure that as he has the ability to do that and as we witnessed here this evening that there will be a great future for him in this House. I should like to congratulate him therefore on his maiden speech.</p>

<p>The speech of the hon. member for Odendaalsrus was an interesting contrast. I may say, with that of the hon. member for Vryheid. One tends to be a little irritated by speeches such as we heard from that hon. gentleman to-night. But one&#x2019;s irritation is always tempered by the comforting thought of the great and enormous part which the two hon. and verkramote gentlemen, the hon. member for Vryheid and the previous hon. member for Klip River, now the Commissioner-General for the Zulu, Mr. Torlage, played in the recent general election in Natal in winning so many seats for the United Party. Few people did more to give to the United Party the seats of Zululand, Umlazi and Umhlatuzana than the hon. gentleman who has inst spoken, the hon. member for Vryheid. In his campaign in Natal he expressed sentiments such as he has expressed in the House tonight. To-day, 1970. is not the time for expressions and sentiments of that kind. I should like to refer to one or two of the things that he said. He made a reference to what he alleges Mai. Arthur said in the Natal Provincial Counci.</p>

<p>This was a man he alleged was the chairman of that council. As far as my knowledge goes, he is not the chairman. This person to my knowledge is fully bilingual. The hon. member made allegations in regard to that gentleman which I simply do not accept. He also made reference to the Natal Parks Board. He said that on the Natal Parks Board nobody had been appointed who was an avowed supporter of the National Party.</p>

<p>This really suprises me. I can remember when this Government came into power or shortly thereafter, prominent English-speaking South Africans, supporters of the United Party, summarily being dismissed from the Board of Trustees of the National Parks Board, people who had given their lifetime to the principle of game preservation. But we hear nothing about that to-night.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Dr. George Campbell of Durban was one of them. There are few organizations in this countiy that do a greater service for the preservation of game and enjoy better public relations with the people of this country than the staff of the Natal Parks Board. There are numbers of prominent members in this House&#x2014;and I do not propose to name any&#x2014;whom I myself have heard paying the very highest compliments to that organization for the task they are performing and the manner in which they do it in respect of all of the population of South Africa.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member refers to the lack of activity by the United Party in respect of the building of dams and the surveys being done in Natal. The hon. gentleman referred to the survey of the Tugela basin and he tried to take the kudos for the Nationalist Party in that regard. That survey was done by the Town and Regional Planning Commission of the United Party Administration in Natal. Let me say this to the hon. gentleman, that the hon. Senator Groenewald in the Other Place had the good sense to acknowledge publicly, and it stands in the Hansard of the Other Place, that that was the finest planning institution in South Africa, established and run by the United Party.</p>

<p>Finally, he referred to me personally and to the hon. member for South Coast. He mentioned that I, so he alleged, had raised, as he averred, &#x201C;skinderstories&#x201D; in regard to the Agliotti deal and the Bell issue. I certainly raised the Bell issue, which is the subject of a Select Committee inquiry and it would be improper for me to deal with it further. But so far as the Agliotti deal is concerned, such is the irresponsibility of the hon. gentleman, I have never in my life uttered a syllable in respect to Mr. Agliotti. But I may say. from what I have seen so far, that it seems to me that anybody who has commented adversely on that deal is likely to come out on the right side. Finally, as I understood the hon. gentleman, he averred that I was responsible for <span class="col_5435-5436" refersTo="page_1275"/>the demands made by the present chief executive of the Zulu Territorial Authority for additional land. [Interjections.] Well, he referred to my being responsible for demands for additional land, and if that is not what he was referring to then there is no sense in the allegation whatsoever.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to waste any more time on the hon. gentleman. That allegation likewise is wholly without foundation. Now, when I spoke in the Censure debate earlier this Session I outlined what I believed were the five basic essentials for the success of the Government&#x2019;s policy of partition. They were as follows, and I quote from Hansard of 23rd July at Col. 287. I said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the physical point of view there are certain basic essentials for the success of such a policy in respect of each Bantu nation. Firstly, there must be the existence of an area of land which is capable of forming the basis of a state. Secondly, there must be the physical presence on that land for the greater part of their lives of the majority of the Bantu. Thirdly, there must be an economy in that land area which can support the majority of Bantu living there. Fourthly, there must be an acceptance by the Bantu themselves that all their interests, material, social, spiritual and political, are in reality centred in that land area. Fifthly, there must be an ability by the white state to survive and prosper without the bulk of its present Bantu labour.</block>

<p>I went on to say that I did not believe there was any prospect of any of those five basic essentials being achieved. I had read earlier in that speech from an editiorial in <i>Die Burger</i> which was as follows, and I quoted a translation of that editorial&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Nationalist plan, theoretically acceptable but in practice tremendously difficult in its implementation, has to deal with a problem of disbelief, inside as well as outside the country. People ask not so much whether it is right or wrong in principle, but whether we are in earnest. They do not believe that what is said can be done or will be done.</block>

<p>Sir, where else in the world do you find in power a Government which has as one of the principal planks of its platform a policy which is the subject of almost universal disbelief&#x003F; As <i>Die Burger,</i> an official organ of the Nationalist Party, puts it, they do not believe that what is said can be done or will be done. You notice, Sir, that the disbelief is founded on two bases; not only will it not be done, but that it is not capable of being done. That disbelief arises because nowhere do we have open discussion led by the Government and involving the Government on the practical considerations arising out of the implementation of that theory. We are given lengthy dissertations on the theory itself, on the theory behind the policy of partition. We had such a speech from the hon. the Prime Minister earlier in the discussion of his Vote, to the extent that almost all of us know that theory by heart; we have heard it so many times, but neevr is anything meaningful said by the Government on the subject of its implementation.</p>

<p>Now let us take the first of the five points I mentioned earlier and examine it from the point of view of a Government that seriously intends implementing a policy of partition, a policy which it has been busy preparing and polishing in theory for some 22 years. Now the first point, as I said, whas that there must be in existence in respect of each Bantu nation, an area of land capable of forming the basis of a state. No one who has the slightest acquaintance with the fragmentation of the Bantu Reserves in South Africa will deny that the implementation of the policy of partition necessarily involves large-scale consolidation of the Bantu areas. I have been in this Parliament now for 10 years, here and elsewhere, and I have never once heard a Minister or a responsible Government member, attempt to tell this House or the country how it is proposed to consolidate the Bantu areas, what the problems are in that connection and how these problems are to be dealt with. There are people&#x2014;and this is the astonishing state of affairs we are in&#x2014;outside of the Government and outside of Parliament who discuss these matters regularly, but in Parliament, where the very heart of the discussion ought to take place there is a desert in that regard. There are people outside who sincerely believe in the policy of partition and who are prepared to discuss what is involved in its implementation. There is, for example, Prof. Lombard, Professor of Economics at the University of Pretoria, who writes in the journal of the S.A. Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns, <i>Tegnikon,</i> of March, 1967.</p>

<p>That makes it even more interesting, if a member of the Bantu Affairs Commission can say the things I am now going to read out. Then it has far greater authority than I ever thought it had. I hope the hon. gentleman will listen now. I am quoting from page 19 of the issue of March, 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Politically, the sub-region of Africa within which the Republic of South Africa is naturally endowed to play a dynamic part, has unfortunately not cooled down to a degree of stability that would allow the absolutely <span class="col_5437-5438" refersTo="page_1276"/>clear-cut identification of the separate decision-making units, but the following list is put forward as a reasonable hypothesis.</block>

<p>He is talking about the economic co-operation in South Africa and he is discussing the various units which will form the entities which will co-operate the one with the other. He then sets out the various states which he envisages and he envisages a Zulu state and a Xhosa state amongst others. Then he goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Table I contains the writer&#x2019;s personal guesses as to the identity, population sizes and incomes of these separate states. The figures should, of course, be regarded as no more than rough indications of the relative orders of magnitude.

Substantial consolidation and exchange of territory may still have to come about.</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister earlier told us that we know the boundaries, that they are laid down in the Acts relating to the scheduled Native areas.</p>

Prof. Lombard, as any intelligent man who accepts the policy of the Government is bound to do, draws a map and sets out what his view is in regard to the consolidation necessarily essential to the building up of independent Bantu states. It is very interesting. He gives to the Transkei the whole of Southern Natal and the whole of the area which can be described as East London. He gives to the Zulus the whole of the north coast of Natal up to and north of Durban and a large part of Northern Natal.</p>

<p>They disappear. He gives to the South Sothos an area called Sotholand, the greater part of the Northern Transvaal. He gives part of the Northern Transvaal to Mozambique and he gives part of the Northern Cape and the Western Transvaal to Botswana; and what is more, he goes on to quote the late Dr. Verwoerd as support for his actions in this regard. The Tomlinson Report likewise made it clear that large-scale consolidation would have to take place if this policy was to succeed and that commission was prepared to draw tentative maps to indicate the direction in which the consolidation was to take place. The hon. member for Transkei referred earlier to the Sabra Congress at De Aar, and Prof. Richards of the University of the Orange Free State, speaking at that congress is reported as having said that a solution for the race problem should include two things, a consistent campaign to convince all Whites that there should be separation and to accept the full consequences of that policy; which is one thing we are never told about in this House. Secondly, Prof. Richards said that the speedy implementation of the homeland policy should be taken to its logical conclusion. That is another thing we are never told about in this House. Referring to the pressure in the outside world, he said that South Africa should seek friends and bring its policy to conclusion as soon as possible. To seek friends, he said, would not succeed if in the end our solution does not work. And this is the problem that we likewise have in this House. At the same congress there was another professor, Prof. Nieuwoudt of the Department of Political Science at the University of Pretoria, and he is reported as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The Head of the Department of Political Science at Pretoria University told delegates at the Sabra Congress here to-day that the biggest problem in establishing independent Bantustans would be the demarcation of boundaries.</block>

<p>Prof. Nieuwoudt said disputes about border boundaires often led to international conflict and even wars and if we want to live in peace in South Africa we will have to lay down definite borders for the proposed Bantustans. He went on to say that the demarcation of the boundaries of the six Bantustans which are to be created will not, however, be an easy task. There is no suggestion that the boundaries are there already.</p>

<block name="quote">Prof. Nieuwoudt went on to say&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">The scattered locality and natural geographical problems of the proposed Bantustans, would present the biggest problem in laying down the boundaries.</block>

<p>The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said the Zulu area in Natal, the Tswana area in the Western Transvaal and North Eastern Cape and the North Eastern Transvaal area would present the biggest problems. Prof. Nieuwoudt added that the establishment</block>

<p>of the Bantustans would cost millions of rands and amongst the points that would have to be carefully weighed up would be the security of South Africa. You see, Mr. Speaker, outside of Parliament there is an earnest discussion on what is involved in the implementation of this policy. People outside who sincerely believe in this policy are prepared to discuss its implementation and everyone points out the difficulties involved. But never do we get any indication from the Government in regard to these matters. Is it surprising then, <span class="col_5439-5440" refersTo="page_1277"/>Sir, that <i>Die Burger</i> has to write a leading article saying that the problem is one of disbelief.</p>

<p>Sir, what exactly does consolidation for the purpose of partition mean&#x003F; We have been told many times that the growth of the border industrial areas is one of the best indications of the success of the policy of separate development.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. member agrees. They are a success because, we are told, there you have the beginnings of what will be large Bantu towns in the homelands adjacent to white industrial areas where there is employment for large numbers of Bantu. We are told that large black towns will grow up in the homelands adjoining the border industrial areas. Sir, where are these border industrial areas which are so often talked about&#x003F; In Natal: Hammarsdale, Pietermaritzburg, Ladysmith, Newcastle and Richard&#x2019;s Bay; in the Transvaal: Pretoria; in the Cape; East London, to name but a few of them. It stands to reason that these large Bantu towns now being established in the homelands in accordance with the Government&#x2019;s policy of partition are being established in areas which will ultimately be in the relevant consolidated independent homelands. In other words, these towns adjacent to border industrial areas can be regarded as fixed points in the process of consolidation&#x2014;as permanent points of urbanization in the future black states. An Examination of any map will show that all these border industrial areas I have mentioned are situate next to portions of the homelands which are comparatively small black islands or fragmentary pieces of homeland surrounded by white land &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; pieces of homeland that are so situate firstly that consolidation with larger black areas is essential and, secondly, so situate that such consolidation can only take place by large-scale expropriation or compulsory purchase of white areas. It is time we had some discussion on this. It is time we were told by the Government what machinery it has set up to bring about this large-scale expropriation or compulsory purchase of white-owned land. It is time we were told what planning has been done in this regard, what it is going to cost, what the sociological implications are and what the effect will be on our economy. [Interjections] I do not mind whether it is controlled or not. I should be horrified if it were not controlled but, controlled or not, the implications for the people concerned are the same, and this is something that we ought to have discussed and made known to us.</p>

<p>Sir, another of the five points raised by me in the earlier debate this yeear for the success of the policy of partition was that the white state should be able to survive and prosper without the bulk of its Bantu labour. This is another point that Prof. Richards dealt with at the congress to which I have just referred. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That migrant labour from the homelands should be seen only as a temporary measure. Eventually South Africa would have to depend on its white labour force, strengthened by immigrants, otherwise the policy of separate development would not be morally defensible.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall have to cut my speech short. There is one final point and that is the question of defence, a point which was again raised at the Sabra conference at De Aar. Sir, the question of defence in relation to the consolidation of the Bantu areas and the establishment of black states is something which I never yet heard mentioned in ten years in Parliament by hon. gentlemen on the Government benches. Sir, what is the position&#x003F; If my analysis is correct that the border industrial areas are being established next to what you might call permanent points in the scheme of things for the future consolidation of the Bantu areas, each of them being the beginning, according to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, of major Bantu towns in which freehold rights are to be granted, then what is the position&#x003F; The position is that next to the capital of South Africa, Pretoria, next to all the major ports on the eastern seaboard&#x2014; Richard&#x2019;s Bay, Durban and East London&#x2014;next to most of the major new industrial growth points in this country, namely the border industrial areas, you will have a high-density and urbanized Bantu population within 20 miles at most of those centres, forming part of the consolidated foreign black states. <span class="col_5441-5442" refersTo="page_1278"/>Sir, if that does not raise an issue which warrants discussion in this Parliament, then I do not know what does. If we are to have in respect of Durban, South Africa&#x2019;s major port, high-density Bantu population groups, not 12 or 20 miles away but on one side with a common boundary and with an independent Zulu state on either side of that port, and very much the same thing applies within a distance of five miles of Richard&#x2019;s Bay, within a distance of 12 miles of East London and within a distance of 20 miles of Pretoria which is not only the capital but the headquarters of our defence system, the centre of civil and military administration for South Africa; if that is what we are deliberately setting out to bring about, then surely at this stage at least of our history we ought to have a serious discussion on these matters. Hon. Ministers sitting opposite ought to take the House and the country into their confidence and explain not the theory of separate development which, as I say, we know off by heart, but how this is to be implemented.</p>

<p>Sir, so often in these debates hon. gentlemen opposite compare the theory behind Government policy with the implementation of what the United Party stands for, but what we ought to have is either the theory of hon. gentlemen opposite as against our theory or a comparison between what is involved in the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy and the implementation of the policy of the United Party. Sir, we have had weeks of discussion on how United Party policy is to be implemented and what effect it will have. Indeed, in every discussion we have the hon. the Prime Minister turns the debate on to that aspect of affairs. Sir, let us have just once the other side of the coin; let us have some serious discussion from the Government on the implementation of the policy of partition, as it is being freely debated in many places outside of this House, but never once, to my knowledge, in this House, because if there is a credibility gap, as <i>Die Burger</i> suggests, in respect of one of the main planks of the Government&#x2019;s policy, then a state of affairs can only develop which is to the detriment of South Africa and all its people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this debate is taking place in the late hours of the evening and also in the late hours of this Session of Parliament, and if everything goes well, we shall soon return to our homes You will pardon me if I do not react immediately to the previous speaker. I just want to devote a few brief moments to the United Party. What has this alternative government produced in this Session which can make us or the people outside believe that they will in fact be able to take over the government one day&#x003F; In my opinion, absolutely nothing. They have disappointed the people outside. They were extolled and carried by the English-language Press, but nothing has come of the high expectations which the supporters of the United Party had of it.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to mention figures and statistics here this evening, but I want to talk about the love which I have for the National Party. This National Party has a long and honourable history. We all know the National Party. Ever since 1914 the National Party has believed that every population group and language group should retain its identity. Unlike the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, we do not believe that every white group, every Afrikaans-speaking person and every English-speaking person should give up his identity so that we may be united into one people. We have always believed that we should respect all the fine attributes of the other groups, in the same way that we respect our own. In these past debates, we have heard a great deal; especially from the young members, who are conspicuous by their absence on that side this evening, about what the youth exrects of us in the future. In their absence I should like to say to them that the youth which forgets its history and the fine qualities of its people has no future. But we can safely entrust the future to the youth which preserves the history of its people and which has experienced hard and difficult times together with its people. Sir, in this national history, too, there were two roads which started in 1910 and diverged in 1912. The one was the road of Botha and Smuts and the other was the road of J. B. M. Hertzog and his followers. The road of Gen. Botha and Gen. Smuts was the road which brought them fame quickly and easily, the road which offered everything which any politician&#x2019;s heart may desire. The other road was that of J. B. M. Hertzog, the road which was difficult and strewn with problems, problems which had to be solved in the future, but the road on which the identity of the Afrikaner was preserved, the road of which he once said: Rather on the ash-heap with my friends than in the great halls with my enemies. There are members sitting in this House to-day who also had the privilege of choosing between these two roads. Yes, there are persons of my own blood sitting here who chose the easy road, that of Louis Both and Gen. Smuts.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not fighting the provincial election. I am addressing this to the young friends who asked: What can this generation offer our young people&#x003F; I want to offer them this: He who forgets his history, will go under. I want to say this evening that I am also following that road of 1914 in the footsteps of my father. He taught me that one should do unto others as you want them to do unto you. This evening we heard of the bitterness which prevailed in the byelection in Klip River. We heard of words which were uttered and which hurt people. <span class="col_5443-5444" refersTo="page_1279"/>But the National Party has still not deviated from the policy of 1912 and 1914. It has been following that policy to this day. But let the hon. members of the United Party tell me how many times they have had to change their policy over these years&#x003F; They have changed their policy more times than there are letters in the alphabet. This evening I want to say to the few English-speaking persons sitting here, that we shall continue with that policy even if not one Englishman in this country votes for us. In 1914 Gen. Hertzog said that the English-sneaking person would be able to maintain his identity, his language and the privilege of having his own culture, and that the Afrikaner would be able to do the same. We shall continue with this honourable policy even if not one English-speaking person votes for us. The young men on that side of the House have become sleepy. But let us take another look at history and let us come to the years of the rebellion. It is no use forgetting those matters and I do not want to forget my history, because I must derive the stamina for the future from the past of my people. The stamina from the past will strengthen me to continue the struggle in the interests of all race groups in this country. When we follow the course of history, we come to those bitter years, the years of a struggle between brothers, those years which are written in black in the history of our people. But then the United Party appeared under the leadership of Gen. Smuts in the years 1920 to 1923. I have mentioned this before in this House. It is those hon. members who are to-day trying to catch the worker&#x2019;s vote. If there ever was a black period in the history of the United Party in regard to its relations with the worker, then it was the period from 1920 to 1924, when the Railway workers were deliberately replaced by non-Whites. At that time the United Party deliberately sought to replace the white mine-worker by non-Whites. That is so. It seems to me that the hon. member for Pinetown has now awoken from his dreams. That is why there was a strike in 1922. Thank God the National Party came into power in the year 1924. In that year some of my comrades still sat in gaol, with the death sentence having been imposed on them. They were to be hanged because they had participated in the strike of 1922. Therefore that party should remain silent rather than talk about freedom and human rights. If one goes back in history, it appears that they did not know words like freedom and human rights. They may know them while they are sitting in the Opposition benches, but when the day comes that they govern, they will not know those words.</p>

<p>I continue. Everything which the National Party struggled to attain for the people, such as our national flag which is fluttering on our flagpoles, was opposed by those people from 1927 to 1929. Deny it if it is not true. They opnosed:it. I want to say to them that we are going to get a new flag and I challenge them to fight it again, as they did in the past. It will be a pleasure to fight, because it has always been a pleasure to fight the United Party and its policy. When we have given them a hiding, they say that they created that thing. I am afraid the member for Yeoville will jump up and say that he is in favour of the new flag. I shall also not dispute it either if he says that he was in favour of our beautiful National Anthem. My mother taught me to say a children&#x2019;s prayer when I had to go to bed at night, but I do not know what he was taught. I think it was probably &#x201C;God save the King&#x201D; and in the mornings, when he opened his eyes, the Union Jack fluttered in front of him.</p>

<p>These were the years between 1927 and 1929. The next colourful date in the history of this people, is the year 1933, the time of the coalition. We know what happened in the period from 1933 to 1939. There was the poorwhite problem in this country. Now I want us to examine that history. What did the United Party do to try to solve the poor-white question in this country&#x003F; Nothing!</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>When a Maj. Roberts of Vrededorp marched to Pretoria to ask for food for the women in that town, Gen. Smuts put him in gaol. This was not a demonstration which had been arranged as to-day&#x2019;s demonstrations are arranged. It is that stamina from the past which I received in my life which will never let me change. I do not want to change either. I shall enjoy the prosperity together with my party and my people. If my people demand that I should eat yellow mealie meal porridge, I shall eat it with a happy spirit and I shall remain a Nationalist. I now put it to the United Party that they did nothing until 1939. Then they kicked out Gen. Hertzog because he refused to be plunged into another war which was no concern of ours. I want to state clearly to-night that I have nothing against the people who went to fight for the things in which they believed, but I also had the right to choose to stay out of it. In the past a few persons have had heart cramps here, and I hope it will not happen again this evening, because it is late. To-day the United Party talks about freedom of speech and of human rights, but when they waged a war in the war years, they granted us neither freedom nor rest. It is all very well that they went to fight, but I did not go. They granted us no freedom and no rest. When that party was governing, they told everyone whom they asked to help them, that he was able-bodied and should join up to go to war. I said that I would not go and fight. I owe the British Empire nothing. To this day I have never owed it a penny. But it owes me a great deal. One evening I was accosted about three-quarters of a mile from my home and told that I should not go home because the Knights of the Truth <i>(Waarheidsridders</i>) were waiting for me there. These are things we cannot forget. <span class="col_5445-5446" refersTo="page_1280"/>I notice tihat the hon. member for Turffontein is entering this House and I wish he would take his seat. We suffered in those days. I repeat that I have nothing against the person who went to fight. But it must not be said today that they are the bearers of freedom in the world, It must not be said that their ideas are the best and that they will give security to every race in this country. No, Mr. Chairman, the past has shown me that one cannot trust certain persons. The people of South Africa will never trust them. But that war passed, and in 1948 the National Party came into power. The first thing we did was to pay that war debt. The National Party supporters have not once asked me why we paid that war debt. We paid it because we wanted to start our career without debt, ff there has ever been a challenge to any people in the world, a challenge calling for all the strength of a people, then it is the challenge which faces this people in respect of the future and which it has already tackled in the years since 1948. This is the policy of separate development, according to which each people in this country has the right to continued existence and to its own identity. Then I cannot and dare not and may not say, as the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said, that I shall sacrifice my identity. I dare not and may not do that, because then I would be committing treason against my people and against my forebears and descendants.</p>

<p>Yes, they are slowly coming in now. It is a pity that it is so late.</p>

<p>We also have a task to perform in the future. This task is unique in world history. It is the task of providing the Bantu with his homeland. I want to say to the member for Zululand that they have looked at everything through dark glasses. Theye have never been able to see the light which is shining on that subject. We shall tackle this task with faith, conviction and determination. We shall be determined with a view to the future, and it will succeed. However dark it may appear sometimes, it is, as sure as I am standing here this evening, the only salvation for hon. members on that side and for me. There is no other salvation. To me my political principles are a confession of faith. It is not good enough for me merely to be a Nationalist. To me it is a confession of faith. Together with my church and my religion, it is the No. 1 task in life to me.</p>

<p>I have already said that it is a task which rests not only on the Afrikaans-speaking members of this nation. It also rests on the shoulders of the English-speaking members of this nation. The English-speaking people of Natal as well as those of the other provinces will have to cooperate. Otherwise they will be destroyed with me, if this idea cannot be carried through. For this reason, I want to endorse what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration said: It does not matter what it costs. It will be carried out. These are tasks which await us in the future. They will be difficult tasks and will present problems to us, but by faith we shall overcome these.</p>

<p>Another task we have is to encourage immigration in this beautiful country of ours with its tremendous development and economic prosperity. This National Party is being attacked and it is being said that we rejected the immigration policy of Smuts. Sir, we merely changed it. The poor old man wanted to throw open the gates. If this had happened, we would have been ploughed under. That was his whole idea. What he could not succeed in doing in politics, he tried to do by means of immigration.</p>

<p>Yes, &#x201C;the good and the bad.&#x201D; We said that we would screen immigrants. It is understandable that there was in fact a slow influx of immigrants during the years from 1948 to 1960. We experienced problems. We had to create employment for those people. We had to obtain housing for them. After all, such people must have all the facilities which our own citizens have.</p>

<p>My friend, if I still had your years, I would have liked to drink from a bottle. From 1960 onwards we obtained immigrants from our countries of origin. They were the best, screened immigrants who fitted in with this people. We owe the Department of Immigration a debt of gratitude for the task which it is performing, and which sometimes attracts tremendous criticism. I want to say to the Minister of Immigration: Continue with that task. It is a good task.</p>

<p>There is another monument which has been built by this National Party. This monument is housing. I want to mention the housing for Whites specifically, but there is also the housing for Bantu. We had to clear up the chaos which existed in 1948, because those hon. members always said, &#x201C;Let things develop&#x201D;, and then hoped that the Lord would bless them. We had to clear up that chaos. We had to erect buildings and clear up Bantu townships. They allowed chaos to develop because there was &#x201C;a war on&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Keep quiet, my friend. You wore nappies in those years. Sir, we cleaned up those cities to the best of our ability. We are still continuing with that tremendous task. A huge task still lies ahead of us, namely to provide for the needs of every White, Bantu, Coloured and Indian. We shall look after every group to the best of our ability, as the money becomes available. However, the time has also arrived for those various races to start working for their own futures. The Creator probably placed them on this earth at the same time as me. I think the time has arrived for the various population groups which I mentioned a moment ago, to take off their jackets and set to work. They must realize that this country is also their fatherland and that they can help us in many respects.</p>

<p>I have now spoken about the history of the National Party; members in the backbenches were not present at the time. One grows to love the history of this National Party because it is one&#x2019;s own ideas which were born of a people. One cannot exchange it, even if one wants to. One cannot place one&#x2019;s identity on the altar and sell it for a mess of pottage, because it cannot be sold. It cannot be bought. From its earliest days, this National Party has erected monuments for this people and its descendants. We erected a monument such as I scor, which was opposed by those members. Let them deny this to-night. At this stage a third Iscor is already being planned. This National Party also established a Sasol to produce our own petroleum. I only wish that some of those United Party friends of mine will make more use of the Free State petrol. If they do that, they may perhaps catch fire sooner or later.</p>

<p>The greatest task which this Government has performed, was to bring about peace and prosperity in this country. There is peace and quiet among the low-paid workers of every race group. Can hon. members tell me if there are uprisings among the Bantu peoples&#x003F; Do hon. members know what an old Bantu said to me one day when we had to move him from Sophiatown He said to me: &#x201C;Sir, I cannot understand it. There my family and I slept under five corrugated-iron sheets. Here the State is giving me a beautiful house. Now these people come to me and say that I should strike. I do not understand it. Tell me what I should tell my Indunas&#x201D;. Sir, his name was Mjikalane. That Bantu is now living in peace. This is also the case with each of them. This is the peace and quiet which this National Party has brought about.</p>

<p>Sir, that hon. member must keep quiet about a United Party city council. He is not even a decent United Party member yet. He must still grow up, and when grows up, I hope he will become converted. This Government has also brought about peace and quiet among the Indian people and among the Coloured people. We know that there is agitation, but these people support the policy of the National Party. They know that it offers the only future plan and salvation for them. There is no other way, because we want them to develop in their own identity. They must build themselves up so that they themselves may govern their own people one day. The National Party has done this.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say this evening that Afrikaans-speaking persons who followed the road of a Botha or a Smuts, followed an easy road in the beginning. It stretched ahead like a beautiful tarred road, but that road ended in a desert. In contrast to that, the road of J. B. M. Hertzog was narrow. It meandered through the history of this people, but it kept right on course like a golden thread. It meandered across rivers, through valleys and over mountains. Since the referendum in 1961, that road has become a beautiful, large tarred road on which to drive. This is the road of the National Party; follow it.</p>
